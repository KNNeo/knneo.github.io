Just a bunch of static pages to display objects in various forms:<br/><br/>

Would You Rather - Simple input output tests<br/>
Profile List - Profile boxes based on json input, with timeline and calendar<br/>
Music Library - Table filtering using p5.js with csv file input<br/>
Image Gallery - Versatile image gallery with viewer and slideshow<br/>
Anime List - Timeline manipulation and selection via first column, content grouping<br/><br/>

Whole site is covered with dark mode wherever possible (see darkmode.css), supports Firefox and Chrome-based browsers<br/><br/>

P.S. Blog is also customised for responsive from old Blogger theme, code arrangement messy so only for reference
