#### [knneo.github.io](https://knneo.github.io/) is just a place for me to play around with vanilla HTML and Javascript!

All done by yours truly unless otherwise stated. Built to support Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.

Whole site uses a universal theme file theme.js (unless where self-implemented eg. Music Database) to switch between light/dark themes, with system default on initial visit.

All versions are kept for archiving purposes, but only latest versions will show up on home page.
