I think I did the most of anything just today morning to be honest, working on the GitHub site. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Oh yeah, there's the happy Tuesday earlier which I did two posts in one day that was crazy, and then my body went crazy afterwards so... <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Man, life hits me so hard right now I may have to set up an exercise regime to fix myself so I can continue doing all of this.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=üòê>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>INB4 I still do nothing to improve my physical wellness haha what I WILL do though tomorrow, me, is to sign up again for <a href=https://www.inorimachi.com/ target=_blank>Minase Inori's fanclub</a>. Yes, <em>again</em>. First problem I foresee is that, my membership number won't work no more which kinda sucks to be honest but let's see what's the new number tomorrow, yes?</div><div><br></div><div>You may ask, why tomorrow and not today? Because tomorrow's the day where I joined her fanclub exactly 3 years ago- Happy Halloween everybody. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span><br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=UzakiChanS205><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! Double</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"What did you do, Sakurai-kun?" Man what DIDN'T he do lol</div></blockquote>Boy, did I have to look back to recall what happened but yeah, the mom. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> In this unlikely romance plot where the mother can come into play lol (#UzakiChanS205), we need the people from the caf√© to do analysis on last episode? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> But the guys are right though, at this time period where Hana-chan is still confused at her relationship with her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a>... SOMEONE GIVE ME ANOTHER BOWL OF RICE lol okay me. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> So, remember what happened previously because I hope you did? But yeah the mother dropped by the caf√© for two good reasons: To check if the daughter has so far caused any problems with her mood swings... towards Sakurai which surprisingly only towards him, but also, to get some consultation from the Asai family. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, they seem to be the only ones clear about the whole situation and how dumb all these people are anyways lol I REALLY wish I had someone like this around me who can't get their love for me so I can tell her back but DAMN, these guys are dumb. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Hana-chan eventually found out that the "boyfriend" calling the mom by her first name is bad, so let's just slap the first names on everyone. Yes, Akihito-kun included haha that's the caf√© owner by the way. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Damn, does saying "Hana-chan" repeatedly remind me of that one Anime "Asobi Asobase" haha you gotta say it like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/171001/Hanako_039_s_Grandfather target=_blank>the pervert of a granddad</a> <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Then, we have the gym trial session. I am NOT going to advocate going to the gym because what Sakurai imagined (Uzaki) Hana-chan will react is right because spending money to exercise is ridiculous either get up your own a** to do it or don't ever, but hey, Sakurai is so ripped only the guy who spotted him on the bench press can tell me why he's okay with doing more reps without getting tired. <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> And yes, the narrator's retort on that being the head of the Uzaki family really didn't get me until I took a rewind. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Problem is though, as he heads home after work (at the gym) and listens to the daughter and wife talk about this awesome senpai at college and THEN realizes it's a male, really starts stirring sh*t up by calling in a family meeting and announcing to the world without using a loudspeaker because he is one himself. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Well, dad, good news for you, if this IS the son-in-law you is starting off with a good one. <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> But seriously though, what is wrong with the guys in this house haha. All in all... the family confusion is half this season from now huh. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Oh, also, Sakurai getting RIPPED <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Really not into the latter though maybe Ami-chan would but he might want to tune it down for me but otherwise!! <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Between exercising and eating MORE rice watching the action unfold... this is turning out to be the healthiest or even most organic episode of Anime this season to be honest haha. But hey, what's stopping us from making this even more irritating than ever? It's the slogan for the series too. Really, all stemming from Uzaki Hana herself too, by the way. But yeah, what's wrong with stayover friends of the opposite gender? It's 2022 dude, we gotta be more open about that, <em>dad</em>. Hehe we shall see more next week I guess this might not be a thing Sakaki can solve now</div><div>[TL:DR; "(Sakurai) He's so pitiful, I'm doing him a favour by paying some attention to him!" This is literally it, we get better summaries with every episode haha]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2yGBgq7j5lCWr4Co7fRNrNzCDpG9Cf-MS6oFPLUJnkPDgKLKwwVGNme4cNBlrRDDM2UoP8IWlvcwv0F-m1QPVD6cPIrl7F-qOYcrMzuCffVzI8PUyddYF2i0cS0G5WUUHdiHwaS2F7a5wxg0VJhOyE4OOdVO_-QV0KQjCIWRL_9JppRrQ1R9qOwf0/s320/uzakichanS205_akihito.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>About to be me acting cute when I turn 30 lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTQKTLxyS6I9Ml5wP7hUBDcTulLrHxu7pMm78Pc-frAa3OWpoaFuwHCTeks8SxhguhXPLydFH8ELCW_1SCCtdoGA1Gi_z8z1pyWiHjIIgOM6B5apGOasOCDoLhsfhSk9NEkPjaL1Am2FGLn6Wkf7x8Pdy4MUwahHS4DRDD7N6YFxo8XhyxC0QnP-TJ/s320/uzakichanS205_fujio2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I still don't have worthy Halloween costume selfies to put as my phone wallpaper haha<br>*panik*</table></div></div><div>P.S. "Somewhere along the way I've lost all my credibility at work" Yeah that's me where I crashed a cloud service for about an evening haha I still wonder how I haven't been fired</div><div>P.P.S. "That's right, it's not your (Tsuki's) fault" OH IT'S MOST DEFINITELY YOUR FAULT MOM lol<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KoukyuuNoKarasu05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Koukyuu no Karasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Did the ghosts appear in your dream again?" Boy, may I never dream about the deceased lol I have enough anxieties</div></blockquote>Man, we are already at the point we wait for the emperor to arrive at the Consort's abode? Damn. What will happen in the final episode? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> As we sit patiently for the emperor to tell us of his troubles in this new episode (#KoukyuuNoKarasu05), we have flipped the opening?? Damn, how did everything got me good? Hmm... looks like I need to tell my troubles to the Raven Consort too. <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> Speaking of such, we have the emperor's aide (which I will refer to from now on because I hate Japanese-translated Chinese names lol I'm not racist I am Chinese myself) to talk about. If you would recall the emperor having sleepless nights due to uh... his past haunting him haha man like it's not only him who could see too so that's just creepy, would not reveal this problem to Jusetsu I guess who specializes in dealing with the passing, instead instructed the aide to continue on the search for what might be the rebellion sorcerer in place and might be found roaming in the city recently too. Ironically though, we have also learnt about the aide's problems and past after being out there, with him passing by the red light district and recalling her mom's journey of being disowned by the husband after having the kid wtf, and then killing herself leaving the kid alone and having to make a choice between getting laid by dudes or getting laid by dudes as a eunuch. *ahem* Like really, *ahem* what's the difference? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> (Yep, still referring to *ahem* as "period drama, by the way") He almost puked at the sight of anxiety of having to continue his search for the sorcerer which really reminds of myself in this aspect- Okay besides the eunuch part, my dong's still on me so <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Besides that though, his loyalty is still to the emperor who saved him from the crutches of the alpha gays in the palace lmao *ahem*, and instead of watching his master suffer in silence over the ghosts every night appearing at his abode, he decided to go against all odds and tell on him to the Raven Consort whom he still doesn't trust somehow considering he also knew this girl has grey hair? Man, dear emperor, you need to keep your mouth shut. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> But yeah, frienemies, I guess. <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> Uh oh we have an EARLY ENDING THOUGH??? Cringe indeed, because what's up is just a little more spoiler to what we have been spoiling for episodes already at this point, because as Jusetsu is granted access to the treasury in search of more history that the dynasties have buried, she saw a map. A map we have seen in the opening many times but have no idea what it was. Maybe, just maybe, we might be at the start of talking about the backstory of the Raven Consort which the emperor doesn't know but heck I think Jusetsu herself might not know much of too. Damn, this is really getting spicy I want to know what's this small dose of poison that is threatening this new empire. Really, never been this excited for *ahem* by the way I got bored of period dramas when I was in primary (elementary) school so <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> great time to be watching this once in a while though, somewhat refreshing since there is magic in this too. Yeah, "Heike Monogatari", you might be dropped at some point this year lmao I am so not sorry for this</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_2DTSQdSLLiGckOD2ty6M8tHBdtGkS1Dw9f1mvIlIBqguD9wgmoi6I5-Rj_hf5BBjQMZp80-fOa0Etq3t88Ogtqm6d6m27Kx6a1agmslLXwe6qyy0nB-yY8C5Mg0zBFc8ceVo-62ijV8Jm3P7GOBV4h-fwPi33RdxToErFKix-H3X7Jypr41c87vS/s320/koukyuunokarasu05_xinging.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MVP golden chicken as always haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAPne41D1G3miEcaFcqEVfvCdGZm3twa5cqBDboKlaH1oMatl4t2o2-6jSmnuwgWLC2QbPc4CEUpRNNkBFJtmgPfcmmg2oqKGzzsIG-5AHfPu3YnNiVpu7it329hoA6z5AWmZ7suQSfOVasiPIigvz7JXJOapTMft_IeFbMV4hy4D9fzU_LhbWEiRE/s320/koukyuunokarasu05_puke.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Literally me half this weekend lol I need to see the doctor</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1184 data-original-width=1280 height=296 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSfBfA7VlIR6yL68QiBcACUdIGtDl1eukRqMp_eoHCGCiBJplctfNNABT1a_nuhgfnca9mXA5ys5GK62FV3odyfHYYLJiSr3b1zOHiAB4VBtiOO33NEUmcvXqdfXk5Zs_-ogXXoYCSoY54w9zEgFJobH5EsUdmeMDGhfx6iYHuI0KODN72cWaBCVSf/s320/koukyuunokarasu05_jusetsu5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>And yes sadist Raven Consort haha stare down at me please<br>(lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

But maybe I should conclude this by tomorrow since the end of the month is coming, don't get Halloween deceive you. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/mysterious-ep/1647144906?l=en" target=_blank>Jououbachi's new single</a></b> isn't too bad to be honest, I'm not too keen on their B-sides since they really sound old and have like some rapping portions which I'm not exactly interested in but the topic song is good so I'll take that. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B9-ep/1647153285?l=en" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE's new EP</a></b> for their major debut is the winner this week don't you worry, for as much as their melodies aren't perfect I've always mentioned if there's anything that represents standard Rock music in our day and age they have nailed it. The topic song is easily identifiable haha it's not hard, and the rest of the release I'm giving it slowly but surely. I am skipping <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/anthology-destiny/1640060091?l=en" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new album</a></b> after listening to it though because apart from Sumipe's singing not being my thing and the songs I've given her so far are unique in theme mostly as Anime theme songs, but also, the songs from her music label King Records tend to be old in style. And that's why I think it fell apart already, really. Next time, Sumipe. Or maybe not, I really don't want to give it anymore haha</div><div><br>There isn't a lot in the news department from Twitter maybe because it got bought out by a billionaire lmao, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1584923580902518784?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's recent live is now on music streaming services</a></b> the time it was posted I didn't see it though haha but as of this post it is, also¬†<b><a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1586009906636652544?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>SID's live audio library will be on major streaming services</a></b> released in parts and the first batch is already making me miss 2010 haha <span class=emoji title=üò¢>*sob*</span>,¬†<b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1584499957834432513?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's new song will be released next week</a></b> so I guess I'll listen to that before commenting and this is by the way for her concept album next year, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lounge666/status/1585164324787585025?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE's new music video</a></b> is for their major debut EP released this week and it's dope as usual, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1585194572665466881?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>GLIM SPANKY's new song</a></b> for drama will also be releasing next week I hope it's better than the whole of their recent album lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/CrosSing_info/status/1585224734379151360?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>Taketatsu Ayana singing ClariS' debut song</a></b> is such a mood I am only filled with nostalgia, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/engage_kiss/status/1585209635790897154?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>Anime "Engage Kiss" character song for Sharon</a></b> is not too bad but I must say character songs aren't really getting to me so I'll give chance once it's out in a month, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/PHONOTONES/status/1585664011164536832?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>PHONO TONES' new song</a></b> released this weekend and it's happy enough for me to worry about my troubles lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yucat1031/status/1585945742287327232?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>yucat's recent live digest</a></b>¬†is up to listen and man looks like we are closer than ever to the new album which I will not be able to listen on streaming haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1585964966229987329?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>RYTHEM's new old music video</a></b> is something simple yet nice I wish I can go back to a decade ago, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonJPmusic/status/1585119150061785088?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's now only producer Mizuno Yoshiki is releasing a full solo album</a></b> next year so yeah he will be singing which I won't be so keen to be honest not even with my decade's training of listening to male vocals, but I will listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/honkidance/status/1586326998380646400?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance's recent live premiere</a></b> on YouTube which is still going on as I speak so ask me whether I like them Honki Dance's live or not- Yes. <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span></div><div><br>Next week though, we will be starting super slow next month, we only have <b>KANA-BOON's new single</b> for the Anime Naruto series so I'm not going to look forward to that much haha also these guys aren't exactly my thing even though they have earned the title of Collection Artist in Klassic Note already, still crossing fingers on their impression on me every time I have to give them something. <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> We shall see I guess.<br><br><br><br><br>Man, I'm feeling so unwell I think I might have the virus. <span class=emoji title=üòê>*silence*</span> Will report later after this post (haha yes) to see if I truly got the thing, or else this itself might also be serious.
