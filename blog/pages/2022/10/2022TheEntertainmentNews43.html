  Hey everyone. As you can see I really tried to enjoy the Saturday before ie.
  yesterday before I come in to do up this weekly post because goddamn, I'm
  going to have so much time in my hands. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For better or for worse, but
  I have things planned, so let's hope next week's post intro is not me b*tching
  about what I've NOT done haha I know I'll at least be doing up another post
  next week so stay tuned for that.
</div>

  Holy shit is the opening animation the best thing I've seen of this series in
  years. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, at least that means they are improving- They even have
  the overlay text title cards!!! Haha apart from my hype about the new episode
  (#BLEACHTYBW02), let's talk about what happened. Oh yeah, we gotta do the
  Sasakibe funeral first. Oops. Well, it was solemn, it was a warning from the
  enemy or just a coincidence but I hardly doubt so considering they know Soul
  Society well and have shadow teleportation powers which is a Quincy thing?
  Haha ah hey what can I say. But yeah, just a summary from Akon twice but thank
  goodness we only have to hear it once, they are deadly in approach, they
  destroy Hollows so basically Quincy in nature besides the Arrancars they took
  captive including Harribel which is de facto leader after Aizen's capture, and
  (I'm just used to this name so) Kirge Opie is in charge of operations in the
  Hollow world as of now, and taking the best of the weak to the leader if
  necessary. Or if they don't retaliate haha when you have power you tend to do
  those things lol. Anyways, which made the Nel trio leave the place to find
  Ichigo and the others and boy does Nel's super speed hit the joke every time,
  and the others apart from Ishida(?) decide to go and save their home world led
  by I will always be his in-lore discipline, Urahara-sensei haha I was already
  hyped when I saw him. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Besides the occasional Inoue
  fanservice-&nbsp;I'll just take Inoue as fanservice for now. Heck, she might
  be the ONLY fanservice to be honest since none is really as cute and... and as
  stacked as she is. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> That, and some blood here and there lol I forgot
  Hollows do take more human form the more power they have even with a mask ie.
  Arrancars, did not stop the other Fraccions aka Espada underlings from
  retaliating against the Wanderich army, but to no avail. I mean, we be dealing
  with God so I would hope the army under him is powerful, and I guess they are.
  For my summary though, let's talk about what will happen soon but don't tell
  Yhwach because he will kill us for it he only cares about the present whether
  it's as his foretelling lol. Ichigo saw Kirge for the first time so next
  week's going to be that which will be great because this will take many
  episodes if I recall, and is also the best time to invade Soul Society because
  Ichigo won't have hands to fly to that other world to help the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a> as
  a main character of this series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, Ishida isn't in this
  equation... yet because he will be once he is isolated (why the dad didn't
  appear though?) and then confronted by the enemy to join them because he is
  technically one of them... and THEN we shall see what happens going on this
  might be too far into the future haha. All in all... thank goodness I'm only
  more impressed every moment of each episode despite the weaker characters that
  are appearing (and dying) and not like I've forgotten about them we need to
  hit our female quota before feminist groups appear lmao see you guys on
  WordPress, but yeah so far so really damn good apart from some animation
  issues I see but that's just me watching Anime for like a decade and a half so
  don't mind me. The theme songs are meh but show off a lot about the series in
  general with the opening just being dope and ending with all the swords if you
  see me defining all of them from left to right later you know I'm a fan or
  have too much time haha, but overall it is still impressive. Let's keep this
  going, guys, remember what I want out of this final arc, all the action in
  <span class="emoji" title="😚">*chef's kiss*</span> territory so I can keep this in memory forever lol maybe I'll
  watch this early next week hehe
</div>
<div>
  [Finally some proper GIFs I can make for this glorious, glorious series for
  Nel haha thinking back now I can't believe the one and only Kaneda Tomoko
  singlehandedly did adult her too- Excuse me while I go back and watch it again
  hehe]

  It took me a while to consider whether I should continue this over the past
  week and especially with the two-cour/season weight on it I've decided to give
  this a miss. I get the general idea of the story already and I'm not that keen
  on the progression considering it's aliens and that's kinda
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a> lmao so
  I'm dropping this. Sorry

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "There's no way they'll get to the finish line" IT IS LIKE AS IF THEY KNOW
      haha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  I see Uzaki is still dreaming about her compatiblity with her senpai like he
  doesn't even care haha ah hey in this new episode where the dream goes on
  though (#UzakiChanS204), everyone had to bask in Uzaki's joy, whether you like
  it or not I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So welp, let's keep the ball rolling I guess, as
  much as this hurts lol can't you see Ami-chan is already quivering like she
  used to? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, remember how Uzaki thinks the prophet (lol) is so true
  in their telling of the couple's compatibility? Yeah, that's the problem.
  Somehow Uzkai has hypnotized herself to think that Sakurai likes her and thus
  is just waiting for the confession I assume (deja vu Anime "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen"
    target="_blank"
    >Kaguya-sama</a
  >"?), so yeah, that is kinda boring for the script so far so (haha) we gotta
  move things along. Cue the rest of the Café staff maybe not including the
  father he's just there to add to the count, as leader of the group Sakaki
  keeps pounding on Uzaki... for information haha relax, about Sakurai and why,
  of all times, she must act more hastily than ever. You know, just citing
  unknown sources like we always do on our term papers to pad the report lol,
  Sakaki shows off how much Sakurai is actually on demand despite his introvert
  personality, will already crush woman if he just takes off his shirt to
  Ami-chan, for example. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Basically, we gotta slap the j-j-j-jealousy on
  her real quick haha nice one Sakaki and Ami's dad. Whether that's getting into
  Uzaki or not, we have many more segregated job shifts to brainwash her in. To
  add on though, the cooking lessons on Uzaki's place with the mother, I mean,
  Tsuki-san haha, is going REAL well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because seriously, calling her
  "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/okusan" target="_blank">madam</a>" would've
  sufficed we always go more formal if we don't know how to call someone it's
  still better than "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/okaasan" target="_blank"
    >mother</a
  >" lmao I mean you're halfway there already, would also be better off not
  reminding the mother that she has potential to be the next romance drama
  villain by stealing her daughter's lover(?) from her? Man, this is getting
  confusing for such an irritating title. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, I think just the
  mother doing the mother thing by giving her daughter advice might have turned
  things around, so let's just say this episode doesn't exist. Okay maybe the
  Ami-chan part is good haha. All in all, we salute to all who have contributed
  to the (little) progress of the relationship between Uzaki Hana and Sakurai...
  I don't remember his given name lol this is just making me bleed internally I
  can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Heck, I even know Uzaki's mom's given name but I wouldn't
  even call her that so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See, the idea about comedy series is that we
  just keep setting up mines knowing that they will explode at some point
  because someone is dumb enough to step on it ie. the guy who set up the mine
  so thanks author, much thought has been done to make sure this is as funny as
  it's dumb to watch. Oops, ran out of rice again how am I going to have lunch
  now haha Uzaki-chan though ever thought of not sh*tting on your senpai? Just
  saying <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

  We got through Episode 3, right? CHILLAX TIME!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, we not saving
  humans now, so what the heck. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we take care
  of the things <em>inside</em> the palace haha I mean we have been so far just
  now for the Raven Consort herself now (#KoukyuuNoKarasu04), you ever seen the
  weirdest interactions between a Consort and her ladies in waiting? Hey me too
  but *ahem* it's period drama so I don't ask too much just like how they won't
  too. What we will ask more on though, is that ghost of a bird that keeps
  appearing in the court somehow. Rumours only talk about the Princess involved
  with this bird who passed away but clearly the bird has some remnants unable
  to settle and so it hasn't left the real world, so I guess we helping birds
  now. It's a problem Jusetsu also knows as she is rather troubled for offending
  her underlings haha I know right *ahem*, and so the Emperor besides helping
  her carve a wooden bird also offered her some advice, about the stuff around
  her she shouldn't just give away. I mean, she did give off the food but food
  makes people happy. Women, after all. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> *ahem* Also,&nbsp;serious talk,
  Jusetsu? He doesn't want to kill you the next time he has to, so keep that
  thing around. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let that sink in for you guys for a bit let's move on
  haha if you don't get this go *ahem* on the death penalty exception, let's
  talk about the actual story in place. Jusetsu finally spotted the lady in
  waiting to that very Princess, talking about how THAT GODDAMN DOWAGER did not
  provision medicine for her even though she was ill THAT B*TCH lol me chill,
  and interestingly, thought of growing medicinal herbs in her garden to
  hopefully turn things around. I mean, it's not impossible it kinda works even
  without the lady in waiting helping her out haha oops, but yeah, it was when
  they didn't after an argument that got her into trouble. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Feeling some
  deja vu, Jusetsu? Your problem with Jiu-Jiu is the same damn thing- And it all
  comes around, as the medicinal herb that got the Princess into a drowning
  incident was in an effort to help the lady with her coughing issues when
  season change because man, maybe I should grow some of those myself too haha I
  feel a cough coming already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, blah blah Emperor's greatest
  friend died because Dowager again, so try to make friends with your ladies in
  waiting lest they get killed and you have to try puddles then. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Did
  we mention about the Raven Consort not making contact with people unless
  necessary? *ahem* All in all... hey, which *ahem* you watched taught you about
  leaders having to be more matured or understanding to their underlings more
  than ever? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Even modern society is a joke compared to this Anime.
  Apart from the Dowager. That woman is the devil. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also, secrets are
  meant to be within walls, not people. No really, think about it. Heck, this
  series taught me so many things in just a month, I hope it does for you all
  who don't watch conventional period drama on a daily basis. I know I don't
  haha so this can fill in the gap I guess. And goddamn is the last sentence of
  this episode a little scary, but I hope that for all our sakes, Jusetstu will
  be able to discern from her position as a Consort and the people around her
  soon enough. Hey, we can't kill people no more after the Dowager, ain't it?
  Haha don't second guess me I'm just here for the tears lol and ONLY the tears
  just because- Yes, what the Emperor saw by his bed was an illusion, thanks for
  asking

  <br />
  Okay, I thought I gotta mention about next week since I guess the package will
  also make me write a blog post but, for once we will have an Anime Extra next
  week! I'll probably watch "BLEACH" early because guess what I watched the old
  episodes (the real old ones) for an afternoon which then followed by the manga
  gave me a headache so I'm getting hyped for that so hope the subs can catch
  up, and a certain Anime movie which I didn't expect was streaming exclusively
  on Disney+ when I saw excerpts on YouTube from the official production studio.
  So yeah, those if all goes well. Cya guys next week then, and until next
  time... maybe I should find a video game to play I do have a theme park
  building game "Indoorlands" on my wishlist released but I didn't want to play
  it so... maybe I should then. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Or maybe I should play "Populous"
  again and see if I can clear more than 2 levels. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe Worms haha I
  remember I created all the "BLEACH" characters and then put them in AI mode to
  fight against each other lmao ok ok decided haha bye<br />
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Maybe I should for every coming episode of Anime "BLEACH" talk about my
  fanfic where I exist as the 12th Squad Captain shortly after Urahara left a
  century ago. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let me think about it first haha
