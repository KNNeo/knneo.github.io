I'm seriously still considering whether to watch Anime on a weekday because I
love my weekdays and I've not been stopping (besides one day haha it's a
burnout) to play that Potion Permit game so... not like I'm going to get spoiled
by the plot, right?? I mean, I may not remember that much but I know what
happens in my favourite action series of all time. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> The new "BLEACH"
trailers are GREAT though haha really then makes you realize and be shocked at
how Ichigo's Bankai is not enormous, and the only ones I can think of similar to
his are so far (spoiler alert) Rukia, maybe Kyoraku and old geezer Yamamoto even
though when they use their powers it's big so yeah, Ichigo.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay intro's long enough let's start haha I really might just extend the one
  item by paying storage time so I can compile all the other stuff that should
  appear by the end of the month. Well, so far it's not great so I'm getting
  worried haha hey me do you still want to buy more MusicRay'n badges to pad the
  order?? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes lmao <span class="emoji" title="*dabs*">😎</span> MOCHO~!!<br />

  Oh yeah true Sakaki why would you even show Ami-chan? *eats a bowl of rice*
  Haha in this new episode dude (#UzakiChanS202) like, tell me Ami-chan is not
  THE BEST CHARACTER you find in Anime. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Then again if it's not voiced
  by
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu" target="_blank"
    >Ayachi</a
  >
  I wouldn't even care. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So, about her I guess. Remember last week when
  everyone got to see... whatever was on the bench in school with two people
  sleeping? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, this is hard to explain even to the mother who just
  brain froze after hearing what her daughter has to say, but you know, it's not
  really about that, Uzaki did wake up first to realize the senpai is hugging
  her like a pillow (#RelationshipGoals amirite?) (And that's why you find girls
  a head shorter than you-) and just had to live with the nightmare of the
  classmates and Sakaki taking photos and even videos of this spectacular
  phenomenon. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> And yes Ami-chan we intentionally didn't call you over or
  else how else we gonna let Sakurai sleep longer so we can get a professional
  cameraman to film this? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Not like it'll stop these guys from hanging
  out again though since Ami-chan felt left out on the action lol she is
  practically done with college since it's at her end and Sakaki is practically
  done with college because he planned out his work and didn't have to deal with
  homework like Uzaki does lol not me by the way but I did choose easy classes
  haha, we playing some... well, soccer.
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/futsal" target="_blank">Indoor soccer</a>, I
  guess. Sakaki was there to trash a bunch of bullies who are also single and
  can't mingle so I feel like I'm already personally attacked haha I'm quitting
  this now, Sakurai is there so look like he's part of the team as Sakaki
  carries all the goals but I guess he did score one too but it's as if you
  killed all the drivers in a race lmao, Uzaki is there is sh*t on her senpai as
  usual no surprises there but that doesn't stop Sakurai from his massacre, and
  Ami-chan just saw some good muscles. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Never change, Ami-chan, never
  change. And I guess we are making a lot of
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/udon" target="_blank">udon noodles</a> just
  because. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> I don't know, Sakurai likes udon? Even if Uzaki doesn't, I
  guess he is picking up pace by hanging out with Uzaki more playing sports even
  swimming, and learning other stuff like cooking so he can be a great
  househusband- All in all haha, man the jokes are still great, just slip in
  Ami-chan every week and it'll be *chef's kiss* and boy did they even get a
  narrator to have more monologue compared to the other two siblings of the
  Uzaki family. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> I mean, what else do you need? Maybe their budget went
  up, I don't know. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Still looking forward to more laughs after this
  though, but really makes me wonder what the conclusion for this season will
  be. Just them in a love hotel? That sounds like a great idea they already
  hugged to sleep we just need the right place haha

  Wow that is very Photoshop-level hair dyeing haha or is that how it works
  centuries ago? I don't know, time travel there and report to me. In this new
  episode of a period drama Anime series (#KoukkyuNoKarasu02), where RIP
  Jusetsu's mom I guess she didn't get to put the black stuff on her hair.
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> I think I'm going to get cancelled haha see you guys on WordPress.
  <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Also, you thought you would be fine watching this and not "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/49738/Heike_Monogatari"
    target="_blank"
    >Heike Monogatari</a
  >" so you won't see severed heads? *taps brain* Anyways, so much more and
  *ahem* I'm still using this as the "period drama, by the way" slogan I don't
  want to keep mentioning but man did I already want to use this twice for the
  text above, we conclude the first arc of a mystery about a dead Consort who
  sacrificed in the face of humiliation. Ironically, the same as the fate of the
  Emperor's mother actually, but I guess we now know the whole story, so we can
  relate? Hey, the guy already saw Jusetsu in the lake with her silver hair,
  what else is more bare naked than that? <span class="emoji" title="*dabs*">😎</span> But yeah, maybe that, maybe
  more than that as Jiu-jiu appears at the Consort's place, but as the
  investigations go on for Jusetsu and the mystery of that earring, looks like
  we have more problems up the alley. From ex-Dowager servants being abandoned
  at the old wash house... do they even have meals or are they left to die?
  *ahem* Anyways haha, this, to when they had to talk to the deceased Consort's
  lady-in-waiting who lost her tongue because what best way to keep a person
  silent by- *ahem* So yeah true ruthlessness to cut the line, but that doesn't
  stop anyone from finding out the truth, since the lady did know how to write
  and faked it until someone who can save her comes her way, then told us the
  real story about the hanging of the Consort. So turns out, all intentional,
  the Dowager was to blame, and everyone related to the one who was framed of
  poisoning another Consort was effectively silenced to not cause repercussions.
  Well, thanks to this lady and the eunuch we found out later who was
  technically her childhood sweetheart who gave him her earring also that
  servant Jiu-Jiu had contact with who visited a eunuch often with messages (I
  know right? A maiden visiting a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kangan" target="_blank">eunuch</a> more
  often than ever? Did we check if that guy was castrated? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> *ahem*
  Please, that's not a bug that's a feature lmao), we can gather enough evidence
  to make sure the Dowager's efforts to keep everyone mum will go down the
  drain. And her head too, in case you wonder if they would show those things
  again haha not really. But yeah, all's done in done, I guess. Also, don't ask
  why the other earring went into the Emperor's possession lol hey that
  childhood sweetheart? <i>This</i> is how much they don't care about you.
  <span class="emoji" title="*dabs*">😎</span> All in all, I mean, the lake scene and the bed scene are the best parts
  of this episode, right?? Haha now I sound like an Emperor. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Not bad so
  far, not bad- the storytelling did get me with emotional scenes especially
  meeting up with the ghost stuff,

    target="_blank"
    >the ending theme song</a
  >
  sounds like it's ready to top my music rankings this year haha, and Jusetsu
  looks better with black hair, I'll say it right here and now. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I'll
  not be racist for this series, I promise.

  is once again hitting me with so many feels, I hesitate to give by the way,
  more than half the album of songs and yes I did in the end in case you
  wondered, because from familiar composers to even more familiar melodies, I
  feel like the choruses already got me long before everything else did, even
  the topic song. So yeah, that's how much I like her now. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> In my
  defence though? The songs are honestly not fitting of Ueshama here, for
  example the topic song where she has to sing a high pitch with her soft voice?
  Man, are they really doing the try hard thing here. Apart from this though, on
  Koko-chan's recommendations between a Jazz music playlist she mentioned in a
  Q&amp;A Instagram story in response to her sharing "<a

    >are already out</a

  by the time you see this. Yes, going down the path of Kayano Ai and recently
  Takahashi Minami, but this one has her own YouTube and Discord channel so
  guess who's putting in more effort in social media promotion. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
</div>
<div>
  <br />So for next week we have our peak period it looks like right here, with
  <b>Kouno Marika's 3rd single</b> which I did not care much after being
  disappointed with the music video so let's see if this holds up, or else I'll
  be relieved to give <b>Kitou Akari's 2nd album</b> and a long awaited
  <b>new nano.RIPE album</b>. I have a feeling I'll be listening to the latter a
  lot by the end of the week so come back and see if I got myself correct.
