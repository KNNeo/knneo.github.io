Hello, me who is the only one on work leave because I chose to and everyone else
is just at school or at work after a public holiday. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> But yeah, as
promised this is a new Extra post in a while, maybe I should come up with a new
title format but heck, that's for next year and beyond maybe. Right now, let's
get into more "BLEACH" hype to start the week and maybe watch an Anime movie
while I'm at it. Let's!<br />
<br />

  </div>
</blockquote>
Aw, old geezer's pissed now. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> In the new episode where let's go
straight into combat with Quincies because goddamn I've waited years for even
just one (#BLEACHTYBW03), but then again goddamn they need to come up with
easier terms to remember. "Bankai" was so much easier to say. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, let's
talk about what is the lead up to the start of the war. Firstly, I guess even I
need a recap here. As Kirge has mentioned to Ichigo, Quincies have a rough past
with shinigami and ignoring who started it first because I mean every Anime has
to start with something even if it's bad before a rebellion sprouts off it in
defence of something terrible, is that a shinigami rebellion chose to split off
the original Quincy soul body to protect the souls and create cycle (and
imprison the King *ahem*) instead of believing in the creation and destruction
of souls, so here we are. Sadly, Ishida (Uryu) won't be able to know the truth
even if coming from the father Souken mainly because he also knew what his
father did ie. same as the granddad who went separate ways with the rest of the
Quincy gang and then wrote his own history of them being the last of their kind.
Not wrong, but we forgot the origin, and of course, the myth of waking the...
successor? Of the soul universe 99 years later. So, that. Next up, let's talk
about the fight. Damn, was that a long time coming. Kirge talking about all the
Quincy powers and THEN showing them to us while actually getting beat up by Ayon
(lol) and Ichigo maybe is rather cool and scary to be honest, seeing Uryu's
powers literally taken to the extreme where everything around spiritual can be
absorbed meaning that if this is Soul Society all the unseated officers would be
free offerings at this point haha, still COULD NOT comprehend the extent of
these guys... let's just call the
<strike>Vollag</strike> <strike>Vollas</strike> that thing their Ultimate power
for now because damn I need the Wiki lol. So yeah, real cool, and it really
feels awkward how Ichigo can just be there watching all the shit happen to the
Arrancar and his friends while being at a corner to what, set up his Bankai?
<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah hey, timing guys, maybe Kubo-sensei also didn't know how to gauge
this. Well, at least he got the storytelling right, so finally let's talk about
that. We now know that Yamamoto did not kill Yhwach a century ago so likely in
the War they had to do 200 years ago ignoring then Mayuri's appeal to do so, and
now literally had to suffer the consequences of his actions, for starters. Who
is in the wrong though? I mean, old geezer has made a lot of mistakes in his
lifetime so far, so I'm not gonna elaborate until the times comes so let's just
take it at face value for now. Remember he exterminated Quincies without
blinking an eye with the OG Gotei 13? Yeah haha. Apart from that though, Yhwach
was LITERALLY watching Ichigo engaging with Kirge in order to make sure he's
busy so that they can launch an attack on Soul Society because you know, gotta
keep main guy busy so we can screw over everyone else. Yes, Kira included lol
RIP dude I hope he's alright. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All in all, dammit my finger is
constantly on the screenshot key so tell me if this is not the next best thing
that has happened for me in Anime so far. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Other than that, we finally
get to see in animation what it means to Quincy release their powers, and pretty
much every aspect of it is such a magnificent view even if it's from one of the
most irritating Sternritter in the story lmao f**k you Kirge Opie haha we'll
talk about why soon, and it's still waaaaay cooler than Ishida Uryu. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So
yeah, gonna love me some combat in the next couple of episodes when I watch this
again... next weekend haha weekly broadcasts hurt they should've gotten Netflix
adapted so I can pay for the subscription to watch all at once lol see you all
then the Tres Bien are DEFINITELY dead now haha who cares I just want to see
some REAL action lol okay me<br />

    Man, this storytelling is still rather roundabout and bullsh*t it's
    ironically good. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, about what this new 4.5-block tatami room is
    about (#YojouhanTimeMachineBlues), the remote control to the air conditioner
    broke. Welp. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Please, for what was the sequel of the original series
    back in 2012 based on a novel adaptation, this pace is VERY SLOW compared to
    that series. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Still, this is essentially a sequel inspired by a play
    named "Summer Time Machine Blues" but to put it to layman terms so I don't
    have to type a paragraph to tell you what it is, it's just time travel in
    this... college life maybe love story? Yeah, that's what it is. Anyways,
    it's well known for its fast-paced narrative, quirky set of college life
    samples with a rewind button because we have to avoid the menace that is
    Ozu, but this one removed all that, as we start from the main guy's 3rd year
    in college instead of 1st. Akashi is still not his girl haha bruh, Higuchi
    still has more chin than all of us combined *does chin action*, and we're
    all hot. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay the last one is the weather without the aircon,
    please, blame it on that devil incarnate. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh, and I'm not going to
    be sorry for their sense of humour where they bring back deja vu phrases, so
    let us "not miss that opportunity in front of us" and make this review the
    best I can, yes? That'll be 1100 yen where we left off. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Oh wow I
    just realized that the fortune-teller is also the manager of the building
    they live in!! Theu never hinted it but man what a vibrant world we have
    here)

    This movie has been split into parts in streaming, so I guess we can talk
    about each of them. So for starters, they are just elaborating on all the
    characters just to remind us all of the above I've mentioned haha you're
    welcome, but also, kind of focus on the summer heat in that building they
    live in. Well, mainly Higuchi and the others because main guy has the Aircon
    but you know, Ozu just drops by from time to time to- Did they just f**king
    bitch fight? Haha this is the best Anime ever. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We were also
    reminded in the somehow 2 years that have passed since the original story,
    where Akashi-san is part of the movie circle in which we had a glimpse of
    <strike>boobs</strike> tits lover Jougasaki ironically wearing a T-shirt of
    "Kaori-san" so his... sex doll haha ah hey, and how ironically everyone else
    is the same because they are all somehow involved in Akashi's newest
    production. But yeah, only Akashi-san knew what the final product of the
    film was though. It's like the Manhattan Project and she was the lead
    scientist HISTORY JOKE!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We will touch on the film soon enough, but
    suffice it to say it's just everyday life until Ozu ruins the aircon remote
    and Higuchi can't enjoy his passive cold air from the walls next room no
    more. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> With the introduction of a new character who called himself
    Tamura, and a film recording with two Ozu and no he is still human as much
    as we think he isn't haha, we are about to sink into a realm of weird stuff
    we thought wouldn't all happen within the past and next 24 hours. Well, in
    their timeline anyways. After they finished filming that day (we shall call
    this the present for keepsakes), all of them went to the bath ironically not
    Hanuki-san who rather be drunk than sink in human soup I guess lol, the main
    guy left early to follow his crush Akashi who happened to walk by to the
    nearby used book fair, and Jougasaki managed to dig out a time machine from
    the corner. WHAT?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>&nbsp;

  I feel like I can never finish explaining the depth of this timeline, so I
  shall move on. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> For starters, on this newly discovered device, they
  decide to test their theory out. Ozu immediately volunteers for the ride into
  yesterday in which he did come back to tell the tale, and was witnessed by,
  you guessed it, a film camera recording on the movie Akashi was producing. But
  also, at this rate, they also realized the dangers of doing such things, which
  I wish you did watch too many sci-fi movies to understand just the physical
  limitations of time travel that this is rather accurate in theory honestly, so
  let's leave it at that. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Otherwise, you would be pleased to know that
  the time machine is still true in their timeline, because it came from 25
  years later with respect to the present. So yeah, Tamura-san here came from
  the future. He was an occupant of the still standing building of the same
  room, and was the test subject of whatever club's experiment in making a time
  machine within a summer vacation's time. They did it, because what you see is
  what you get. The problem only happened when quite literally, they decide to
  resolve the problem of their aircon remote by sending Ozu, Hanuki-san and
  Higuchi together back into yesterday. Yep, I feel tired just explaining to you
  that so go watch it and see the whiteboard at the end. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But not so
  fast, we gotta welcome back an empty returning time machine first. Uh oh.

    Considering that these three are literal troublemakers who won by a scissors
    paper stone match (yes, just one) to who should retrieve the remote before
    it was broken the day before, maybe it was a bad idea after all, to even do
    all of that. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hanuki took a while to realize why letting everyone
    drink cider during the filming can prank kill them haha, Ozu followed Akashi
    because he knew something was going on with his bestie and her but is likely
    disappointed that nothing happened since the main dude WAS A PUSSY haha, and
    Higuchi stole his own shampoo coming in from the future. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> So as you

  I feel like *pant* this level of storytelling is tiring, so we are burning
  through this now haha no really the movie was 2 hours long go watch all the
  fun yourself me spoiling it here is just a sin. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But to a surprise to
  no one, once Higuchi and Hanuki-san were sent back to the present time
  specifically with the remote stolen right from Akashi's hands right before
  they left, they then realized that returning the remote in perfect condition
  from the past would be the problem, as it has been destroyed before. Heck, we
  even did a funeral for it because the actual machine didn't have an on-off
  button. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Problem is then, they thought the remote would be useless,
  and with Higuchi tampering of the time machine and putting Jougasaki in it, we
  sent him RIGHT back into 99 years before where there should be a war going on
  so... RIP I guess. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> He didn't die don't worry, and as the landlord
  (1200 yen please haha) has mentioned it being a swamp, that's where the dude
  landed in. Tamura though, had a better solution. From him, we knew that in his
  near future 25 years later the building will be reconstructed thus means the
  death of the only aircon in the premises so Higuchi would probably have to pay
  for his own lodging now lol yes he be still there lmao, and the remote would
  be useless, so he brought it back to present time, so yeah his past. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Excuse me while I take some headache pills before I carry on haha *gulp*
  Everyone was sent back to the present smoothly apart from the main guy, who
  needed to be there to do one thing: ask Akashi out to the festival.

  Okay so here's where the romance part came in, and thus I truly believe this
  movie is not just the sequel to the adaptation a decade ago, it's also the
  conclusion. So once again, everyone travelled back to present time haha see
  first paragraph of this review lmao, but the main guy didn't. Because he
  already did. He stood the time of passing and hid in his own room for about 24
  hours before he found a time to sneak out of his own room a day later while
  also simultaneously confusing the heck out of that student council leader
  Aijima lol. What also stood the time of passing was the remote control, which
  you might have recalled was lost 99 years ago but then was in the swamp until
  the dog dug it out wrapped in plastic. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> You think anyone a century ago
  would understand how plastic wraps work? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, it was real
  confusing, but what was more confusing is when Tamura forgot to bring his
  belongings back to the future. He came back, no surprise, until he dropped his
  backpack which included, and this is a thing by the way, a Mochiguma. Yes,
  that toy Akashi-san has been carrying it all along. So spoiler alert, this is
  the son, which begs the question now: Who is the father?? *pfft* It was
  hinted, and I really mean HINTED, that it was the senpai. Yeah. Yeah- OH

    Ironically, the final part is more like of a satisfactory one-two punch to
    the series one last time, as we correctly explain Watashi's life as a
    college student and the 2 years that have since passed. You know the stuff
    above, now patch it into the timeline where he was in a railway research
    club and THEN met Akashi-san 2 years later. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, this elaborate of
    a plot I WISH my life was half of this. Haha time travel is fine I also have
    motion sickness so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... I just want somebody to bust the
    sci-fi logic in this movie and make me regret watching this. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
    Because if not, this is a great movie! It was a nostalgia ride (some would
    say a time travel back) to what I've loved about the series, and so, so much
    more. All they did is just slap a time machine into this series, by the way.
    Everything else involved is just a story element because it was just 2 years
    later since then. And as usual, everything is determined already, so nice
    try for telling me to watch this movie today. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Serious talk
    though, this series has every single joke in check, made sure the time
    travel thing made sense which is why the pace at the beginning is weird they
    are setting up all the objects down including that student council guy's
    glasses lol SCREW YOU AND THE CHERRY BLOSSOM CAMPUS LIFE haha anyway, and
    how they really, <i>really</i> heavily hinted on the romance between the
    main couple. Though I would say, if the kid turned out like Tamura I might
    have killed it at birth- This is a great series for those who like a
    different take on animation, and boy, did it still hit me a decade later. I
    would like to brag about my experience of watching these to people, but
    secretly I'm like those railway research club members where I rather keep
    this gem to myself. Tell me if that is true for you too if you have seen it.
