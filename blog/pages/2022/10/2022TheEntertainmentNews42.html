Well I think I might just start this earlier every week now, and because I
really don't want to watch Anime on weekdays, we shall watch all weekend!! Haha
maybe not once I reject Urusei Yatsura since the others will only air on
Saturday nights SO!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  As expected BLEACH was licensed to Hell (get it?) so letting it air on a
  Monday in Japan and letting the fansub groups catch up might be a wise choice,
  so I think this will be the move going forward anyways. Also, we know the plot
  already it's just how much Kubo-sensei may have tweaked it since he oversees
  overall production on this final arc so <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Without further ado as I started this on a Saturday, let's!</div>

  Hey, you thought staying overnight was fun with that Anime last season? Wait
  till you have to deal with Hollows as a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>.
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Okay that's just for me personally but I really did not expect to be
  living this long and BE talking about my beloved action series which brought
  me into the world of Anime a decade and a half later, so before we talk about
  the episode, let's talk about feels. (Haha if you want to skip find the
  episode hashtag) This all started with the 20th anniversary of the original
  work back in 2001 when I was still a kid not knowing anything in school and
  only till around 2007 did I know of this from my classmates and then I was in
  middle (secondary) school, when the world was on fire back in 2021 at this
  point and they gave us more fire by announcing the Anime adaptation of the
  final arc of the original manga probably due to the rising popularity of its
  currently only mobile game Brave Souls, finally found enough capacity to
  complete the only action series I had dreamt of on my bed, literally. Fast
  forward to today where with some years of production they are finally ready to
  start, and I could not be more happier. So, as usual, first episode of any arc
  is for warmup (#BLEACHTYBW01), as we talk about Hollows being removed from
  existence. Also, they are so big, even the stationed shinigami in Karakura
  Town can't deal with it, and we have two. Man, are these Hollows considered
  Adjuchas? They don't talk though haha so many questions. (Yes, I'll link
  everything I say in lore to a Wiki in case anyone thought I was making all
  this up) But fret not, they might just be in a little squeeze seeing all these
  spawn in the Real World because there was an imbalance of soul powers likely
  due to the massive killings in Hueco Mundo which <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> we shall not talk
  about the perpetrators for now, we might need some help from the main four
  living in the town which also includes a Quincy haha ah hey, but overall, it's
  all in a night's duty amirite, fellas? Eh, Shino? Ryuunosuke? Why are you guys
  on the ground? Didn't Ukitake and/or Rukia train you guys well- Okay they were
  just bait, isn't it? Central 46? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't know who made these orders
  down, but considering we have some Arrancar curious to walk into the guys'
  bread supper or something there HAS to be something wrong, we don't even need
  12th Squad Captain Mayuri to tell us that, or even 3rd Seat Akon- Hey, I don't
  have to describe everyone in this series; You go figure it out if you are so
  keen. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, shit happened haha and that's why talking action
  series isn't exactly fun, RIP 1st Squad Vice Sasakibe you will be missed I
  will look forward to your Bankai in the future <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, old man Yamamoto is
  pissed but he doesn't get the shadow thing just like Ichigo and boy was that
  the best animated thing so far in the series haha, and we had our first glace
  at <strike>Ywa</strike> <strike>Yuwac</strike> whatever that f**k's name is
  haha maybe we call him Quincy God for now haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> and his current
  occupation of Hueco Mundo, the Hollow world is currently in a mess because now
  imprisoned Aizen left them cold tea. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I will only have
  hope they will pick up pace from here on, removing the ideas of recaps like
  from the long ending from our faces and making the animation stay ever so
  consistent instead of giving us the disappointments from the Arrancar and
  Fullbringer arcs. Fingers crossed, people!! We still have a couple more years
  to go for this series' end, and with Kubo-sensei in supervision of the series
  himself, I really hope this will deliver. More of this good stuff next week I
  guess. My only expectations, apart from the above which are really small to be
  honest, are that they showcase, once again, what all the action that makes
  BLEACH special, now that we have the best in animation and quality(?) all in
  one place. (<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> All sword releases please hehe) 15 years ago we only had
  the best voices

  Yeah haha what if all the alien invasion is a hoax and we just have some sweet
  romance? Haha yeah right I figured. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yes in case you haven't
  figured out the plot just by me saying this (#UruseiYatsura01), let's talk
  about what this classic remake is. This is a remake of the popular(?) 90s
  Anime series where, in face of an alien invasion, this dude Maboroshi is
  selected to play a game with one of the alien species to determine the outcome
  of this takeover. Yeah, it's as cliché as it gets, people. What's more cringe
  than that is our human representative is randomly picked and his opponent,
  that's right, is a female alien called Lum. So yeah, in case you wonder how he
  won... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nope, you're not wrong, Maboroshi is a man of culture lol,
  nothing like his dad who can't stop a quarrel between the mother and kid,
  still stares at women even though he has human Shinobu as his girl. Again, I
  can't help but bring my bro into this equation because the only difference is
  that he's single haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, would probably settle on marrying an alien
  anyways even though all this guy's motivation has been to be with the girl he
  likes. Earthling girl, by the way. So yes, it's an easy misunderstanding, we
  have that Cherry monk to vouch for that lmao, and I don't know if you call
  this bad luck or not and shout out to my bro again for comparisons haha, he
  did win the showdown by thinking strategically in the way he does: using his
  perverted brain. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Since Lum is an alien who can fly and electrify her
  opponents, one could only feel helplessness as a fellow human and then blaming
  him on his incapability to win this within 10 days (lol) despite all his
  limitations as just a fellow commoner. Heck, not like he has access to
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/51417/Engage_Kiss" target="_blank"
    >satellite lasers</a
  >
  or even just
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50709/Lycoris_Recoil" target="_blank"
    >guns which shoot out binds</a
  >
  to stop this Lum-chan per se (sorry for Anime reference overload), but you
  know, why not just snatch that... I guess bra? What do aliens call those on
  their planet? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I'm going to make jokes like this real often if
  I pick this up so I hope you're ready. Anyways, all in all I think this has
  crazy 90s comedy vibes maybe even heavier than modern take on such comedy such
  as Anime "Komi-san", but as much as it feels dated, in this first episode they
  didn't really give much premise on developments of the characters, or even
  just, a hint of Maboroshi liking this alien girl at some point. Well, I guess
  we need that transition phase that'll take a couple of episodes, right? Haha
  yeah let's not let the signal jamming from the saucer get in the way of this
  triangle relationship which will turn into a single line at some point lol,
  because for this lucky guy, his bad luck is just turning around, just about at
  the right time. Remember how he has to have all the bad luck to be chosen for
  the showdown? I mean, he could've used email. Haha see you guys around and we
  shall see if I can forgive this being just casually funny lol I've already
  given the theme songs internally by the way it's just classic dance pop
  anyways

  You see, you don't go to the school festival because you're alone but you guys
  are CLEARLY together you guys even slept- In this new episode of happiness
  haha (#UzakiChanS203), oh shit let me cook the rice first. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yes, we
  are expecting the biggest drop of the century lol and it's not because of
  Uzaki's rack haha, it's the school festival! Because we are going to enjoy
  days of fun as Sakurai closes himself in his abode playing video games all
  day. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah, did you also forget he was a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hikikomori" target="_blank">shut-in</a> and
  likes to play games more than Uzaki? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because SAME DUDE lol I feel
  like I have a lot in common with Sakurai minus the muscles. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways,
  we know that will not make of great content even the author knows, so he had
  to devise a plan- I mean, Sakaki had to devise a plan, LITERALLY, to get these
  two to have a great time in the campus while also making sure everyone in the
  school knows of this couple who aren't dating. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> How that works though?
  I feel like I should explain with respect to his perspective, as he explained
  it to Ami-chan who, we will talk about her later, is also involved in this
  somehow for some reason to no surprises to anyone haha. Firstly, Sakaki needs
  a way to get these two to join this festival. So I guess instead of keeping
  his mouth shut which he normally does, he suggested to the committee that
  encouraging people to participate in a lottery with spending on the stalls
  will get them upward to a prize that will make sure Uzaki wants it, like
  apparently it's a gaming console. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey Uzaki, you don't want something
  else? Haha oh well what do I know about women. Anyways, Sakurai was okay with
  just that as an excuse, so he played along with it. Then, Sakaki had to
  suggest something so cringe to make sure these two get attention, so he said
  to them to go spend money on the most expensive stalls, like the
  fortune-telling one ran by the Occult Club. Well, that went great because
  apart from Sakurai being THE ONLY GUY in the queue haha I mean I would've
  already thought something was amiss, they didn't read the notice (as with the
  many times they don't anyways) that mentioned about this queue only doing
  romance predictions, so hey, no wonder it only got the girls in. Which also
  will explain that if a couple had the balls to queue on this line means that
  they aren't worried of getting their fortunes told of them? Wait, what? They
  aren't a couple? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> THEN WHY IS AMI-CHAN HERE??? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well you get
  the idea, blah blah they are perfect for each other and that's why we have
  this Anime lol you're welcome says the author, somehow they were prevented
  from leaving once they noticed Uzaki's friend in front of them will only do
  romance card-reading, and I guess one of the voices who prevented them from
  leaving was familiar. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Haha it's like they know Sakaki was behind
  this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You think? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And of course in a surprise to no one, both
  of them are thinking about it even after the event, where Sakurai had his
  ideal break which is playing games at his place while Uzaki came over to cook.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, say they aren't a couple yet. All in all, maybe it's just me,
  but the narrator might be in too much for this episode in order to explain
  Uzaki's fantasies of assuming that they must be together after doing the
  fortune-telling which is obviously NOT true that will NOT happen in 20 more
  season of Anime haha, but hey, what's stopping them? Themselves, I guess.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, that's the whole point of the series, yes? Oh damn I ran out of
  rice to eat so see you guys next week then haha

  Oh, so that's the origin story. Hey shout out to Xing-Xing picking out the
  literal cutest girl in existence to be the next Consort? Haha I wouldn't have
  suggested otherwise; This is Anime anyways. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode
  where slavery reigns supreme until a golden feather lands upon your rooftops
  (#KoukyuuNoKarasu03), *ahem* I think you get the idea me not mentioning
  "period drama" would help make this more palatable even to me alone so, you're
  welcome. So, maybe we talk about the past of the Raven Consort for a bit.
  Story goes, that remember the girl had to dye her hair black to cover her
  identity as someone from the past dynasty as they will now be hunted by race?
  Well, not going too much about how that got her mother killed just because she
  was a bit too late, but then on she has been a child slave which *ahem*
  couldn't be represented any better until she got picked by the golden chicken.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, it sounds like a joke until you realize that it was raised by
  the Consort, the previous one, and that is now her legacy today, this Jusetsu.
  But today, in her palace she has to deal with a new lady-in-waiting (gotta
  emphasize, voiced by Kouno Marika) who refuses to let her get her own cup of
  water lol, that emperor who just somehow goes to her abode more often than the
  other consorts which- Can you just not appear in here, dude? She's going to
  get cancelled by your childhood friend at this rate. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> *ahem* Maybe
  that's also why the also current Empress in waiting (she is LITERALLY waiting
  to get laid haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>) paid her a visit too, but you know, who can stop the
  rumours out there. *ahem* Jusetsu won't change her mind though, we know for
  now. What will change her mind though, is when she slowly noticed the things
  around her changing, from possessed servants in the palace to maaaaybe this
  Raven Consort could use some protection because man, is the past coming back
  to haunt her. Because I'm pretty sure one would take precautions if you
  realized someone else out there can use the same magic stuff as she does,
  calling upon spirits and trapping them in a jar for blackmail? Really, who
  does such hideous things like this? Well I guess the rebellion so that's why
  we will be going after them. We did also get back the... I will just call her
  the Empress' ex lover haha ah hey, his soul so that's good news at least,
  sadly we had to see her cry because *ahem* and that's why we can't have nice
  things. And all this prowess about the emperor not being able to treat Jusetsu
  as a normal consort where he can have babies with her- Truly, TRULY an issue
  of being the monarch of a nation. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... Hmm I like the hints
  that were dropped on this episode about a potential thing where Jusetsu will
  be haunted by the past on her. Hmm... Should I give this? Can I take the
  sadness every episode for another 9? Hmm.... maybe? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It isn't too bad,
  for starters. We know it's *ahem* already so that's not too surprising.
  There's more lore than we think there is regarding the lives from the past
  dynasty so technically we don't know the real identity of the potential
  villain who will ruin this new empire at some point, but yeah, we have so much
  going on now, it's hard to think the lore wouldn't be good. So yeah, I guess
  I'll give this. Jusetsu is too cute to give this up haha ah hey me stop
  talking like the emperor
</div>

  Wow this is quite a week in Klassic Note though it might be the best for the
  month if the end of the month streak doesn't do this well. That doesn't mean

  flew through me like a gust of wind not affecting me in any way possible,
  because the melodies did not land on me so I won't say too much of this
  comparing to some of Waki Azumi's singles for Anime too since it's the same

  which though I said it sounds good and actually gave 2 songs literally geared
  towards my preferences of her singing voice hehe you're welcome Akarin I
  guess, I failed to give the topic song time and again today's my 3rd time
  listening to it again and I'm STILL hating the verse of the song, so I shall
