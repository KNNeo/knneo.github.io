Haha hey I said the thing, though is it the new year if we haven't hit the one on the lunar calendar? lol<div><br></div><div>Not going to do the Anime Extra thing for Titans though, so they will be officially delayed for a week considering they air... tonight haha that's why I hate Sunday Anime but what to do, I have a day job and I work on Mondays so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br> So let's see what the new season has to offer! Well I'm mostly watching sequels so you tell me lol I just hope the Bisque Doll thing will be good but I may be burnt out on romance shows so we shall see<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSanS301><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"This is the cool thing that the kids in athletic clubs use!" And you can still lose to Takagi in arm wrestling BOOM GOTCHA haha</div></blockquote>I think Nishikata is me dealing with things I am uncomfortable with which is basically me outdoors so... or maybe it's just love, you ever thought about that? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this first episode of another season of laughs where we continue our defecation on this poor dude lol (#TakagiSanS301), wait what is with the suggestive themes on this?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, you saw the opening animation? What the... Anyways, looks like in summary this is the aftermath of what happened last season with the summer festival and they held hands? 'Cos this is quite a theme in here, apparently. We start with Nishikata's fantasies... well dream it looks like, and yes Takagi-san it's a naughty dream because how did grabbing a cow's tail become a thing in this? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> (Goddamn did they put kinky producers in this now lol oh it's the same guys?) Moving on, we know Nishikata is already missing Takagi he's dreaming of her in his dreams, and as they meet again after the summer festival before school starts, Takagi asked Nishikata <strike>out</strike> to guess why she asked him out, and he got it half right... I guess? But yeah, gotta say though this dude is getting smarter by the day even though it's still off by a lot, since teasing is part of the lore is always an easy guess. The desire to meet though... I'll leave it at that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Seriously though, this hurts, just kiss already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then, we get to see everyone else in class. I know technically we saw them sleep in class in Nishikata's dream, but this is the end of the holidays where people haven't finished their homework, so yeah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Just for recap, the guys all went to the beach but it appears to be separately in boys and girls groups, so Takagi likely went with Yukari who is concerned about her fair skin she's trying out homemade masks, Mina is just totally distracted by bugs as usual, and Sanae... let's just say she is still as chill as ever. Nishikata went with his dudes Kimura and what his name, Takao? Oh really, I only referred to him as "bucktooth" <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, everyone's got the tans, Takagi be dreaming of her boy too, but I gotta say, maybe Takagi is a prophet. Haha, to this dude that she likes apparently. You see, if you love someone you can read their minds perfectly. Your experience may vary. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, so close yet <u>still</u> so far. Can we change this around in 12 episodes? I don't know, but we shall see. I feel like now I've learnt somehow that the fourth wall ie. production is teasing me on this series for so long, I've been a Nishikata all this time, I feel like. Like, really, how was I so dumb to pick this up to watch back then? Well, just like how they are going to be together, I have to watch this till the end now. They hinted on this as their final year of middle school, so let's see how far this goes. I honestly really want more romance than the teasing because I know we have to fulfil the title of this series but I feel like we've had enough... or have we? *Takagi giggles*</div><div>[TL:DR; Imagine Rieri in the studio going "wah", just, imagine it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhb5PtDSUXiYpl7JVaIFCASBG9vQAhHIWX448b1DVqXzHOGELEmcwOgWU2M2_gvk3FXtpBT-JY_AJqrNJjJjGqjGO6-4VG2zqTlHH0TVimBwUtvZO4rnjGDyy1auc2uf7fWpqKERId3D3GVcMPJdg-2cHU7-ctahbSu8iG-L-WzTGQB-g/s320/takagiS301_cow.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How you know this is not for children<br>(Really huh, cow outfit?

Ah, the question that most people can't answer from their family members. I feel you bro, I really do. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new series I'm trying out haha get it because outfits (#KiseKoi01), we find out that you don't need to have friends. You just need to have passion. Just, look at my solo journey on listening to Japanese music. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Anyways, this is an Anime ironically, about the same passion towards stuff only you like. And to be frank? I totally feel you guys. And I'm glad there is a Venn Diagram where these two can meet. So, let's talk about how this relationship happened. Firstly, about Gojou Wakana, the dude. (Yes, just in case like me you have mistaken that given name as a female) He likes dolls, specifically <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hinaningyou target=_blank>hina dolls</a> if you have not seen them, are a traditional doll design of historical origins rather unique to Japan, and if you have admired your granddad doing this for years since you were a kid, you would be drawn to it somehow, and that's our guy here. I would say that talking to the dolls may be TOO into it, but look at "Yojouhan" with that freak talking to a life-sized (s*x) doll sheltering it from the rain and compare it to this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I wouldn't say much about it, but seriously as they have mentioned, it's hard to get people to like the stuff you do, apparently also for the girl who left him because of his love for dolls back in I assume middle school. In this world where people call you a loser just because, we switch to the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gyaru target=_blank>gal</a> Kitagawa and her gang. In her accidental bump on Gojou's desk lol are you really okay though (why would you put that as like, a coincidental thing?) (Ah, anime production decision, I see), the dude ended up focusing on (her rack but also) her conversation with the girls talking about how some dude at the hair salon mocked on her interests in, guess what, Anime. Yep, we got a hidden otaku here, ladies and gentlemen. Well probably not that hidden, I assume the girls around her know about it but couldn't care less so she rarely talks about it I suppose, but yeah, try picking up a chick by insulting on her, bro. Not cool. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> For Gojou though, he's fine he hasn't got found out about her talking to his beloved doll head figurine OH MY FREAKING GOD. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, that's if Kitagawa was a normal person but she's not, as we quickly find their coincidences stack upon each other's lives pretty quickly. The episode focuses on the dude talking about how conciliatory he is to his classmates making others in class push class duties to him and then leaving for their own part-time work and can you give me a cut if I'm doing this for you lol, but yeah, in contrary Kitagawa stands for herself and wonders why this shy guy in class doesn't speak up for himself. That didn't get over his mind for a while, but I gotta say that's pretty good life advice we getting them all in this series lol. Then, the encounter. The sewing machine at home broke, so Gojou had to use the school's sewing machine but with the following assumptions: (1) This school doesn't teach home economics so yeah I can cook fried rice better than any of them lmao and (2) they don't have an Arts Club but have this Arts room, weird. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I assume we have another side story where someone is forming <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/31952/Kono_Bijutsubu_ni_wa_Mondai_ga_Aru target=_blank>an Art Club with a bunch of weird people</a> in it (lol sorry for Anime reference I am an otaku too haha ah-) but that's for another timeline, but yeah, Gojou can spend all the time he wants to making hina doll outfits without people finding out... if it isn't for Kitagawa. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Turns out, she be spending time here to do outfits too, this gal who doesn't know much on how to do sewing she probably has the same amount of knowledge as me tbh, but for cosplaying. Guess I was wrong about when I saw the trailer, but she is just into it, this might be her first outfit, and it's... terrible. I wish I could use harsher words, but I'm like nice guy Gojou so I wouldn't go up to her and stare at her half-naked body- Oh yeah, there are <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> references here, so be prepared though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So this is where the intersection is: We have a girl who wants to make outfits, and some dude who can do it but for dolls for now. So why not let him teach her- Oh we not teaching to fish she just wants fish? Uh okay, says Gojou, and thus the magical journey begins. Hey bro, I hope you don't mind a career change because she's gonna change your life forever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, great episode though, we might not even be done concluding on the origins of this romance, but we are getting there, and I'm rather pleased so far. We have comedy, we have suggestive references, we have some moments which will no doubt come back to bite us in the final episode, and we have Kitagawa. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I say we have a winner. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But seriously though, if you can get over the slightly lewd stuff around here which is nothing compared to <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou target=_blank>living on an island with you being the only dude</a>, I would say (sorry for another Anime reference haha I gotta write what comes in to my mind) this is worth a watch. We can never get enough to cheesy romance beginnings, and I think this is a good balance of all of it, with enough fuel to keep it going. Like really, if you aren't prepared to come here to watch more Kitagawa cosplay, you might be at the wrong place. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Just look at the opening animation man, we don't even have enough cosplayers in Japan to make ALL the outfits worn by this one girl in this series haha. (Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRS8Otwbo7g" target=_blank>the ending song music video</a>) But hey, I'll be darned to see this animated hehe we shall see what is up next because look at the title of next episode I can't even</div><div>[TL:DR; This author thought it'll be a great idea to let Kitagawa ask someone to help her make clothes instead of teaching her how to make clothes.

People listen to songs from 20 years ago. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kaikai-kitan-ao-no-waltz/1542572215?l=en" target=_blank>Eve's mini-album</a></b> from 2020 is not going to hit me anytime soon as with most of their songs, so I'm just giving the one movie theme song. No really, this dude's style is not for me, and I'm talking about melody, as usual. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%A8%E5%AE%AE%E5%A4%A9-best-album-blue/1599462474?l=en" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's best albums</a></b> are just a repeat of the songs I've listened over the past... 8 years? About there, and I think I'll just give the one new song but I missed the other in <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%A8%E5%AE%AE%E5%A4%A9-best-album-red/1599520886?l=en" target=_blank>the RED album</a> so looks like I'm giving an old song which I previously did not give, so to speak. And I did not intend to review this, but I picked up <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/2000s/1597478262?l=en" target=_blank>anewhite's latest album</a></b> from last year and got quite into it so I gave a couple of tunes. I really think if people ask me about indie artists I can recommend this to them. They be recognized by the music industry too with credited songs, so that's good, we can see where they go from here on. Hopefully no the same melodies I'm starting to hear a pattern lol oh did I mention I also accidentally hit on <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%83%94%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF-%E6%BF%80%E9%97%98%E3%81%AE%E8%A8%98%E9%8C%B2/1597557910?l=en" target=_blank>H ZETTRIO's new album</a></b> released in the new year? Haha I might just give one because they all sound the same after a while</div><div><br>In news concerning music and it's on Twitter and yes I'm back to this terrible intro for a paragraph because I can't think of anything better, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1478652741752803330?s=20" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's new music video</a></b> is not going to be my thing so I'll be skipping that I didn't give it in the best albums anyways, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/_kanaboon/status/1479015100648673282?s=20" target=_blank>KANA-BOON's new album will be releasing end of March</a></b> and yes one member is missing don't ask where he is we don't know either <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span>, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1479258892228231176?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song</a></b> for their upcoming album is for a commercial so that's cool, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1479392367215923200?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new music video will premiere on YouTube</a></b> tomorrow which is for her album next month, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1479832519361335296?s=20" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new song</a></b> is already streaming and on YouTube if you are keen it isn't bad tbh, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Akase_Official/status/1479845353314729991?s=20" target=_blank>Akase Akari's debut single music video</a></b> is Anime "KiseKoi" in real life I found out she's a drama actress who sings and cosplays too so that's going to be a thing real fast, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/spiraspica/status/1479649540504694788?s=20" target=_blank>spira spica's new single is releasing next month</a></b> for Anime "KiseKoi" and I expect a music video to drop by soon, and blah blah <b><a href="https://twitter.com/smasonline/status/1480095169542520832?s=20" target=_blank>TrySail was in Anime Songs Online</a></b> event organized by Sony Music Japan and they are the parent company for these girls so go figure. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, I took some time to research on <b>what Suchmos is doing</b>... <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1478639833945804808?s=20" target=_blank>they went on hiatus</a> (why) and someone in their group died so RIP dude, <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1478639837301202945?s=20" target=_blank>one of them is creating a slow jazz band</a> which probably spawned me to dig around for ZETTRIO lol, and I almost gave this dude <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1478639835732611072?s=20" target=_blank>his 3rd solo single</a>. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Oh well, guess not everything will go your way haha<br><br>Next week it looks like we're hitting the Anime portion of Klassic Note reviews lol, where I may just give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/real-eyes-single/1600645665?l=en" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new song</a></b>, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%AE%8B%E9%9F%BF%E6%95%A3%E6%AD%8C-%E6%9C%9D%E3%81%8C%E6%9D%A5%E3%82%8B-ep/1594814582?l=en" target=_blank>Aimer's new single</a></b> and <b>TrySail's new single</b> because it's all for Anime. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> We shall see how far we can go, I'm not expecting much from these but Inorin's song wasn't bad, so I'll report my findings next week. My guess, I'll probably continue on my plans to listen to other artists I discovered from last year.<br><br><br><br><br> Yeah, you can say I enjoyed the IDOLY PRIDE mobile game's new event a lot this week. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1477863146425487361?s=20" target=_blank>I got the event SSR</a> on the free roll of 10, posted on Twitter early some of the photos taken on the event in-game, and probably <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1478894284073963520?s=20" target=_blank>got the most likes in the history of my Twitter account</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, it's just for fun, and as I told myself maybe I should use this to do other things than music more. Besides, no one will care about the music stuff I talk about if I don't Japanese and/or use hashtags anyways. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Cya guys next week haha, and until next time be sure to look back at some of the posts where I talk about how I simped for Futon-chan last year. Probably doing again this year tbh I can't stop staring at images of her half-naked body-<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. The very first Japanese mobile game I played <a href="https://twitter.com/alterna_girls/status/1478380953613791235?s=20" target=_blank>"Alternative Girls" has reached its end of service</a> this week and they released an offline version with stripped off content notably the events which I actually missed some of them but most of the features still exist including, and I'll take my time to look at them, character story endings which required maxed out relationships which if you're like me and like them all you won't have enough for even one of them lol. The download period ends next month, so I may want to download again for my older phone too so maybe, maybe I'll use the VR features again lmao unlikely I'm too lazy to do so</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1478712027912704001?s=20" target=_blank>My "Alternative Girls" profile</a> for good measure, because even though I levelled out all the girls' relationships the top 3 still show a pretty good representation of my preferences haha thanks game</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
