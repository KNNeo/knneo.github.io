lost count at some point but you get the idea (maybe I should split between new and used from Suruga-ya)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Unlike last year, because I think I've become numb to the prices in shipping lol me, we shall only talk about the items specifically, and what was different compared to last year.</div><div><br></div><div><div>LEAST WORTH ITEM BASED ON ITEM VALUE</div><div>I would say though, I hardly buy anything that has the least worth, so it kind of ends up being the items that I was most disappointed of due to - and there are a lot of them last year - gacha elements in getting those items. I'm fine with badges I'm not going to be mad even if the odds are low, but bromides though... And that's why I was real sad with <b>Hanazawa Kana's bromides</b> in which it's her first time selling them directly to us thanks to her moving of music labels, but then I ended up getting all the landscape ones instead of the portrait ones which was what I actually wanted, so really, can we just not do that and just sell all of them in sets? Please? I'll pay more lol you'll pay more if you buy more gacha-based ones huh haha no thanks then</div><div><br></div><div><div>MOST WORTH ITEM BASED ON ITEM VALUE<br>Normally I would put this in the least worth portion, but since you know I was a simp the moment I bought in the <b>Kouno Marika fanclub box</b> YOU KNOW I was already pricing that one handwritten <em>priceless</em> membership card above everything else. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> I'm sorry man, impulse buys are a thing and I don't know how to scrimp and save. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Apart from that, if we do not talk about stuff that costed a bomb, I would say I loved <b>Ookubo Rumi's bromides</b> so much, my phone wallpapers this week were it, and I can't say any more how much I want <strike>her body</strike>Â her photos so much and since there isn't another photobook I'll take this any time of the day. RumiRumi please release a photobook again I know you be in your 30s but</div><div><br></div></div><div><div>BOLDEST ATTEMPT</div></div><div>Ah, my boldest attempt is ironically NOT listed in any of these posts mainly because I don't have any physical goods to review on. Yes, and it only gets worse, they both are from <u>and to</u> Tachibana Haru aka <b>Futon-chan</b>, the only cosplayer I follow till date. As seen from the thumbnail of this post, Futon-chan has within the year, joined a modelling company known as "modelpress", and under that name she released a sort of <a href=https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B09FNTY81M/ target=_blank>digital photobook</a> of her dressed up in many ways than over to please my eyes, so I immediately bought it to support her advancement it's not that expensive anyways. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜Ž>*dabs*</span> Bear in mind that the world was on fire, and her being independent is not great for her own career even if she does MC here and there, so I'm just glad she is under some shelter now, from here and onwards. And if you thought getting something from her isn't bold enough, did I tell you that I ALSO giftedÂ  an outfit (cosplay? lingerie?) to her which was on her Amazon wishlist, on her birthday over a year ago? And I didn't see her wear it at all? (Or take a selfie and PM me? lmao ah hey I left my Twitter handler) You don't get any returns on this FYI this is idolism at its finest. Will I do it again though? Eh maybe not I'll just pay for her fanclub next week haha there wasn't one last year anyways</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqbJJY3I5oxCA9aSjnxiwr0dgYjMfohtilDibw5mvrO_DNKlOuEyQW0UbEUHhf2Jnn8f6hh7SrCYFxUpPiSYzhMZ1L4jYtLWFOgq6XJfJwfI6xa4zGBAWiNECs7Uy_qKTfBWuIxYx5htOElzEANIZ_a9-xhQj4kjVo2gBkvFgaz1PVVg/s933/futon_gifts.jpg imageanchor=1 style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=522 data-original-width=933 height=179 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqbJJY3I5oxCA9aSjnxiwr0dgYjMfohtilDibw5mvrO_DNKlOuEyQW0UbEUHhf2Jnn8f6hh7SrCYFxUpPiSYzhMZ1L4jYtLWFOgq6XJfJwfI6xa4zGBAWiNECs7Uy_qKTfBWuIxYx5htOElzEANIZ_a9-xhQj4kjVo2gBkvFgaz1PVVg/s320/futon_gifts.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>In case no one believed I did this even though I mentioned it last year, here you go<br>(No, the photobook did not feature her wearing the stuff I bought her <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span>)</table><div><br></div><div><div>WORTHY MENTIONS</div></div><div>I would argue that I should talk about also how good <b>Waki Azumi's pamphlet and photo set</b>... bromides thing are, or even the time I bought an <b>Omigawa Chiaki photobook</b> just because she promoted it, but I have to say that the stuff that made me move out of my comfort zone... at least in terms of my wallet lol (RIP wallet), was to betray my sister and our trips to buy novelty T-shirts to buy... <b>novelty T-shirts of voice actresses</b>Â that my sis will never buy and is super pricey just because. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜Ž>*dabs*</span> From that "Aoibito" shirt and pants meant as a thing from Amamiya Sora I can't even, to those shirts my mom ruined by putting on the sun for too long until it changed colour (ugh) (haiz), there are a lot of things to say about that one bulk purchase which... I'll never do again and don't ask me why. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Yeah, probably why maybe RumiRumi bromides won the Marinka box since that had a shirt too but I left it inside the box lest history repeats itself again haha living alone and taking care of your own laundry is better huh</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>BEST ITEMS BY TYPE</div></div><div><div>Bromides (not including sets of used bought in bulk) (gacha outcomes included)</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Toyota Moe<li>Valentine's 37cards<li>Koga Aoi<li>Naganawa Maria x Hondo Kaede "Maria Birthday 2020"<li>Taketatsu Ayana<li>Inori Machi<li>Kitou Akari "smile giving day vol.1"<li>Isobe Karin (2nd place)<li>Waki Azumi<li>Minase Inori "HELLO HORIZON"<li>Uesaka Sumire<li><b>Ookubo Rumi</b><li>Oozora Naomi<li>Kitou Akari "MIRRORS"<li>AMUSE Voice Actors<li>Naganawa Maria x Hondo Kaede "Maria Birthday 2021"<li>Hanazwa Kana</ul></div><div>Clear Folders</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Natsukawa Shiina (2nd place)<li><b>Inori Machi</b><li>Tomita Miyu (2nd place?)<li>Hanazawa Kana (one was drawn)</ul></div><div>Pamphlets</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Amamiya Sora<li>Natsukawa Shiina (personal bias so ruling that out)<li>TrySail (revealed online in full)<li><b>Waki Azumi</b><li>Toyosaki Aki (interesting concept)<li>Minase Inori "HELLO HORIZON"<li>Uesaka Sumire (no cleavage lol)</ul></div><div>Books</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Douki-chan vol.3<li>Douki-chan vol.4<li><b>Chijin no Ai</b><li>Inori Machi Diary #14<li>Marinka Box<li>Inori Machi Diary #15<li>Douki-chan vol.5</ul></div><div>Badges</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Kitou Akari "smile giving day vol.1" (one was text)<li>Tomita Miyu (duplicates)<li>Ookubo Rumi (the lineup were purely solo images too so)<li><b>Oozora Naomi</b><li>Kitou Akari "MIRRORS"<li>Naganawa Maria x Hondo Kaede "Maria Birthday 2021" (not solo images)</ul></div><div>Shirts</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li><b>Amamiya Sora "Aoibito"</b><li>Toyosaki Aki "live your best" (material thin af, not new)<li>Kitou Akari "smiley pop" (amazing quality)<li>Toyosaki Aki "Okaeri Radio" (amazing quality too)</ul></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I really don't know how long I can do this, but as of now we are basically living on the assumption that every single package sent to my room is <a href=https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/importing-by-post-or-courier-service target=_blank>exempt of taxation</a>Â (every package is less than SGD $400) and everything is paid purely on the host country ie. Japan. So yes, I'm paying their 10% right now lol don't tell my country's government. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> But in the case that changes which it has been mentioned to encourage local purchases (Like, really? What about this- ugh), then I may have to tone that down.</div><div><br></div><div>But until then!! Here's to more fun exploring the merchandise of Japanese voice actresses!

Thinking of bombing my bro on his birthday in March with Itou Miku's newest photobook released a month ago in December I know his address <em>since he asked me to buy stuff for him before so</em> I think I might just do it it's cheaper than buying from the local bookstore somehow haha no really</div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEverydayLife">The Everyday Life</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheWelfarePackage">The Welfare Package</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
