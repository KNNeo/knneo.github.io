I really kind of hate it that I have to watch Attack on Titan first just because
I queued it to watch in chronological order and I have to watch last week's
episode. Upside is, I'll be ending with KiseKoi which is probably for the better
since I can't stop thinking about Kitagawa ever since I met her. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Is
this what it feels like to love Anime again...? <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  New week, new... a lot of stuff apparently, so let's get into it! I don't
  think I remember what happened in Titans I did not watch those recap episodes
  in Japan lmao I won't get this now<br />
  <br />WHY CAN'T I BUY MARINKA'S LIVE TOUR GOODS COLUMBIA JAPAN WHY CAN'T I BUY
  STRAIGHT THROUGH YOUR ONLINE STORE okay rant's over let's start haha<br />

  Wow, (spoiler incoming) Levi's dead, huh. Oh well, guess I'm done with this.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode of a final series I hope this better be
  (#AttackOnTitan76), I almost forgot a lot of people are with Eren's group now,
  of course, including Zeke. Levi's not dead by the way lol. What is dead though
  supposedly, is Zeke, probably after Levi chopped him into pieces, but
  ironically, he didn't die. So at least he'll still be useful to Eren lol
  spoiler alert? Well, you read that otherwise, okay? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Moving on, we go
  back to the episode we picked up, where if I didn't remember wrongly, Reiner
  arrived with the Marley army to Paradis to do a counterattack while Pieck
  sneaked in to befriend Eren after whatever Eren did to take in some Titan
  powers such that he has what, 5 out of the 9 in his hands was what we talked
  about previously? I don't remember but it's close I know the not Erens are at
  a disadvantage in terms of Titan power possession. What is at a disadvantage
  now though, might be Eren's side considering this aggression from the enemy
  outside of the island. Even though it really looks like as what Eren
  mentioned, because they can convince their support which are the Marley army
  and Eren's team to back them up, it just ends up being these two fighting it
  out, Reiner and Eren. Ironic, isn't it? Haha that's war fer ya. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But
  that's where the similarities end. Since Eren's group is just a bunch of
  traitors lmao especially Yelena if you would recall, their forces are unlikely
  to stop thousands of men from Marley's side even though they took a big hit in
  their manpower previously, and still can bring in heavy artillery via
  parachute (can you even do that? someone try that out haha) and use that to
  nail Eren in the Titan brain, which of course, doesn't do much but immobilize
  the Titan. Speaking of which, we got Titan battles straight off the bat here
  in this final final season, where Reiner goes head to head with multi-power
  Eren who ignores Yelena's advice to step down and fight head on, is just
  playing level field until what's his name, Porco who was at that place with
  Pieck (umph) (lol), stepped in to help Reiner take down Eren, and Pieck
  mounting on the heavy Titan gun to shoot him from afar. *sniper monkey* (lol)
  Anyways, as you can see though, Marley's plan isn't perfect, but it was well
  planned. They also know Eren is the ultimate weapon, so stopping him here and
  now will just solve everything, or so we think. I mean, we technically have
  not witnessed on the Founding Titan power yet RIP that dude who got eaten from
  beneath the stage yeah Willy Tybur haha, but yeah, if that is not divine like
  a meteor shower made out of fire I don't think Eren is going to get out of
  this as easily as Levi might have with who's that face again uh... Hange-san
  yep, who apparently were stuck with Zeke and some not friendly forces but
  managed to escape through the river with Levi suffering significant injury,
  probably keeping Zeke away from his brother. And he's no Titan, by the way. I
  mean, he has that jab where his cowboy hick friend gave him, but it's not used
  yet right? And Annie's still hidden? Yeah, is that where we are at now? I
  think so, I really don't remember haha. What we actually have learnt though,
  is the legendary healing powers of the Paths, where Titans at the brink of
  death can be resurrected by some angel lady in an instant? Okay, be sure to
  give us an explanation sometime soon. All in all, I rather have BLUE ENCOUNT
  for opening theme lol you don't have to know who they are, the ending theme is
  probably what I'll go for, and I'm actually glad they got back in pace this
  quick picking up right from the previous season. Getting me hyped for some
  action Anime is the best thing this series has given me haha. Looks like next
  episode they have to convince the army in Paradis to fight. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> That
  sounds like a bad idea tbh did you see how Yelena's group and existing forced
  in Paradis died under the Marley army? Haha it sure looks like Marley's side
  is winning now, so we shall see what happens next. God, I'm glad this series
  is back and giving us the ending sooner than later. I really want an answer to
  all this bullshit, uh, I mean, lore haha cya guys again next week.
</div>
<div>
  [Gotta say though, I'm glad they gave us less than two scenes of recap for me
  to remember what happened so far from a year ago, instead of BLEACH which will
  take half an episode to do so, every week. <span title="*ugh*">üôÑ</span> Bad memories for those I
  guess and thanks Titans for not ruining the Anime series]

  Haha what is with the speechless intro did we run out of budget to hire

  and
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuuki_Kaji" target="_blank"
    >Kaji Yuki</a

  to do voicing? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode (#TakagiSanS302) where ironically
  I have to say I miss Takagi-san's voice haha they got me, turns out Takagi is
  just a bloody cheater, no offense. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> It's not like she's smart or
  anything, just that once again, if you need a reminder, Nishikata is just
  dumb. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So, first up, this silent drama is great because for once we
  can appreciate the soundtrack because I haven't since I have to work a
  full-time job lol <span title="*sob*">üò¢</span>, it's basically Takagi's stalking journey to meet
  Nishikata when the time arises, and you know, freak him out while she can. I
  know, I feel like something's the problem but with Nishikata trying to figure
  her out to eventually dropping his guard against her
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kehai" target="_blank">presence</a>, (I know
  right I'm doing middle school Japanese while I'm at it) it's basically telling
  us how observant Takagi is normally just so she can always read his boy's
  mind, but also, if you want someone to guess what's in your pocket... do it at
  home. Also, you can just say she's wrong and pull out your dic- Next up, okay
  we also run out of budget to hire
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/43279/Konomi_Kohara" target="_blank"
    >Koko-chan</a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/10981/Yui_Ogura" target="_blank"
    >Ogura Yui</a
  >
  too, huh. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> (Edit: Sorry
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/25437/Mao_Ichimichi" target="_blank"
    >Mao-san</a
  >
  forgot about you) Man, where's the budget on this episode even haha maybe on
  the soundtrack? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Did like, the animators watch an episode from the
  Looney Tunes cartoon series and got inspired by it? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, it's the
  same thing as before but now with Mina-chan who doesn't care and is easily
  distracted by stray cats and beautiful flowers, probably didn't notice
  Yukari-chan until she has to, and we know Sanae-chan wins in all this since
  she didn't get found out lol okay middle schoolers do these huh. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>
  Thank goodness I'm not the recipient or else it would've been boring for these
  13-year-olds haha. Finally we bringing the voices back haha the recording
  above must be when Tokyo was on lockdown lmao, we check each other's desks.
  Spoiler alert because there isn't any today in class, but Nishikata thought
  there is and Takagi just went along with it. Easy. We already know who lost.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Nishikata also gets spooked easily so I won't care too much, but man
  if I knew Takagi was just trying to return the book I borrowed to her inside
  her jersey I would've <strike>taken it to smell it</strike> just pretend to be
  teacher and <strike>grounded</strike> reprimanded her for bringing such stuff
  to school. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Man, Nishikata, you don't even know how to be cool. Look
  at your bros like Kimura and Takao. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay, bad examples, pretend I
  didn't say it. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Then, we know this is a thing in school when the
  librarian gets to take the month's break just because her work has been
  replaced with students, I don't even know how the main couple ended up in the
  same library shift group. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> (<i>IT'S RIGGED!!!</i> lol) Nishikata is
  into picture books so Takagi just picked it for him, and to (think he) look
  cool Nishitaka chose some literature for his girl until you realize... it's
  not a romance novel. Oops, he won't find out anyways haha this idiot. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>
  Last but not least, and this is why we are here in this third season coming,
  Nishikata showed off his running skills by running to the beach as egged by
  Takagi. Like really, just give me the wholesome stuff at the end I don't want
  the Nishikata runs down the beach bullsh*t. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But then again it's
  dependent on that so I guess why not. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> But yes, more of this.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And yes, I would've guessed it, Takagi probably came for him (lol
  that sounds wrong) knowing he'll be challenged to do it despite not intending
  to and wear himself out, so yeah, some wholesome support is what he got in the
  end. I hope that's what you asked for, bro. Also, some teasing, gotta give
  some of that too haha. All in all, gotta remind you all including me once
  again, that it takes a lot for Takagi to convince her dude that spending time
  with him is great just because her usual image is just teasing him. That, I
  don't know if it's good or not, but we know it works. They had a kid too so
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay that's not even in this adaptation go read the original
  spin-offs. I'm just glad we got more of this series, and if you can't get over
  Nishikata losing every time, at least enjoy Takagi losing every time for
  totally different reasons. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Well
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ganbare" target="_blank">ganbare</a>
  Takagi-san can't help you there haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Takagi's movements are greatly orchestrated with the soundtrack until
  you hear Yukari-chan shuffling at the intersection lmao that was just cartoon
  level stupid]

  Wow Shizuku-tan, it's basically a porno and YOU tell me this is safe? I've
  watched Anime for a decade, girl. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Don't worry Gojou I'm in with you
  bro because in this new episode (#KiseKoi02) we get to hear the lore inside
  the lore that Kitagawa is so crazy wanting to do cosplay on. Not that he has
  to know it, but that's also how we creep people out, being otaku with people
  who don't. Also, Gojou probably died of embarrassment in this episode so RIP
  him, yes? Haha, let's get to the story. <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> Yeah, like Gojou I gotta calm
  down too haha but not really from embarrassment because what is Anime
  nowadays, but more of, I laughed too much just from this episode alone. Let's
  talk about it. Since we got the devil's contract lol who doesn't, and Kitagawa
  did explain the lore of the character she was going to cosplay hopefully
  without you thinking of erotic thoughts but even if you do I'll forgive you
  haha, there are only certain points including the initial point where you have
  to remember: We're all doing this for her sake, for Kitagawa's sake to cosplay
  as her favourite character. Thanks, Shizuku-tan. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But yeah, she be
  describing a porno game so whatever don't forget they are high schoolers and
  you gotta graduate to even touch those things so I wonder how she got her
  hands on those. But yeah, if you have not experienced me explaining Japanese
  AV to you it's pretty much the same as Kitagawa's explanation of "Slippery
  Girls 2" lol the title but you know, let's just say I'm not a girl who wants
  to cosplay and I knew all these earlier than she does. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Moving on
  haha, and it's a literal reference to the first episode and my thoughts, that
  Kitagawa also had a cosplay beginners handbook bought and somehow she still
  can't figure it out so at least Gojou knows how to read it, and I guess he has
  to do all the work instead of just teaching her because we'll need more than a
  crash course tbh. Next up, since it's the weekend ahead, Gojou decided to
  continue this on Monday because where got time for his dolls now haha, but
  thanks to the granddad going out to buy the sewing machine which his dear
  grandson broke doing hina doll costumes, we know Gojou is going to break the
  next one making outfits for some girl he met in high school so gramps don't
  worry, your hopes and dreams for him aren't over... maybe. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Kitagawa
  dropped by on his day off on a Saturday ironically finding out where he lives
  through map apps, and drops by to get things started. Literally. And second
  half is just a joke in my opinion so I hope your jaw doesn't hurt from
  laughing: it's doing measurements. And yeah, who else is going to measure her
  bust size, the granddad who is outside? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So yeah, you can believe
  hilarity ensues real fast on this part where... And that's how you know Gojou
  Wakana here is too-pure-pure-boy haha I need to make that Anime "Kannagi"
  thumbnail soon, because you know, first time girls appeared in his room. But
  seriously though, when is mine happening? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But yeah, this might be the
  hardest thing this boy has to do in his life EVER and I meant his erection
  HAHA BOOM okay I have to put mature rating on this site now thanks
  Shizuku-tan. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In a nutshell and I rather let you enjoy the experience
  if you get what I mean hehe ah, lucky
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukebe" target="_blank">sukebe</a> Gojou
  gets to enjoy the pleasure of measuring every nook and cranny of Kitagawa's
  banging figure (Like really, B86? That's impressive) until it's too late and
  ONLY (haha wtf really) when the girl realizes some dude is measuring up her
  crotch... Is that considered too late? Or does anyone not know what is
  happening here?? Is probably what Gojou is thinking about but that's the point
  lmao, and I really hope for our sakes this is the furthest this Anime will go
  in in terms of&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank"
    >ecchi</a
  >
  references. Because really, I'm not that pure though but, this is real hard to
  watch too. (Yeah yeah erection blah blah) (lol) I know it's meant to be better
  than the game Gojou now has to play to see Shizuku-tan in all angles, but
  dude, play those when your gramps is not around, man. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, I
  laughed a lot so that's a good thing, but more on Gojou's embarrassment and I
  wished Kitagawa had more too or maybe I'm used to those Anime haha, but
  between Gojou bowing down to Kitagawa on his bed&nbsp; to talking about
  nipples (lol), this Anime has EVERYTHING normal people would try to avoid. I'm
  not normal, so that's ok. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Goddamn, will I even survive watching this
  for 10 more weeks and she's not the only girl in this Anime... We're LITERALLY
  going to be in a harem where I join the Humiliation Club because I can't focus
  on helping Kitagawa do cosplay outfits lol poor Gojou I hope you had a rest on
  Sunday haha <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span>

  [TL:DR; Just a friendly reminder in case you forgot the title, there's

  Since I had to come up with something every week on Klassic Note as a summary,
  I would say this week is... really just Anime if not for TrySail because I
  forgot they delayed their release indefinitely so who knows when we getting
  that new single. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Other than that, we do have some songs we can talk
  about.

  is a meh so I'm just giving the new Anime "Kimetsu no Yaiba" opening song.
  Like really, the music video did not deepen the impression of the song for me,
  it's just Anime hype or whatever kids like now. Aimer-san, I hope this is what
  you wanted. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Anyways, these aren't enough, so I continued my journey

  is... very similar to the single I heard of last year in which as I listen
  then I noticed their rather heavy style is still not so my thing, so I tried
  to give another emotional song, I guess. Yeah, just one song. So total 3 new
  songs, not bad for second week of Klassic Note 2021 lol<br />

  >&nbsp;apparently for reaching 10k subs on their YouTube channel since 2020
  but maybe also more news...? I mean, we can use another album, you know.
  <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Also, it sounds like an actual live this time around so I won't
  expect their mini keyboard or a cappella but who knows. WOW this is a long
  list lol oh we might as well add in

  with apparently big news to share so... maybe it's live huh the album's recent
  in October too<br />
  <br />So next week, we have a couple of releases we can listen too but I don't
  know how many of them I can give to be honest including
  <b>fuzzy knot's new single</b> and if you don't remember them that is fine
  lol, <b>Higuna Ai's new digital single</b> which is for Anime "Attack on
  Titan" since I don't want to wait for a more formal physical release as I
  usually do, and maybe if I have time or all of them are disappointing then
  I'll end my planned exploration trip with <b>No Buses</b>. Oh yeah, I listened
  to some Kitri this week too and that wasn't a great trip so I won't comment
  much that single was a miracle haha<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />Hmm what should I talk about here...

    >Kotobuki Minako's final livestream</a

  not that keen to talk about

  lol, so maybe I'll talk about how I intend to buy the "BLEACH" manga
  collection in its entirety of 74 volumes but I've been hesitating to get it
  since years ago after it ended or even got fully licensed in English, since
  English licensing has slightly different designs so boo, there's colourized
  digital versions in Japanese too, and there's even a special e-book made to
  house an SD card worth of any series in Shounen Jump in Japan but those are
  not cheap and it was only on pre-order in October of last year so not thinking
  about those. Even if I buy the digital ones in Japanese I also won't have time
  to read it or have a good device with a Kindle App to read. I don't have an
  Android tablet I only have a Surface Pro 4 which I use to grind DOAXVV so...
  yeah. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I'll save that money for now, they don't need my money anyways
  just give ma a PS5 game of the whole series so I can replace my subwoofer with
  a gaming console lmao. Cya guys next time then I suppose this is long enough
  for an outro lol, and until next time... maybe this year's photobook showdown
  is Hondo Kaede vs Lynn huh haha you can see if that will happen in the
  upcoming months hehe I might just do it tbh if it's for me
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. I wish I can just play DOAXVV like how you play the not volleyball
  aspects of DOAX3 but oh well I can live with this game haha maybe I should
  give them money it's going to be 5 years for this game already let's see if
  the new DMM GAMES PLAYER will region lock me by then lol
