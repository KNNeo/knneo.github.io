I'm just struck out of things to say now mainly because I may not have enough
personal time to myself. From having company dinner on Friday night and meeting
with friends on Saturday night, I don't think I have quite enough time for
myself to... to... you know, relax. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And it kind of includes this, to be honest. Watching Anime and listening to
  songs, but honestly saying for the latter I may have listened to too much old
  stuff even if it's in the form of game soundtracks, but ironically it keeps me
  more at work compared to like, YouTube videos in the background since the
  content changes every few minutes. I use it as like, an impairment because I
  must say I'm too efficient of a worker myself. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay, enough about life, let's sink in to more animated action and animated
  girls so we can forget about friends having to recommend me dating sites to be
  "normal". <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Let's start, shall we?<br />

  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "Do you want to save Eren?" There is no saving Eren, Armin, he's already a
      bad guy haha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  You think? You think that it's possible? That Eren is this hero the world
  needed? And that's not Reiner? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, heroes gotta make sacrifices,
  maybe cut off some relations, so Eren's way better off now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this
  new episode where we doubt Eren's sanity lol (#AttackOnTitan77), why is this
  episode's recap this long I don't even know. But hey, look who's here. Okay,
  story. I'll summarize the intro because even I'm bored, we talked about Armin
  explaining to all the guys in the cells after that dude unlocked them, about
  how Eren can be a liability to all just because he still has the final say in
  what to do with the Founding Titan power. Believing in that, the guys decided
  to help Eren out... in the case he needs helping lmao. Because between getting
  pierced by Reiner and pounced on by... that other small Titan lol I forgot his
  name, he still managed to fend them away despite losing half that Titan face
  somehow. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So firstly, we talk about war advantage shift to Eren's
  side, because Zeke's here. Gotta recap that since the possibility of that
  happening where Zeke reached the walls is probably because Levi didn't stop
  him and that is true we saw that 2 episodes ago they had to retreat or maybe
  he is dead who knows haha, but yeah, the brother is here to change the tides.
  Removing plenty of Marley forces on the air and at the ground with his
  precision rock shots lol the airships just needed one stone tbh, he easily
  removed any minor distractions that might be out to get Eren and the other
  Titans fighting considering Eren did fend them off up till now. Ironically,
  after freeing the Paradis people in the cells and trying to help Eren, turns
  out that might not be necessary as Yelena celebrates upon Zeke's expected
  arrival, but then freaks out at Armin saying they want to help? Hmm... we
  might have to leave that for later I have a feeling Yelena knows how to deal
  with people but not using guns. Still, this also means Falco is saved,
  reunited with Gabi and Marley forces, they got married and- Haha hey don't ask
  me why there's a romance subplot right in the part of war but Falco did drink
  that Zeke spinal fluid wine along with the Paradis army so... you think he's
  gonna stop Zeke from screaming? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And before we know it, Zeke has a
  control of the situation while Eren limps his Titan body (what, why) to his
  bro, but Zeke almost did not notice how easily the Cart Titan is taken care
  of. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Wait, they took down the Cart Titan? Without a Levi? How can you
  even- And before you can even think that is possible, and then I recalled the
  title of this episode which is aptly named "Sneak Attack" so yeah, it's just
  Pieck returning to human form of course. This gives an opening to Magath and
  almost unbeknown to Zeke who is looking off at a distance, to pull in a shot.
  Magath got it though, right at the nape, as the Beast Titan falls from the
  wall. Will Zeke scream though? And kill like, Falco and everyone else who
  drank the wine in the process? We shall see. Falco is very small sacrifice to
  rid of most of the Paradis army at this point so it's your switch train lanes
  moral question thing again. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, wow that was quite an
  episode. I wish the recap was shorter because why, hearing Gabi not just
  thinking like as if she is a soldier is great lol, and yeah, it's fairly
  exciting all around. Not the talking, the action. The action is good haha cya
  guys next week for more.

    Wait, so if Nishikata loses he fans you? Where's the loss? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this
    new episode (#TakagiSanS303) we have more teasing tales to talk about, even
    though at this point who knows if any of them are winning or losing.
    <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Let's talk about them all. Firstly, about fighting off the October
    heat. Yep, when summer refuses to leave even after you changed out to your
    winter uniform... it's terrible. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (I don't have this problem btw
    it's summer here all year so we only have one set of uniforms) Takagi be
    talking about how hot the weather is in class because we are at a timeline
    where aircons in classrooms aren't a thing yet (lol I did experience that in
    high school, and it was GREAT haha) (no it was cold I had to wear a jacket),
    and Nishikata brought his weapon to class:
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/uchiwa" target="_blank">a handheld fan</a
    >. Seeing Nishikata enjoy himself chilling in class, Takagi can't help but
    make sure she gets in the cooling down WITHOUT having to hold the fan to do
    so. And thus, it became a showdown. So yeah, "move the eraser using the
    fan". <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Bruh. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> One could've just scooped it and it would
    have counted. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> He is an idiot, this Nishikata. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But
    seriously, life is unfair, he gets to fan a girl. Life really is unfair.
    <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, he didn't win of course for he thought he had to fan an
    eraser which has such high traction on the wooden table surface for you
    Physics fans out there lol, but yeah, thank goodness I realized this faster
    than him- Well anyone would've. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So Takagi got some chill from him
    doing the attempt, and then won so she got it again... I'm just speechless
    at this point. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next up, when you see me swing my arm like a sword
    don't mind me because I am releasing my
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach" target="_blank"
      >Zanpakuto</a
    >
    lmao (no really, stop asking why I do that every night haha), you know I'm
    as cool as Nishikata who thought being cool in baseball from a manga he read
    must be the best pitch (get it?) ever to Takagi to let her make fun of him
    again, but yeah, she sure did. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> What a surprise, huh. And yeah,
    asking Takagi to keep a secret about this isn't hard considering she likes
    him lmao, but you know, she had to make a showdown out of this to humiliate
    him more. Or get him to do cool poses again, if that is what you wanted
    Takagi-san. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, I see what you are doing here. Anyways, Hitting a
    ping pong ball with a broom shouldn't be hard, so I guess the whole school
    knows of it now, if "the whole school" refers to Nishikata's fanclub which
    only has one member in it. Don't guess who. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ignoring the not stuck
    cat haha yes stuck Yukari-chan too lol that was lame, we talk about another
    part in this erratic weather season: rain. So last part, and I like how this
    is the wholesome part of the episode, is sharing umbrellas again. But with a
    different twist, it seems. Nishikata did forget to bring his umbrella this
    time, so he rushed to the lost and found after class to borrow one I didn't
    know you can do that I normally just run to the bus stop haha (or wait for
    them to build sheltered walkways our local government is very good at
    wasting our tax money), and went home happily to catch up on the special
    episode of animation he was looking forward to all day I suppose. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>
    SOMEBODY MAKE A JOKE! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, halfway through his journey home did
    he express concern to her buddy in class and it's not Takao or Kimura haha
    it's Takagi, about her umbrella status, considering he rushed out and didn't
    bother to ask earlier. So yeah, nice guy Nishikata strikes again to walk
    back all the way to school to ask Takagi, who is just in class doing her
    homework until the rain stops... sometime in the future lol. Nishikata
    manned up to ask if she wants to share the umbrella you're welcome haha, and
    who would say no? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We don't know who won, but somebody won. <span title="*smiles*">😊</span>
    All in all, I love how now every episode's last scene is always wholesome.
    Thanks, Anime; It makes this season's episodes so much more memorable now.
    Above that too, imagining scenes are happening more often than ever which
    isn't bad the cheerleader girls aren't that bad tbh hehe, we are seeing
    things happen between the two, and I must say, we have never been closer to
    seeing them together than ever before, and I like that tbh hehe Takagi is
    going to be so happy when that day happens whatever it is lmao

    But seriously, which is worse: wetting your pants because you dreamt of a
    hina doll, or Kitagawa? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Excuse me, Shizuku-tan. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this
    new episode where I think the porno game has gotten to him this Gojou
    (#KiseKoi03), shoutout to Anime "<a

      >Kazuya</a
    >&nbsp;alone haha I found your friend lmao, because looks like someone
    wetted himself thinking of Kitagawa cosplaying as Shizuku-tan! <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Is
    it a mistake to watch this series? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Firstly, we talk about not Gojou
    wetting himself we know he's a normal high school boy already haha but man
    what did you do to him dear Kitagawa, we talk about their image in school,
    and why, probably, Kitagawa should not associate herself with him too much.
    Because honestly, besides the fact that Gojou is uncomfortable with having
    friends considering he doesn't have any till date lol same, the eyes around
    them are also making it worse because we know Kitagawa is popular in school
    and... well I won't say the dude isn't suitable, but she did reject that
    other guy in the salon so who cares right? Being a
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gal</a> is only in
    image only, one doesn't have to behave like one. But seriously Kitagawa I
    still gotta survive three years in high school so we can keep our distance
    for now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, as one would expect since the first episode,
    this is going to be the girl talking about what's wrong with being friends
    just because everyone else doesn't know what's up... or can't know what's up
    haha, might be better to communicate whatever cosplay or eroge stuff outside
    of school... or maybe not because you can't discuss the plot of "Slippery
    Girls" out on the streets, seriously. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on, Kitagawa did end
    up finding Gojou out who is actively trying to hide from her just because,
    and dragged him to do shopping with her because good chances she gonna be
    wasting her savings in the worst way possible so thanks Gojou for helping to
    make the right choices. From clothing to wigs to... stockings haha, seems
    like Gojou really knows a whole lot more than the actual prospective
    cosplayer who just seems to enjoy the fact that she is just <i>doing</i> the
    cosplay. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah hey, enako-san wishes she has an assistant that happens
    to be her boyfriend or something. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Moving forward haha, and yes the
    best part is really when they had to buy not underwear but it's close
    enough, that is probably what this series is about so don't be shy Gojou but
    I hope your pants are washed up. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay Kitagawa I like how you are
    teasing all of us including Gojou here but this is NOT&nbsp;<a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san"
      target="_blank"
      >the right Anime</a
    >
    for it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, they had a great time shopping for the stuff they
    need, I guess Kitagawa had to treat him to dinner thanking him for doing all
    the work because seriously this girl knows close to nothing haha, but
    hearing them at the end talking about stuff they like... I'm not with you on
    this Gojou? Because I hardly ever say "beautiful" in front of... anything
    haha because I look at my phone wallpaper and <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> so yeah associate me
    with hina doll faces Kitagawa. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, in case this isn't good enough
    of a warning, it's when he says the word at the right time that'll make the
    difference, so I'll look forward to that. All in all, we are halfway there
    already making that Shizuku-tan outfit so that's cool, but looks like we
    have a timeline (<span title="*ugh*">🙄</span> project timeline lol) to follow to and I'm surprised
    why Kitagawa never mentioned it before but she did do the shopping as soon
    as possible, but still. As I have learnt and maybe you should try to watch
    the web series special without Aniplex region blocking you, according to the
    expert which they asked to help out, she talked about a timeline for
    Shizuku-tan's outfit to be done in a month, so four weeks. Twice the amount
    of time needed. And she's a professional. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Good luck there, Gojou.
    <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We shall see how bad this end up, isn't it? Hard to say for this
    series now, we probably can get bed scenes without even thinking about it
    haha but it can't be as worse as Kitagawa's initial attempt at cutting loose
    cloth so I'll look forward too all of those haha

    [TL:DR; "It's important to have things you refuse to compromise on" Great
    life advice in general, like character? We almost just forget about those
    things sometimes. And always forget if it's with regards to work. No really,
    wake up sheeple.]

    This week's releases aren't a lot, but they are enough to talk about because
    they are good in my opinion. Let's talk about what they are good in.

    for Anime "Attack on Titan" is fine, I liked the theme song and have no
    choice but to give the ending anyways lol but still, it's a pretty good
    song. Didn't bother with the B-side though.

    >
    is just some nostalgic style songs if you don't mind, I did almost give one
    of the B-sides but I didn't, so the topic song is good enough for me for
    now. I also honoured my own promise to go back to review artists I've liked
    last year so last on the list, I listened to
    <b

    and picked up a couple of songs. As expected I got real addicted to those
    songs really fast haha they seem to have some appeal I can't get over with
    lol which is good tbh<br />
    <br />
    For news concerning the music and it's on Twitter haha trust me I'm getting
    bored of this paragraph intro,
    <b>Aimer's new music video</b> is a new version of one of her not new songs
    for the upcoming B-side album but I'm not touching that for now and I'll
    talk about that in the next paragraph, Ikimonogakari's vocalist

    see the appeal in this yet,

    for Anime "Date or Alive IV" which is ironic because they normally have

    is just them singing songs I don't know so I didn't miss much watching live
    even though I did half of it and their archive of self-covers probably got
    me better with emotional tunes so be sure to check those out instead haha,

    is definitely something I will have to think about. Which to listen first
    may just determine how many songs I can give for either of them, to be
    honest, so I'll be sure to think about that when it's out by then. I'm not
    sure if I'll be picking up Aimer's B-side collection album to listen
    considering we just listened to a single not long ago so this will be at my
    discretion.

    YEAH I BOUGHT MARINKA'S TOUR GOODS WHAT OF IT <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, I think we
    have a clearer picture of what is up for my birthday which will only appear
    in March so don't be too surprised about that, but yeah, I said to go
    digital this year but turns out I think I've only gone "more" digital but
    not completely, so that's what we'll deal with for now. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Might not
    be doing a showdown for photobooks this year though, I feel like comparing
    my beloved Ede-chan to half-naked Lynn-san sounds <i>really</i> unfair you
    know I don't like short hair. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cya guys soon then, and until next
    time... one more week to another holiday stretch, so I gotta cheer myself up
    for it I guess. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> You all too ganbare~ Haha I'm just trying to be
    motivated here I mean just look at

  P.S. Shoutout to ma bro here (the one I always mention of course, I only have
  the one haha) for last night where someone else talked about ma bro and his
  buds opening Pokémon Trading Cards being "not normal" (same person mentioned
  in the intro of this post) and pointed out that I am normal, and I shook my
  head and replied "no I'm not", and ma bro laughed with me for a solid half a
  minute. Thanks, bro, it was great cover not having to explain my obsession
  into giving Japan voice actresses my money which would be hard to tbh people
  have no idea what it means to simp on bromides haha <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>
