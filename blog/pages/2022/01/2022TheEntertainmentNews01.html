Hey, happy new year everyone! I guess I have to do this again in another month
because of the lunar calendar but, uh, we'll worry about that then haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Enjoying the last of my long break from work to be honest, because I don't
  think I will be taking breaks anytime soon... which sounds like a bad idea,
  but oh well. It's either that or I quit- Anyways haha, I've thought of what I
  should do on these breaks between Anime seasons and instead of reading Manga
  which I don't bother to now, I have a better suggestion: watching Anime
  movies. Yeah, those ones that were good and I should give them chance but have
  held back doing so mainly because I didn't get to sit in the cinema... or have
  a Netflix account lol, to watch then. So yeah, I just hope it's good haha ah
  hey just don't give me that "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/36098/Kimi_no_Suizou_wo_Tabetai"
    target="_blank"
    >KimiSui</a
  >" ending that one was total bull faeces-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, let's do this! This is going to be uh, hugely dependent on how good
  the one movie is haha but if you can't get enough with the lack of content
  from this post you can always go back to the Klassic Note Song Awards post
  from last year and the Christmas special before that to get your fill lol.
  Okay let's start.

    You heard the intro song? Yep, turn up the volume, that's in English by the
    way. And yes also, this is in

    In this movie I've waited for the Blu-Ray release to watch just because and
    forgot about it for half a year lol (#JoseeTora), since it's the Year of the
    Tiger I thought I should start the year with some animation involving a
    society full of tigers...? Ah hey, this is not just "Toradora!", okay?
    <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, let me summarize this movie in one sentence:
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <b></b>
  <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
    <b
      >"Ask yourself this if you haven't already: What have you given up so far

  This, is what I got from this story that made me cry. And I promise you, it
  has nothing to do with understanding disability, so hear me out. Story goes
  that Tsuneo is a dude living his life to the fullest, doing crazy amount of
  part-time jobs and studying and aiming to study overseas at some point. So
  yeah, your typical college student in debt lol. Well, not in debt, just we
  know, overseas scholarships aren't your sugar daddy so you gotta work for it.
  What he is really working for, we will know in a bit. But then in his life,
  some girl flew into her life (literally) who referred to herself as Josee
  (tis' in Spanish) and told him to not walk into the place where she and her
  grandmother lived. Quite a b*tch I would even say, as her harsh tongue did not
  stop her from further shunning away this unexpected guest who saved her life.
  Like really, is this what you do so people who saved you? Not even thanks?
  Okay, brat. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on, the grandmother thought it would be a good
  idea to help Tsuneo on his journey to saving enough money to study overseas so
  she offered him a job opportunity: to take care of Josee, her granddaughter.
  Yep, you heard that right, his buddy at the diving school is already pissed
  but, he gets to take care of a woman. On a wheelchair. Well, by taking care
  also means you have to hear her every order, which kind of got to him within a
  month real quick, making all of us believe that this girl is nothing but a
  piece of sh*t within. That, we quickly found out that it is not so. Being with
  her granny for years and losing her parents from the start, it's not
  surprising to see Kumiko, which I will refer to her actual name now, being so
  pessimistic with life and literally only hyped by the daily walk she gets to
  do with the granny who is of course,
  <strike>not in a capacity to take her out because mahjong</strike>&nbsp;(lol)
  is afraid of all the "tigers" out there who can harm a weak person pushing on
  a weak person. One day though, Kumiko made herself scarce, which made her only
  guardian panic and thus Tsuneo helped to find her, but is surprised to learn
  of her desire for wanting to see the ocean.&nbsp;
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Must be nice to be you, going to places you like."
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  And soon we sink in (literally) into a world of differences between Kumiko who
  dreams of going into the sea and Tsuneo, who has literally went on dozens of
  diving trips just because. Kudos to her walking out of her comfort zone
  though, because really the MVP be that lady on the street who showed that guy
  what's up, easily summarizing what it means to not be afraid of "tigers"
  walking on the streets. Overcoming that, this opened Kumiko up to so much more
  possibilities that would otherwise be impossible just because, and with the
  grandmother's afternoon naps the two sneaked out to visit the world around
  them together. Please, we call those "dates" haha hey nice rack Mai-chan you
  may have known Tsuneo to the core but they went out together to eat crepes so
  <span class="emoji" title="*dabs*">😎</span> Haha oh well, your experience may vary, as they say. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Kumiko's
  life has changed so much, even the grandmother and&nbsp; the social worker who
  has persuaded them to let the girl start living by her own and get a job, be
  more than surprised on how much leaving the house is doing for her. Hope,
  guys, in case you have no idea what that is called in your life when you walk
  out of the house with no one stopping you, as you would every single day. They
  went to eat crepes, they went to buy art stuff so she can draw, and they went
  to the library. So this is likely the inspiration for this story, where Kumiko
  finds continuations to the book she liked which also got the librarian
  interested, making them friends and also letting Tsuneo know where her pet
  name came from, for Josee is a character in the book. Kumiko also experienced
  a lot more than these though, but I think I'm not going to cover all of them,
  for we will see them later anyways, involving the kids in the library who like
  to be read to and Tsuneo's co-workers at the diving school. No really gran,
  when your granddaughter starts to have to spend time to dress up before
  leaving the house.... <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "He called you Josee, how wonderful!" Haha Kumiko you walked RIGHT into your
    own trap lmao <span class="emoji" title="*wink*">😉</span>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  And... we reached the climax of the story. There's good news and there's bad
  news. Good news is, Tsuneo is finally reaching out for his dreams of studying
  overseas. What is not known though, is that he applied to study in Mexico
  specifically to go diving there and see one of those fishes he has admired as
  a kid, the one he gave as a lighting plaque or something to Kumiko, however he
  did not tell her of his plans in the future. Bad news is, someone's
  grandmother passed away. Man, how? Then again, it is story progression, she
  has done her job tbh, and man I can't believe even now that this had way more
  impact to the story than ever, because imagine if Kumiko didn't have to
  <strike>think on her own two feet</strike> think by herself, with her life now
  alone and with social workers barking up her alley every other day. Yeah,
  think about it. With that though came more problems, as Tsuneo's friends
  literally came in at the wrong time asking Kumiko to let him off? Come on,
  Mai-chan, stop adding fuel to the fire. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> As we will learn soon though,
  but that is also where the girl learnt of Tsuneo's plans to study overseas in
  half a year but also, and I really won't say this unless I'm a b*tch from
  those Taiwanese dramas, but I promise you this is the last time I'll talk
  about discrimination related to disability specifically here, that the idea of
  Tsuneo may be doing sympathy for Kumiko because of her being on a wheelchair.
  I mean, we know that's not true and Mai-chan pretty much turned from cute to
  being evil already so there's that, but that is probably what flipped Kumiko.
  As she attempts to go to the sea again with Tsuneo, she let this be the time
  they say farewell in an attempt to free him I guess is the point, and here is
  where she might have made a misstep. What happened afterwards was as regretful
  as it would have been accidental, but it is also at this time to know why we
  have attachments in our lives. Because, just because, you can't just let them
  go.
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "I no longer want to reach out to anything!"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  I really thought they'll make it real bad, but let's just say Tsuneo is fine
  besides a serious fracture of his right leg which is bad enough because as he
  described to his professor who suggested someone else go to Mexico in his
  place also how dare you, is that he will not be able to see his beloved fish
  underwater no more. Well, that is not worst case scenario as we have learnt
  later, but it's hard to imagine how such an incident would not have you think
  like our other disabled friend here. So yeah, I'm not going to attempt to
  experience that because not having freedom of your two legs really suck I know
  for a fact so I cross roads properly lol, but yeah, you can imagine how much
  Kumiko is lamenting herself for this incident, and how much Tsuneo wants to
  kill himself at this point. Interestingly, with the egging from Mai-chan again
  and technically she did it first, she confessed to temporarily disabled Tsuneo
  just because. Once again, proving that things you want to do are just such a
  hand's reach away. Just like how the dude decided to go overseas to study and
  see his favourite fish, and how Kumiko at some point thought of being an
  artist despite only impressing kids at the library at this point lol. But
  because of love I guess, Kumiko did not want to see Tsuneo lose all his hope
  in life, and decided to help him out. Very discrete though, I would say, as
  much as a brat would be to express her feelings for the dude. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "With the wings of your heart, you can go anywhere!"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  As Tsuneo was starting to recover from physiotherapy and his buddy getting him
  out of the hospital intentionally, they were brought to the library, where
  Kumiko is there this time around, to read a story for all to remember. I'm
  just going to summarize, but it's pretty much the story we have here, but
  since it's a kid's story they had to make things up by making Kumiko the
  mermaid and Tsuneo that angel who saved her time and again haha ah hey.
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> It's similar in premise, things happened, however the dude in the
  story Kumiko wrote did not give up and went for his goals eventually, which
  probably is what is required to his Tsuneo to complete his recovery and reach
  for his goals once again. Hey, not giving up on the stuff you like and want to
  do is important, in case you do not know. Doesn't even matter if it's the one
  audience who liked it lol that kid who stayed by Kumiko, but yeah, look at
  this blog and you'll get what I mean. <span class="emoji" title="*sob*">😢</span> Haha okay let's move on I'm just
  wiping tears at this point. Eventually, Tsuneo did make the trip to Mexico to
  study hehe here's the plot twist there was enough time for him to recover
  lmao, but more than that, he learnt of who brought him to where he is today
  despite the endless cycle of being saved and saving that specific someone who
  is Josee. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So yeah, you can see the final romance parts yourself,
  it's just a confession before they actually say goodbye. Also, Kumiko is older
  than Tsuneo though? Haha okay by a couple of years probably but who cares

  All in all, I loved the story. It was definitely a roller-coaster ride though,
  maybe too much of one there were so much to talk about I can't even as you can
  see from the previous paragraphs, but suffice it to say that it was a good
  one. It's like if I am a thrill seeker and had to rate one of those rides in
  the theme park, the good ones, I'll say they are good, even if I'm not a fan
  of those. This is a good emotional love story with a twist which is just
  someone on a wheelchair but who cares, which you would then realize that can
  break down many barriers which will justify the storytelling here, but that's
  the whole point: It takes someone without a cell phone to let them see the
  world out there. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay just joking, but it's always feels like this,
  and I promise you that is not the case. What is the case though, is how much
  they made the happy and sad times real good, from the couple going out on
  afternoons even if it's 2 hours and seeing the people around them, to how they
  pulled each other up despite what the other might think otherwise, but if not
  for <strike>that part-time paycheck</strike>
  <strike>disability</strike>&nbsp;their love
  <strike>for fishes and the ocean</strike> for each other they would not have
  done it together. Okay, I promise last time joking about this stuff, but you
  get the idea, it's just a catalyst for making such a love story more wholesome
  then you can imagine. And I did not regret giving this a watch, and you should
  too. I don't know if Eve singing the theme songs will make you like this even
  more, but I think it worked for me. Now I can only be Tsuneo's friend Hayato
  and dream of dating fishes or something because no one landed on me yet.
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, maybe it's because I didn't do part-time jobs? Damn, I missed
  out haha if this what you get I would like to babysit a wheelchair bound girl
  around my age who hates my guts lmao you're welcome Tsuneo I described your
  girl perfectly
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Lest did I not tell you that the best part about this movie was every
  single time

  New year, new songs they say, but ironically I tried to find songs from
  previous years to listen, but not all defined the new year as much as I
  wanted. But then again the Song Awards just happened and we used to have a
  larger break from music every year so... Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  <b>Kuso Iinkai's new album</b> is nowhere to be seen on streaming platforms,

  electronic-heavy tunes haha ah hey<br />

  another Anime theme song by the way), before we transition into
  <b>Amamiya Sora's best albums</b>&nbsp;(yes, there are two) which I don't
  think will make much difference because I've heard of the new song previews
  and I'm not impressed and I honestly don't think there will be songs I can
  give from this solo idol singer. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> And if all this fails I'll continue
  on my new year journeys into some artists I've been intending on exploring
  including No Buses, Kitri and Sisters In The Velvet. We shall see.<br />

  <br />Damn, what a way to end this week of break. I can't exactly tell you
  some of them lol it involved playing porno games lmao yep that's a thing, but
  as I see the new calendar coming my way hopefully next week and yes we will do
  a review of that don't you worry, we are transitioning away slowly from
  arguably best girl of 2021, Minase Inori. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> No really, she got me into
  poster hunting this year. You see the one poster hung in my room? Still there.
  Not the fanclub subscription though. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cya guys next week then, and
  hopefully until then I'll hang up a new calendar that is... did I mention who
  it is? You all forgot? Okay then you can find out next week haha

  P.S. No really, do you know there's a survivor game where you can harvest raw
  materials to build your own house AND have sex with girls on the island? You
  have no idea lol (PM me on Twitter if you want to know the name lmao
  <i>it's "AI x Shoujo"</i> ok I'm bailing haha)
