To whoever got the last free gift of the latest issue of "Ganbare Douki-chan"
screw you for making me sad now haha but honestly speaking I could've just done
this DAYS AGO where the listing for the gift was still there.

  I just can't speak for my own mistakes now it wouldn't have made a
  difference... yesterday was worse considering I went to the wrong location for
  that physical fitness test and they still let me in...
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    On the upside!! Haha we found more Klassic Note Reviews we can do apart from
    Ryokuoushoku Shakai because of the album this week, since apparently I
    missed Ten-chan's too so maybe this will end up becoming my birthday package
    instead I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> With Douki-chan, huh. Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>

      </blockquote>
      Is it really Zeke's fault if he doesn't scream just because there's a kid
      involved in this? I mean... right?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where
      apparently we have moral decisions to think of in war haha I know right
      (#AttackOnTitan78), Zeke just screamed. Yeah. He didn't hesitate. Maybe
      for a moment, but no, he did it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> THIS IS WAR BABY!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay
      jokes aside, let's story. Story goes we are still in war, someone shot
      Zeke close to the nape I guess but didn't okay Magath I don't want to
      point fingers but you could've done better as Commander lmao, and the
      Beast Titan fell to the ground. And as expected, Zeke screamed and turned
      all his Eldian enemies despite being an Eldian, into Titans. But not
      without any resistance. Colt, who is, if you need a reminder and they did
      do that, Galliard's brother who shielded him to become a Titan, brought in
      Falco and shouted at the one Titan to not do it just because... one
      shouldn't drag kids into this? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like really Colt, you make of a
      great comedian haha. It's war; who cares what happens to the innocent
      people involved. (But seriously don't quote me on that, I may go to the
      international court for this lmao) And so Zeke did it, the madman or mad
      Titan whichever you prefer, and everyone instantly turned into Titans.
      Colt did mention about having a range on this though, but as we have seen,
      it's as far as his voice can go, so shoutout to Pyxis enjoying that wine
      spiked with Zeke's spinal fluid haha hey ask any alcoholic if
      <em>that</em> is how they want to go. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Falco went for Reiner who is
      just struggling to juggle between letting Eren go and not be bitten by
      Titan Falco or vice versa but after a second shot is aimed at Zeke once
      again making sure his Titan form is beyond saving but STILL not managing
      to hit him in person and getting ambushed by Armin's team, Eren just took
      this chance to run away from Reiner even if it means abandoning his
      current Titan form which is pretty beat up to be honest. Yeah. And before
      you can think of what happens to Gabi at this point and how she can be
      here with a horse at her age lmao, I just keep forgetting she is like a
      superweapon in this series ever since they introduced her at the start of
      this eh... season thing so from last year haha. So yeah, Gabi also had a
      madman move, and aimed right at human Eren as he was seen running towards
      Zeke because how else you gonna inherit his power. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah,
      many things happened, it's pretty chaotic to be honest it might be the
      most chaos we have seen ever just stacking upon each other, between Eren's
      severed head and Zeke's upper torso to what looks like Gabi being shot so
      RIP her first, we switch to the Paths again, as we have seen a couple of
      episodes ago. I will not talk too much about the jebait Eren just received
      from his brother, but we did learn a lot more from Zeke just sitting there
      waiting for his brother to recover. Firstly, the Paths alternate world
      they are in. Only people with royal blood and I assume thode who possess
      Titan powers can be here, along with, surprise surprise, it's Titan
      Founder Ymir herself. Why is that so? Because this is the origin of power,
      so Ymir basically can heal all Titans or even make Titan powers in here,
      for she is the creator. Secondly, what Ymir can do. Apart from creating
      Titan stuff, she apparently can't speak, and is only here to obey everyone
      else in this world, so anyone with royal blood. But what does that matter
      though? This will bring us to the last point, which was Zeke's plan to
      test Eren out. Maybe he knew too, right? Like, from the flashback where
      Eren intentionally missed the catch of a baseball from Zeke signalling
      their partnership, Zeke probably knew to test Eren out till the final
      stages, and Eren did squeal since he thought he had total control. By
      telling him what Zeke knows which is wrong, Zeke himself was able to tell
      Eren he is the Founding Titan, but in reality, anyone can command Ymir
      (sex too? SWEET haha I'm not pedo) (lol) to do anything, including, that's
      right, making him those chains which he proclaims will lock him down.
      Which should've made you wonder but I didn't, why that wasn't there when
      he time healed after dealing with Levi previously. So yeah, I hope you
      figured out earlier than me because I'm just here for the ride, but
      suffice it to say, these two have to fight it out now. All in all, it
      looks like whatever happened after that one moment will drastically change
      as soon as we get done with this world's... whatever flashbacks or
      conflict we are getting now haha. Don't ask me why Zeke is testing stuff
      out, but he did have a lot of time to wait for Eren to recover it seems,
      so it's up to them now. Literally. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, we shall see how this
      goes. Very interesting lore so far, and I can see the hype now. Goddamn,
      this might end way better than I would imagine hehe cya guys next week for
      more lore because it's about time we spent even more time talking about
      that after this bloodshed lol
    </div>

      [TL:DR; How to deceive your brother within 2 minutes lmao ah hey gotta say
      Zeke is a master of manipulation in this series]

      series in a nutshell haha but hey, if we started with this it wouldn't
      have been fun, wouldn't it?

    <div>
      P.P.S. "I wish I could shake your hand, but it's best we don't make direct
      contact yet" Pandemic joke haha but of course, Titan-powered Eldians
      making physical contact means ability to share memories so we can't let
      known Eren's love for Mikasa and Zeke's masturbation habits lol what<br />

        </div>
      </blockquote>
      DO YOU THINK, <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nishikata, that your girl will forget ANYTHING you
      two talked about at any point? Like, seriously, asking for a friend.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I'm friends with Takagi-san lmao
      (#TakagiSanS304), even kids know how to pretend to get sick when new video
      games come out and I don't even fully utilize my sick leave. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah
      hey, I'm an honest person, what can I say? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> So, story. We have a
      lot more kick going on with Takagi apparently lol even if the weather got
      cold, so let's talk about changing uniforms. As you may have known, the
      weather's gotten cold in Japan and if I wasn't wrong I saw reports of
      snowing again in recent weeks from our dear voice actresses living there
      lol, but yeah, due to shifting season weathers schools are required to
      have two uniforms, one for summer which has shorter sleeves and is cooler,
      and a winter outfit which has thicker material and is longer sleeved. Oh,
      my (technically) middle school outfit is some cyan coloured pyjamas, no
      joke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, apart from Takagi guessing when she would change
      out to the winter uniform along with Nishikata lol she could've just asked
      and still win this showdown, but instead she agreed on Nishikata's duel
      which is saying the word "cold", in any phrase or form because this is
      Hiragana and more flexible than Latin alphabet, we can make those word
      puns we all love and hate haha. I can't explain it better what the boy did
      to the girl lmao that sounds wrong, but yeah, no pay-outs in betting
      Nishikata lost haha, especially when your pay-out is some direct skin to
      skin contact with a middle schooler- Let's move on, shall we? This Anime
      is making me noticeable by the police. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And don't ask why Sanae
      should mind Mina-chan's message not going through telling her to change
      out to winter uniform when they themselves didn't do it too lol I'm
      getting this right, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next up, lunch time. I mean, there's the
      canteen which is normally where we go we aren't allowed to hang out in our
      classrooms during lunch break, so yeah, it's waaaay harder to find a seat
      alone considering I can't hide myself from the crowd eating at the
      rooftops. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Anyways haha, Takagi probably noticed Nishikata and his
      buddies are all MIA just because (lmao I like how Takao is just pretending
      to be sick btw) (and isn't Sakurai eating with his girl why would he eat
      with you losers-), and surprise surprise, she found him eating alone. They
      had a showdown Nishikata could easily lose to only when he noticed he lost
      lol that impulse meta needs to stop bro, but best thing is he thought he's
      going to get an even bigger penalty... somewhere along the lines of
      getting fed by a female classmate. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> You see, when it's just the
      two of them eating lunch alone like this, the problem is... there's no
      competition. No rivalry. No one stopping them. No one snooping by at the
      bottom of the stairs. Yeah. It sucks. Just wholesome teasing from Takagi.
      It's almost too unfair. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, we have a UFO sighting. From Takao,
      of all people. It's fake, of all truths. Hey, when we have paranormal
      expert Sanae on the task, it's easy to just remember such things than to
      approach those guys who just like to do stupid things without being
      noticed lol I feel you on a very personal level Takao. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Nishikata
      thought it'll be cool to also replicate the image taken but he should've
      learnt how to use an expert camera app to take shots with a lower frame
      rate haha, but yeah, Takagi sure saw something that changed her mind, even
      the guy thought she was joking. No, like, bruh. You said she won't lie.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (It's probably like, a remote controlled thing, but who knows
      man, it's Anime lmao) Last but not least, we go to the bath. With Takagi
      asking when Nishikata is going to the bath because the one at his place
      broke and why don't just ask when can he go to her place to use their bath
      lmao, the guy was of course expecting her to appear somewhere sometime...
      but not like it's that important anyways no one made a promise at the
      entrance she might just be stalking inside the mens' bath all this time
      haha ah hey. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They had the after bath drinks together as Takagi
      calculated lol this girl's a genius by backtracking, and Nishikata took
      his revenge thinking playing an embarrassment match would work in the dark
      without seeing each other's red af faces until you stand really close to
      each other- Takagi-san I feel like we have been teased all along, you ever
      thought about that? What's more than that is Nishikata even brought in the
      offer of sending her home and I don't know why you don't just do it and
      let her run away anyways, 'cos this showdown would've been concluded so
      nicely, I'll just die of embarrassment myself. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, great
      episode as usual and I love how they can continue to deliver such
      consistent wholesomeness without even telling us anything about it, I can
      never thank them enough. And by the way, we are going to get 8 more
      episodes of these, so I really hope you are ready. Like, if your face is
      red now please go see a doctor or therapist before witnessing this marvel
      of an Anime till the end haha excuse me while I book my appointment lmao
      goddamn man Nishikata you lucky dude

      Bro, I don't know if you have been on a full-time job yet but, uh, do you
      know of working overtime? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where accidents do
      happen especially when you found out how it happened lmao (#KiseKoi04), eh
      Kitagawa maybe the best way to help Gojou out now is to make the outfit
      for Shizuku-tan yourself if you want to make it in a fortnight? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Ah hey, gramps is more important in this case though I wonder if this
      grandson will be forgotten if the old man found out about what is
      happening to this dude in school. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> No comment. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I
      wouldn't say this is a premise to anything, but yeah, this episode it's
      about making the schedule... that no one confirmed about. I really thought
      that'll be the signal, like, the gramps hurting his back, that Gojou
      should do something about fulfilling the promise to Kitagawa about making
      the outfit but, uh, let's see how it panned out. Let's first talk about
      the events that happened and are happening along the two weeks Gojou
      thought he needed to finish the cosplay outfit in. Yes, Kitagawa did not
      even bother to stop him I don't know why. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Anyways, we have the
      gramps. I mean, letting your gramps literally trip on what was in your
      shopping bag is quite a stretch (get it, because stockings?), but I would
      say it's rather important in giving Gojou a hint that he would be spending
      days walking in and out and even managing the hina doll house at his own
      at this time with ad hoc appointments happening here and there and his
      tendency to help out the shop... bro THIS is obligation, maintaining that
      shop. Also, exams. Midterms are coming in soon it looks like, and as much
      as Kitagawa hated to study because she's a
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gal</a> what a
      surprise, but as a person I would be worried about how Gojou will be
      juggling between the exams itself AND making that outfit. Ah hey, they
      exchanged contact information, I don't see why any one wouldn't have
      contacted the other for any sort of advice. Like really, I mean, what
      should you do, bro? Why not consult Kitagawa, eh? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> I know right,
      ironically Kitagawa herself also didn't manage to catch a hint on what has
      been happening to this poor dude. Ironically though, it made him stronger.
      Because despite being under stress with exams and making this outfit and
      some dude who wants to see hina dolls and flying back to France in a
      couple of days lol shoutout to that foreigner, Gojou still managed to
      bring himself together and do it in time. And I quote things every episode
      in this series because it's that real, the gramps believed in pushing
      oneself further just because one likes doing what he or she does.
      That's... probably how we can live with work every day haha if that is not
      you quit your job right now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah misunderstandings galore
      when Gojou really found out that Kitagawa was NOT expecting him to finish
      the outfit as soon as possible, since literally she has no idea (about
      everything honestly but specifically) how long it'll take to finish such
      an outfit, is now feeling bad because you know, someone who she met at
      school did everything just for her. I wouldn't say this is powered by love
      but you gotta wonder what has made Gojou going all this while. Haha the
      desire to see Shizuku-tan in person? Maybe but I think it was the boobs.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But also, Kitagawa crying. Because as much as I liked to see it
      in this episode lol, all Gojou wanted is to fulfil her dream to cosplaying
      as that slut. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, have you played the "Slippery Girls"
      series yet? I bet you haven't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She tried the outfit on, we forced
      a gal to cut off her eyebrows lol, and we got our first undressing scene
      in this series lmao okay the last one is just for me. All in all, this
      series continue to deliver not
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> stuff
      which is great tbh haha, and I wished these two would communicate more
      considering your grandfather broke his back because of it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Next
      episode looks great, because really what are boob bags when she already
      has two? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Haha someone please make this joke next week I beg you lol
    </div>
    <div>
      [TL:DR; Best parts of this episode are (1)
      <strike>Suguta Hina</strike> Kitagawa taking off her shirt haha and (2)
      how there's a sound effect of her blowing off her sneeze lmao ah hey this
      is a show airing on national TV we show boobs and censor sneezes lol]

      This week's releases, as mentioned last week is just nothing but females,
      but at least we got some mainstream artists in so that isn't too bad.
      Overall they are good too, a great end to January and a great start to
      this year of Klassic Note, I might add.

      is branded to be a release which features songs you listen to at night,
      but I would argue that check out my special compilation from last year in
      Klassic Note "At Ease" where I promise you all of them are better to
      listen to at night than any of the songs in that album lol. Anyways, I
      picked up the first song in the list which isn't the topic song mainly
      because the melody and cabaret type of mood got me, and the rest really
      didn't have melodies I liked.

      preceded in full album reviews this week mainly because I knew I can give
      the latter more anyways, so yeah, I did give more attention to the songs
      in here, mainly giving the topic song which was just a meh, one new song
      and the last was basically from their single last year which will complete
      that release so we'll review that release real soon.

      is no surprise considering they started their 15th anniversary last year
      with three singles, and their style is safely good Rock music, so not
      giving those is just the new stuff I can find in this Collection Artist,
      so three new songs including the topic song.

      is a conclusion to her novel series released on Twitter these past couple
      of weeks and is a prelude to her upcoming album.<br />
      <br />So next week, we will only have <b>spira spica's new single</b> for
      Anime "KiseKoi" above which the music video already cemented the release
      so we shall see if the B-side will get me so I won't mind the
      Ikimonogakari cover inside this single for some reason. Other than that,
      we will also listen to

      from last year which I did intend to listen but didn't since it was not on
      music subscription services. Hey, not everyone buys their CDs physically
      also it's 2022 I can listen to my music however I want and paying some
      money for it. Ask my friend how much he still leeches off YouTube music
      videos lol and he doesn't want the ads what a jerk haha just pay them the
      2 cents per listen<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Oh you wonder why this post is so haphazard and slack? Well, it's a
      Sunday, and I get to have next week off work so... <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Yeah, that's
      pretty much it. Maybe really made me regret not getting a free gift
      earlier I hate myself so much now I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay! Haha cya
      guys next week, and until then I'll enjoy the new massager my sis bought
      me because I said you can get me that as a birthday gift and I swear it's
      an impulse buy so I gotta use that everyday now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't worry sis,
      I'll make more use of this gift than the Nintendo Switch I gave you years
      ago lol go treat your siblings right haha bye<br />
