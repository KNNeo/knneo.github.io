Hope you enjoyed this week, me. Because next week you won't. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah can I get another week's leave? Haha asking for a friend. <div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, welcome back to the end of Japan's Golden Week, and I hope you   haven't been reading the blog posts for the week as boring as I have tried to   write them because I really don't give a shit now haha, am still thinking of   ideas for Klassic Note's 15th anniversary, just ended up sinking into oldies   so that I can come up with better compilations which I may or may not do now   because work. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, getting lazy already huh, me. Anyways! What I   won't laze on though, is watching Anime! Hey, at least I still got that, eh?   Probably fuelled by "Shikimori-san" this week tbh I saw the thumbnails on   their official Twitter and I can't wait to give the opening theme song single   lol that's how they getcha also because single track release so <span title="*shrugs*">🤷</span> Sorry   Gamers and your 10% off voucher I'll find somewhere else who can give me a   pre-order bonus thanks </div><div><br /></div><div>  Let's start, yes? Let's not try to worry about why the new Klassic Note Review   is still not coming at any point because I did some last minute shopping, and   that one package from last month which is effectively delaying my Takashi Rie   fanclub membership for almost a month already lol I'm like Katai-kun who   missed school haha I'm going to be sooo confused they have nice guys in   Riekou? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> </div><div>  <div>    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoiS206">      <div style="text-align: center;">        <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span         ><span style="font-size: large;">          Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita.

We did it, everyone. They confessed their love for each other.     We are one and done and DON'T YOU DARE RUIN THIS FOR US RIKEKUMA <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>     So, story. Well, essentially, the conditions of love shared by the many who     have participated in Yamamoto's survey of the general public came in to     Yukimura on two conclusions: (1) to love someone is non-deterministic, one     cannot prove to love someone unless they themselves acknowledge that love     from that someone, and (2) that this state of love is still very biased and     heavily based on where one would assume that happens. And so, Himuro decided     to conclude this very experiment we have been going on for a season and a     half (lol) by you know, confessing to the guy she likes. Good news is,     Yukimura also did it, so that's good news. Took him a while to get there     though. Bringing his laptop out, he had to list out what he liked (and not)     about this very woman in front of him so much so as he taught Kanade-chan to     do in order to come to a conclusion that he is in love with arguably (no     proof btw) one of the most attractive     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/waifu" target="_blank">waifu</a> in Anime     history. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Like, we need a threshold on where to stop, bro. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>     Maybe we need to set that up next time so this equation won't go on a     endless while loop, yes? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And as Yukimura has indirectly proven, no     calculation will be able to skew these results such that he can't reach a     conclusion, so Himuro you win, I guess. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> And she made out with him     for a solid minute lmao I can't even <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> It was not considered as a     conclusion though, surprise surprise, I wish this was episode 12 but clearly     the above did not list as such and thanks idiot bear for the reminder lmao,     and I must argue that this isn't even a proper confession- Moving on haha,     the confession may have happened, oh joy for everyone involved apparently     including Kanade-chan and Torasuke who have been cheering on them this whole     time, then realized that their experiments may never end. Even as to prove     that where their love is at is enough for them to do experiments on each     other until they get their Master's degree. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So next up on     "RikeKoi": We prove the conditions of how to have kids! Haha ah hey maybe     prove conditions of marriage proposal first that's gonna be rough Himuro     will do the kneeling, right? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But seriously, the bias is that they     are doing it ON each other. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, gotta say best episode in     this series is already out haha, and looks like we are having some GROUP     DATE next week, so yeah, we shall see how far that can go. It's like we are     the richest people alive or have retired and then what? Haha see you all     again for some more science-proving action for Kanade-chan maybe...?   </div>  <div>    [TL:DR; "They know that they love each other, but they can still continue     their research together. For Himuro-senpai, that's the greatest happiness     ever!" The straight <strike>guy</strike> girl knows haha]   </div>  <div>    <div class="thumbnail">      <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFPLG7cl_FKjC3Dbnk7dtUrGq0Yt3LICnCUfASo12hhVxi-clRXPAvvqIOiMpFPMN8l9ip3jflsJnlbkWD7_l4izap9pnSdMIoauDlx5vA4Uzb00nZgNuCuepsTbzz9GFJlgT7fGhNozV2PIfFp7Q3gkWXLIycgLCrvkPA8036NDUR6qxwz12HX_zi/s320/rikekoiS206_kiss.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                Find someone who loves you like how Himuro loves Yukimura,                 really.               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjT7SXLSHnCE7p4OptK7hd4AicNyx0u05G0XDpoSMXukO_cthC0kdA8kBeNP7vP2ziInTnhS67FjPHyoT5HtLXdOzISJKqUQAgRpw1SGgsemc9KFGgpU8HP_iu0EMOZ2i2E7pAVzmsNjWreC8UT2oJ4M3ixY88dNJDVbLCBH_SMS8q6tnP53QmCWbbQ/s320/rikekoiS206_photo.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                At least smile a bit bro, you taking photos with your girl                 dude<br />(lol)               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>    </div>    P.S. "Why are people so eager to join together organs meant for food     intake?" He meant kissing, by the way haha I would like to agree with you     Yukimura? But I got no proof for it I'm more into hugs which I never got     since I was a kid. <span title="*sob*">😢</span>   </div>  <div>    P.P.S. "There will be no need to conduct more experiments" Woah woah then     what will happen of this series? Isn't this set out to prove love? If it's     proven then what are we to do? They really decided to nail this as a final     season huh haha   </div>  <div>    [Now that I think about it, Himuro is literally stuck where I was as a kid     in that kids drama ensemble. I let my emotions take the better of me as I     play a casting role with a respected female senior who... I guess I may have     harboured feelings with, and I told my mom I want to quit. Himuro wants to     research but lets her emotions get in her way. Hmm... I did leave though so     she did end it alright haha]   </div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEij55GjYSng2RPbfpuEmthlATNnkESwbpcALCxYJ8l88Tr0pTV0ZEisYlEYbDlQhSRiF3dVocYTuKqbzSq5hE_18OAoK5nQ3rcL0496FxLUjIOzRMW-tIu-4fSZCpMtkTm5CXed9cyY6k1tRcH3etxY-2VBKKYBhpVfp0GyrxZ7I6RaVGrIVUi-Coy5/s320/rikekoiS206_rikekuma3.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Hey, ever see a work promote its own work INSIDE of the work               itself?<br />(Haha no shit video game "Wheelman" did it too)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMtwKsGS-3tqPx-xUzzVLuyWxbRGImXPH9Nn1CbRJrMr9iXeUmTpREVfqpptiADq2-ADsst5gl1D2J7Vq93eQnWls1oWFpAW9Qu6avrf9KKSczOt6_1vW3NnkIgiefw6ZZ85eMh2PfgpQO8tYoB4yDYzCElu7J476SN4SfPJKOBlszjx9w-LnYD4zI/s320/rikekoiS206_scratch.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Haha Ibarada is just like a cat, scratching the heck out of her-             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>   <div><br /></div>  <div>    <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AharenSan06">      <div style="text-align: center;">        <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span         ><span style="font-size: large;"> Aharen-san wa Hakarenai</span>      </div>    </blockquote>    <blockquote class="tr_bq">      <div style="text-align: center;">        "You are free to use the pool as you like" Okay besides pissing and         defecation, please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> <span title="*pukes*">🤮</span>       </div>    </blockquote>    WOW OKAY AHAREN-SAN YOU CANNOT SWIM HUH lol I like how we already assume     something's wrong but think she can swim. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where     it feels like "Takagi-san" already just that both of them are terrible at it     haha (#AharenSan06), we find more ways to make fun of the main couple.     <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh, we have new characters too. Trust me, you may not have noticed,     but yeah, we do. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Let's talk about the thousand showdowns that     happened this week though. Firstly, swimming. Turns out Aharen doesn't know     how to swim and not like Raidou is any better, so we have Oshima who can     teach them because seriously why haven't I seen someone with her banging     body swim this well in real life haha <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Next up, table tennis or     ping-pong if you prefer that I just go by what I know when I was in school     so who cares. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Anyways, apparently both of them suck and can resort to     just using gravity to serve and do simple returns so they can play on the     makeshift table for 2 minutes <span title="*pukes*">🤮</span> but yeah turns out Aharen doesn't know     how to play and not like Raidou is any better, so it's no wonder they lost     to the others in class just because they are good enough they make a great     team to play in the Olympics. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really, I MYSELF can take on both     of them. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> And then, we have bowling. Not that I've done the rolling     thing because it really looks stupid, but I guess for beginners that might     be the easiest way to play ever, just... you know, it's technically cheating     haha. Turns out Aharen doesn't know how to bowl well and not like Raidou is     any better, so they just ended up in a draw. How that happened I don't even     know lol. More than that, we have basketball. This time around, Raidou did     win though considering Aharen lost one of her shots, so they decided they     can take on the NBA- Yeah, right. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What is with all these repeated     clichés I can't get around to? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Besides Aharen killing it in the     arcade games department which easily shows how great she is at these to be     honest maybe just play video games with her Raidou, with a toilet trip that     technically Aharen did not go, the guy ended up having a lot of fun(?) with     her till the end. Not until he realized something is up. So introducing the     Hollywood stunt double for Aharen Reina: It's her brother Ren. Yeah,     brother, by the way. All in all, I don't even want to emphasize on why the     brother likes to cross-dress I may like my sister (lol) but I won't want to     wear her clothes (lmao) but hey let's hope that's the last part of greatness     we expect turning out to be just a blessing in disguise.

Welcome to "Kaguya-sama" haha where in this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS305) I     think Fujiwara-sensei is back to, uh, be forced to train Shirogane again?     Now where have I seen that before... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But seriously, who doesn't     want some <strike>Shirogane</strike> Fujiwara rapping, eh? Go go Koko-chan     yo <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, about that new global disaster warning signal for a     tsunami... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ok ok let's talk about the rapping first. Jesus Christ I     can't even. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, recall how Shirogane went out and sang his heart     out at a karaoke room and it killed Hayasaka? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, that. So of     course he wants to be better, only for us to recall how bad he was even at     singing the school anthem, did Kei-chan ask for help from Fujiwara once     again to save, you know, the family members who are alive from this     nightmare- I already assume the dad is dead btw. Like really, imagine if he     ran for mayor and had to rap. That's how bad that gets. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways,     jokes on him because Fujiwara didn't know how to rap too if one would recall     she only did the "DON DA YO" shtick because that's all she knows about     rapping lol, so Shirogane had to teach her... so she can teach him back?     Yeah, you will get it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And so, with that perfection in hand which     hopefully will last for about five days lmao, Shirogane asked Hayasaka out     (the butler, so she had to male disguise herself) in the park where we are     far away from civilization so to, you know, avoid further casualties. Oh,     and did I not mention about how much budget this series at its third season     has right now? If you thought "Aharen-san" had budget, wait till you meet     the Jeff Bezos of romance Anime. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Because what we did get at the end     despite not being as impressive in my opinion compared to the other series     which did nail it, this one came in more than rough which makes me believe     this is probably not 100% canon material, but hey, at least they are     enjoying themselves talking c*ck about each other haha hey that's how we get     Hayasaka to speak bad things about her master. Also, did Fujiwara just     swear? I thought that's a "<a       href="https://myanimelist.net/character/32925/Naruko_Yokoshima"       target="_blank"       >Seitokai Yakuindomo</a     >" thing. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, they had to do this much for me to even be     amazed at how they managed to get everyone in a romance series to do rapping     lol I mean look at the ending song. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Definitely not watching this     part again, that's for sure lmao. And I'm glad this isn't the only thing in     this episode, because Maki-chan is back. You know, that distant cousin of     Kaguya? Yeah, she be back talking about her days with the boy she likes     apparently we didn't know his name     <strike       >because isn't it that one time we had to talk about Shirogane</strike     >    but I guess we do now lol I think my brain just got fried haha, is now     talking about how much she doesn't want the boy to be with her bestie     Nagisa. Yep, we at it again. Now it's real though, we no tsundere action     already. She's certain, that's for sure. Pretty much as certain as the last     time Nagisa wanted her bestie dead. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ironically, she is dealing with     great passion fruit tea and a bunch of idiots who hesitate to confess to     their beloved just because, so blah blah blah Kaguya wins anyways since the     only way anyone would like her is by accident- All in all <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> as I     listen to the ending song, I find this episode really hard to digest. Not     that I don't have the hip-hop in me I listen to rap just not this often in     an Anime season lmao, but yeah, this is as trash as this series gets, to be     honest. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Maybe we tone that down a little bit ok? Just make     Shirogane bad at rapping again, would you?

Turns out, they just had     to NOT pay Tadano and Najimi's voice actors. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode     where Merry Christmas everybody haha oh it's over already huh (#KomiSan17),     and a Happy New Year- No really, in this world these two phrases come back     to back, and so is my work leave. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Anyways, what happened in the fall     of snow after Christmas. Najimi didn't sleep haha that's obvious, and so     didn't Tadano thanks to the childhood friend, and they got Komi-san to play     with the snow together. Ah, such simple times... you don't see this in     "Kaguya-sama" by the way, and that's why this series just wins in these     simple moments. And then, they had a snowball fight with the kids at the     park. Well, not entirely bullying because they placed Komi-san with the kids     as a team and placed Yamai-san on the other, so naturally there will be a     betrayal going on so long as someone is targeting the goddess at any point.     <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah no surprises there Komi-san hates Yamai anyways and did the     final kill to secure the win for the kids. "For the kids", man, that is so     charitable as it is cool even our dear goddess is adopting it now- Moving on     haha, we have a family trip back to old home again. Haha that sounds wrong,     maybe we call it "Yuiko's place" now hehe ah hey there has got to be a past     where Shuuko the mother got loved by the grandmother, so we'll leave it at     that since now that the granddaughter has taken over that role. Ironically     not as much love to Akari-chan haha yeah she's back, as the old woman just     trashed her completely at     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hanafuda" target="_blank">hanafuda</a>    because you know, kids don't know risk and just "<a       href="https://jisho.org/search/koikoi"       target="_blank"       >koi-koi</a     >" and lose everything? Ah hey, maybe she isn't cautious enough, okay? Don't     give my Akari-chan trouble lol I sound like her dad. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (No really,     can I though? Something triggered in me thanks to one Hondo Kaede voicing     this adorable thing) The narrator got paid a lot for being commentator haha,     Akari lost all her     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/otoshidama" target="_blank"       >new year's gift</a     >    budget thanks to playing with the grandma, and Komi-san helped her get it     all back. Hey, beginner's luck rubbing off Komi-san again, what can I say.     <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> And then the new year arrived it's shrine visiting time!! Dude,     why the girls were so hyped for this I'm not too sure, but they sure look     great in     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kimono" target="_blank">kinomo</a> that's     for sure. Oh yeah you too mom haha I'm really sure there is a past where she     was treasured by the elder, trust me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> The crowd opened a way for     the Komi family to walk by lol even in public she has goddess-like powers     suck it "Kannagi" lmao, Komi-san thanked the gods for blessing her with one     Tadano Hitohito hehe, and she had to help do last minute shift work at the     temple because the priest ran out of human help. And I guess this is a good     cut into the Inaka-san character focus episode, so here we are. Like really,     thanks to her not being such a "country b*tch" I don't think this term even     exists lmao, in spite of her being recognized by her classmate she still     helped her out considering this is the first time Komi-san is working...     after the time where she gave out tissues and that was so much easier.     <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, wonderful times to start the year, we all are blessed     especially if you believe in the goddess that is Komi Shouko <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, and     Akari-chan is MVP this episode haha cya guys for more of this tbh I'm     totally enjoying this I don't stop to take notes on what to write here hehe   </div>  <div>    <div class="thumbnail">      <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto;

Ah hey, them     girls have been waiting for this moment, failing their exams and everything     lol that's just like me haha just that I don't go outdoors. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>     Anyways lol, the gang had a wonderful time there; They played at the river     under the hot sun, they had barbeque and ask me when is the last time I did     that lol, and Izumi saved a kid who got taken away by the waves. Wait, what     was that last bit? Haha hey Izumi be a nice guy to save the kid okay, we all     tend to have cramps while swimming this is not just him down on his luck.     Shikimori did jump in to save the day though, and I guess that was the big     reveal, huh. Just the top, huh. Swimsuit, I mean. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> NOW I'm     disappointed haha what was all that hype before, me? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Izumi learnt     from her mom who knows how to cook which will make him of a great husband     lol, I almost forgot about how Shikimori had to go to cooking lessons with     Izumi's mom and that's why that pan of... I don't know how to describe those     haha, should not be consumed without rice I guess, and we were better off     eating dessert. Speaking of that, didn't know about s'mores until this     episode came out so I wonder if anyone sells this in my neighbourhood hehe,     but yeah Shikimori wanted that couple moment- Izumi is such a dork. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>     Gotta say like "I reserved a special one for you" or something, dude- Oh     she's the cool one, I'm sorry. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And as if one dessert isn't enough     because man do I feel the heat in the afternoon in my room too lmao, the     guys went to have some ice cream. And seriously shout out to Izunuka ruining     it for the couple, for I'm pretty sure he pissed Shikimori off by taking     Izumi's portion in whole so much so he might have died and reincarnated...     twice haha chill girl. Really, Izumi, just hand over yours to your buddy and     share Shikimori's with her. Please, we know     <a       href="https://twitter.com/anime_shikimori/status/1523000683762528263?s=20&amp;t=CuE6Qwh3AfRdSHLlQ_yb5g"       target="_blank"       >this episode was trending on Twitter</a     >    because of the saliva-licking action on that chocolate almond. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>     (Haha that's what she said-) All in all... Am I actually disappointed at not     seeing Shikimori in full swimsuit form? AM I, ME???? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, just     slightly. Taking the pants off would've helped solidify this as my favourite     episode of all time. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Thanks Nekozaki and Hachimitsu for the save     though, you guys really turned this episode around. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Everyone's     gotta drool a little too so that's nice for suggestive saliva references on     the ratings or something. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, what ELSE can I not say about this     episode? It's like I'm a goat and the carrot is dangling in front of me. I'm     soooo glad I got to just lick it HAHAHAHA we are only halfway through this I     can't wait for more not dark lore lol please don't I'm enjoying this a lot     so far   </div>  <div>    [TL:DR;

So FYI, they     like to do the thing now where they curb your impatience and increase     engagement and interest for Anime theme songs so basically     <u>they are available first-episode early</u> in digital pre-order and music     streaming now, so I'll link them to prove my point. For     <b>Anime "Komi-san"</b> I already am going to review the opening by     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ao-100-syoku-komi-cant-communicate-opening-theme-ep/1614941059?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Itou Miku</a     >    but the ending by     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/koshaberibiyori/1618155347?i=1618155350&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >FantasticYouth</a     >    is unlikely even now just because I thought it had a good chorus and bad     everything else I feel uncomfortable giving it.     <b>Anime "Shikimori-san"</b> might end up tops just because I'm actually     okay giving a different style of opening song with     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%8B%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC/1615713462?i=1615713463&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >nasuo's new single</a     >    but that might be a problem in itself as the usual Regular Edition itself is     single track so it's as alleviating to give it right away as it's hard to     get that CD with any special gift lol don't ask me how they made me think so     much but. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah yes, and I might just end up listening to     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/route-blue/1615714125?i=1615714126&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >Nakashima Yuki's new song</a     >    after all, as much as I'm not interested in her at the least I'll give the     pop style of the song lol. I don't think I will have problems giving     <b>Anime "RikeKoi"</b> (so     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/love-evidence/1614578941?i=1614578945&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >Amamiya Sora</a     >,     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/bibitto-love/1614579055?i=1614579065&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >CHiCO with HoneyWorks</a     >)<b>, "Aharen-san"</b> (<a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hanarenaikyori/1615742199?i=1615742208&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >TrySail</a     >,     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/distance/1614579005?i=1614579243&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >HakoniwaLily</a     >) and<b> "Kaguya-sama"</b> (<a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/giri-giri-feat-%E3%81%99%E3%81%85/1616853920?i=1616853923&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >Suzuki Masayuki</a     >,     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/heart-ha-oteage/1618069048?i=1618069050&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >Suzuki Airi</a     >    ie. Suzuki Productions lmao) theme songs anyways so that's the least of my     worries haha. So yeah, and most of these will be out within the next few     months, so that's all I'm having at this point, in case you wonder where the     mainstream artists went. Well, next month we will have some albums to talk     about so until then I guess.&nbsp;<br />    <br />    So, we have a lot more news to talk about from Twitter that will concern the     fate of Klassic Note in the following weeks even months because we are     seriously empty with releases and that's a problem haha,     <b       ><a

This and a long line of singles might be     my next batch of reviews, if we are lucky. Oh yeah, and     <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new song</b> also since it was kinda abrupt and we     don't have much to give anyways haha<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Oh yeah, Happy Mother's Day anyways. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, my mom isn't at home     anyways so I guess our family just did takeaways all weekend to celebrate     the occasion. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, the mother likes part-time job paychecks and her     friends so what do you want me to do about it? <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Cya guys next week     then, and until next time, may I talk about the Anime mothers I like to     celebrate Mother's Day with?

Probably going to jinx this but I feel dumb that all the upcoming     packages aren't going to be here at my week break but during work time so I     can have something to look forward to instead which I guess isn't bad? So     yeah, let's just pray hard that all of them arrive despite the rising oil     prices haha ah   </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    P.P.S.
