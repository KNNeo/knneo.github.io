Well, at least this one will pass by smoothly because I can already imagine what my Monday is thanks to work- <div><br /></div><div>  Maybe next time we put a ban to that word, eh? Like, immediately cut me to   another paragraph if I say anything related to work- </div><div><br /></div><div>  Okay maybe I should stop haha the... the newest package is already here so be   sure to enjoy some mediocre content and review until that bomb which is   coming... at some point, will come, yes? <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> Putting that aside, let's talk   about Anime and music it's much more fun than spending money on stuff and   waiting for them to arrive lol seriously though Rieri can we have web sign-ups   for your fanclub next time please <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoiS208">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;">        Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita. Heart</span       >    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "If there is an issue, Kanade should tell (us) directly" Okay Yukimura can       you stop behaving for a scientist just for a minute "She isn't a dense       person like you, Yukimura!" Hey Himuro give him something a something a       lesson, would you?     </div>  </blockquote>  Yeah Himuro you want to break up now? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Come on, we barely started haha   anyways she needs her daily canoodle now Yukimura. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new   episode where were left off thinking if Kanade is still into her teacher good   chances are yes anyways lol (#RikeKoiS208), it looks like we are taking the   brave experimental approach and ignoring the psychological state of our   subjects- Hey, Yukimura, ethics in experimentation, remember? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So   yeah... how should I even start? Um... maybe it isn't just about ethics.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, serious talk though, for this might be one of the more serious   episodes we get out of this series. Thank goodness I already gave the ending   theme song this week lol. Apart from the unnecessary consolation of Torasuke   in his weird 2D girl dating within a group date of real humans lol ah hey he   can be him and Ibarada did just tell him to do research on how many people out   there are like me who likes 2D and 3D girls lmao (okay not true I don't jack   off to 2D-), we should probably focus on the conclusion to what was stopping   the group date experiment from last week: Kanade. Ah hey, it is technically   her fault according to infamous make-girls-cry scientist Yukimura haha thank   goodness that's someone's boyfriend lol, but besides the obvious point where   Himuro is trying her way to getting Kanade-chan to speak her thoughts out   after bailing from the experiment from what seemed to be an emotional   breakdown somehow after seeing her sensei, at least we did settle down with   Yukimura too somehow lol that's the point I guess, to talk about what her   problem is. Turns out, thanks to a complete flashback which I'm surprised we   haven't gotten until now, that Kanade's... crush on her sensei is more than   just teacher-student love, and I'd like to believe the teacher felt that way   too, casually promising her a "date" just because she got better grades.   <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Never thought of that with the teachers I know of so I hope they are   relieved. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, who gives a damn about Rubin's and Kinsey's   scales, with Kanade-love scales it's all about normalcy. And I guess Yukimura   did go too far with the real talk and I feel attacked for some reason, but   Yukimura dude, not that Kanade-chan needs a lesson, but as she said too, not   everyone lived a life with guidance of confidence. Even the stupidity to fling   a man flying her way is a form of confidence. So yeah, quit blabbering your   scientific knowledge and learn to respect others once in a while, yes?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Does that sound like I have character? I feel so empty without the   packages from Japan dropping every few months now. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> All in all, it's   obvious the second half is just a reflection session for Kanade, but I would   argue for her though, that what can she be for change if she wasn't being   guided to be normal? Same with Torasuke and Yamamoto, with Ibarada in the way   somehow. Honestly saying? More interested in the latter haha if that is a   thing that'll make these two secondary characters come together them BRING IT   ON haha don't quote me on that ok I'm just envious Himuro got to cuddle her   boyfriend for a solid minute every day lol I can't even </div><div>  [TL:DR; From "pause the recording" to "watch via streaming again", that is WAY   TOO MANY fourth walls in just this episode alone lol Rikekuma can we stop   doing this] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7paeX1yuEjnupzpthjGOP9hk6WX4eh_nRq2eUoorqZ5s6xo5eerYs4H2KDVGJ2fz9TkkKSdSN3tHqEiFrtLLvJVJWSC7uJZgah7lBgZ4fzm_wrOD_QnQmVwjXwp29JOnAmDQgbmlHyMzBMNmyyFKL-NH2euii0PRFzsHTJtIOMSIGoxge2Wi2630E/s320/rikekoiS208_kanade07.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Okay kid Kanade-chan is uber cute haha             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjucsOh1BT61wJG3uDGWfEjJHMYowWzF11C6MTDlUdFYn_lWGih7A3-YtxFEl_M0PGERQPTbElWqFbFVRVmMhtqzuWNCVqc6ckYlSXE1-w3d9Y4kp7_otAk-RXSiweMmhlgvhDfRpZC1Q2bWWunXxPDJoFwaFznCGs6CX426saXUXdhRKLjI56Qkb-m/s320/rikekoiS208_kanade10.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Teen Kanade-chan is even better no wonder the sensei will go out               with her-             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

NOW you got me interested haha in this new episode   (#AharenSan08) HELL YEAH I love me some Tobaru-sensei PART TWO!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah   hey, I'm the same as her just that she's voiced by Kana-chan and I don't   nosebleed seeing couples do... anything tbh I may not even look at them.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, esteemed action part two I guess. Her friend Miyahara-sensei   (yes the teacher of their class) asked to join her to have lunch at the   rooftops, so you can guess what happened when our main couple decide to also   go to the rooftops to have lunch. TOGETHER. Haha okay Tobaru-sensei I didn't   mean to bleed you out with just one word but <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But apparently this time   around, the sensei was fully prepared to embrace what is about to happen as   she has already practiced imagining all the stuff that will trigger her blood   rush lol. It's like taking the vaccine but psychologically. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Sadly,   she can never predict what will be happening, from Oshiro appearing on top of   them hiding on the roof above the staircase floor, to sitting far away from   them because she is scared to sit close to Aharen, and oh&nbsp;yeah the long   chopsticks- See, it was ME who was prepared for these, not you Momo-chan.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What we did NOT predict though, was Tobaru-sensei going through a   rollercoaster of emotions and how she is dealing with them, from nosebleed to   choking on her lunch to needing plastic bags and oxygen...? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, she   has a problem. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Just use like, half of your brain capacity and you   would have been saved. That might also make you not eligible to teach students   but it's a good trade-off. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Because really, stop imagining shoujo   manga plots in your dreams Raidou doesn't look that ikemen. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Speaking   of which, it's Miyahara-sensei to the rescue to her literally dying in her   room at home, preparing her some food and cleaning up after seeing her   involved in what I would call a suicidal mission? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Maybe put on some   classical music or something to sleep every night, ok? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And second   half of the part thankfully it's not more Tobaru-sensei lmao PSYCHE haha, it's   the summer festival. Hey, every Anime has to have that, and since we didn't   have bikini episode here maybe fireworks would be enough... as long as Aharen   stops spending all her money on just food and is tall enough to not get lost   OR watch the fireworks in a crowd. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, the problems about being   short, what can I say? Thankfully, we have tall handsome guy Raidou-kun here   (lol) which one Futaba-chan can mistake as her dad haha, and is still scared   of him leaving her at the lost kids counter just because... I mean,   Tobaru-sensei would've bled out at the rest area about thrice. I'm made of   greater material so don't worry. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, thank goodness   Momo-chan-sensei didn't see the most esteemed of greatness between these two   because seriously something made Aharen Reina skip a beat I'm PRETTY SURE   that'll send Tobaru-sensei immediately to the hospital haha, and seriously   Raidou stop thinking everyone here (besides Oshima) is good at anything we   just want to have a good time we can't keep doing   <a     href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san"     target="_blank"     >showdowns</a   >  every time lol </div><div>  [TL:DR; Okay the subtitles can never fix that so I guess I can explain: MVP   you should know, but what Tobaru-sensei is changing is the last character, so   MVA = most valuable&nbsp;<a     href="https://jisho.org/search/aware"     target="_blank"     >aware</a   >&nbsp;as in esteem.

SAME DUDE haha     </div>  </blockquote>  I like Ishigami's enthusiasm for participating in the school festival haha and   of course it's NOT because his senpai is managing the two-day event. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> In   this new episode where someone's bound to break whichever way you are thinking   (#KaguyaSamaS307), oh yeah true narrator Ishigami has seen this before so we   are really focusing on the Miko transformation story here, yes? Haha I love   this episode now it's not exactly the same though. Okay, about the school   festival committee. The two got dragged into it. Or more like, Ishigami   wouldn't even mind considering Tsubame is in this, and Miko is just being   Miko. Which is a problem. As much as we see the stark contrast of Ishigami   showing off his knowledge to fend off all the terrible offense Tsubame's   fanclub members in the committee are throwing at him (nerds, we call them),   Miko is totally trying to defend her own actions despite really just having   her might be a problem because even coming up with a fun slogan will get her   pissed. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But apparently, and I think that's a story for the future   episodes, is that she wants a campfire in the festival. Apparently, with her   reputation and effort getting things sorted out, she kind of made it happen.   Heck, it's already happening, and that's probably how she gets her respect   from others in times like these. Why her insistence in having a campfire   though? We might not know for now. What we do know is Kaguya-sama is lighting   the fire with her superb archery skills which I will not brag in her place or   even the two reporters who just went around basically surveying all the   members in their clubs as we know of. So in a nutshell Tsubame is perfect lol   hey Ishigami I stand by your side, Shirogane is in Astronomy Club for some   reason first time heard of it tbh (Oh yeah so you are into Kaguya-san and I'm   into Shirogane-kun? *DC/Marvel handshake* Haha I can't even), and I like the   card cheating club Fujiwara is in lol. Last but not least though, legit this   is just basically hovering inches above a landmine waiting for gravity changes   to happen lmao, it's Shirogane's effort to... break balloons before he an   sculpt them. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> This time around though, despite all the showing off and   dunking on the guy himself and Fujiwara's impatience in wanting to teach him   considering she is a jack of trades and Shirogane... is the opposite because   Fujiwara can't study for heck lol, she is really trying not to get into the   trap of having to teach this guy with no skills outside of studying even if   that means she has to argue with Kashiwagi on her contradicting standpoint of   wanting to help but not herself and no one else will be willing to do so   anyways. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Also hell yeah I like this Koko-chan x Mocho b*tch action   haha keep it coming) Well, not like Kaguya didn't get a fair share of that   balloon-popping action but really, thanks to Fujiwara figuring out that he was   using was a box of old balloons which if you know about this, will wear off   over time because rubber, Shirogane ended up being able to make decent balloon   figures after being given a new set of balloons to- Nope. NOPE. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All   in all, stop putting boring characters in this series please haha the only   ones worth mentioning in this episode were the two reporters tbh, and I gotta   say that is too little action in that meeting earlier with Miko-chan I   seriously thought we will get the same thing as Ishigami... which I guess   won't make of an exciting story huh BUT NOW WE KNOW THE GOOD STUFF IS   HAPPENING NEXT AND I CAN'T WAIT HAHA HYPE someone fix the narrator's tape I   think it got jammed at the end- </div><div>  [TL:DR; If I had to be an Anime character in this series I'll be one of those   two girls who worship Kaguya-sama haha also Tobaru-sensei were you a student   in Shuchi'in?

She did something unbelievable we didn't believe it too when   we saw it last week. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Now she's just worried about all of what   happened between her fingers crossing with Tadano's for some reason lol yep,   but the reality is likely that none of them recall, even Najimi who popped in   soon after. But you know, what better way to get us excited about Komi-san   than to see her panic about giving a love letter to Najimi haha didn't know   you're homosexual, and freak out seeing Tadano for some reason. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Hey,   hands, you loner f**ks. What have you interacted with a girl on? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Speaking of loners haha, let us introduce the new guy in class who took quite   a chunk of last week's episode. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Introducing   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/narushisuto" target="_blank"     >Naruse Shisuto</a   >  (haha that name is right on point, please don't tell me to translate that,   please) (okay I can translate Kometani   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chuushaku" target="_blank">Chuushaku</a> as   a commentator though, as it's English THEN Japanese lol but serious talk   though did they just fire the narrator? She was just talking about Komi-san's   feels earlier- THAT WAS IT?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh ok it doesn't overlap thank goodness)   is the new guy in class we never knew lol, because besides being at the toilet   most of the time looking at the mirror and listening to Ju*tin B**ber songs   (lmao), he is... what we call very self-conscious though of course with the   exception of Komi-san which he thinks likes him too, just like everyone else   in class. Eh, just a reminder, Naruse? More people are looking at Katai-kun by   the way, than are looking at you. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We don't need more commentary on   that, thanks. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Though this friend story is unlikely because I guess   Komi-san still isn't friends with this idiot yet she probably is with   Kometani-kun though lmao GOT HIM, it would look like Komi-san is just as   confused of him as she is of some of the guys in class. And you thought the   ninja Shinobi was weird. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Between Yamai's breathing down his neck and   the pain of having to throw down with Makeru-chan lol, it's no wonder this   school and specifically this class is all about personality. Well, Naruse has   a lot of personality, I'll give you that. Won't get you friends though, just   so you know. Not even Tadano- Last but not least though which is the next part   of the romance series it looks like, is Tadano escapes to Kyoto with his lover   Komi- Wait, THAT'S NOT IT??? Haha but why we got jebaited so much as so to   know of Komi's past of not going to her school trip in middle school because   no one knew of her issue and Tadano suggested SUCH A GREAT IDEA to instead   being in groups with girls in class and not allowed to be together with him   and/or Najimi (the latter being not possible to classify by gender lmao) to GO   TO KYOTO TOGETHER- Someone bring me tissues I am already nose bleeding on my   desk while typing this out. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, yes Komi-san you have friends   now I just close my eyes and pick any two girls via   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kuji" target="_blank">potluck</a> they would   be fine with you more likely they would not be fine with each other lmao, and   I have a harsh feeling, Tadano is going to get Katai-kun and Naruse in his   group for some reason HAHAHAHA KYOTO~!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> </div><div>  [TL:DR; "No matter how many times we go, it's Kyoto after all!" *This episode   is brought to you by the Japan National Tourism Organization-] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="1080"                 data-original-width="1920"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2eES22xyEzb8Yk_qcuhXj8v1u3zospU5Hh4SwIaPofu7p1MD_F63UpTVk0H0npGbDBgDa7HLztTT-mNA_98go1mmgGlrf2VHkbGXZEe5QxMS3X8meC0qAhVmcz9Uu3TYo1SpjkL-O19LjI9GEl-eHm1UWNcE92FAKxwhhC-7Dcs7hdoymnPGtqV-u/s320/komisan19_naruse3.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              You know why you're not cool, narcissist boy?

Marika is a guest vocal in it I don't even think this   counts as a collaboration but it is a song for movie "Anime Hakken!" which   recently had a lot of news due to the amount of <i>popular</i> voice actors in   this including Marinka herself,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/fuzzyknot_staff/status/1527982553457537024?s=20&amp;t=1U5cAGs6osT6IdQaUpF6ew"       target="_blank"

Yeah, that's a lot to take in just that last part   alone to be honest haha<br />  <br />So for next week, we have the Anime "Shikimori-san" theme songs to talk   about so hopefully I can smoothly give <b>nasuo's new single</b> which only   has one track lol, and <b>Nakashima Yuki's new single</b> which honestly   saying I have been well brainwashed I think I can give the Anime's ending   song.
