  I love to quote myself time to time, you know? This time around though, I
  seriously thought twice as to why this actually happens. Maybe it's just me,
  but maybe it's also a trend, but what would even drive any music production or
  artist into making sure the second last track of every album has a specific
  mood? I don't even know.

<div>THE TRACKLIST OF ALBUMS</div>
<div>
  We've all listened to music albums. Whether they are the first time you heard
  of them, or it's just purely instrumental like SPECIAL OTHERS (which I must
  say if you have never heard before you should), albums tend to have a listen
  of 10+ tracks, of varying lengths, sometimes with preludes which are very
  short instrumental or songs which are excluded from Klassic Note of course,
  but even so, there is always an order. No surprises, the artist or music
  production behind the releases, determine the track order of these albums.
  Whether the best song should be at the front, or we conclude the album with
  the best, there always is some due thought into these... but how far do they
  go? <b>Do they arrange the tracks in order to convey a mood?</b> Do they want
  to allow a rollercoaster range of emotions when you listen to it? That brings
  us to this very specific position of each album, and I meant in those albums
  with a standard track list of songs, we don't care about best albums or the
  smaller releases like mini-albums here.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THAT SECOND LAST TRACK</div>
<div>
  So, the second last track of an album. As mentioned above, production (as we
  will refer to loosely from here on since I don't know how to refer to them
  tbh) tend to conclude an album with a happy song, something with more impact,
  so that it wraps up as if like, a happy ending of a movie, a good ending of a
  novel, sort of feel. This much, try your nearest album review for
  confirmation. As such, there is much freedom in the placement of tracks
  everywhere else, after the intro and into the ending. But what somehow is
  important and many are emphasizing on, is the song to place before the ending.
  <b>It typically is strong with emotion, filled with a dampened mood</b>, but
  not as quite as a turning point of a movie or something. From

    >SPECIAL OTHERS "Have A Nice Day"</a
  >, there seems to exist similarities between these releases, just at
  <b>the point of mellowness</b>, I can't even describe. It doesn't even matter
  if they are independent or just backed up by a music production, somehow, they
  know this track is the most important place to make a difference. And trust
  me, I've given the above I've mentioned to realize that.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>WHY THOUGH?</div>
<div>
  Perhaps <b>it's just to convey an emotion</b>? That's as far as I can think of
  though. Because looking at the ones who don't comply with this rule, I can't
  help but think if those that do now follow such a pattern are not well thought
  out in the first place. Heck, I even arrange my compilations in Klassic Note
  after this concept. Whether that really
  <b>makes of a better listening experience</b>? I am not really sure. But
  somehow, somehow I get hooked into these tracks more often than ever. Not that
  I have statistics to prove it, but considering that when I get too into giving
  albums often more than just giving a couple of tunes, I tend to end up giving
  this specific track every other time. Maybe being part of a bigger package,
  that one song suddenly became more important than the others. That, is what I
  think anyways.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>

<div></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Honestly though? This is still just a thought. But I'm glad I can just point
  this out and talk about why I think this rule exists. It's strange, isn't it?
  Perhaps the next time you listen to a full album, will you notice how that
  song is more emotional, more prominent, even more than ever better, than the
  other songs you hear from the list. I know I will. Cya guys next time for more
  irrelevant logic from listening to Japanese songs for too long.
