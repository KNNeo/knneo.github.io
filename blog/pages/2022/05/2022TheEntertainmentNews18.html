GOLDENNNNNNNN WEEEEEEEEEEEEK Haha okay me we just have a lot of holidays here,
please. Not living in Japan, by the way.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Man, every time I look at my new desktop wallpaper featuring voice actress
  Koga Aoi (which you may know her from Kaguya-sama and/or Komi-san) (yep) I
  always felt like this purchase of her mini digital photobook where they get
  female VAs to take photos of each other, is so worth the price- You should get
  yourself a copy too and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/seiyu_tomophoto/status/1512740150526513154?s=20&amp;t=HmdZvDkaw7BIv3J9YJTW2A" target="_blank">see her get wet</a>-

  Anyways, lots of stuff to go through again this week, and news for next week
  since I have it all to myself: I WILL DO A POST EVERY DAY FROM MONDAY TO
  FRIDAY NEXT WEEK!!! Yeah HYPE!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, probably for #KN15YEARS to
  be honest, and I'll need to spend more time and effort to prepare these so...
  maybe I'm not buying a new Switch game to play then lol I bought so many and
  didn't even bother to play them<br />

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "Wow! Our senpais really became a manga!" lol WHAT did they run out of
      budget? Haha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Wow how many fourth walls they broke for the intro? Haha I can't even.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode (#RikeKoiS205) hey if this series gets serious
  too early I might just flip? Haha probably not but we shall see from here on.
  Because for now, we are getting more serious in this love experiment thing
  then ever. But first, let's talk a little about how it started, with
  Yamamoto-sensei. She's back, she is NOT back with more manga though as we have
  seen just a couple of pages CLEARLY still drawn by the author themselves and
  not by her (lol don't fourth wall me I know it's the same) since she has been
  slacking off work and dodging the dealing set by her editor which, if you
  would have known, is enough of a thing for real life authors that they make
  this as a joke already. What you would not have known though, is that the
  editor is a former rugby player who probably can win an arm wrestling match
  against Ikeda-sensei haha, just came into the lab to drag her out to finish
  her manuscript. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Seriously,
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/40716/Kakushigoto_TV" target="_blank">wrong Anime</a>, people. And then we move on to Kanade. Remember the previous episode where
  some dude just walked in to confess to her? I mean, even without the parents
  or even her grandfather expecting some in-law to appear into their lives
  earlier than ever considering she's also the oldest in her family wow didn't
  expect to see the full family here tbh, Kanade-chan here might have trouble
  even rejecting this kid who just popped up in her life ever since the
  presentation in the first season of Anime. Still, doesn't stop Yukimura from
  quantifying the confession reply for her haha I almost forgot this is a
  science series, and despite not giving a damn on whether we are talking about
  the friend or just herself, Kanade seems to have some idea of whether to still
  be friends which this dude who says he likes her. Without proof too so that's
  awkward. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, to put it simply, Kanade will be hard-pressed to
  reject him considering they don't know each other, so being friends and
  hanging out would be a good start to know. There, solved it without equations.
  <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> And lastly, I'll put focus on this more to be frank, is the collation
  of "proof of love" from the community. No really, I heard some newbie who
  sounded like Asakura Momo in there, the one who voices the bear. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Anyways, as if this didn't get any more cringe ignoring the one who talked
  about her guy dying *OOF*, Torasuke is livid about himself probably liking his
  childhood friend more than ever forgetting that the friend relationship here
  is a thing, Himuro's feelings are still a question mark even though I think
  it's definitive at the end of this episode already, and Kanade... let's just
  say she's over with this lol. All in all, great episode as always goddamn I
  keep comparing to episode 1 but I must say maybe it's because that other
  couple sucks compared to these young ones hehe, but hey, all's in a day of
  research, yeah? We'll see if Yukimura needs more proof from Himuro on her
  newest confession or not haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "What is love anyway?" Love is an experiment, Kanade-chan. You try to
  go out with people once you realize you're too old to be single, and then-
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>]

  </blockquote>
  Really? "Hokkemon Ko"?? This is all you can come up with, Mizu Asato-sensei???
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well in this new episode where we talk about dead memes and died off
  trends from five years ago when the world wasn't on fire haha yeah don't
  forget about fidget spinners (#AharenSan05), someday we will get the Spiderman
  pointing meme in here, maybe season two. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, the jokes this week haha
  okay there are the interesting actually romance stuff here so that too haha.
  Firstly, about this new Pokémon Go ripoff. I'm not going to bore you with the
  lore that is Pokemon because I'm sure my friends can teach you the techniques
  if you need to, but if the keywords "Focus Sash" and "Endeavour" or even
  "Priority Move" don't ring any bells on you that's basically how Raidou's mon
  lost to Aharen's even thought she just played it like, yesterday. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Okay way too much video game references liao so let's move on haha, we have
  Futaba-chan again apparently she's real popular with the target audience lmao,
  and yeah thanks to her remembering what her boy Akkun mentioned, she chanced
  upon Aharen by a crane game and wanted to get something for her boy, only to
  know that Aharen literally taught her how to get with her last coin by burning
  all her coins. Such is why Aharen is the master, girl. Start paying tribute to
  her or something, you tsundere brat. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Aharen can just offset the new
  monster loot to her boy, so no worries there. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And I rather not talk
  about how Raidou got fat lmao, maybe the highlight for this episode is how bad
  Raidou needs tutoring for the upcoming exams. You know, because he really
  sucks? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, no surprises there where Aharen is better at him at
  every subject considering he never looked that far up the class ranks anyways
  he's always at the bottom lol, Aharen on the other hand is just glad she could
  be of help to him for once, considering she typically always causes trouble
  for him for trying anything yeah even the feeding until he got fat lmao, but
  yeah, as she said it herself, she might be good at stuff but if not for Raidou
  covering her back, she might not be where she is today. Really, truly
  wholesome moments especially when he saved her from the falling shelf- Wait,
  was that supposed to be a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kyunkyun" target="_blank">kyun</a> moment??
  Haha okay, didn't catch that though (get it?) I really just forgot this is a
  romance series. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All in all, choke me Aharen lmao who knew she was a
  faceless assassin with slick moves also please Raidou they don't have to clean
  up after themselves if they are that good anyways lol, I legit have no idea
  who's that other classmate which has been featured in this episode twice haha,
  and yeah where's the romance? <span title="*silence*">😐</span> We're not even halfway there, me, we
  can wait a bit more hehe until next time then
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I just absolutely LOVE the evil laughs from the one and only Minase
  Inori I need more of these now lol can we change this into a love rival series
  and put Inorin as antagonist? Haha there are other series like this?]

  Okay Ishigami, chill. No such beam exists or else Kana-chan wouldn't be
  married now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where the love continues or maybe
  not haha (#KaguyaSamaS304), I think we have more to talk about than ever
  before, to be honest. Firstly, Ishigami's crush. I think we might have figured
  out already but thanks for the recap I almost forgot about his time in
  Cheerleading Club, Kaguya spits on Ishigami's lack of motivation to aim for
  some girl he thinks he can't get. You know, idolism, but probably more
  achievable because she's right by you and you technically can just hug her
  back and you'll be more friends than ever before so why not also use some of
  your student council authority to get what she wants hehe, instead we have
  this situation where Kaguya helps Ishigami out on the exams again just because
  you know, grades are everything. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I like how his motivation then comes
  from serious Kaguya which is cool honestly instead of just to the person he
  likes, but hey, at least he tried. Because I didn't. <span title="*sob*">😢</span> Anyways, moving on
  I hate drama that speaks my life out lmao, we talk about how everyone else
  dealt with the recent exams. A year has passed since they were together and I
  meant as in the student council no one is dating in this room EVER haha,
  Shirogane is just top in class but is easily distracted by his phone
  apparently with Ha!@#$%ka lmao we will elaborate on that again, Kaguya is in
  second and she can easily blame that on Ishigami since she has to help him not
  fail lol, Fujiwara probably will never study as expected haha, I forgot
  Miko-chan is smartest in her cohort and that's how she shows off her prowess
  and is probably alone because of that lol, and I think I saw Nagisa drop in
  rank in the eyecatch afterwards haha yes I paused to see the others Shijo was
  3rd though. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last but not least and it will be a lie if I didn't say I
  want to skip to this part so badly, Fujiwara mentioned about a stayover or
  hanging out just with the others, but since Kaguya was so desperate about it
  and wants it right now, she gets it right now... at her place... with just her
  bestie. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, be patient, girl, I know you rush to get yourself
  ploughed but <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We meet with&nbsp;Ha!@#$%ka disguised as a gay
  apparently lmao okay Anime you doing discrimination now huh, the girls have a
  wonderful time together in the mansion- Man, life without Kaguya's dad is
  great. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And then we sleep. And unless you are NOT girly enough you
  don't sleep until the clock strikes 12 so yeah, science proven effect on
  people where sleep is as bad if not worse than intoxicated, so Kaguya-sama in
  love. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> They had girls' talk until it involved Kei and her brother
  haha, we were about to hear the confession until it isn't, and... what do you
  think will happen if nose bleeding Chika-chan walked in to a female butler?
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, have you ever seen all FOUR forms of Hayasaka Ai?
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> That might have been too much for Chika-chan, to be honest haha. But
  hey, we got a LOT out of this episode though, even though to be frank it's
  kinda repetitive at this point WE NEED TO KNOW WHO SHIROGANE LIKES!! Haha okay
  who am I lying to we know he likes the male butler lmao see you all for more
  gay action I guess
</div>

  Hayasaka is better lmao <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>]

  You know this is a good episode when they pay the narrator more than Shousuke
  despite his longest appearance in the series. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode
  where hey Merry Christmas everyone lol this second cour should've been in
  previous season (#KomiSan16), we are NOT even close to people getting
  together. I wonder why. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh, it's Komi-san's birthday too. Ah..... I
  see. Haha okay about this special day I guess. It was orchestrated apparently
  at the last minute as with Tadano on all things, but that also shows how
  little time Komi-san was given to play along what seems to be a Secret Santa
  thing so just like me she had to go online to buy a bunch of candles to- Oh
  she didn't? And this one is technically random? Well... maybe she can drag the
  brother along to help out. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ironically this didn't really happen in
  this episode for some reason, so we didn't really find out who got the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/muffler" target="_blank">muffler</a> from
  her though. What we DO know is her birthday present, and how everyone ended up
  hanging out at her place with only one day's notice. Probably hard on the mom
  to prepare all this beforehand, but hey, when's the last time you had your
  class over for dinner? <span title="*silence*">😐</span> So yeah, she wins, I guess. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  Everyone thought hard about where to sit in the living room lol, it hit back
  at them when everyone just sat down giving her no choice but to... you know,
  sit besides Tadano which just flipped Yamai-san haha, they played a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ousamage-mu" target="_blank">game of King</a>
  somehow with the mom involved lol who got two guys to kiss lmao here's your
  gay tribute here dear homo fans of this series (mom, it's 4 kisses 3, please)
  (haha <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>), thank goodness Tadano didn't get a massage from anyone besides
  the anee-san character lol, and Komi-san ordered everyone to be friends with
  her forever. Long live the Shouko empire. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And then, we have a
  flashback. So looks like Tadano recalled the birthday and I promise Yamai too
  but she didn't intend to go along with the others and go to Komi-san's place
  through her room window- And Tadano got Najimi to help out on Christmas Eve.
  So yeah, it started with them picking the best gift as a showdown haha yeah
  Makeru-chan be gyrating at the corner already after Yamai lol, but apart from
  half the people who can't think of anything to gift her, the other half can't
  come up with something good- Stop grabbing that dancing Santa no one gives a
  shit about that, Komi-san. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> As usual Tadano got the best gift and I
  agree imagine being that plushie haha thanks Yamai, gotta argue Kaede-chan's
  gift is a good second choice, but yeah, it ended up being a collective
  purchase instead of each to their own which Yamai wishes she could've and
  actually won the others. Sadly though, the gang did not feel the sincerity of
  her thanks from receiving even a gift, because you know, read the title of
  this series again lol, so they got a great message from her instead. So that's
  good. Someday, man, someday we will get her to say her thanks and show some
  hype from receiving a present just like a normal person- Wait, did I get hype
  receiving a birthday present? <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Did I even receive a birthday present
  this year? <span title="*sob*">😢</span> All in all... where's the dating part??? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really,
  not Yamai of course, I was expecting something going on with the main couple,
  but considering even the mom knows not to make this awkward and not let Tadano
  be able to resume school because he'll be beat up by the others lmao, I think
  we can hold that for another time. You know, previous episode was a pretty
  good couple moment. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I guess we can have more of these, eh? I've
  never had this many friends so it'll be fun to watch... someone... enjoy...
  life F-

  No really, you have NO IDEA how much I have sunk into
  <strike>Oonishi Saori</strike> Shikimori-san at this point haha even the
  official Twitter account knew to check on whether you think Shikimori is more
  cute or cool each episode. But come on, with this new episode we know
  (#ShikimoriSan04) that her being cool is part of her cuteness, isn't it?
  <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> So yeah, about summer. We just setting things up, because obviously,
  this isn't that episode where we get everything, but I'm pretty sure this is
  all going to be great next... week... so let's talk about what happened this
  week! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Firstly, the gang's plans to hang out for summer. They are
  still facing the exams though first, but before that, we gotta plan where to
  go to <strike>study</strike>&nbsp;find the motivation to, you know, look
  forward to swimsuits or something. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Like, Inuzuka, you don't even
  know. Bruh, even Izumi is staring at a bikini ad poster in the mall, dude.
  Shikimori got the hint, why didn't you- Well good thing is, the girls in this
  series are VERY HYPED (even Shikimori lol) to get some shopping going on so I
  can't wait for next episode already lmao, but yeah Nekozaki is right Shikimori
  is very afraid of losing to anything, even an ad it seems lol. Speaking of
  that, we got a flashback to how they all came together. Turns out, Nekozaki is
  already with Hachimitsu no surprises there, but one is I would say, very fond
  of Shikimori especially when she found some cute boi to date lol, so much
  jealousy here I can't even describe, and they both got real serious playing
  basketball the others are just amazed at these two. We didn't get the final
  scores here but who cares haha, but we do know it's a good showdown just
  because. And yeah that's essentially how things work right? Friendships.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> It just starts with something and boom, next thing you know we be
  playing at the river half-naked. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Yeah, Nekozaki likes "too pure pure
  girls", we got that reference haha <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> (Sorry for "Kannagi" drop no one
  knows this Anime with Kana-chan and Tomacchan in it I apologize in advance)
  But hey, all is well, eh? She just gets her top-up from Izumi or something.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, good to know the relationships between this gang, and
  honestly it's fun to watch as an audience too. The exams happened just because
  and Izumi lost the power to write because writing tools fail just because
  (lol), and you know, we can talk about the stars. Haha I seriously thought we
  can go with the "the moon is beautiful" confession trick but I guess pure
  Izumi doesn't do that stuff huh. Kinda pisses me off now to be honest haha ah-
  All in all, what is with the lesbian subplot in a cooking class haha I promise
  you this is not a porno in any way, I'm LOVING the slow pace in this
  slice-of-life romance series already, and goddamn if next week I need to get
  my nosebleed going. Haha cya guys then
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "(Shikimori) tops the list of girls I want to marry" Haha you're right
  Nekozaki because SAME dude]

  </blockquote>This week? Hmm... it's not much, but I'll talk about them. It's been a while since I touched any of these artists or genres, so let's. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/bullets-into-the-pipe-ep/1619445959?l=en" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES' collaboration digital album</a></b> is merely just to introduce a new song featuring a rapper I understand I gave it anyways I could use more of them, but the other 3 tracks in the release is definitely not any better than the originals despite having guest vocals on them and everything else sounding EXACTLY the same. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kaguya-ultra-best/1618925378?l=en" target="_blank">Anime "Kaguya-sama" album</a></b> is more interesting though, and if you have heard of their radio show "Koku Radio" as which it is named, associated music label Aniplex has kindly written songs from main three characters which had their separate release to basically everyone else making Suzuki Ryouta the new hot music video idol lol, is finally compiled in a release and streamed digitally too so I can listen to all of them including cast covers of the theme songs. I don't think Kohara Konomi herself had an influence in giving the song I merely didn't listen to it the first time around, and goddamn Hasayaka's character song is good. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So yeah, the original theme songs were better lol including halca-san which I should not say because her songs aren't actually good and I give them because of Anime even though she's a MusicRay'n artist where TrySail are- (sorry for TMI)</div><div>
  <br />
  Let's see, for news on Elon Musk-owned Twitter which I'll give a damn about because it's music, more <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1518530263084503040?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana live videos on YouTube</a></b> it's as if they want to appear on this paragraph every week and <a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1520707098044108800?s=20&amp;t=b9wSFSSbSYYgCPeGlANJrg" target="_blank">if you missed "K-ON!"</a> they have that too, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/pg_koushiki/status/1518937944886755331?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">Porno Graffitti announced a new album</a></b> after 5 years without one and honestly saying I also didn't give a damn so maybe it's a good time to go back to them date not yet announced lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/barks_news/status/1518938084192452609?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">fuzzy knot announced a new album</a></b> in their recent live and it looks like this Sid and Mayflower member combination is getting traction so I guess more 80s retro tunes in the next few months, don't ask me why <a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1519966672148627457?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new THE FIRST TAKE video</a> on YouTube (1) does not feature their drummer but maybe it's a lighter version and (2) why they get to do this the second time since it's kind of a rarity and they might be bringing in viewers, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi_info/status/1520234023372566528?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">yanaginagi's new song</a></b> is the first of many songs for her 10th anniversary plan where <a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1520392483666292736?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">voting on what we feel</a> from this song will determine the future songs' moods, <a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1517729983271256064?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank"><b>SHE'S new song</b></a> isn't too bad even from preview, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3pasi_official/status/1520357536859561984?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song</a></b> for Anime "Cuckoo no Inazuke" will be out on streaming next week, if you would recall about an indie event from last week <b><a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1520417695765827588?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">yuiko's new song will be on digital and streaming</a></b> three weeks from now so that's rad, didn't notice this but <a href="https://twitter.com/shionnu10/status/1520360780000284672?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">Tsuji Shion's new song</a> will also be online in three weeks after announcing it in a live event which I can't attend lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1520298131220754432?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's new music video</a></b> is basically fanservice and all the dancing you will expect from idols so hey welcome to K-Pop a decade ago lol, this is probably my favourite so far because rare Klassic Note guest <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aesthetic_Mag/status/1520123931524354048?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">Murder by Death will be releasing their new album</a></b> in upcoming July following a Kickstarter for pre-orders as usual if you don't know of them looks like they are going refreshed 70s this time, and I'll roundup all the artists involved in the <b>upcoming YouTube Music Weekend next week</b> where they showcase past live performances, including <a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1519152497814011904?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">Hanazawa Kana</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1519149986960711680?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1519161222813614080?s=20&amp;t=NHsh3SEuMV1vjNN7S-YTHQ" target="_blank">SCANDAL</a>&nbsp;since I follow them.</div><div>
  <br />Next week would be a great break for Klassic Note once again but that'll be bad for the start of the month to be honest so maybe I'll try to pick up <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/koshaberibiyori-single/1618155347?l=en" target="_blank">FantasticYouth's new song</a></b> for Anime "Komi-san" which really is hard to give though Ookubo Rumi liked it lol (still not idol influenced don't worry Klassic Note stands independent in views lmao), and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%98%9F%E3%81%AE%E6%B6%88%E3%81%88%E3%81%9F%E5%A4%9C%E3%81%AB/1597687739?l=en" target="_blank">Aimer's B-side album</a></b> from early this year just because it'll also be a good trip down memory lane since I started with her in 2011 thanks to Anime "BLEACH". Man, I really wonder how bad it'll be once the final arc comes back in October this year, theme songs-wise. It'll never be as good as what we knew, right? Most of them stopped or left Sony Music Japan who hosts the series' theme songs. Hmm... mol-74? That's as far as I know on potential candidates haha oh yeah ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION is still around- That'll be cool!! <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> (Edit: Now that I recall we&nbsp; have KANA-BOON and Ryokuoushoku Shakai now so that sounds like a good time half a year from now haha)<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  I... don't think we will be reviewing them photobooks even next week. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Yeah, may have screwed that up, might as well let them ship early so it can
  avoid all the Japan holiday things or something. In view of that, I better
  prepare more on the upcoming posts I'll be doing for Klassic Note, starting
  with a post that I've been keeping for a year or so because I didn't bother to
  post it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> You know, missed timing, but I think it's still a good time
  to talk about them, it's artists I follow in recent years following all the
  falls of all of the artists I started with the early 2000s. Cya guys then, and until next time... I want myself a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CczN3MzvUSu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">Kohara Konomi photobook</a>- Oh it exists now?? Haha yeah oh shit I forgot about the changing images in the official site four times a day lol goddamn I never get to see all of them somehow lmao bye</div>
