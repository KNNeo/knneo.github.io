Haha okay me the point that you are buying CDs even in 2012 is already a joke. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Hey and welcome back to this blog where I spend a lot of time talking about stuff that no one will care. In this post (lol), I talk about how one should be spending their money after they get their salary. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> You guessed it, it's the very reason why you see CD reviews appear ever so often today, it's The Klassic Note Reviews! In a surprise to no one, The Klassic Note Review did not start with what the title might have implied, an actual review. A proper write-up. With plenty of images to showcase the product. Actually, it was more of just an unboxing. And a lot of mistakes. Most importantly, it was a lost of waste of money. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> With all the stuff I review today, it all started with amazement when I delved into my first online purchase from Japan.</div><div><br></div><div>So behold! The darkest history of Klassic Note Reviews and its origins are going to be revealed in this very post, about 10 years after it started!! No really, get my tissues ready for I will cry puddles it won't stop lmao <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>HOW THIS STARTED</div><div><div>It all started with the thought of what would be the first thing I do with my first full-time pay check. Three months into the thing we call "conscription" here haha, living away from home, having way too much time in my hands when we were in the transition phase of shifting away from basic to specialized training so I had a lot of time in my hands... You could take it to be like a college/university term break, about a few months long. And in came this thought. Yeah, time tends to do that to you. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> And among these thoughts did I recall of Klassic Note, the concept I came up with for the music I listen to from Japan, with me as the only listener and judge, which basically means I want to collate my music library haha. With five years since its start, it was natural to come up with something to celebrate its 5th anniversary. So the first thing I did, and I joke no one, is to buy back all the songs of Japan I knew of ever since Klassic Note started around 2008.</div><div><br></div><div>Ah, before we continue, and this still applies today, there are certain conditions to be fulfilled. As I was paid like cr*p lol don't tell them and at this point I was listening close to a thousand tunes and counting, I knew it was impossible to get EVERY SINGLE SONG I've heard from Japan, as that would require buying every single release - single or album or EP - and that would have costed waaaaay too much, and my satisfaction of them, the idea of me not liking every single song on each release, came into mind. And thus the condition of "<b>reviewing full singles and albums given in Klassic Note</b>" became a more practical way of getting hold the songs I truly love. Problem is, that is still quite a lot to deal with, close to 100 CDs in total. So I did it in batches, progressively buying in the year's songs we are in because remember it was 2012 and Klassic Note doesn't stop for no one lol, while also trying to get the "reviewed releases" for every year, starting from the newest so 2011, 2010... etc.</div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>THE FIRST KLASSIC NOTE BATCHES</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwHIXQqNZrcR0tLeLkbKufnZiCnSqYuRogGpWFmUuaSAkG9Pve_RrTBQwSW2lRZpqpdKNZg36uNXNRrde6-J9lxLNiyJ8w8ZyRFjyqd6hYIOWgUzdvHCZhleLSpWxeDtqQEidgvUTXCLIZZrxdXKVmnPSyXV0jnaSUsUdWZfxkr_KMaYUR7OWLZCRu/s800/287718_10151035847447460_323955001_o_10151035847447460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=600 data-original-width=800 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwHIXQqNZrcR0tLeLkbKufnZiCnSqYuRogGpWFmUuaSAkG9Pve_RrTBQwSW2lRZpqpdKNZg36uNXNRrde6-J9lxLNiyJ8w8ZyRFjyqd6hYIOWgUzdvHCZhleLSpWxeDtqQEidgvUTXCLIZZrxdXKVmnPSyXV0jnaSUsUdWZfxkr_KMaYUR7OWLZCRu/s320/287718_10151035847447460_323955001_o_10151035847447460.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[Jan-June 2012]<br>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â When you take images with garbage and a remote control lol</table><div>So around July 2012, I started with Klassic Note 2012 releases, the first half of the year, the CDs I have given every song in, so that includes THIRTEEN SINGLES, for a total of *REDACTED* yen haha, direct shipping into my home address thanks to a buddy we have known for so many years. And I cannot thank them enough, I sincerely thank <b>CDJapan</b> aka Neowing Japan's international shop website, for making all of these possible. At that time, they were the only shop that offered international shipping, their fees are still lower than many services even today, and with my half-baked decision to get these in, I truly gave my soul to them and hoped my purchase of these will pay off. I wished I had shown you the expression on my face as I received this box of surprises; Boy I could never replicate that feeling again.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8KeoCLwUdRFOqI7SIAuLjyrDsj9DPModVYJm2I--vaTW6j6rT-SOxcnaSIoG_S_2OfoN2Q87GkizsYYAYwo0_jtJvY7IwRaxxfnxGukaGYcucelMi6TRT068Pm8nXdb39dX-6vCB295QME-fMueizP4gVFMJ7N5KaKnL2qnCvkeMaS4whA7xwQ92d/s800/255949_10151136457962460_2090709565_o_10151136457962460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=600 data-original-width=800 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8KeoCLwUdRFOqI7SIAuLjyrDsj9DPModVYJm2I--vaTW6j6rT-SOxcnaSIoG_S_2OfoN2Q87GkizsYYAYwo0_jtJvY7IwRaxxfnxGukaGYcucelMi6TRT068Pm8nXdb39dX-6vCB295QME-fMueizP4gVFMJ7N5KaKnL2qnCvkeMaS4whA7xwQ92d/s320/255949_10151136457962460_2090709565_o_10151136457962460.jpg></a><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqFBW8yqiGGf6xi9qiL3uVjCiDQ8wTjv3aVWKFSQmVFll-_NWKfwjdLeikwGs08axxbLqxjCiJpzNYo7hmHPepxwx-229f9qKBxL7uyYx-lgZ7h2b5_Il5XYwF0PzaCtUZc4N-xzJ2-EI5EemUeysUFzl3cogAIoLerhFlv156uql0zYd2rh86yqNG/s800/278519_10151136465322460_1483101994_o_10151136465322460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=600 data-original-width=800 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqFBW8yqiGGf6xi9qiL3uVjCiDQ8wTjv3aVWKFSQmVFll-_NWKfwjdLeikwGs08axxbLqxjCiJpzNYo7hmHPepxwx-229f9qKBxL7uyYx-lgZ7h2b5_Il5XYwF0PzaCtUZc4N-xzJ2-EI5EemUeysUFzl3cogAIoLerhFlv156uql0zYd2rh86yqNG/s320/278519_10151136465322460_1483101994_o_10151136465322460.jpg></a><tr><td class=tr-caption colspan=2 style=text-align:center>[2011]<br>Yes, there were to many I had to take two shots to show most of them</table><div>As you might have noticed from the poor quality of the images even if I let you zoom in lol, from taking a photo from a tablet with thick bezels with a terrible camera to how I got that very tablet from my dad because he didn't know how to use one to how I posted all the images I took up to Facebook so my contacts can be jealous of my treasures, my bravery, my... waste of money <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> it was all but a fever dream to me. With a quiet afternoon and my parents out of the house, I had to secretly (yes SECRETLY) (lol) use the living room media player to play these (I now have a CD player in my room FYI), but yeah, the experience was AMAZING!!!! It was like a dream come true, supporting artists the way I know how, to listen to them with great quality (2012 had digital downloads but not hi-res OR streaming of those formats) in a huge room environment. It was as if I had my own listening room, I truly believed that. Yeah, I kept all this a secret as much as I showed it off to social media. But time and time again, I continued to add to the count.Â </div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDDVHdIwR25nnhRkbM_hfPDR9_5Yhsukv_aOpNnu4wJKs6iLy1sLegdeOvmo8sGrN0buIvOazGlo1dImt2Sk3MmKiw909WLNWi8mxtzvks5gxHHwBQ99SKN7gozMy9N3z-yzBoMWyzun6sBPxqzXuU4vnUZdUUtqmeUm-aU1PDh_tWBClCeQki_gxn/s800/56223_10151219618772460_1379977138_o_10151219618772460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=600 data-original-width=800 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDDVHdIwR25nnhRkbM_hfPDR9_5Yhsukv_aOpNnu4wJKs6iLy1sLegdeOvmo8sGrN0buIvOazGlo1dImt2Sk3MmKiw909WLNWi8mxtzvks5gxHHwBQ99SKN7gozMy9N3z-yzBoMWyzun6sBPxqzXuU4vnUZdUUtqmeUm-aU1PDh_tWBClCeQki_gxn/s320/56223_10151219618772460_1379977138_o_10151219618772460.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[2010]<br>Shout out to the lone male artist Ajikan over there haha</table><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfY8wic5VZcSDhv70xDocRCXhR8LnxIlh8byTLyE4F4IZAxdCF_5yJryjaxqLtxmgTqKd67K67alr37R51Y6hl3l3J_LAlh6fhrpYuZEH-gAeeWDMK2oxhQIB2oN2og02lzrGAppMn-rPPNYGKhMfivOH-SxnlUsLMln1krkEQrjcqdjxJW1YCC6Yv/s800/52921_10151234646407460_1308920183_o_10151234646407460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=600 data-original-width=800 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfY8wic5VZcSDhv70xDocRCXhR8LnxIlh8byTLyE4F4IZAxdCF_5yJryjaxqLtxmgTqKd67K67alr37R51Y6hl3l3J_LAlh6fhrpYuZEH-gAeeWDMK2oxhQIB2oN2og02lzrGAppMn-rPPNYGKhMfivOH-SxnlUsLMln1krkEQrjcqdjxJW1YCC6Yv/s320/52921_10151234646407460_1308920183_o_10151234646407460.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[2009]<br>Ayachi on the right doesn't count, and this was before I bought a duplicate of Porno Graffitti's single lol it wasn't even that good lmao</table><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOENg7u3QqevB2_c0oLPIfBm7AXg2cLSl78Jiz31Y4aWbBBDolIl2MVeNbiiEWS1BMztwQcV-EL48j7ApWMjGKhg24RbG1SLCZjkDgfEMsrudoK4gzmEaDbOkNbbBRa4UrdGaVmVyHMDu8kUDVKXpmySL0TTGfRa84jmZMmlNHHth3rhinzNkEwyAt/s800/334102_10151324093907460_1861421594_o_10151324093907460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=600 data-original-width=800 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOENg7u3QqevB2_c0oLPIfBm7AXg2cLSl78Jiz31Y4aWbBBDolIl2MVeNbiiEWS1BMztwQcV-EL48j7ApWMjGKhg24RbG1SLCZjkDgfEMsrudoK4gzmEaDbOkNbbBRa4UrdGaVmVyHMDu8kUDVKXpmySL0TTGfRa84jmZMmlNHHth3rhinzNkEwyAt/s320/334102_10151324093907460_1861421594_o_10151324093907460.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[2008]<br>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Just this image alone can reveal how big a box it came in, when I started collecting Ikimonogakari cards that came with every of their releases, and how they knew I loved "BLEACH" haha</table><div>Every month since then, as you can see in a series of photos posted to Facebook which took how long again? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I have since then increased confidence in buying back releases from 2011 in August that year, 2010 in October, 2009 later that month and 2009 with more 2011 ones in again IN THE SAME MONTH because I remembered that's when I checked my own data to verify if more are "eligible for review" and they are haha, and 2008's releases in December along with the rest in 2012 including YUI's best albums back then.

Clearly the living room wasn't for me I live with my parents lol, so I knew these would be in my room. I also did not want to tuck them away in a box in a corner just like my parents did which showed zero sincerity in liking stuff they bought (they also bought a lot of stuff they do not care about now, waiting to rot), and so I cleared my bookshelf which didn't have many books anyway, and left half of the space to put my own belongings and daily necessities, and the other half for - you guessed it - a row of compact discs placed back in their initial wrapping. Well, I had to open them, I know you shouldn't be doing that but there are some stuff inside including novelties so I couldn't avoid doing that, so I tried to keep them in the best condition I can. Along the discs were those things you use to categorize your books I forgot the names of those, and I happily bought a label set just so I can put them into the years they were reviewed.

I think besides the one time I accidentally bought a duplicate of what I did the previous year (I'm not going to hide that, it was Porno Graffitti's 2009 single "Kono Mune yo, Ai wo Iyo" and if anyone wants a copy...) (haha), I revised my song list to ensure I did not missed anything while still being able to purchase the year's releases to put on my shelf. At this point, the time span from release to review became a lot shorter, so getting special gifts aka First Press Bonus as CDJapan would call them, became a thing. There was incentive in getting these earlier. This pushed me to be more prompt in giving new songs the earlier they arrive, even before their expected release date. That also meant that I went to the point of listening to short previews and giving the CDs prematurely so I can put more on my shelf and these are typically from idols I know, and voice actresses like Toyosaki Aki became my fuel for Klassic Note. It was a crazy time of rat and chase at that time.Â </div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXKNTiBvoAzEh4Mcs9MvaiRsoOVknZPW1Rse5PXXBXCDyO9vPhRRu9glWjwa0LtjXQ2GFofk2zjmWloO8kSW-yb5CqiFx524Unva6p62ZIoCMQjFEwZb0BpFzdic5pq96e4JcEBZSt3OW86r1OdrZligXIFl1wJ0xfE_2RFggmslrLrlG2xqp78eb0/s960/1013677_10151667482422460_1055014004_n_10151667482422460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=516 data-original-width=960 height=172 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXKNTiBvoAzEh4Mcs9MvaiRsoOVknZPW1Rse5PXXBXCDyO9vPhRRu9glWjwa0LtjXQ2GFofk2zjmWloO8kSW-yb5CqiFx524Unva6p62ZIoCMQjFEwZb0BpFzdic5pq96e4JcEBZSt3OW86r1OdrZligXIFl1wJ0xfE_2RFggmslrLrlG2xqp78eb0/s320/1013677_10151667482422460_1055014004_n_10151667482422460.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you squint real hard you can see what I bragged about after an online purchase, on Facebook<br>(No really, still there today haha)</table><div>Around that time too, I continued to refine what my definition of purchasing one of these CDs might be, even giving exceptions to afterwards terrible releases with Toyosaki Aki's "CHEEKY" and SPECIAL OTHERS' 2013 live audio CD album. Also, I learnt of the facts of buying releases in Japan, the idea of market expectation for buying pre-orders which will explain my behaviour above, but also the fact that buying through online... does not support the artists directly. Apparently, and I think this was from CDJapan, that releases bought online do not contribute to the infamous Oricon music sales charts. The latter though, did not really exactly stop me from buying more, but encouraged me to buy from more direct methods. Though still through online shops, with the help of forwarding services and my understanding of Japanese, one could buy from a Japan online store, ship it to these services and they can consolidate and bring them to your overseas address!</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7SYxNNhQ82ho5O1SsQDc2QJnTkBsH7R54nDAoQ06oNe5FDDwABhJnXtwCoKrrgny-N6F31lmdIXR-4Vag1A5PlPNowHBhpY7VlO8NRDs9Kf6kuNX3PKilnEBpWteDaGDFc-sMaIkIf_ml5Qn9aRNT4Tq-0-ddyyvfWD63UyAlhUxiCxSXjEIFnqMJ/s800/1512734_10152104720317460_885733067_n_10152104720317460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=600 data-original-width=800 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7SYxNNhQ82ho5O1SsQDc2QJnTkBsH7R54nDAoQ06oNe5FDDwABhJnXtwCoKrrgny-N6F31lmdIXR-4Vag1A5PlPNowHBhpY7VlO8NRDs9Kf6kuNX3PKilnEBpWteDaGDFc-sMaIkIf_ml5Qn9aRNT4Tq-0-ddyyvfWD63UyAlhUxiCxSXjEIFnqMJ/s320/1512734_10152104720317460_885733067_n_10152104720317460.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Still the only respect I have for instrumental band SPECIAL OTHERS.<br>Still my dream to go listen to your live one day, guys.

Criteria</a>"), they were not digital releases so I don't have to show you a screenshot of the iTunes page lol, I have given exception to music cover releases which are under their Anime credit (see "<a href=../../2014/07/the-revolutionary-decision.html>The Revolutionary Decision</a>" lol I suck at naming blog posts), I have changed the ratings of the individual tracks to suit a new judgement criteria, and included translation of lyrics to show significance in their inherent meaning I like to mention in the reviews from time to time. Klassic Note Review has come such a long way, I would've gone back in time to mock at my mistakes of buying duplicate CDs, and opting for a local forwarding service which eventually failed to ship my orders for months but thankfully the latter did not affect music discs. Even so, it would not have stopped me from doing what I like today, receiving that very new physical media of songs to remember. That, until Japan stops selling CDs, will never change.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilVBeL_M1PRzAbAiDQ2koAcZ9SF8yGr4MAHggAhtuWznQ989R4dlJRt2V4_94WnzeGud33Eubk0CxJ28k-8zTTY10AvixX1YNrKZIfRx6Rgnc-XS4M94vaQasW4mvW6wDIpSR-OzvxQqZ7-XxfqXYhWvfoxpA-2Ml8H6JJ5ju96OnDCAlY2Pf9xNDa/s1600/PXL_20220502_131321268.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilVBeL_M1PRzAbAiDQ2koAcZ9SF8yGr4MAHggAhtuWznQ989R4dlJRt2V4_94WnzeGud33Eubk0CxJ28k-8zTTY10AvixX1YNrKZIfRx6Rgnc-XS4M94vaQasW4mvW6wDIpSR-OzvxQqZ7-XxfqXYhWvfoxpA-2Ml8H6JJ5ju96OnDCAlY2Pf9xNDa/s320/PXL_20220502_131321268.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>And here's a high resolution image of the Klassic Note shelf today so your eyes won't bleed from seeing blurred images above lol</table><br><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I would like to announce a series where I go back and review all those releases which did not appear in this blog as its own post at any point so 2013 and before, but I know I didn't have the commitment to come up with a "Klassic Note Review Redux" series or something (lol yeah came up with the title for a while tbh) because I could never, EVER, tell you how much the feels were when I listened to it back then. What I CAN tell you though, is I have never once regretted making this decision, to never support my local music (lol if there is any) and doing stuff I like even now. This, is probably why I decided to continue on the journey to supporting the artists as much as I can. I'm sorry for the terrible quality of the images I only had a smartphone end 2013 and even then those cameras weren't the best thing anyways, so pardon me for not taking them photos again just so you can relive the moments by looking at these mementos which still live in my room. See you guys again for another of these long stories and underrated memories.</div><div><br></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I have bought from not Japan before, mind you, when I was totally into indie duo "cozy diary" who went as far as getting nominated for music awards back in 2015, but before then I had already bought two singles from TAIWAN everybody, and is such weird reminiscence as I am Chinese and have NEVER bought any of my songs until what was mid-2013. Now you will know why I hate Chinese love songs and instead give emo songs now haha</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=600 data-original-width=800 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT_xIV3av99hkhph7NSU3bcwQrXBowJGj-neVg3yIDELHfgPBg3jWk__2RNYjZhK6G49jXIYBfIYCOODBbdv0if3NFV4pa-oBEGizeTaF8LxKoQqX78VzS6j7K9ssRLUsa9uHbq5wjuTtEBtK1Jz0YjuIHBUHmohy_RY0ThUBZCtWxZmZHsq3nCf-r/s320/1040556_10151699718062460_1602127214_o_10151699718062460.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Next time anyone asked why I didn't support artists I like (in Chinese), I show them this haha</table><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><div><br></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
