<h2 class="title">The Graduates of Klassic Note 2015</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>(This is originally written at 2021.01.23 for Klassic Note.)</i></span></div><br /><div><strike>I feel like I should do this before I start giving more new songs for this year so, I'll go back to 2020 for a bit. Just a bit. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span></strike></div><div><br /></div><div>Welcome to the once in a blue moon Klassic Note post in this blog besides Reviews and the Song Awards. Hey, I try as much as possible, but it always has to come from a good idea or topic. For this though, it's not just a long time coming, but I feel like I should talk about what mainstream artists I like to give today, and this would be an adequate depiction.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">THE GRADUATES OF KN2015</div><div style="text-align: center;">[KN2015の卒業生]</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaXeP2pzcGOUkJfAaCyB-NzwH58Za4Ek4d_9fQm-IZvO6bCWmF7jlnhw0j1PJ-cz3qK04TdUhndioUDDzwhIcqQYQygULkj3DbhWNuu1D_cZjoFB_LTOP2dIntLnsh92lPnKCgALJEmxJdLNVbgi2xxwIyduRpR9Yja4-blNBSgzcc1WvpJE_LEbjz/s454/kn2015grads.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="454" data-original-width="454" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaXeP2pzcGOUkJfAaCyB-NzwH58Za4Ek4d_9fQm-IZvO6bCWmF7jlnhw0j1PJ-cz3qK04TdUhndioUDDzwhIcqQYQygULkj3DbhWNuu1D_cZjoFB_LTOP2dIntLnsh92lPnKCgALJEmxJdLNVbgi2xxwIyduRpR9Yja4-blNBSgzcc1WvpJE_LEbjz/s320/kn2015grads.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>I named this aptly not really based on say, number of years till college graduation, but more of, it was around the time where I've started to open up to give a new generation of artists where Collection Artists like Chatmonchy and Aqua Timez are announcing their disbandment, which means we have lesser regulars in my music library, and the search to find more became more and more important over time. 2015 was a great year of finding those artists which I listen to often over the year 2020, and with them releasing new songs despite the world on fire, it would seem appropriate to talk about how I started with them, and how they became my impression of today.</div><div><br /></div><div>For some background, Klassic Note 2015 was the first year the Vocal Popularity Survey - which determines the ratio of female to male vocals in songs given in Klassic Note - hit the lowest ratio yet which means males are increasing, throwing the stereotype of me as a male listener who only listens to female vocals. Yoru no Honki Dance and THE ORAL CIGARETTES convinced me with upbeat songs and touching lyrics to throw me off the impression that bands with male vocals must be similar to boy bands, or only meant to attract female audiences. Fast forward to 2020 where after many years of hearing their songs, I'm really convinced to give the artists I'm going to mention below, new songs based on their styles whether it's exploring new ground or perfecting the mainstream. We also saw some of them transit from indie to mainstream and gaining more attention, further justifying their popularity and reason to be mentioning them here.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Tracklist:</div><div><div><div>1<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>By My Side<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>Yoru no Honki Dance<span style="white-space: pre;">	[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/by-my-side/1093028924?i=1093028931&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div><div>2<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Smile Smile<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>Yoru no Honki Dance [<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/smile-smile/1515097841?i=1515097842&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</div><div>3<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Amy<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>THE ORAL CIGARETTES<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/amy/983513837?i=983513838&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div><div>4<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>The Given<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>THE ORAL CIGARETTES<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/the-given/1507914636?i=1507914654&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div><div>5<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Silhouette<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>KANA-BOON&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/silhouette/1536455324?i=937667018&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div><div>6<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Massara<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>KANA-BOON&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/brand-new/1536467780?i=1499591417&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div><div>7<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Nana Hitsuji<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>Scenarioart<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;">[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/nanahitsuji/1536491787?i=1053370692&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div><div>8<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>It's All Right<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>Scenarioart&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/its-all-right/1503160896?i=1503160902&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div><div>9<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Love begets love<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>SpecialThanks<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;">[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/love-begets-love/1006495781?i=1006495785&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div><div>10<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Asu mo Asatte mo<span style="white-space: pre;">/</span>SpecialThanks&nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;">[<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/asumo-asattemo/1505389126?i=1505389513&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Link</a>]</span></div></div><div><br /></div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>YORU NO HONKI DANCE: Good ol' Dance Rock</div><div>"By My Side" [2015]</div><div>When watching this music video I already felt like they were a bunch of jokesters, but as I slowly give in to their Dance Rock style rather unique to the Japanese music industry, I've ended up giving more songs than ever, even without being psyched by the male vocalist's dance moves, rather obviously meant to attract a female audience. What really hit me though? It is even in their indie time, this was still simple and solid of a song to be listening to at a time where melodies are additive in nature just to fit lyrics mostly, and there aren't many songs to dance to without hitting the Electronic genre. Those already, make this a solid genre to get into. Song-wise, despite the slower tempo and simple lyrics, the song still gave off what they are good at, a style to dance to.</div><div><br /></div><div>"SMILE SMILE" [2020]</div><div>Five year into them and entering the list of Collection Artists in Klassic Note, they may not be as active as we think they are, but after entering major label in 2016, it has become a different story. From reviving debut albums to singing new songs to dance to, they never fail to impress. Despite a time of sadness, they are still able to come up with songs to impress, and songs to love. With this song and their music video, they have easily proven they can still sing a happy song to remember. Amongst other things, every release of them always has something to remember by, and ever song I have is sure to be a classic every time they pop up. That, I think is just showing the success of their style and production which only makes me anticipate more from them every time.</div><div><br /></div><div><br />THE ORAL CIGARETTES - Becoming Emotional</div><div>"Amy" [2015]</div><div>Ah, do you like love songs? I sure do. Especially when it's different. Cue THE ORAL CIGARETTES, where despite their weird band name, can deliver a love song that is to... love. Obviously aiming for a female audience singing to a supposed female, I then quickly realised how well they write their songs, and with just this single I've given more songs within the year to have gotten a better idea about what they are. From hype songs to emotional songs to remember, they have everything, and they stand out in their own front.</div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>"The Given" [2020]</div><div>Over the years, they have done a whole lot to impress the Japanese music industry. Just hop into one of their live performances shown on TV or live events to hear a list of songs to remember. The point that they themselves can gather male and female audiences alike is not just about singing hype songs which are always different in formula, but also their emotional songs is what brought everyone together even in these tough times. With their album in 2020, their hype songs are overshadowed by their emotional songs in my opinion, and this song along with "Slowly but surely I go on" are tunes that will remind you how they have gotten more emotional and thankful for their growth over the years, and that I can get into. With Anime, they excel. Without Anime, it's where we hear their real them. So real, you can relate to them at every level.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>KANA-BOON - Solid Hype</div><div>"Silhouette" [2015?]</div><div>I did not know KANA-BOON from Anime, surprisingly, but from their live performances on TV, and that's where they got me. On stage, they walk the floor to impress, because just dump in one of their hype tunes and it will not disappoint. Everyone will have their own song to remember, but for me, I started with one of their classics. It's not a 2015 song. but I did start at that time, so hear me out, that's where I started following them for their new songs, and that's what let me stay. This song was mainstream good, and Anime was just the icing on the cake. I would've listened to them even without the credits.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Massara" [2020?]</div><div>I know this is not in 2020, but I listened to this from the best album released in 2020, so this 2019 song would still count. And again, not that the new songs in that year didn't hit me or anything, but this was worth more than a mention to also, compare to what truly means to be them. My impression of them over the years is still excelling on their hype songs, even though they did hit me with emotional songs from time to time. Because it really isn't KANA-BOON with hype songs, whether it's from Anime, drama, or anything else in between, they always can come up with tunes and guitar riffs you wouldn't possibly forget. My initial impression of the song may not be strong, but after hearing this out, this song is full of power, and yet can still tear you up. This is the true appeal of them in my opinion, which is why I never fail to come back to them time and again.</div><div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>SCENARIOART - Turning Mainstream</div><div>"Nana Hitsuji" [2015]</div><div>If you hear them from anywhere starting from their major debut, your impression of them might be the same as mine at this point to, because they are mainstream awkward. Really, saying they are normal would be an insult, because Scenarioart loves to explore on different melodies, and that's what Klassic Note is out there on the search for. The single collaboration with KANA-BOON further cemented my impression of specifically them because they also showed an emotional side of them, which prompted me to find out more about that side of them too. When artists are weird and they turn normal thanks to major labels, they will always turn out better than expected. Trust me, they are a really good example, because you will remember then again every time one of these hits you.</div><div><br /><div>"It's All Right" [2020]</div><div>Years fly by, they have left mainstream and tried to take it out on the world going independent, but somehow since 2018 they have not disappointed in terms of their new songs, trying to engage with their audience despite the weak popularity, because their strong will shows their real passion to keep their music and music style going. Releasing an album during tough times probably wasn't their idea, but the idea to push on under an independent label gives them more freedom to engage the now Internet-cooped audience and show what they are made of. Surprisingly, by leaving mainstream label, they are even better than mainstream, and that is why I say this is what makes them special. With this song and many others in their album, it's always when you want something slightly different that you will remember how great they are, and that applies for me too.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>SPECIALTHANKS - Hardcore Feelings</div><div>"Love begets love"[2015]</div><div>First thing you would notice, that they are the only ones in this list with a Punk Rock style. Yes, you may not have noticed even after hearing this song. That's what their impression to me was. With Misaki singing a love song for their then major 2nd album, you would have never guessed that they are rocking a style so heavy, it almost turned me off the other way. Following their major debut in around 2014 if I didn't remember wrongly, they have sung a couple of times for Anime, which explores two new areas from their usual days as indie: Singing in Japanese, and writing songs less heavy in Punk. Yes, two very drastic changes, which probably would summarise easily for why I would be into them in the first place. Their appeal from turning away from singing English songs only, and the point their Punk Rock style isn't in our faces really stuck to me after hearing this and being amazed on the music video. The song is great, what can I say? The female vocalist might have played a major role though.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Asu mo Asatte mo" [2020]</div><div>Five years into this song, and I'm still giving them songs. They have been releasing songs steadily for a couple more years after 2015, but then died down following band member changes, and after quite a hiatus, they promised to come back with an album in 2020, and I can assuredly tell you, they have never changed. Initially because of the lack of their presence in Klassic Note for years, I was reluctant in giving Punk Rock again because that was all I can remember back then trying to give them songs to no avail, but surprisingly, as I continued to listen to the album, I felt like this was all the same I've seen so far, and that I still liked them. Particularly for this song, it did not really hit me until I realised that this was all that I felt even back then and after all these years, listening to their songs. Their songs reach the heart, it might be hardcore sometimes, but you never forget about their sweet tunes.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>And there you have it. I'm never going to have that dedication to give artists today again, considering Klassic Note now is surrounded by idolism and sort of mainstream artists which have weaker origins where people were together to make music that will be totally different without a producer under their heads. And that's why sometimes I'll take a step out of mainstream and listen to a bit of indie music, because that is where it's at its pure form. It might not be impressive in production, but it's those unique traits in the bands at that time that will create an image to last. Maybe that's why I think they deserve some mention after all this time, and also a compilation.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
