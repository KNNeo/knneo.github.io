Wow do I even remember what I did this week? I mean, you can just look back at
the week of posts I did for that package that FINALLY appeared haha note to self
do not do this again I waited too long I saw those photobooks and came-
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, welcome to Sunday again, the time where you feel bad about living
  because you gotta work tomorrow- Hey, give us four-day work weeks, employers.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well I shouldn't complain because at least I'm not going SIX days a
  week haha can we not talk about this already
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Next month is going to be rad though, as I confirmed the new Klassic Note
  Reviews which will be due by then... subject to me padding more orders and of
  course, the singles that will be releasing in the next couple of weeks... if
  they hit haha ah hey you can't keep printing single-track releases WITHOUT any
  special gifts lol Nasuo-san why
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay, let's Anime and music! Shikimori-san is back again so that's going to be
  hype<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoiS209">

      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span

  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "This girl has always read the room like this, and acted normal with a
      smile. When I think about that, I..." I FEEL DISGUSTED lmao hey Himuro
      isn't that bad she's the most innocent one haha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Yeah Yukimura don't be a life advisor because many will commit suicide because
  of you- Also Kanade-chan did you just do a two-face?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yamamoto is my
  new girl now haha in this new episode where I lost all hope from the cutest
  girl in the series haha (#RikeKoiS209), we... uh... have to look back at her
  problems, eh? I mean, at least without overconfident Yukimura around, we can
  at least give her some due chance. In a nutshell, Kanade-chan likes blue
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/randoseru" target="_blank">backpacks</a> as
  a kid, is an older sister to her brother who likes to cry and break stuff lol,
  and likes to hang around with people. For the last part, that is pretty much
  what they teach you at school. But the others, is what parents (1) think of
  what should be normal for you because you can't determine for yourself and (2)
  do to protect you so you won't get into trouble for the smallest thing you can
  get around with. To be fair, Yukimura's parents probably gave up on THEIR SON
  (lol) which probably made him even more nerdy than he can today to teach where
  he is, and even lucky enough to get someone who is as passionate about science
  as him... without being creeped out by him holding a laptop in a confession
  lmao, still won't understand why Kanade AS A WOMAN has to bear all this burden
  of being normal just because that mother thinks she's a weirdo for, uh,
  beating up the teacher. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Again, like every other drama and/or video
  game plot, if you wonder for a second that your kid is weird and change them,
  you will have effectively killed their personality which may or may not be
  able to recover. As you can see from this week's posts lmao, I have somewhat
  recovered from what I thought was normal besides the getting friends part so
  really should've learnt from "Komi-san" lol Anime joke, but yeah, considering
  I can deliberate this much on an episode which associates this much to me...
  at least I don't have a girlfriend to worry about, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, story.
  With all this normality going on and Kanade pondering about her life, she then
  asked her current boy about what he liked about her. You better answer that,
  dude, it's "normal" for your girl to ask about that shit haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Shikijou
  then talked about his screwed up life so far (because SAME DUDE haha) and you
  know, giving in to a lot of pressure from people around him and screwing up
  that presentation and Kanade (with the help of Yukimura) showing him what's
  up, which to be honest, I would've also liked her at that point if I haven't.
  You may not have everything in life, Shikijou, but you have a NORMAL
  girlfriend now- Okay I'll stop with the normal jokes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Not normal, by
  the way, since normally we joke about how Himuro wants Yukimura bad haha) But
  yeah, just like how Kanade is holding back on her actions just because no one
  would allow to live her life freely, maybe she should've just broken that
  punch machine so she can break up with Shikijou after he got disgusted by her
  actions and call off&nbsp; &nbsp;the experiments that were going on, yes? Haha
  yeah, remember those? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on though, we are teased with school
  festival presentations and what Ikeda Lab will be doing this year besides
  getting sloshed with Torasuke haha, is... a cosplay booth? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well,
  don't think we have to quote to know that appearances matter more than
  anything in seeking out a partner so I lost haha, but yeah, thanks for the
  Himuro fanservice haha I can imagine the two in a room and them doing this
  kinky stuff lmao *YES*, but yeah Torasuke is right we almost want to punch
  Yukimura but he is forgiven for now haha. All in all... I see we have some
  seriously good developments going on from here. If concluding this season is
  some school festival fun and drama, I wouldn't even mind seeing Yukimura
  cross-dressing- No really, please don't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But before that, we might
  have to clear the air between Yukimura and Kanade, and it looks like Chris
  might be into play here so we shall see how he can help with his vast
  experience sinking in boobs lol see you then
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Instead of just Himuro cosplay can we actually get some Amamiya Sora
  cosplay though??? Fans vote for Aqua cosplay from "KonoSuba" series congrats
  on third season btw haha]

      a doctor lol
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Okay between Raidou not doing his zippers previously to the intro over here, I
  am starting to think the best part of this series is frantic Aharen Reina,
  prove me wrong. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though where I think something IS
  wrong with Raidou haha (#AharenSan09), hey if getting sick makes me more
  attractive I should go back to work even if I can hardly breathe- I'll work
  from home, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So firstly, we talk about how the production
  changed out their team of animators who were working on the main guy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  No really, have you ever doubted on that though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah as you can
  see where the joke is, even the sister herself is amazed at how much the
  brother changed just by having a fever. It's like how I get very funny when I
  embarrass myself which is all the hollering in the entertainment industry lol,
  but yeah, this one falls in the category of "why" to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah,
  and they gotta compare it to when he recovered and no one gave a damn lmao.
  Man, quarantine at home for a week will probably send Rikachimalu to Heaven.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next up, new character time, and as hinted by Reina (we will use
  given names now just because) she has two siblings, and other than the
  cross-dressed younger brother Ren lol, this time around we saw younger sister
  Eru who, despite her larger build in every department haha, is also kinda
  scary. Well, I wouldn't call her that because she did end up buying all the
  stuff and telling Raidou what he should get at the arcade to grab a plushie to
  make her sister feel better and THEN gave the groceries to him so he can do
  the deed instead of her... I would say she is a great younger sister.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> From the cooking and the Aharen family (don't ask where the parents
  are lol) eat around, it looks like Eru might have some j-j-j-jealousy going
  for her sister and her boi, but also, that she is maybe
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kuudere" target="_blank">kuudere</a> herself
  and maybe slightly rejective of an appearance of a potential brother-in-law...
  I like where this is going. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, still can't deny that Raidou is
  probably still a good candidate to join your family... at some point even
  though it's still classmate or even school friend relationship... maybe haha
  hey at least Ren-kun is happy about it. Speaking about him, he did drag Raidou
  into going to the supermarket with him though, because why not have more
  wholesome moments to love than just bleed out on because if Tobaru-sensei saw
  more of any of these she might not appear in school for a month. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All
  in all... I'm literally Ren-kun at the end watching those two. So, so much
  wholesome content I can't even .<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, if this Anime is a romance
  series as I've heard rumours of lol, it better deliver since we are at the
  point we have gone through so much we might just see something happen between
  them. Man, this alone will get me excited to see this series through haha I'll

  [TL:DR; As the outro has shown, since Reina can't gauge things for shit (title
  drop lol), Eru is there to help her out lest she buys what, a warehouse of ice
  cream when I would argue if your sister is ill you also shouldn't give her
  any? Haha]

  Seriously though Miyuki, please, PLEASE trust your sister's fashion sense
  because you really don't have any. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, you think Kaguya will like
  this eighth-grade outfit? She gotta, right? She's so into him already and also
  doesn't know much about fashion? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where Miyuki's
  dad is the other way around with fashion which ALSO will disgust me if my dad
  did that haha (#KaguyaSamaS308), we got the lead up to the school festival. We
  are getting there, guys, trust me, we are. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But you know, gotta survey
  Kei-chan's school festival which started earlier... just, turns out that
  getting the brother to go there might be rough. But he is right though, that
  he has been saving to let his sister look better and let the father dress up
  whatever way he is doing lmao, thus doesn't have much left for himself. That's
  the cool guy Kaguya likes, and to no surprise, Kei just returned the favour by
  getting him some REAL clothes and REAL ways to wear them. Like, even I know
  the waist strap is worn on your shoulders from watching not the dad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Maybe Shirogane here has some
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yankee" target="_blank">delinquent</a>
  times, eh? Who knows. You think Kaguya is into this stuff? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking
  of Kaguya, and like her we ignore all the damn tradition and bullsh*t which
  had made this Honshin Festival in Shuchi'in even possible to do at such large
  scale, and whatever Ishigami wants to try to do with Tsubame now that he knows
  the closest guy to that woman is actually dating Osaragi of all people lol ah
  hey, we might have to help Kaguya think of how she wants to confess to
  Shirogane. Yeah, hard to believe I can say that after three seasons of
  "whoever confesses first loses" cr*p haha, but hey, Kaguya gave in. I'll say
  though, in terms of thought, that Shirogane did do it first after he thought
  of studying overseas, but breaking the girl was more vital to the plot of this
  series so hear me out here. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Thanks to the narrator, we know that
  Kaguya is just struggling to hold up to her ideals and just acting like a damn
  b*tch now and wants to confess first before the guys does even though we are
  <strike>somewhat sure</strike> <strike>pretty sure</strike> definitely sure
  this will NOT end up in a rejection unless they want to do it themselves lol,
  is still pegging on Kaguya herself to not be able to do so (probably) even
  with all the rumours around the school festival's magic... or any school
  festival event to be honest it's a way to get people together as long as you
  are involved in some capacity. I don't so I'm single so <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways haha
  <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>, we don't need to know Shirogane's side already we know he will do it in
  this festival it's just when and where the opportunity so I'll look forward to
  that. All in all... you think even this season's ending is going to be sad? I
  hope not, but we gotta brace for it somehow. Just like how Kaguya's chances of
  failing a confession from either side might happen, we gotta think of what
  happens if a confession were NOT to happen. Yeah, she doesn't even know he's
  studying overseas after graduation. Would that be a problem though? I don't
  know. What I do know is people are getting desperate. And that, is DEFINITELY
  potential for a lot of drama we are going to witness in the next couple of
  episodes. Please Kaguya dad don't appear please haha my only fear tbh
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I swear I'm the same reaction as Hayasaka when Kaguya said "I like
  that dude" and really wanted to flip my ears again and do the comedic bit of
  "I can't hear you can you say that again" thing haha also it sounds different
  coming from dear Koga Aoi btw]

  Yeah, don't worry about sitting with Katai and Naruse, Tadano-kun; I wasn't
  the author and I ALREADY PREDICTED THIS LAST WEEK lol in this new episode
  (#KomiSan20) where I took zero notes again to write so let's go through the
  awesomeness that is the school trip to Kyoto! I know, I said Okinawa was great
  just like, two days ago and I'm going to have to change my words again, but
  just like how Inaka fears to step foot into cities in Japan, I also have never
  gone to there in person even though I'm probably more verse than the tour
  guide (voiced by Uchida Maaya by the way, they shared it in
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >the official Twitter</a
  >) about Kinkakuji and others, still can't contain my excitement when it's
  this bunch of <strike>weirdos</strike> people with personalities going to this
  very same trip that every other school goes in Anime. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Almost forgot
  Tadano was the class chairperson so we get to take a look at the groupings in
  the train which are also the groupings to sleep in the inns later. Apart from
  the obvious pairing I mentioned above AND last week be sure to check that out
  I totally nailed that I need to be rewarded with something haha, it's Yamai
  and Nakanaka clapped with some Agari meatballs lmao I'm so sorry Himiko
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, I want to be in Makeru-chan's team and if she loses to me she goes
  into the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onsen" target="_blank">onsen</a> naked haha
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, people figuring out Inaka after this long might be many episodes too
  long I mean Komi-san figured that out already haha, and Komi-san is with the
  quietest group on the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinkansen" target="_blank">Shinkansen</a>.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We have Kaede-chan in the train too right? LET'S GOOOOO problem is
  man, that why is this bus tour guide
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ryokou" target="_blank">Ryouko</a> (that is
  too many Kanji characters to spell her name this exists as a normal name lol)
  so useless but I think we don't need to find out more because mainly these
  guys or most of them do not care about the traditional talk about the scenery
  and landmarks (apart from Komi-san and Tadano) but also probably because we
  already have a narrator we don't need another person to commentate-
  KOMETANI-SAN GO AWAY <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, poor Uchida Maaya for voicing in this
  series as someone I'll just end up forgetting haha. Ignoring her, reaching the
  hot springs inn they were supposed to stay the night in after a day's worth of
  exploring... You know, you know what we want. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And as if Yamai-san's
  desires don't say about ours for the majority of male fans watching this
  series (including the author lol and I don't even know their gender) who wants
  to see Komi-san in the pink so badly <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>, she thankfully is afraid to go
  in the bath similar to Agari-chan but for different reasons lol Komi-san might
  be scared to show her body but Agari is just afraid of being called names.
  Hey, I'll take some meatballs in the Autumn season, don't mind me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Seriously though, stop discriminating on women Yamai-san if you want them
  boobies go touch Agari's or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Tadano had to deal with
  Naruse's cr*p quotes haha, Katai's superior status as someone who can't speak
  to anyone but to delinquents in class so he might as well flex about it, ended
  up enjoying the photo-taking sessions with the dudes with their tops off. HEY
  KOMI-SAN JUST, DUDES BEING DUDES AMIRITE??? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't even want to know
  haha and to top it off while the teacher's not looking, we play some pillow
  fighting! Haha guess who won wrong answers only. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... we
  aren't technically done with this trip yet because there's no confession or
  whatever haha ah hey you want to count that one? Haha even so, I think this is
  a great episode which emphasized on stuff... we weren't supposed to emphasize
  on lol that's the appeal of the series too anyways. As long as Komi-san is
  enjoying herself I don't mind haha cya guys for mor next week

  Man, summer vacation's over and we jump into school festival? Which school in
  their wrong mind does that?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode after we took a
  break for a week and don't ask why (#ShikimoriSan07), we are in school
  festival now apparently. Everything seems to be in order, their class is doing
  animal cafe which sounds pretty normal, who doesn't want to procreate like
  rabbits with Shikimori-san haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, and our dear lion Izumi turned into a
  cat for almost getting into an accident without his girl's permission.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, all is fun and games but specifically there are two things in
  this episode that will make the second half of this arc a lot more spicy than
  it has to, so hear me out. Firstly, about the library duty. Turns out, the
  library which serves as a rest area still needs to run at the three-day long
  festival (Jesus Christ Shuchi'in only gets two days max lol) still needs to be
  taken care by someone, so students take turns to do duty there.
  Coincidentally, we have the Izumi-Kamiya combination. Not that it is a
  combination, but they did the same thing the year before, so I guess at least
  it's acquaintances at this point. Interestingly Kamiya was more interested
  about the year she missed where Izumi was going out with HER idol
  Shikimori-san. Yep, you heard that right; Kamiya is (likely) not interested in
  God of Misfortune Izumi. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah Izumi is right we have never seen
  Kamiya here being more enthusiastic than she was playing volleyball, as the
  three-hour shift ended up just being Izumi sharing his romance experience
  with... possibly the coolest girl in school haha sorry Kamiya-san. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Then, we have the Couple Numbers quest. Well, Hachimitsu called it a quest so
  I'll believe that. Goddamn, and that's why all schools should have this, is
  this quest the most forced and/or most interesting ever because even without
  reward it's already a treat just to have to ask someone of the opposite gender
  out to take a photo just because you both got randomly assigned a number by
  the student council the moment you step into the front gate of the school. I
  mean, asking THREE girls out in your high school life? That's three more times
  than when I did it haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, Shikimori's quest seems to be finding
  whoever is with Izumi lol I meant the number, and possibly trade with them.
  But yeah, coincidences only can last for that long, so don't quote me if I say
  right here and now Kamiya will NOT be handing her number over just because.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Though Shikimori have you ever considered the other way around? Get
  Izumi the number that is same as yours? Hey, just a suggestion if all else
  fails. What is also all else fails is them trying to do this the year before
  where Izumi lost his number and that's why you should rush to take the photo
  IMMEDIATELY lol, thanks to the student council president (who probably drew
  those numbers on the hearts anyways) letting them have it despite losing the
  physical item needed for the photo, helped cement the relationship by giving
  Izumi the push to confess to Shikimori, which is what we have today. (<span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> So
  wholesome... Haha) All in all... what do you think will happen now that we
  know all of this and everything is laid on the table? Are we going to see some
  b*tch fighting even for the wrong reasons because why fight for an unlucky
  loser? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Are we going to have this EPIC TALE of Izumi having to go
  against his love rival Kamiya for- No, nope, not happening. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What will
  happen though, is that I think we have reached a good point of certain
  misunderstanding that next episode is GUARANTEED going to be a huge mess which
  is why I'm here for to be honest haha to we shall see if anyone gets their
  photos taken by then. Haha really makes you wonder how many couples will do
  that just to the the Couple Numbers thing right lol we shall see about that
  next week too

  This week ends May with I guess somewhat well as much as there isn't much to
  end in, as it's filled with Anime theme songs with a surprise at the end so
  that is probably what got me going this week.

  for Anime "Shikimori-san" is a release mess with FOUR versions of releases and
  all tracks streaming online just so you can decide which version you want,
  including an acoustic studio cover of the actual song in the Regular Edition,
  "character-inspired songs" in the Anime Edition, and literally what could've
  been an actual B-side for the Manga Edition which featured an Oonishi Saori
  version too (which was somehow worse lol) so you tell me what I will be
  reviewing next month. (We will talk about them again when the time comes
  btw)&nbsp;<b

  did not catch me with any new songs not even the B-side but I'll still give
  this Anime ending theme song since it does have them good pop vibes I will get
  around to liking.

  which popped in as a surprise to me at least was just probably warm-up for me
  getting back into their songs especially as mentioned last year they lost
  their band's main composer and had to find new ground which I would safely say
  they did, so good for them. Yes and I did give

    >a new song announced</a

  during their recent outdoor live. I am not going to ask for what standards I
  gave for their previous album on this but I'll try to give as much as I can.
  It has been a while and their oldie Rock style isn't exactly easy to give but
  you know, we got more artists coming back this year with new songs so that's
  real nice for this Klassic Note 15th year to be honest<br />
  <br />So next week on Klassic Note, we are literally starting the month with
  new songs straight off the bat, with <b>Hakoniwalily's new single</b> for
  Anime "Aharen-san" and <b>Suzuki Airi's new single</b> for Anime
  "Kaguya-sama". Yep, we haven't left Anime songs yet. Anime songs has not yet
  left us haha. Neither I'm typically interested in so we shall see if they can
  make the cut to be in Klassic Note Review for the year.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  With all my obligations I've done just even earlier in the day in which I have
  to be forced to <span style="font-size: x-small;">exercise</span> amongst all
  things lol, I'm just glad that I don't have to think about more stuff that my
  lazy a** doesn't want to do. Really, at some point I'm going to hate typing
  all of this out- Well, not yet anyways. I still like the path I chose, I can
  only have neck pains for the rest of my life even with the healthy stuff I
  should be doing instead of being in the <i>metaverse</i> lol <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, but I
  like this kind of freedom, I truly do. Maybe not mentioning my obligations is
  better no one does that for their news articles. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week
  then, and until next time... really, if you need something to look at and be
  impressed with and you haven't been on Instagram looking at beautiful women
  the previous post of this blog would be a good recommendation. Haha bye<br />
