From listening to songs I heard as a kid playing video games when I was working (<span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>), to earlier today I was watching some Twitch streamer reviewing his old videos... These might have hit me too hard than I would want to. Hey, better not think of quitting my job now until things get peaceful and THEN we can jump haha note to self please<div><br></div><div>Ignoring nostalgia, I got to move forward, so moving forward, let's watch some Anime and listen to new songs! Well next week won't have many new songs so that sucks, but hey, last week's still new. Also, good reminder that I'm STILL not getting laid this year OR have anyone to go out with on Valentine's Day OR even someone to give me chocolates lol but yeah, should've done some stupid promise to a girl in middle school to date each other if we're still single by 30. *looks at my age* Oh well, can't turn back time now haha lets do this then that stream took the whole Sunday morning already</div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan80><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"From here on, things will not go your way. Only Eren will get what he wants" Oh man...</div></blockquote>Wow dude, thought I got over not watching Grisha kill all those people including Frieda but f**k me man. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Now that my brain is scarred for life and that's why you can't air these until after midnight lmao, in this new episode (#AttackOnTitan80) I can only tell you it'll be more exciting for you if you have always thought that Zeke is correct. No really, it blew my mind, what a plot twist from last week. Anyways, they have to fight it out now, I've seen so much blood I don't even want to talk anymore lol, but seriously, is it an action series if you don't see red? I mean, look at "BLEACH". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, story. I don't even know how to start. Let's talk about origin story. This is easy, as we see Ymir reflect on her past after we know Eren is in control... maybe know he's still in shackles, and as Zeke ordered Ymir to do what he desires which is euthanization this is still a thing by the way, Ymir recalls her past of how she lived in a village eons ago. So, long story short, it's your usual 2k years ago village being pillaged by what looks like medieval knights or whatever, and the whole village either got erased or the people were enslaved to do what they please. Typical of that time unlike the peace we have today in real life, but what made her different is she let someone go out of kindness. That, she got ratted out by the other slaves just because one of their eyes are on the line lol, and the leader of that tribe let her go. Of course, if you think those barbarians who enslaved people would be nice at this point, think again. For letting her go is to chase her down as an example of defying orders, and... she barely managed to survive. Falling into some body of water and encountering a parasite of some sort though (I swear I read the mid-episode summary of that origin, and only thought of it as parasite since can this even look like God? lol) (Yeah sounds like a parasite which can become Titan big if in contact with human anatomy), Ymir transformed into a Titan, and that's where our true story began. She proved useful when going back to the tribe of the Eldians (OOF <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>) and even allowed them to expand and conquer enemies like the Marleys (DOUBLE OOF <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>) to dominate the land. (Like, why not just kill the guys who enslaved you though? lol ok me) Sadly or if you think otherwise, all it takes for one soldier to throw a spear at the leader and Ymir's sacrifice for the Lord immediately turned her into a dead body... and that's where we saw the Paths. So summary, human meets plankton and becomes Titan, doesn't really die after death but since she's the Founder here, no one is there to heal her actual body so she heals the next guy who appears most likely unless their life runs out holding those powers which if you need a reminder is about 13 years OR gets eaten by others which is why probably no one will step in here unless the former happens before the latter which is unlikely because remember the passing of powers? *nods head* So yeah, that is pretty much it, this series, we figured it out. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, coming back, turns out the walls are Ymir's three children which also likely hold part of her powers as "creations", but even ignoring that, we know Ymir thinks she doesn't have a right or say even after death, which is why she still obeys every command of the Eldian descendants who appear in here. Ironic, that's Zeke, but Eren had other ideas. Forcibly removing the chains on his arms like he's a Titan lmao, he convinced Ymir to make decisions on her own, and I guess we didn't know that she is innately evil? I mean, if you undo the walls and give Eren your Founding Titan powers ie. do The Rumbling, I'll pretty sure you're evil. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> With the unlocked power, Eren addressed every Eldian that is still alive (hopefully not those outside of the island but who knows) his original intention and in case you haven't figured it out and still think Zeke is going to make things happen, which is: To use Eldian... found Titan powers to eradicate all humans outside of the island completely. Yep, you heard that right, Gabi was pardoned for shooting Eren in the neck. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, who knows what happened to her now, okay? But yeah, Armin was not exactly right since the power was now NOT used to fight Marley's incoming forces but in a more general term... let's just say there are millions or even billions of people out there to erase, and Eren's going to attempt the very first speedrun. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> All in all, goddamn this is getting better by the episode, I feel like we're close to the end. What will happen of Eren's ego, and what happened to Zeke now? We shall find out soon, but looks like we going to clean up the mess soon so we can approach Eren for... anything at this point I don't know, to stop him? Haha we shall see how to do that or otherwise soon enough</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXSsoESzbPMJY-7iwk6axmGyOLsLTJeV_nr_KSi84GdhEFy1NZUZOyX7kpOV3iOtQ5p6iZpiUkMK8rsTgPVmRzwm5RXQVLwXKzeA0BKbkTFGJC9rV8ciXmc5R0ZqDCwXRB-4r4NXBM897I9wvJNtXWhD1zHmtbaoz63GXJcdCaOpwQ3A/s320/attackontitan80_ymir2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>My colleagues during lunch on my first day at work<br>("New guy buys the drinks" lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbXs9CY8JQ-MxFZsTqFyj2fQVIMGFtpNH8o_cNh9POyd7Rtqg6pfy8_AjVCYNaOZ9xnINuM7gNsJaqjySG68ECjKgsJjLURPQGp7pTNLT-wgeIqhVmT2jmeZtY6GbflIoBnql8NTZkgDLuHkGj-1RrKL9Pn3ceXtLX8sbPQDabicj83A/s320/attackontitan80_ymir3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW Eren wants to be the bad guy lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Oh well can't get away from that now you're born in one<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSanS306><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Oh, I hope she doesn't think that I want to ask her out (on the rooftop)" Oh well, Nishikata, she might think otherwise but okay <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Haha wow that was some cute opening singing right there. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh, it's called the "la la la" version, by the way, very cute. No, that is NOT Takagi-san because they want you to know opening theme song artist Ohara Yuiko is cute too. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> In this new episode where we kick-off the school festival lol (#TakagiSanS306), whoever thought of the dumplings role needs to be kicked out of school. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, do you want a coincidental screw-up and end up with a happy ending together, or create that coincidence and then end up as if nothing happened? The latter is part of my school life I'll never tell lmao, but the former sounds like a classic romance plot waiting to unravel. And I think this is it, this episode. So, story. The school festival is up, the guys are still rehearsing for the play of course, so Nishikata how did you think that you asking Takagi out to the rooftops is because you wanted to confess... Yeah right like that'll happen. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, don't jinx it, me, he has to do it at some point because I can't imagine the marriage proposal from the girl lmao. Anyways, rehearsal is going on real well, Yukari is too anxious as director it's hard for her to eat and sleep lol poor girl, and before your eyes can blink, it's the actual day. Nishikata thought a showdown on walking through the haunted house in the festival would freak Takagi out just because he intended to go 10 rounds on it first lol, but we all figured out that Takagi isn't afraid of anything and Nishikata freaks out at anything so yeah, guess who won. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or Takagi knows someone inside the maze and gets them to show her the shortcut out. Haha Nishikata you have no idea. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, straight to the actual event, the play. A lot of things happened before and during the play which made Yukari mad probably since the script got ruined somehow, but of course, we get to see the actual main couple come together at the end. How though? Well it all started with lunch where Kimura had to, and I say, HAD TO, join the eating contest, so him having to later be in the main role of the class' play might prove to be an issue but we will mention that again later, but as the class managed to follow the script perfectly the teacher was enjoying so much we won't shed more tears of laughter or sadness than that dude lol, but yeah, at least Nishikata didn't screw up his part as Dumpling A lmao. Good for him, for something else is about to happen that will turn the tides on this play. So, bringing back Kimura's diarrhoea which should be happening around now, he had to bail for the toilet in line with the final scene of the play which according to Mina-chan, the princess and that pig (I meant Juliott lmao) had to die together so what's better than that than getting Nishikata to be the replacement and THEN letting Takagi trip on a fake chestnut which Kimura dropped earlier so Nishikata can be the hero and actually save the princess from her fall. Man, like, you feel that?? THAT is how you know you found the right guy. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Of course they had to fake it out considering the pig head is not on the prince after the save, and the princess fell instead of kill herself with a knife lol. Also, probably not like Nishikata can remember the lines for the prince in record time to not screw up, so you know, at least they made it sound like they were together with the power of love or something. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, I know, Takagi is totally enjoying this haha. Like really, Nishikata wished the curtains will draw down faster as in just drop the cloth down immediately so he can avoid another second being in embrace with Takagi-san...? Please kill me now, please. Someone give me the dagger prop. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, what is with the ending animation it's so much chibi haha, Houjou is MVP of this episode prove me wrong lmao, and Takagi probably enjoyed every single part of that last scene of the play dropping hints to the innocent dude who technically did save her skin during the actual play. Good for you Nishikata, I already know why I'm not getting laid in middle school because I wasn't nice enough to save some girl around me who was about to eat the ground. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Like, what more do you want from this series? I feel like I've had my fill like how Kimura is after lunch at the festival, and I think I'm going to have to go to the toilet real soon, so I hope that is only in 6 weeks time when this series end and I cry in the toilet about my lonely existence. Happy Valentine's Day everyone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; I'm pretty sure Nishikata is his voice Kaji Yuki as a middle schooler minus the romance probably lmao]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1888 data-original-width=1280 height=472 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgY-5KVa2Td3dxyvDoWDBNGwKKQePKCBgSFEy6s3dJkQppFVeP99WNRqgFSf_NShAOuULKTcMp5-YQi2PzVw0RbyVBJbrlu99et8bISPi4tvgu1TND1ZrQBkT0bo9QEhH2FyOfVZ92ZUe6aBxlEtfW6jrT6brqqwMKx0JGkMRlTptEpWQ/s480/takagiS306_takagi1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is so perfect, I did not regret stitching this together<br>(Says Mina-chan who made the costume haha what)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiExw3PBRK1LJhx2eyZ9d9SrIvZbCVNkk_ohQoVIwJtE7ey363VaTRY34GuIEjwF1c3Yucau41g8OZ633j0PR2t0WVRLartMwLCRgMy7mmHirYb5GhsiFdyaJlI1O3iGRjU825IF1TKoJOe2Cz1Q9j7LV7XM7HLT5DFG5E5aGL4O4ZuJQ/s320/takagiS306_hug2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Takagi is sooo enjoying herself right now I can't even</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGNObXRKk8RQipuJ-rpXFY8EwV-bgHnM0QW_K_N4ecmUE89AdheWSBSS86fx7TOOlIWCE9h1UUT6_q97Tvwfnibcc8sLzXBxuOrS778VI-xiY69FsKj-fxi_bcQp48Vm1QpSDTDK1a9Cs3H5YnHPnAeoxav8aOCxunZh4FIn0BC9gKsg/s320/takagiS306_save.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Gotta say though, this clutch save is what gets the girls in<br>(Also, isn't her crotch facing the audience?

You ready, loners? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know, me too, me too. But hey, have you ever wondered, how you can look handsome, even if you didn't do anything? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Well, don't reference this series not every girl wants to be a cosplayer haha. Anyways, you know what is more interesting than getting excited for cosplay? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Talking about story, of course, where we pick up the pieces Kitagawa dropped of her affection of Gojou saying she's beautiful? Hey, I'll fall in love with this guy too if I were her. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, first half, we talk about Kitagawa's sudden change of heart. Well, I mean, do you not anticipate that though? It's in the title, please. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But you get the idea, yeah? But personally I also wonder if Gojou meant what he said... as he dozes off on the train so really, who knows right? But hey, it's not like Gojou won't be into Kitagawa. I mean, he'll be into her once we- MOVING ON haha, the Gramps is back home after two weeks of recovery... after discovering stockings brought home by the grandson, got stunned again the second time after seeing a girl at his shop, then actually found out the truth because why go the normal visit-your-grandparent-at-the-hospital route when you can do it right at home? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Definitely not a "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40839/Kanojo_Okarishimasu target=_blank>KanoKari</a>" Episode 1 reference lmao) And boy, did I enjoy every bit of Kitagawa fangirling over one Gojou Wakana just because... technically he didn't say it to her directly, but you know, you gotta go wild over it, right? It's high school, man, you can go crazy as a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gyaru target=_blank>gal</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Not as much as her family history though, so we'll leave her and her cooking at that for now lol. Next up, amongst all this wholesomeness I wish I can enjoy more, but I guess we forgot this is a romance Anime so our new character is here. Surprise surprise, it's a girl haha, and maybe Gramps letting her into the shophouse was a mistake. Like, a HUGE mistake. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Apart from not realizing that his dear grandson here doesn't have any friends apart from the one future girlfriend hehe don't say I predicted that (lmao), it's probably on Wakana's side to think that opening the door to the showers to catch a potential scammer would be a good idea. Because... yeah, remember this series has <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> references? I thank animation studio Aniplex for doing God's work of NOT letting me watch literal porno haha, but I think the flashback-enforced scene that was witnessed by Gojou Wakana right here might be too detailed and ironically hilarious he might as well surrender himself to the police on spying on a naked girl in the bathroom. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I mean... <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, surprise surprise x2, she's here for the outfits Wakana made, and of course it's not of the hina dolls or else he would've gotten laid LONG ago haha sorry bro, but also precisely because Wakana has seen the Nether universe lmao, he is now blackmailed to make outfits for, wait for it, Kitagawa's favourite cosplayer of all time. Yep, complicated now, isn't it? Probably not as much as how new girl Inui Sajina a.k.a. Juju-san (I'll refer to her as Sajina, she has a sibling and I need my thumbnail renames lmao) thought of the couple when she stalked this rising popularity of a new cosplayer ever since the one outfit got uploaded onto the World Wide Web, is here to ask the master to make an outfit tailored to her figure. Yes, that petit, flat, totally not washboard figure- *gets beaten up by Juju-san* Anyways haha, too much not Anime references within an Anime to be honest I almost want to throw up at what was this, a potential <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yuri target=_blank>yuri</a> Anime series? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, Gojou, its intended audience is for small girls. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I won't say much about the blackmail tbh since Kitagawa will find out about that somehow and not like they can do anything about Gojou's crime anyways lol, but now that we have some love triangle going on I can't wait to see how many people want this guy to be doing cosplay outfits his whole life. Hey, remember this series was about hina dolls? Not anymore! Haha I can see all the relationship chart lines happening just like Blaze, so I think we'll leave that to future episode where we see if Gojou can hold on to his <strike>purity</strike> <strike>sanity</strike> virginity before his high school graduation lmao Happy Valentine's Day btw haha</div><div>[TL:DR; "I'm totally in love with Gojou-kun!"

I miss emotional or softer songs. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, let's talk about them. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/yowataribeta-no-aishikata/1604559147?l=en" target=_blank>Kuso Iinkai's latest album</a></b> signalling their return is one in a while especially when it took them a month to get from release date into music streaming, so I'm still glad I got to hear more of them and miss what they are to like, because I really liked it. I didn't give everything though, just a couple of songs as usual. What was released this week though, ignoring yanaginagi's collaboration single which I am not listening to, is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B8%E3%83%83%E3%83%88/1607058308?l=en" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new album</a></b>. Yeah, my dear <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a>. The whole album of new songs  exclusive to this release is pretty intense though as a whole, so I would say I gave almost half of the is it 9? Yeah, new songs I've not heard of before including the <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/harenoba-take-over/1607058308?i=1607058310&amp;l=en" target=_blank>topic song</a> of the album written by yours truly from UNISON SQUARE GARDEN Takushi Takuya because I heard he was a guest in her late night radio show so I nailed his name now haha, but yeah with Nan-chan's powerful singing it's hard to not write songs that don't make you stand up and rock in high times. That's what I felt from it though, and recently been burnt out giving such songs including Anime theme songs so I wish I could hear something like Yukarisa from same time last year, but I eventually got into it. So yeah, congrats on being the new Collection Artist before Asakura Momo's new single in March which might not even make her one. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> That's called simping, boys. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br> On news concerning music and I've liked on Twitter so I can remember to mention it here, <b><a href=https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1491320967435481090 target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new song</a></b> for her upcoming album literally brought me back to the 80s for some reason lol "don't know why" (get it, because the song title), I definitely missed <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ORESKA_Official/status/1491256539491217410?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>ORESKABAND's rehearsal livestream</a></b> where I guess they tipped hints for their upcoming album, I did join in though on <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1491366275267788803?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new album release livestream</a></b> where she also announced her yearly "Shiina Day" event which I won't be going just because, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1491336065126387713?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>Aimer's 2nd song for THE FIRST TAKE on YouTube</a></b> has been <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1491424604489134085?s=20&amp;t=eSZ9dpxVXu-UJcnnu7poYg" target=_blank>on Twitter Trending</a> for that night in case you didn't notice and it's her new song the good one (haha), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1491740717789581314?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia released live footage</a></b> of their live from last year with the face reveal of Mia-san by the way and singing the love song from her previous album only makes that even better (hehe), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1491970270244098068?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new album tracklist</a></b> revealed collaborations with many artists so I hope that means it'll be good lol, I rather skip listening to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1492066956899667969?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>yanaginagi's selection album preview</a></b> just because I can do it again after I'm done with those three albums the week after haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1492079435545460743?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>miwa's new song</a></b> for her upcoming album isn't exactly awesome but I guess I'll get around to it anyways, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1492340942975627267?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new video</a></b> on YouTube was from their previous livestream I missed and I think I'm only liking this song more, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sambomaster_txt/status/1492408206542663682?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>Sambomaster's new song</a></b> is for a movie and will be released the week after but I'll get around to that later lol #ThreeAlbumFebruary, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1492453427435036673?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>ClariS is releasing a new album in April</a></b> with a teaser after I lost count since even their previous song half a year ago, And <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ohara_yuiko/status/1492449056031125504?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>Ohara Yuiko's new song "la la la" version</a></b> is probably the cutest thing you'll hear all week. No really, just take a listen, you'll get the gist even if you don't watch the Anime haha<br><br>So for next week, we got a week's break so the calm before the storm which is next week with THREE ALBUMS Jesus Christ haha, but yeah, I do have some things to listen to. Accidentally hit into another song from <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1492148691972784130?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank><b>Cwondo</b></a>, so I'll be giving the one by this week even. I also listened to <b>wacci's new song</b> which is something for my emotional fix after all the action this year, and since I did dig into one of the retweets from Nan-chan's official artist Twitter crediting all <a href="https://twitter.com/SHITkojiro12250/status/1491354112314994696?s=20&amp;t=eSZ9dpxVXu-UJcnnu7poYg" target=_blank>the</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/huyuyasumi_/status/1492087918655324160?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank>artists</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eba_cadode/status/1491390628923867145?s=20&amp;t=eSZ9dpxVXu-UJcnnu7poYg" target=_blank>who</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RON_SDF/status/1491308175727153156?s=20&amp;t=eSZ9dpxVXu-UJcnnu7poYg" target=_blank>participated</a> in creating her album (so that's links to one of the producers/composers/lyricists of each of the 4 songs I gave in the album hehe), I'll be listening to some <a href="https://twitter.com/huyuyasumi_/status/1485995102724104195?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw" target=_blank><b>Sasagawa Nao</b></a> who did besides the lyrics because done by yours truly, for <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/super-dearly/1607058308?i=1607058334&amp;l=en" target=_blank>one of the songs</a>. Ironically I hit on her latest single which is (after some research reading headlines and then understanding it is) a self-cover of a song she wrote for an idol group but I guess I like her solo version more, so maybe I'll listen to more from her. So yeah, the Alternative music fix I need next week to tune myself back in order to give more mainstream stuff the week after I guess. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Look, you guys have no idea how much my roots are into Alternative music okay?</div><div><br></div><div>Or maybe since I work on alternate days at home including tomorrow maybe I'll watch a couple of live archives I have on hand for months and have no watched them. We shall see.<br><br><br><br><br>...</div><div><br>Feeling lonely now, punk? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, it's tomorrow, and don't worry, as long as you work from home and don't step out of the house tomorrow on a Monday... let's just stay at home today on a Sunday too and play some DOAXVV just in case haha <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Cya guys next time though, and until then... if someone were to make me a Valentine I wish it was...<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Oh well it's tomorrow but it's... whoever appears in that Wordle-like quiz I made for myself haha so it can be anybody I'll update later hehe (Edit: Hidaka Rina I guess!
