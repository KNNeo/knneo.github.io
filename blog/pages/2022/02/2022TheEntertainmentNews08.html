Wow yesterday was quite a day. In a matter of hours, I went to dinner with my
family and really had a unsatisfactory meal just because I wanted dimsum and the
place failed to deliver even though we're eating a dimsum buffet with
complimentary abalone and shark's fin (lol yeah), I bought myself some digital
photobooks from Amazon as a gift to myself continuing my ideals of not full on
buying physical goods, and my bro gave me an Amazon gift card to buy more. The
last one, he placed a Sumipe image just because lol, and I guess I have to give
back to him at some point and I really think giving him game credit would help
with his terrible
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/gacha" target="_blank">gacha</a> luck lol, but
yeah, the night has been fun. Earlier in the day... I forgot what I did so of
course it's good haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>...</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I do remember Ten-chan appearing in my dreams though, will talk about that for
  outro I guess <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    And in case you haven't noticed how I can chill this much this week, say
    goodbye to work from home for the past two weeks after this week and say
    hello to the new package of the year! Yeah, I'll tell this much but for the
    latter you can find out more in the previous posts so please do so it'll
    make me happy knowing you think I'm a creep simping on bromides lmao
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    So, let's get into the Anime and music! Quiet week for music but I did scoop
    up a lot of songs though, and I'm already hyped for next season's shows
    so... hey we are halfway there let us enjoy these while we can!
  </div>

    </blockquote>
    Oh well, there goes the walls that are supposed to protect them, I guess.
    You think anyone now alive have witnessed the building of these walls?
    Probably not huh. In this new episode where Eren is God now lol what a
    surprise (#AttackOnTitan81), we are taking our revenge against humanity.
    Well humanity that is not Eldian, of course. Whether that will be a success
    or will it have much resistance, you have to remember that the world is
    fully capable of killing titans using modern weaponry so they still have a
    chance... probably I don't know for sure. Is it too late to migrate?
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Audience: To where?) (Yes haha) Anyways, it appears that people
    outside of Paradis Island also will know seeing that dude heard it too, so
    yeah, I guess you can rat out Eren if you want to. So, story. Story goes
    that everyone heard of Eren's message because he's God now haha same joke,
    so we can assume, amongst all the assumptions of the people right now inside
    the island, that Eren is likely doing a genocide of the people outside of
    the island probably sacrificing himself if he has to. Like, you know, no
    exceptions. Which first worries Gabi, now that Falco is gone in the fight
    and already in the hands of Jean and others, decide to find him back even
    though as Armin mentioned, he might be the Jaw Titan now considering his
    body is still intact. So Gabi managed to somehow reunite with the farm
    family she betrayed because they got found out being Marleyeans, somehow
    saved her from interrogation from the Scouts who didn't know about this
    professional sniper holding what seems like

      >Soifon's bankai from "BLEACH"</a
    >
    lol good reference me, followed them to safety in order to find Falco out
    through sources, eventually knowing that Connie took him to, you heard that
    right, feed his mom who has been in a coma for years. Oh well, we gotta
    sacrifice someone. Figured it'd be Falco lol hey in their defence Falco is
    already hard to save the moment Zeke screamed so I'm not going to comment
    too much. Not going to look forward to Gabi's wedding at any point lol they
    may not have any guests haha SPEAKING OF THEM <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, they are
    doomed, so let's move on and talk about the remaining Titans that have to be
    dealt with within the island, thanks to Zeke's scream. Yes, Pyxis is
    included in this so RIP him I guess he loved to drink though so that's on
    him really, but as the bodies pile up, the gang now not including Connie had
    to help the local military clear out the big ones so they can at least
    protect what is left of their hometown. Well, said for whoever that piece of
    shit is, Yelena and the others are still in wonder how all of this happened
    and how they got betrayed by Eren I mean NO SHIT lol, but instead are under
    control of... whoever that dude is who didn't die and got saved? Goddamn,
    should've just done him first. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All in all, a clean-up episode it
    seems after the great decision-making twist from Eren, and just a hint of
    what was about to become of Annie as Armin found out that Reiner's armour is
    totally gone. Yep, Annie, remember her? Last encased on armour because she
    thought she could run away from all this? Yep. I wonder what role she can
    play in this though, maybe run fast enough to get to Eren at this rate?
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next episode, it looks like we have to deal with the human element
    bullsh*t again, and as we have always learnt even in real life, it is never
    smooth and will never go the way we want. See ya guys then haha

    </blockquote>
    Yeah okay I really am not selling on
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a>
    that isn't female so Nishikata if you could stop being such a problem...
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well, what'cha gonna do about it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Anyways, in this new
    episode where Nishikata has never once touched a dog lol I shun from them
    and I have btw so I don't know how he managed to do this (#TakagiSanS307), I
    guess let's just let him have it his way for once, yes? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So firstly,
    walking the dog. It looks like Takagi had a chance to walk someone else's
    dog I legit thought she bought one because of Nishikata lmao anything is
    possible dude, but yeah, looks like someone else is more enthusiastic about
    it than the other. Hey, Nishikata be like an elementary kid full of
    curiosity, what can I say. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But yeah, he's hiding it all the way
    until Takagi gave him the chance (it's like Eren but Takagi is Eren now lmao
    AoT joke) to go ahead first by running with the dog, and letting him play
    with the dog at the shrine which was the assigned destination. You know, so
    Takagi herself can take photos from afar and slot in a video while she's at
    it haha what you think that didn't happen? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, I'm just
    second-guessing Takagi now don't mine me haha. Now I just have to wonder if
    she called him out to hang out just because she had an excuse to. Also let
    me spell it out for you bro, that's called "<a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kimigairu/1536261678?i=570061382&amp;l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >kimi ga iru</a
    >
    kara" haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span> Hey, praise me for my Japanese I won't stop you from
    watching more Anime to learn of this. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Moving on, Nishikata had to
    go back and take his homework but Takagi insists on going back with him,
    also dealing with the remnants of the school festival. Remember the best
    scene of that play where Takagi was in Nishikata's embrace sort of? Yeah,
    now everyone wants to be together somehow, and just like Yukari-chan lol,
    they had to let the dude believe Takagi was just, you know, actually trying
    to spend more time with him, as if no one else which includes Mano-chan and
    his boy, thinking these two were an item. I mean, not yet. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey
    Sanae, we know that, thanks for the update. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But seriously though,
    until the day Nishikata can be cool and admit being with a girl is a thing,
    he'll only escape out of the window of the restroom and evade all
    embarrassment if possible, I tell you. Next up, looks like it's Christmas
    soon, and ignoring the three girls who are probably not getting laid by
    Santa anytime soon lol please Sanae because dear Mina-chan still believes in
    that old man don't ruin it for her. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, looks like for the
    library duty Nishikata be reading about the dogs now lol he just brushed it
    off like how anyone normally would, and Takagi be knitting? Yeah, and
    Nishikata wondered who it was for- I&nbsp;like how she didn't let Nishikata
    ask who is the recipient until he has to say himself? Haha this is a great
    series. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Process of elimination man, gotta eliminate yourself out of
    shame though. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But yeah, Takagi probably lied here because (trust
    me) it's (not) the neighbour's dog who needs a scarf or some sort. Hey, what
    do I know, Takagi is hard to read just as a person. She got her shame too,
    you forgot how her boy wanted to walk her home and she said no? That.
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All in all, I recommend Nishikata to listen to more love songs to
    get used to whatever awkwardness that may require him to seek medical
    assistance soon lol it's not great for the heart btw, and Takagi at some
    point you should not leave your boy hanging. People getting a little
    impatient of the fact that you guys AREN'T together already lmao more of
    these next week I guess

        Gojou-kun you know <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    Okay where's the jealousy part because I can't wait two more episodes to do
    this- Oh, we not there yet? Dammit haha in this new episode though
    (#KiseKoi07) we go a little further in all directions it seems, and that's a
    good thing. Nothing's better than opening your vision outside of hina doll
    making and actually looking at naked women- So, let's talk about the naked
    one first. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Since they technically signed a contract with Gojou not
    getting any payment because Juju-san here will be spending it all on a
    studio rental lol not really but, the other two offered her payment for part
    of the rental in exchange of doing cosplay together, which great news, she
    agreed, so yeah we get so step into the world of professional(?) cosplayers
    and how they do it. But first, and I like how this series never forgets
    their worlds inside worlds, we gotta watch that "Blaze!" series first. Yeah,
    all 126 episodes of them. For your information, the "Attack on Titan" series
    is not even going to end nearly close to this, which shows how bored we are
    collectively watching old series which were then popular because we didn't
    have access to the broader Internet just like Wakana here is too. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
    Oh yeah, we are in an age where DVDs still exist in Japan (they still do
    FYI) and Netflix isn't invented yet so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So looks like instead of
    Gojou picking up on the series on digital we get to go to Kitagawa's place
    to get them, and boy was that a joy to watch. Yes, I'm talking about the
    girl herself. Of course I refer to her contacts, what are you saying dude
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, in-love Kitagawa thought it'll be a great idea to get him
    to stay to watch the series with her just because they can spend more time
    with each other (<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span> Takagi, watch and learn) (haha), and besides the
    unsurprising otaku room of dear Maria-chan here, I think Gojou summarized it
    perfectly but I'll add on to it, that Anime is just magic girls
    fist-fighting in front of a gay couple after turning to the dark side
    because you can't get laid. Why am I not a magical girl. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also
    interesting is when Kitagawa offered to cook for her dear boi and him having
    to think twice about that lmao, but hey I gotta say the guest is here to
    watch the series so it can lighten his load bringing it back which I highly
    doubt you are doing so just stay the night here dude haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span> Kitagawa
    did a GREAT job at cooking NOT
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/omuraisu" target="_blank"
      >omelette rice</a
    >
    because her eggs ran out (lol get it because whatever whatever women stuff)
    which was a joy to listen to the surprises every time when Gojou said "<a
      href="https://jisho.org/search/cha-han"
      target="_blank"
      >fried rice</a
    >" lol it sure looks like it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Last but not least, we continue on
    the journey of Inui Sajina. She is still impressed by Gojou every time he
    speaks, from this being his first attempt at making an outfit, how they
    don't have a proper camera just using a smartphone, and how they can't just
    Photoshop Kitagawa's rack to make hers bigger without having to pad them
    physically until she can't breathe lol, but suffice it to say they can learn
    one thing at a time. I mean, for Kitagawa, that is. Why is Gojou so
    enthusiastic about cosplay- HOLY SHIT THE CAMERAWOMAN IMOUTO IS BIG <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
    (Yeah Gojou, as in height, what of it) (lmao) All in all, it looks like
    moving on, we might see more technical stuff going on because man did I
    almost doze off with them talking about Anime and/or taping in cosplay so if
    you don't mind me I'll take a nap for now thinking about how Kitagawa loves
    Gojou so much I can't even <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys then
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; I think I can say that if you didn't like whatever loli fighting
    series is in that Anime inside of this Anime, I'm legally allowed to sue you
    for renting that <strike>DVD</strike> Blu-Ray BOX from your local video
    rental shop or vending machine haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span>]

    his music library thanks to the one song he wrote for Natsukawa Shiina's new
    album. Out of that context, I've listened slowly and back in time so in
    descending chronological order thanks to YouTube (Music)

    a year before that. Yep, heard them all already I pretty much covered all
    the bases at this point besides his digital singles from between the album
    and now, so I'll stop there I may have listened too much haha. I've listened
    to him from being indie and sounding rough and Rock-based though
    Alternative, to being more niche and pop and eventually it's just way more
    distinct than when he started in 2018. So good for him man, I might just
    keep a lookout for future releases if I have some time in the future. And I
    padded it with some

    be released which are (in no particular order)

    in years so let's see if it's actually good. After all this is done, then I
    will consider moving on to
    <b>Akase Akari's new single for Anime "KiseKoi"</b> and sink in to her
    cosplay goodness if I still care about it lol, and
    <b>yanaginagi's selection best album</b> if I have the time. This, is going
    to be a week full of songs I will not give because I'm going to get burnt
    out on Wednesday haha we shall see<br />

    Oh yeah, dreaming of Ten-chan, dear Amamiya Sora. To put it simply because I
    am lazy to write dream recollection posts lol sorry me from the past, I
    vaguely remember seeing her walking around in a rush while taking off her
    makeup (lol) and since I can walk in pace with her and she was busy doing
    what she was doing, I took a selfie with her in the background, with
    thoughts of sharing to my bro (the one at the start of the post) and
    constantly asking her to slow down and being concerned about why she didn't
    just stop walking and do it instead and also looking forward to her without
    makeup which is probably the most important imo <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, Ten-chan, I
    look forward to the day we will be together, whichever universe or timeline
    it might be. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> We wouldn't have talked in high school even if mine
    is in Japan though, so don't think too much, me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> Cya guys next time
    then, and until next time... I can't wait for this month to be over so I can
    see Nan-chan's photobook from last year go on sale so I can exercise my
    gifted credits to buy it on Amazon Kindle. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span> Bye oh and also Ede-chan
    is cute I can't wait for her new photobook next month lmao that's the real
    reason I want this month to be over
