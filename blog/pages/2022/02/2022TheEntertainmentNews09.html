Do you guys know of Chat Jukebox? It's a thing in Twitch where streamers allow
viewers to submit their short clips or videos (on YouTube, mostly) and it is
compiled and played back to back, so it's basically a bunch of trash and memes
and good stuff depending on the audience who paid to submit them. Yes, it's
paid, or else it's going to be 100% cr*p haha so yeah, that was fun to watch,
great catch-up on the stuff I may have never known of because I'm just an Anime
weeb who only watches a set amount of drama and/or listen to Japanese music
which probably was a thing for the world a decade ago.
<div><br /></div>

<div>
  Oh well, what'cha gonna do haha ANYWAYS!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> We got more shows to watch
  this week, and my weekend is running short thanks to that livestream. I also
  spent most of Saturday outside so you know next week for me at work is going
  to suck because I didn't stay at home enough lmao let's get to it then my
  hair's getting long haha

      the island? Geez haha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Well, looks like many are "giving their hearts" to the Eldian genocide cause,
  eh, Eren? Good for you bro, good for you. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, in this new
  episode where we continue to witness the effects of The Rumbling
  (#AttackOnTitan82), oh yeah we can talk about Annie who just woke up after
  shielding herself from Titan goo for years which has melted from the event
  that has been killing thousands of people at this point. Hey, small sacrifice,
  as Eren would've said. So, let's jump right into the story, as Armin would
  getting the jump on Connie next episode or something. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Firstly, let's
  talk about Annie. She's alive, and according to her long story-telling to
  Hitch which I swear I remember that name but not remember anything lol, Annie
  was out for about four years, remembered a lot of things thanks to people
  talking in front of her, so she probably figured out how she was removed from
  that Titan goo. Armed with her hands in blood so she can transform anytime,
  she threatened Hitch to send her out of the island - and I can't believe I can
  say that especially considering we know Annie is pretty heartless and doesn't
  care of anything - to see her foster dad once again. Spoiler alert, he's
  already dead, following a protest of the Eldians stuck inside Marley camps
  with most of the military not knowing of that dream everyone else saw, likely
  got shot in the head while going against the country that locked them down. So
  yeah, sorry for that Annie your dad's an idiot. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Next, we talk about
  Floch before I forget his name and what a piece of sh*t he was. Everything he
  said to the Marley volunteers were kind of correct, just that in his case, we
  know he is just a wimp and he'll do all it takes to control everyone if he can
  so yeah Eren probably made his best and worst choice on trusting this a**hole,
  but hey, what can I say he used everyone anyways so this idiot is included.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, he shot someone as an example so who said this isn't dealing
  with humans again, and Yelena's group got locked up until they were willing to
  help... Floch with his cause because I don't think a collective term exists
  for this now lol. Jean is just shocked at all this because yeah who wouldn't,
  Mikasa is shocked at what to do now since she can't do anything with Eren, and
  Armin has enough of her shit. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Well, considering he is the best brain
  in the gang and he's back to panicking, no wonder he rather think he's worse
  off as a main character and let Erwin live instead so he can make worse
  decisions than this. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Last but not least, we talk about Connie.
  Remember last time we saw him he left with... Falco I almost forgot his name
  lol (Please I can only member at most half a dozen people okay? And they
  aren't even Japanese names) because we know Falco has Titan powers inherited
  from the brother, and Connie can get his mother back by letting her eat...
  a... human? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But yeah, Falco knew close to nothing but to follow this
  soldier, but he has a hunch this guy isn't nice. Also hey, Connie, if you are
  a soldier, stop thinking of the people around you. You do for the cause, not
  save your family. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> I'm good haha so yeah, Armin's determined to stop
  him from saving his mom, that's for sure. Gotta say though, how to deal with
  the Titan powers being around forever, I have no idea. Maybe bury them in
  secret so they can never be consumed by someone else ever again? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All
  in all, and even in the preview, we see Pieck (umph) (haha) and the Commander
  (forgot his name again lmao oh yeah Magath) spotting Hange and Levi in the
  distance (they were blown away most likely), so I guess we will continue with
  that for now, this world on fire. So yeah, surprise surprise, our coolest hero
  isn't dead and yes Hange I don't mean you lmao cya guys for more story to the
  conclusion of this epic series that just refuses to end haha we are near the
  end trust me

  P.S. "The only thing I could hear was you and Armin talking away" Oh yeah
  Annie what do you think Hitch and Armin are doing? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey she doesn't
  know and so do we "Thanks to you guys talking, I always knew what was going
  on" Haha hey this is great storytelling so now you don't have to explain to
  Annie what happened, kudos to the author for that

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  I guess Nishikata is into outdoor dates, huh. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode
  where we continue this path of romance with no end in sight or else how you do
  another season of this lmao (#TakagiSanS308), we actually are doing so, with a
  literal path. (Hehe how did I know that, future me you wrote that intro
  earlier-) So, the path of love. I won't spell it out for you so let's refer it
  as "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/yoi" target="_blank">Yoi</a>
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/koi" target="_blank">Koi</a> Hill" or
  something haha, Takagi and Nishikata climb the... stairs to see the fantastic
  scenery up this hill. Yes, steps like these are normal in the suburbs, city
  freak, so listen up. So initially, Nishikata asked his girl out (haha) not
  because he could be dating her walking up the stairs, nor did he intend to
  write on that notepad of the person he likes because we know it's Takagi and
  it'll have been a great idea to let the girl write down hers as a showdown
  instead lmao, but no instead Nishikata walks the steps with her and spent a
  good amount of time talking to her because what else you gonna so on the way
  up lol even he jebaited himself so Takagi can learn more about him, and then
  asked how many steps they climbed instead of asking her out. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>
  Seriously bro. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, Takagi won just because it's literally
  written on the place of interest, so as punishment Nishikata has to... walk up
  here again next time with her. Yeah, just walk up here a few more times to
  seal the deal, idiot. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Dude, is this not more of a jebait or what?
  Haha I mean, Takagi-san you might have to think twice this partner of yours is
  not very smart. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Next up, and I can't believe I'm saying this,
  between whatever roles
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki" target="_blank"
    >Yuuki Aoi</a
  >
  has ever voiced I've watched so far, nothing comes as close as just hearing
  her normal voice in a bittersweet romance scenario. Like seriously, you
  questioned yourself on that before? So, stairs again, but it's another couple.
  These two, probably more chance to date each other earlier. Hojou and... I
  don't remember the guy's name BUT THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> The point
  is that, the girl knows all about this place so is already happy about waiting
  for the moment, and the guy didn't deliver. I wouldn't say he didn't
  considering only Nishikata doesn't know about this place lmao, but he... he
  didn't do it. Sad, I feel sad for her already, the character and the voice
  behind it haha ah hey. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Gotta say though, still sweeter than like,
  season two's ending of this series tbh. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Someday guys, someday you two
  will be together. Next next up, in case you haven't realize they only hired
  one dude to do the background scene drawings this week lmao maybe I should
  check the credits later, it's Mano-chan's turn. With Nakai, of course. Problem
  is, we can clearly see how much the guy doesn't really care and we'll talk
  about why in a moment, versus the girl who is such a desperate slut- Anyways
  haha, Mano-chan is into this lovey-dovey stuff, so as boyfriend Nakai I
  suggest you play your part to make her happy. And so he did, for he has
  already climbed this hill before and wrote on that notepad too, just because.
  Aw... slap some more sugar on that relationship I can't even. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span>
  Mano-chan, you are very lucky <strike>to get laid</strike> to have a partner
  at your age for many to envy. Also Nakai-kun MVP he's the coolest in this
  series FYI. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I can already imagine in the future he's like oblivious
  to the girl's birthday and gives her a surprise <strike>at night</strike> in
  the evening or something. You know, celebrations. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> And then, we have
  the lesbian subplot. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> You think the legend works in this case? I don't
  know. I just know I won't search hentai of it. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But yeah, if you
  haven't guessed it, Sanae and Mina have no idea what this 415 thing is about
  besides Yukari-chan, because if you have not known of its spin-off novel
  series where she is the main character... I won't blame you it's a novel
  anyways. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyhow, not like Yukari has anyone to write it on anyways
  don't you dare write any of the dudes mentioned above (you can write like,
  Kimura or Takao or something haha) (or me, yeah, or me) (lol), so yeah, the
  girls are just for here to enjoy the scenery and a great workout, it seems. Oh
  come on, it's not sad, the legends just don't work on them. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> To wrap
  this one side shtick off for the episode, we talk about rental DVDs. Oh DVDs
  exist in Japan, by the way, just so you know. I know it's 2022 already where
  the rest of the world are burning them as in on the fire lol we be digital now
  dude, the main couple drop by the convenience store where they rent movies and
  stuff like it's the early 2000s. <span title="*cringe*">üò¨</span> It's not really a showdown here
  because remember every episode has to have a wholesome moment at the end now?
  Haha so yeah, they recommended movies to each other. Apart from the spoilers
  revealed by Nishikata accidentally introducing his movie about aliens fighting
  humans but in an old Western duel lol who wrote that, and that "100%
  Unrequited Love" is getting a movie adaptation soon wow so much hype dude, we
  didn't get the "let's watch at my place" plot that we might have wanted even
  if these people are still in middle school lol. Well, turns out, Takagi may
  not have enough courage to do so, just like Nishikata. The dude may be a
  tsundere but Takagi... she be an embarrassed girl haha I mean, we dealing with
  an idiot and a thickhead so that is understandable. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, I
  think you can understand how much I love this series just by looking at the
  write-up here lmao, and I don't even mind them throwing more of these stories
  at me. I just wonder what will conclude this season though, because nothing
  can quite top a summer festival theme, but maybe going to watch that movie on
  Christmas with that couple gift Nishikata wanted? I mean, that totally sounds
  like a thing your parents will let you do haha ah hey they got laid and I
  don't so they win lol cya guys then

      tantalizing haha
    </div>

  Wow Shinju, your enthusiasm for your
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">onee-san</a> is off
  the roof even though you don't have much to go to reach the roof haha <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span>
  (Get it? Because she has a tall build- Why do I have to explain all my jokes?)
  In this new episode where I welcome us into the world of cosplay because come
  on we barely touched any ground on this (#KiseKoi08), so let's see with this
  episode we can go much further. So firstly, about the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>. No, this
  particular one did not tickle my fancy. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> She is Inui Shinju, so
  different from the elder sister Sajina, and boy is her explanation of how
  Juju-san came about is totally wholesome I can't believe we have an episode
  worth of this. More on that later, but suffice it to say the sister Shinju
  took on the interest from the father in photography, but specifically to take
  photos of the cute stuff that is Sajina lol am I the lolicon here, but yeah,
  because the sister is always doing cosplay for herself, this aspiring
  photographer thought it'll be a waste to not put what she did for many to see
  online, and so she did. So basically, <b>she's</b> the manager. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But
  despite how much things have grown so much that her reputation to even rent a
  studio to do her next cosplay will be so much easier (and cheaper) if the word
  "Juju" was placed in front of her requests she doesn't even know, but yeah, I
  can understand both of their cases, so to speak. I mean, look at Kitagawa
  getting high from looking at more exclusive Juju-san cosplay photos. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>
  Maybe Shinju should join in the cosplay business too but she said no and I
  know we have the same shocked face as Gojou so WE KNOW SHE IS LYING!!!
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But yeah, it's just a prospect, dear author, we know, we'll not think
  about this too deeply. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> And as expected, the couple do not know of
  how professional cameras work because I know you don't too, and also how
  expensive they are. Well, study some engineering and one day you'll get it too
  but (haha) yeah the technology is never cheap especially the equipment used,
  so I guess they are not considering this at this point. Next up, the selection
  of studio for the shooting. Since the couple are going to be sharing the cost
  with Sajina here, they arranged to meet up to find the next best location to
  take photos apart from the yard which we start with... an abandoned hospital.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Well, great start, dear author, because we know this is totally not
  scary and there won't be the one person who won't freak out even walking into
  this chilly, dark place. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> While Sajina quivered (hell yeah) (I'm not
  into <a href="https://jisho.org/search/lolicon" target="_blank">loli</a> haha
  ah) in her fears, we also learnt a lot about herself, about how her dream was
  being a magical girl (lol) as impractical as they were as a kid, could still
  come true being a cosplayer, which is why she tries her best to make it stay
  that way just because. I get it man, people do cosplay for all sorts of
  reasons, mostly for social media attention these days or you have these guys
  here I guess. Anyways, Gojou gets it too relating himself with
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hinaningyou" target="_blank">hina dolls</a>
  and how he hasn't reached it quite yet thanks to these girls lol but hey, at
  least he gets to be encouraged to do it by hearing this little girl's story.
  We can do the tears without the handshakes though, you gonna let
  girl-school-only never-talked-to-guys virgin Juju-san faint. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Ah hey,
  I wouldn't have gone for her hands, but what do I know I don't date a gal.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Last but not least, and I can't believe you can do this without
  bikini, it's the beach! Yeah, the exams are over, Kitagawa had the urge to go
  to the beach, so he dragged a mat and Gojou-kun with her. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Ironically,
  this is the signalling of the start of the summer vacations, and guess who
  they are going to spend it with. I mean, that's how you know this is a good
  relationship because one dude never leaves the house since he doesn't have to
  versus some outdoorsy girl who likes to go out, you can have so much fun you
  won't even get bored as long as you are together. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Some woman take me
  out please I'm just taking myself out at this point it's just <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> Haha
  anyways, all in all, great episode I would say, we may have way too many
  quotes to talk about in one episode considering this series is chocked full of
  them in the first place, and I can't praise it myself any better. Maybe
  getting food stolen from a hawk and looking up the short skirt is fine after
  all lol those aren't reality guys you would be hit by the hawk first and
  skirts can't be that short... unless you're outside school but what do I know
  haha stay tuned for more Gojou-level discoveries of the outside world with
  best girl Kitagawa haha bye

  [TL:DR; How you know Kitagawa Marin is a good girlfriend: She passes you half
  of the remaining burger AND the drink lol okay the latter doesn't matter
  though imo also indirect kiss so]

    Well, this week's Klassic Note went as great as expected. We had to listen
    to three full albums (and ones single lol) and they delivered. Well, some of
    them did. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So, let's start from the top.

        >Kouno Marika's 1st album</a
      ></b
    >
    since her debut last year of the same period wasn't exactly great, not many
    songs will fit her high-pitched voice but that doesn't mean she is bad, just
    that the songs are heavily pop and rap-based, which only made me think the
    producers might be influenced by her idol group Earphones on this which
    doesn't really make of a great experience listening to it. I did give the
    more popular songs though including the topic song.

        >Hanazawa Kana's new album</a
      ></b
    >
    ever since her change in music label was also not exactly a game-changer, as
    with my past experiences giving only an average of 1-2 songs per album even
    the one with 25 songs (lol) haha but yeah, I did find some interesting
    things besides the topic song which can bring you back right into the 1980s
    lmao. But yeah, Ooki Reiji, didn't even give

    you wrote too just because. Moving on,

    as of course expectedly good because besides giving the usual now in her
    image ever since her short hiatus, in recent years she has only been singing
    pop-heavy songs, but I also had a share of listening to more Acoustic and
    Rock based songs which is great because covering as much ground as possible
    is half the reason why she still stands strong as a Collection Artist in
    Klassic Note today. Even missing out on her latest single from last year,
    and I gave it another chance after if I recall, rejecting the music video on
    first impression. Last but not least, I took a day later to give
    <b
      ><a
        href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%81%8B%E3%83%8E%E8%A1%8C%E6%96%B9-special-edition/1609057445?l=en"

    which ironically didn't appear on time but also, had a weird singing voice I
    can't describe it's not exactly like Marinka and it's not cute so the songs
    being subpar didn't make it any better so I just gave the one song.

  will be for Anime "RikeKoi" season two, no surprises there. I mean, how can
  you be cuter than that, Ten-chan? <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span><br />
  <br />So for next week, finally and finally, we are giving
  <b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> which I really hope besides her later than
  expected entrance in as Collection Artist (compared to her fellow TrySail
  members), we have <b>SHE's new single</b> and
  <b>ORESKABAND's new album</b> for quite a while I really hope it will be good
  we have heard the past couple of songs and they aren't bad, and from the above
  news paragraph we are also giving <b>mol-74's new album</b> which is probably
  their first out of indie times so these are stuff they came up with being in
  major for the past few years, so let's hope we have as much to give or even
  more compared to the previous releases since I've only given the one single
  last year? Yeah, we can do more mol-74 is uniquely nice to listen to, to be
  frank. I know many people won't be buying on it but Anime will keep them going
  haha major label power!!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Also, next week is also quite a week for
  releases LET'S GO!!! lol<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Oh yeah, forgot to mention it, but happy birthday today to let's see...
  Takahashi Rie aka Rieri because why wouldn't you want a lively girlfriend like
  her, Tachibana Rika-sama but we shall not talk too much about her since she's
  married, amongst a whole list of voice actresses who have their special day on
  this... special day somehow don't ask me why. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, no news about
  Rieri's fanclub renewal which I think I'll summarize it, being a member is
  buying a physical item last year in April when it started and whenever you buy
  it thereafter will expire the membership by end March so... now is definitely
  not the time to join, so I'm seeing when the next round of this is. Hey, I
  regretted that I missed a year of it, what can I say. Should've just written
  my name on your membership card or something. <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span> Cya guys next time, and
  until next time... man February just came and left, but I can tell you for
  sure, the next month coming aka March 2022 is going to be so crazy, I may have
  to quit my job to receive packages lmao just joking remember my birthday
  present? The actual one? Haha yeah, it's coming. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Until next week.<br />

  a Saturday so I didn't take work leave <span title="*sob*">üò¢</span>
