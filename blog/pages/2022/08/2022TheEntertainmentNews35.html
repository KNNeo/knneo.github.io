THE NEW PACKAGE UNBOXING SHOULD HAVE BEEN YESTERDAY!!!!!!! <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Oh well, even with my precise calculations I still could not be at home on
  Friday to receive the new stuff I got from Japan and dad had to step out of
  the house when it appeared and NOW I have to deal with whether I can even get
  this from the post office by the end of the month. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We can but hope.
  Very hopeless though. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> So yesterday instead of playing video games which
  I do on weekdays now, I ended up exploring
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/doujin" target="_blank">doujin</a> series
  from

  </blockquote>
  Hey, you think Kazuya made her grandma proud by giving the most traditional
  gift he can to a woman he likes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, say it ain't great but the girl
  liked it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where I guess we have birthdays again
  so yeah White Day but not really lol (#KanoKari21), yo Gramps what makes you
  think Chizuru will take time off her busy schedule to be with you guys- just
  bring her grandma over, the hospital bed and everything. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
  looks like this is just one event, but trust me, with this many girls in
  Kazuya's life? It can never be just the one. Because for starters, Ruka-chan
  is THE girlfriend. Yeah, makes you really wonder how the family never figured
  that out lol I mean maybe Kazuya has no siblings to rat him out? Could not
  stop Ruka-chan for making herself the perfect granddaughter-in-law in front of
  the grandmother because seriously, if we reach that stage where we have to
  break up with Chizuru, at least we will make the other's transition into the
  family slightly easier. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, Ruka-chan had the head start since
  Chizuru was at the hospital with her grandmother, and yeah for legal reasons
  she should not spend more time with anyone else but her only family. Well, not
  even future not boyfriend or whatever I don't know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It wasn't until
  Chizuru actually started to worry about her rental girlfriend job because who
  knows what's up with Ruka-chan, that she decided to tell this combined
  birthday party event to her Gramps who just jumped out of her bed hearing
  Kazuya's name (lol) and told her to go instead, possibly saving the
  awkwardness that is the more practical modern day daughter-in-law candidate.
  So yeah, NOT Chizuru. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, you gotta start getting used to drinking
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sake" target="_blank">sake</a>, girl, can't
  keep having soft drinks. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I would argue it's kind of a mismatch,
  Kazuya is still the only heir of the family line, so yeah maybe the
  inclination towards a prospective girlfriend who remembers to pay respects at
  the altar will be better than I don't know, having one drop by the guy's place
  to want to have sex with him haha ah hey. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't know, we haven't
  reached the part where we have to consider Kazuya's feelings yet. (Gramps do
  you even want to see a baby or not? Haha) <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... does all of
  what Ruka-chan do mean anything? Like, seriously? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't mean to
  sh*t on Ruka-chan, she's such a girlfriend I'll make sure the family takes her
  in if that is what the girl wants to be, but man, Chizuru with all the acting
  is just a win. And I know, I feel like I have to draw references if I have to
  deal with even her voice actress in my life. Happy birthday Ten-chan anyways
  haha this week's episode is a coincidence says Anime production

    >girls cutting down their hair</a
  >
  until I don't know whether I should keep liking girls with long hair. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  But hey, I guess Mizuto doesn't. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> In this new episode where why can't I
  have a buddy (preferably female lol) to like stuff but it's Japanese music
  haha (#TsureKano08), yeah sure you can come over to my place to read books,
  says Mizuto. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, we already know about everyone else in this
  series so who would be triggered...? Haha but before that, we are already
  triggered by the fact that Isana can just wear whatever she wants and not feel
  bad about the fashion industry because WHY ARE YOU WEARING A T-SHIRT DUDE lol
  again you gotta remember, she is a woman. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, Yume-chan and
  particularly Minami-san are determined in spending money on her (literally) to
  make sure she can go to Mizuto's place ie. Yume's abode haha, and not feel
  weird but seriously, does she feel like she does? All she did after going to
  his place is just taking a book and lying down at his bed! I mean, I should
  fill my shelves with books instead of CDs. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, it just feels
  like it's too normal with a girl like her just being in some guy's place and
  this isn't even a porno, then asked for many other favours like donning on her
  socks and massaging her shoulders under the excuse of a huge rack. Seriously,
  if this is any other Anime series this is already probably rated above 21 for
  some reason. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But no, this series ironically isn't that, and we might
  find out after a while. As we are constantly shown on flashbacks about the
  siblings' pasts, we are reminded about their lovely times together, and how
  this couple thing is drastically different compared to the friendly
  relationship between Mizuto and Isana. Maybe it is that they both haven't
  experienced such relationships before I would argue and so does referee
  Yume-chan lol, but also, we all wished boy-girl relationships can be this
  sometimes. Being cheeky, having a ball, not thinking about dating and/or sex
  for that matter, just being friends. Okay maybe after being rejected is a
  problem I'm not Mizuto's parents but I'll also say Isana is the ex more than
  their daughter lol <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, but yeah, ask yourself if you had such a friend in
  any part of your life. Or even till now. But probably just briefly, as we can
  see, this boy girl thing is so much more. Especially to Isana who really
  treasures this friendship and not be judged by appearance or gender, could not
  satisfy Yume-chan's definition of relationships and it's just because we are
  dealing with Isana here. That's all. All in all though, I think this is just
  another reminder and I hope it's the last, of what relationships are like in
  this series. Because normally, at least in Anime, boy and girl come together
  to NOT be friends. Even my bro wouldn't be satisfied with that, honestly. So
  what, then them girls can't have them ugly boys in their social circle?
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Sorry but I'm gonna cry in a corner see you soon <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>

  [TL:DR; "It must be hard dealing with such a

  Haha Mell-chan you are fated to retake that damn test, girl, unless we get a
  tornado warning. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where like every other Anime
  series we need a mass character introduction episode haha (#Arusuno08), please
  watch all of Anime "Slow Start" to know what I'm talking about, but let's just
  say everyone panicked because Alberta-chan went missing. Well, not really, she
  had an adventure of a lifetime. Almost costed her life though. And worry
  amongst students in school. Well... let's just say this is the school so we
  should be fine. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, what happened. Apparently some dove walked off
  with that special feather we talked about previously, and Al-chan as I would
  refer to because I don't want to type the nickname OR the nickname Hammit-san
  came up with it's only slightly different by the way, followed the bird into a
  crevice in the school. Problem is, she was wary even though she walked into it
  and found the dove, but also means that by policy the fairies are in charge of
  closing those crevices even when there are animals inside? Why aren't we
  seeing carcasses inside caves in this place? <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Anyways, the fairies
  didn't know much, so Al-chan got stuck in it while trying to find a way out.
  And boy she did, while constantly giving out hints to the rest of the group
  who thought she went missing, because I don't know if you would call this a
  portal thing? But I guess the school is built on very perilous grounds so
  maybe it's just that. I wouldn't describe Al-chan and the dove's adventure in
  great detail because everything is cute about her anyways lol this week is the
  Tomita Miyu focus week haha same with "TsureKano", but yeah, this is
  definitely not a normal event in school, someone going missing and it's not
  due to bugs and/or Knights. Well, both would be a problem if you would recall
  the girls in the Select can't fight any of those proficiently, but it is
  someone gone missing and this is not

  so ("BLEACH" joke haha), so at least Solow has allowed the girls to go find
  their buddy while cancelling what was supposed to be a math test- Damn, tests
  are this not important in school, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not like we stop exams when
  someone has gone missing. Well, they may not even tell us students too lol
  just like how Lidel-san heard sounds and others felt vibrations throughout the
  premises but did not notice those were made by mostly Al-chan indirectly apart
  from the part where she punched the walls of ruins using her magic arm which
  well, maybe don't do that next time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> With the help of students
  hinting the girls to narrow down Al-chan's location so yeah

    >in the cast</a

  now haha, and the power of the <i>sun sun</i> because Pedura sucks when it
  comes to places without light lol, the girls have effectively prevented
  Al-chan from basically falling off the cliff at the last moment since they
  themselves were at a parapet shouting and the girl's walking out from the
  darkness without realizing she is in danger, got saved by what was the most
  impressive spell we have seen so far Abra-san already better than Harry Potter
  haha, AND Mell-chan who just sky dived to grab her while Al-chan is grabbing
  on to the dove's egg for dear life. Slice-of-life Anime, ladies and gentlemen.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, who cares about the Knights and them being jebaited by
  other soldiers lol I just eat the blue mushroom stew haha yes we were hinted
  about their presence earlier on to be honest, I think I may have hit my quota
  for Al-chan cuteness for this series, and I cannot be more thankful. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  </blockquote>
  Gotta say though for someone without a real heart Chisato is kinda stacked-
  Okay okay, focus on the story. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#LycoReco09)
  where I think we saved her from the bad nurse? Hmmmmm she doesn't have long to
  live though. Uh oh. Time for vengeance- So just so you know Takina?
  Yoshi-san's plan was vengeance. Yours isn't. Remember that. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving
  on haha we got two months left might as well make the most of it, seems like
  though, news is spreading fast. Well, considering Chisato is going for her
  usual medical check-up which is part of the DA and Takina found her
  unconscious with the sedative and her chest ripped open (HELL YEAH lol) it
  seems like Yoshi's plan has been going as planned: putting an early end to
  Chisato's artificial heart. We'll talk about why in a moment, but considering
  she only has about two months to live, really Takina you gonna go find the
  killer? I mean, we can already guess it was sent by Yoshi-san anyways, just
  ask Kurumi and Mika. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like seriously, is this going to be 4 episodes
  of depressing slice-of-life? Because I'LL TAKE IT haha who cares about all the
  action so far I don't even like guns. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah jokes on me, there's
  more to this because as Mika talked about his love story and along with
  Yoshi-san effectively adopting the not revived kid known as Chisato lol, this
  girl was an orphan like anyone else in Lycoris and I won't elaborate much this
  is a cheap idea, but just that she has the talent for weapon accuracy but
  also, has a heart condition as a kid. Yes, back then when kid Chisato had a
  real heart. Of all of the cheapest tricks to employ to save her though, Mika
  consulted someone from the Institute and decided between that dude and him who
  shall be the father in this new family. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Wrong answers only because
  the DA is the mother in this family lmao all hail the DA, and Yoshi-san
  technically saved the girl with a fake heart. It will only last until they
  turn 18 and that's fine with Mika as long as we can make her mission to
  kill... a thing lol yeah what else is wrong in this story? But in the end
  Chisato realizing someone saved her made her NOT want to kill, so basically
  what made her today. For better or for worse, of all things. Today her is then
  stuck with even without the timeline of her fake heart, to continue as a
  Lycoris in order to maybe take Majima down, to go back to the DA because
  suddenly Kusunoki needs her help in taking down bad guys before she is done
  with her duty lol just that this is now life-gated instead of age-gated, and
  Takina just wants to spend more time with this girl who taught her everything.
  Still, mom is still your mom Takina will go back to the DA I'm sure, and as
  the snow falls we realize how sad it will be for the liveliest, most carefree
  girl to be dead in due time. Excuse me, to not have lived this long. No
  really, imagine Lycoris Recoil without Chisato. Maybe Fuki-chan and Takina.
  Would you watch? Because I won't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't worry though, I'm still
  impressed with the storytelling of this story thus far, and I would rather
  watch the end of the bad guys but along with the end of Chisato, than to see
  her be alive in the near future. Again, she has already outlived WAAAY longer
  than she has to, and that's literally for a selfish mission. So yeah, maybe
  taking Majima down will help. Maybe, Majima confronting Yoshi-san at this
  point will make him one step closer to being Chisato's <i>next</i> saviour.
  See you then.

  </blockquote>
  We got recap now?? Okay "BLEACH" you trying to cut down on runtime? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  In this new episode on why we still looking at old content (#EngageKiss09),
  how did this episode start up being so boring? Is it Mikhail? Can we get rid
  of him? Let me put up an auction for his bounty. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, looks like
  this is the reveal episode I guess, so let's talk about it. Firstly, let's get
  rid of Mikhail's role in this whole mystery so far. Yeah, he knew of what
  happened. He just didn't figure out that Miles is the guy involved with all
  the recent demon events so far. But he did have the power to know everything,
  including information fed to him from the Demon Bureau so Shuu and Ayano's
  mom, his surveillance cameras, and above all, thinking that he's correct to
  not tell Shuu of the truth. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, moving on because he's not the
  point of all this but he did make the views dip though. What DID actually make
  this series take a dive was the reveal, because guess what, things have been
  going so smoothly on the demons side is because Miles, above all else, is also
  a demon. Plus, he had a contract with the devil. Literally. Asmodeus
  apparently, and we also found out about the history of Shuu and his demon
  hunter&nbsp;father, who, as dumb as him lol, dealt with the demons too haha
  it's just history repeating itself if you think of it, in order to achieve
  their own dumb plans. The father chose to be with a demon probably to find a
  way to stop all this so he might be a traitor at some point which is good so
  not loyal enough to Asmodeus as Miles haha, and Shuu chose to be with a demon
  probably just to kiss. Hey, when's the last time he had to kiss Ayano? Don't
  remember. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, as you can see I am trying to make this
  interesting, because above all else in the memory recollection and trying to
  extract all the memories from Miles to know the whole incident and Tetsuya's
  death statement in his car it was so long he only bled out of his mouth
  halfway through lmao, is as you can see, the storytelling is dragging. Just
  like many other variables in this recollection, Shuu's dad having kids with a
  demon which doesn't explain Shuu existing maybe he's adopted HAHA that sounds
  screwed should've revealed more of this earlier too, Miles going through all
  this nonsense just to save his child which honestly saying might be just the
  worst kind of father you can expect, and everything going back at Miles in the
  end thanks to Tetsuya... it just feels like a joke at this point, just like
  how Sharon is already out of prison so she can fistfight this A-class demon
  for two seconds and not let Shuu feel bad about letting her out. Again, he
  won't, he forgot everything already or actually, he just made Kisara feel bad.
  But what do demons know about feeling bad anyways; This might just be his
  actual sister for all we know. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> All in all... I must say I am rather
  disappointed with the pace of storytelling on this particular episode. The
  fight is fine, there are WAY too many dialogues that for once I have to give a
  damn about Mikhail's role in all of this even though the person itself is
  really just a joke, and probably because we have been through this too often,
  letting Shuu recall what happened even though he gave it away to the demon.
  All this, I can say, will not compensate for the actually good though
  predictable action scenes this time around. But yeah, thank goodness it's over
  lol, because next time around, Sharon will have to explain even MORE to us
  about Asmodeus, and well apparently there are gates of Hell in this series so
  let's see how much I will hate this lore by the end of next month. Maybe
  Sharon explaining everything in a gym on the exercise bike will make me
  happier lol hey Ayano you join in too eh maybe not you Kisara <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Is it because someone knocked on Miles' door and said "I can save your
  daughter" but it's not a specialist in America OR someone from the black
  market?? That's what happens when you don't have enough money to seek
  treatment bro lmao]

    actually her fist apparently she brings us more emotions from drama theme
    songs to whatever was the inspiration for the topic song (did I mention she
    is heavily influenced by the West?) really just gives me and all of us a
    wonderful classic to remember once again. I did not only listen to her
    though, as I found out also about

    which I wouldn't even say it is but then as I listen to half the album full
    of instrumentals which I would barely call an album it's only got 6 tracks,
    is that this is what they are about, emotional yet on point, maybe just the
    melody isn't, but I think they are cool. Again, Kana-chan gave me a
    recommendation I'm thankful for. Only gave one song though, but that's what
    hit me to listen to the release anyways, so you're welcome, ladies.

  No, I'm still sad, all these can't remove the fact that I can't read the new
  volume of "Douki-chan" haha spoiler alert for next week. Anyways, at least I
  have something to look forward to, not until I forget that the end of the
  month is near me and I'm more paranoid than ever that I don't get to talk
  about Kyari-san and Mocho... for Klassic Note haha no way dude why would I buy
  Kaori-chan bromides. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys then, and until next time... I really
  am seriously considering my prospects of idolizing Ten-chan oh happy birthday
  anyways haha I know this is like a time of renewing them vows but uh, with
  Koga Aoi recently and even Kyari-san joining the fray... Bye haha be mad at me
  Sora-san so I will like you more lol<br />
