Wow I already forgot what happened this week haha oh yeah I had lunch with my
friends lol
<div><br /></div>
<div> Hey, I don't really want to plan for this portion of the weekly blog post by writing it first but as I dreamt about another season of Anime "Kekkaishi" last night (yeah Kagerou is back!! lol what) and got blessed with more Isobe Karin Instagram post reply likes from (hopefully) herself, then maybe I'll talk about <a  href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChfB3GWPTOt/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"  target="_blank"  >Koko-chan coming back</a > to work from the fire out there and Mocho's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGhJ4C5KTVs" target="_blank"  >fanservice video</a > (excuse me, <a  href="https://twitter.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1561191538180247552?s=20&amp;t=YbAed-3OU8-H85QqZfNFog"  target="_blank"  >videos</a >) if you haven't watched them yet. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Is this good enough of a summary? Well if it is let's move on to Anime and music! <a  href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/ChenhAkpQ7G/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"  target="_blank"  >Why does Asakura Momo look so stacked</a > someone explain to me lmao maybe it's just me<br /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KanoKari20">  <div style="text-align: center;"> <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kanojo, Okarishimasu</span>  </div> </blockquote> <blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;"> "Well, it's fine at least it won't look like <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E6%8F%B4%E4%BA%A4" target="_blank"  >paid dating</a >" Oh boy Chizuru you might be right lol how old is Kazuya to be a sugar daddy? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div> </blockquote> Man, the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyoza" target="_blank">gyoza</a> Kazuya was eating doesn't even look good you saw the likes of "Arusuno"? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay non contextual jokes aside, in this new episode where Ruka-chan feels bad for sh*tting on Mami-chan haha and I don't even (#KanoKari20), and that's why I think I saw something on the Anime's official Twitter haiz I need to stop following them haha, Kazuya made a right choice for spicing things up a bit for his next rental... date. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Wait, why is HE doing the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kosupurei" target="_blank">cosplay</a>? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the school uniform date. Yep, we already expect Chizuru to be wearing it though maybe next time try booking Sumi-chan for that request too lmao, because you know, Chizuru's fees for rental just went up so we might as well up the requests now haha. Problem though, is that Kazuya is just holding back in doing all the dating stuff he wants to do but thinks he cannot until Chizuru reminded him every time that he paid for this so from holding hands to sharing food and taking photos in the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/purikura" target="_blank">photo book</a> in the arcade should be as normal as the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">riajuu</a> in high school who ACTUALLY have partners to go do all these things- I hate all of you, ALL of those people who have partners in high school. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But of course, as Chizuru has mentioned, wearing this instead of casual outfits because they suck lol does have their disadvantages, since you will stand out more and be found out easily by that school's outfit since not like she is going to buy a generic cosplay JK outfit just for the occasion, is probably less worried about how much Kazuya is just salivating at the tightness of the blouse and shortness of the skirt. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Ah hey, never been there so I won't know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, gotta say Kazuya did plan all the good stuff that he missed doing in high school out considering he doesn't even have a date lmao, but yeah the hug has got to be the highlight. Like, when's the last time you hugged anyone? Besides your parents? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I can pay to hug a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bijin" target="_blank">bijin</a>? WHY NOT haha ok me, chill. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Not the kissing though, that... that might be too much lol not even being professional can help with this level of <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu" target="_blank">skinship</a>. All in all, fantastic episode hey they really picked up the pace after all the serious talk with the plays and stuff, and I'm just glad we have come full circle into giving another rental girlfriend date just a little different in spice and you know, watch everything else unfold because remember Kazuya is kind of being apprehensive thus far to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span> Next up, looks like we have Ruka-chan family time which I don't think will be together in one sentence, so let's see Kazuya explain how be broke up with Chizuru. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> If not, that kiss at the end of the preview might not be from the current girl. Uh oh. Haha see you then
</div>
<div> [TL:DR; "Want to go a little further in?" HELL YEAH haha can she even say that]

Dude. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, in this new episode (#TsureKano07) looks like we might have a rise and fall to Isana-san right here, in her pursuit of romance to, in case you need a hint here because I swear I mentioned about this last week too lol the official website spoiled it, Mizuto. So, the convincing. Well, apparently Isana may not even know she likes the guy even romantically and probably is so ambivalent she turned off her feminism in front of this guy who doesn't even get a boner anyways lol, would then only be convinced on that fact by the other two girls on this, could not even believe that it's possible to like this male friend here but hey, imagine all the romantic stuff you can do between you two, spending time together on not books. Yeah, you can do all of those. Been there, done that. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> Haha ah hey Yume-chan speaks from experience. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I guess we even went in the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> route also lol, but looks like Mizuto might be drippin' (haha) but not cooming at any point so I really wonder if this dude is even human. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But yeah, maybe being friends is like this, never really have such a good friend to know about that though. Female friend, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Then again, feels like too aggressive anyways and the guy probably can see that, but moreover is the shame of Isana-san here that might be a problem too, as the girls try ways to not let the friend get caught by flirting with the guy in the library corner lol is this a porno? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And then, the confession. Sooner than later it seems, but also, if you haven't realized that yet, Minami-san is that agent you talk to to get a job interview even though you know you can find a job yourself lol not true BUT, in this case she benefits from the cringe she is going to get from Yume-chan because remember when Minami had to try to date Mizuto herself? Yeah, same thing but different girl now. So yeah, that's how you know it doesn't work AT ALL haha Isana doesn't have the long hair like the other two lmao, but in case you wonder if Mizuto would ever say yes to any woman, we are reminded of his past, where he still holds dear to the one and only person he has been with all his life up till now, and I think by now you should know who she is to be honest. All in all... wow this is a good episode, too good even. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we might be a step closer to Mizuto's reality we have not known too much of till now. Why, of all things, he was probably the one who initiated the breakup with Yume-chan probably before the family merge. Yup, this is the sh*t everyone, this is I guess how we will find out what will happen to them. All of them. Minami-san included lol okay maybe not her but still, this is rather exciting than Isana wanting to be a dude lmao see you then
</div>
<div> [TL:DR; Okay I could not explain how much I share similarities with Irido Mizuto over here but GODDAMN he is literally me minus the good looks and the ex <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> Also yeah he has Yume-chan who is <a href="https://jisho.org/search/saikou" target="_blank">saikou</a> she can't be beat haha <a  href="https://twitter.com/CultureZ_/status/1556670596532305920"  target="_blank"  >IMOUTO</a > <a href="https://jisho.org/search/suki" target="_blank">SUKI</a> DA!!! lol okay me]

Come on Pica-chan you already look marvellous are you sure you need to look MORE beautiful? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>  </div> </blockquote> Okay WHY HAVE I NOT CUT A SCONE IN HALF?? I gotta start doing that next time haha I'll do it next weekend lol thanks Starbucks- Mell-chan IS THAT BUTTER??? YOU MADGIRL- In this new episode haha sorry for all the shouting (#Arusuno07) but seriously though there are <a href="https://jisho.org/search/youkai" target="_blank">youkai</a> in this?? What even is this Anime haha ah hey I don't know maybe that's a Knight in disguise too. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, about this week's topic, we talk about fashion, of all things. Hey, they are ladies after all, we gotta talk about the latest trends in London, yes? Yeah, from that smudged piece of newspaper used to wrap the apples when they went grocery shopping, I guess. From what Pica-chan can figure out, it looks like we need some standing hairstyle coupled with some sort of feather decoration. Well, the former is easy to do if you have long hair and I don't wish that for Mell-chan or Alberta anyways, but the latter is the bigger limitation they had to overcome. So they set out to attract <strike>Tori-san</strike> <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tori" target="_blank">birds</a> with bird nests (that's what I call Tori-san's v-) (yeah I'll beat this joke till it's dead haha since it's not about my d-) placed all over the campus in an effort to see the birds leave a couple of those behind if they migrate or something. Ironically, this week's "warning" was more important to the development of this particular episode involving two Knights confronting a dude taking care of exotic animals, probably is killed in action despite having a firing squad against people with swords yeah bringing guns to a swordfight too, caused one of the glass panels of his greenhouse to break and releasing all the birds in it, which is probably how the girls get to see not just one of them, but a rare species even Solow would take longer than two seconds to figure it out. Hey, no one said she knew of it due to a tragic event in the past for her but what do we know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, this was the only one bird the girls found since the other nests were blown away due to a strong night wind, this was also rare to see, so I guess the girls did achieve what they wanted. They dressed up Pica-chan with standing up long hair with a yellow-blue feather on the top and... Abramelin then found out from the paper that it might have been talking about trending hairstyles... centuries ago haha I know right we are about two centuries in the past already can we even afford to go Victorian? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But yeah Abra-san is right: Pica-chan is better with her untied long yellow hair. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> All in all, nice episode as usual, I appreciate more of the lore from the Knights side because it looks like they might just be the leading law enforcement and I won't say in the face of the Queen of England but who knows what aristocracy looked like back then, but suffice it to say these guys might actually want these magical girls for their powers for some purpose.

Man, imagine if the Allan Institute can't find a talent for you. They will just kill you for the sake of it, heck. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Is this how they choose suicide terrorists- In this new episode where we deal with capitalism lol (#LycoReco08), oh come on how did the cafÃ© lose money again? *looks at Chisato* Oh well, it takes a lot to raise a cute girl and we have two so haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span> Kurumi is the independent one, right? Oh right she's dead so who cares. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, I guess they did cover three things in general, so let's do that too. Firstly, about finances. Yeah, apparently the cafe isn't doing too well on budget, and it's not like Mika-san can't count all this stuff on his register fast enough lol, but more like Chisato might be giving out generous portions and not making enough money out of them, is probably their issue. So Takina took it in her own hands to save this special workplace from dying lol does the DA even care, from taking on jobs which actually pay haha literally they have to shoot the clients in order for them to do so, to actually creating a new parfait so good that it gets a queue going even though it looks like <a href="https://jisho.org/search/unchi" target="_blank">poop</a> lol sorry Takina creativity isn't important in making money we know, is probably the only saving grace to making sure this cafÃ© stays in the green. Takina, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yeah, time to progress the story, the baddie has been waiting there for weeks for the girl to go to her physical. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ah hey. But before that, Yoshimatsu's assistant at the Institute, we have another fellow member who wants to talk to Chisato first. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> His name is Majima, and I guess he did literally drop by her place to talk to her while making sure no one in the building will be freaked out by gunshots because there isn't anyone else in the building lol it's a hideout for God's sake and the baddies already know. Talking about Majima though, he recalls on the Radio Tower incident we have been all interested about, that in his effort to fight off waves of Lycoris apparently using just his hearing lol he was blind some time ago? Could not even fathom how someone like Chisato probably in her middle school age can do all the killing this efficiently. And I guess Majima got out of it lucky by blowing the place up so both sides lose and we have to spend millions keeping it up lol I didn't say that. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, Takina got worried of Chisato being alone, but did not get Majima as he left in a jiffy right in front of her lol could've escaped through the window but that's not cool enough, is still the least of their worries because we don't know what Majima might do next. Well, ignoring him, we might not even have to worry about that no more because Yamagishi-sensei who has been calling for ages for Chisato to go for her check-up is not even worried compared to her new assistant who swiftly set the client down for a surgery she will never come out of. It's checkmate, Mika-san. So... who's the bad guy again? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All in all though, great development of events from Yoshi-san's case to we get some Majima with the flashbacks to what will happen next. Heck, I already am interested to know what happens if you supercharge that fake heart of Chisato's. Sadly, we only have next week to find out. No wonder it was <a  href="https://twitter.com/lycoris_recoil/status/1561007598052454400"  target="_blank"  >top trending on Twitter</a > yesterday haha we might be onto a really good original Anime series in a while. See you all then where hopefully, just hopefully, Chisato is just weakened but still alive. Hopefully. We can but hope.

Heck, I rather demons be a liability they have been so reliable so far with Kisara and that tentacle suit. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#EngageKiss08) we might have finally reached a point of the mystery for us to wake up from all the romance we have been getting so far lol I say this in the nicest way possible, ladies and gentlemen. And yes, not gonna elaborate on the Tetsuya brief about the situation from weeks ago I suppose you guys got it since I did and I'm pretty dumb to understand mysteries in Anime anyways and that makes me the perfect audience to watch these, in summary all those who were involved to help initiate demon activity were all killed by humans, so looks like the real enemy isn't just demons no more despite what the history of Bayron City has told us. So for now, we are looking at some higher-ups who are controlling the nation by... uh, regulating demon hunting so that this city has something of threat to be taken down on? Maybe, what do I know, the suspects include from Ayano to her mother (my bet is really on this remember the red hair of the informant?) to whoever is above the police department which we will know soon lol, were all somehow told of this mystery explanation from Tetsuya so I'm pretty sure the enemy is now more wary than ever about this situation. Yes, even the one who has cameras threaded all over the city to monitor you idiots lol why is there a camera in the bathroom where the Mayor's daughters are bathing <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, I don't think Sharon helped much but she did help get my boner up lmao, since pretty much at every turn (and that's why this storytelling may lack its power) there are newer things happening which we don't really remember just like how Shuu also doesn't with his memories at this point so what am I to say about this? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Serious talk though, we know Tetsuya will figure this out somehow, but considering even the main three who have been briefed about this mystery before everyone else does, that the others do not have any protection on them so I wouldn't be surprised that the enemy is targeting not someone who has a demon for a friend. Excuse me, girlfriend. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, RIP Tetsuya you will be missed, and I really believe Shuu and Kisara only just went after not the enemy even if it's Mikhail that smug bastard haha, who only just to prove his innocence showed how much of a creep he was in spying on all of us enjoying our "freedom" (Isn't that what society is anyways? Asking for a friend haha) thus effectively wiping himself off the list of suspects but putting him in top perverts of the city to say the least. And it looks like Shuu has figured it out checking in on all the surveillance footage though, so the truth might not be far from us... maybe this might be another puppet in a police vehicle. *winks* All in all, wow didn't expect to have developments in this mystery we have been going around for so long. Well, probably from chasing Sharon down for two episodes maybe, we almost forgot everything about the incident. But we are getting there, starting from probably not the perpetrator they are finding, though that doesn't get rid of the suspects listed so far. As we know though, this just makes the storytelling that much easier since it's one of us lol closed room murder? See you all next time as I extort more information from tied up Sharon because I want more information but won't pay lmao <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span>

Not going to be this easy next week though haha we'll talk about that later. I also took the liberty to listen to <b  ><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/genki-ep/1636594197?l=en" target="_blank" >MOSHIMO's new mini-album</a  ></b > which released earlier this month and thank goodness it didn't join the bandwagon of releases because apart from their own quirky style which will hit differently than the likes of Porno Graffitti and GLIM SPANKY, it was also good because remember outside of their weird lyrics they are just a normal Rock band through and through, and I'm only more convinced as I hear more of this release. The lyrics may span from summer festival to marriage (lol) but goddamn their music is good. Maybe I'll give more listen to them or give them due attention in future live performances. You're welcome because I don't have to be stuck with the one jealousy songs now haha ah hey that song is just relevant what are you talking about I use it for Anime every other week<br /> <br />And looks like we have lesser news to talk about from Twitter which yay I can write more, <b  ><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1558815749015187457?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw" target="_blank" >Aimer's new song will release tomorrow</a  ></b >&nbsp;for drama theme song and I guess we will find out by then along with <a  href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1560982484208066560?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw"  target="_blank"  >the music video</a >, <b  ><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1558816345185169408?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw" target="_blank" >her recent live performance digest on YouTube</a  ></b > can only remind me on how great she looks despite all her history about her issues lol go read it up yourself, I've only been in 5 years of the <b  ><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1559193320701640705?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw" target="_blank" >7 years of Sangatsu no Phantasia</a  ></b > to be honest and I guess even after her face reveal it didn't change much on my impression of the singing voice, <b  ><a href="https://twitter.com/CrosSing_info/status/1559875286161690624?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw" target="_blank" >Taketatsu Ayana will be covering Cardcaptor Sakura's theme song</a  ></b > (the third one) via CrosSing YouTube channel so next week I guess (yes this is likely pre-recorded since her pregnancy), ignoring Mocho because you should've read the intro lmao, <b  ><a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_mu/status/1560220014128467968?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw" target="_blank" >ORESAMA announced their hiatus</a  ></b >&nbsp;following a final live and release of a live Blu-Ray so you tell me what happened <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> say goodbye to the end of dance pop in Klassic Note, <b  ><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1560582357198970880?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw" target="_blank" >Natsukawa Shiina' new single will be delayed till November</a  ></b > from its initial release of end September which is probably for the better but I am kinda hooked into that emotional tune so that's a problem personally, <b  ><a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_mu/status/1560189850703503360?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw" target="_blank" >Takahashi Rie's new song will be for Anime</a  ></b > where she voices main girl of so yay it has been a year since her debut EP tbh, and finally <b  ><a href="https://twitter.com/nanoripe_info/status/1560820622594256897?s=20&amp;t=MfqtTNQJUnWPAC60FSt3Iw" target="_blank" >nano.RIPE is asking for photos for their upcoming music video</a  ></b >&nbsp;(theme is jumping/flying) which heck I just hope the song can be better the music video can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkQ1yFawRUo" target="_blank"  >a slideshow of flowers</a > I don't care haha<br /> <br /> So for next week, apart from <b  ><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%87%E3%83%8D%E3%83%96%E3%81%A8%E3%82%B9%E3%83%94%E3%82%AB-ep/1630861090?l=en" target="_blank" >DIALOGUE+ new single</a  ></b > which I rather talk less about even though they got the best guy Takuya-san on the writing, could not save the fact that the song is sung by a dozen girls who on average can't sing better than my mom <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span>, we have <b>miwa's new EP</b> in a while which is nice so let's see if her tastes in music can still hold my hopes up because so far she has just been diving deep into pop tunes and I'm not getting her is the point. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well, she can only be good for this long haha I can't wait to praise her next week<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, I have hinted throughout my Anime reviews about a new package and yes, it's finally on its way. I just hope it doesn't appear on a Wednesday since I gotta OT which sucks lol, but otherwise I'm fine I need a end-of-the-month August boost until next time which seems like October? Maybe, I'm not buying the Ede-chan and Naganawa Maria birthday event bromides though. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Short hair, dude, short hair. Maybe I should buy for Maria-chan haha see you guys next week then, and until next time... And that's all the time we have this week I gotta shower and sleep bye

<div> P.S. Oh yeah I finally recalled what I did this week lol I played a video game titled Urbek City Builder it was made by a Chilean so the random city names are all South American, but it's pixel so reminds me of SimCity 3000 but it's resource management than of finances, and it's challenging to play, to say the least, I spent the whole week playing it. Yes, financially too I paid for the damn thing. But now I think I realized that this is also how some mobile city builders are doing so... no ads amirite?? Haha the guy might need more money from me before he can fix the UI scaling when I play windowed though lol
