<div>
  (I mean, I wish it wasn't an Anime cover for the Regular Edition but heck, it
  has a huge rack of I don't know who so I'll take it)
</div>
<div>
  <br />Origin: The origins of this particular single might be more of a
  coincidence than just pure idolism at play, let me explain. I was initially
  going to watch the Anime behind the other single "Isekai Pharmacy" which was
  released on the same date by this voice actress Ishihara Kaori but did not
  watch because I hit my own quota, but that did not stop me getting interested
  in this double single release since I knew of her from last year. Not double
  A-side, not album, two singles released in one day, in view of her birthday
  that week. I was then naturally attracted to the topic song of the other
  single which is this one, and things sort of went haywire. It only got better
  so I did not hesitate to give this at all. The slight awakening is just part
  of the illusion. Let's talk about the magic involved in this.
</div>
<div><br />(1) Abracada-Boo</div>
<div>From the first chorus:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Even if the world condemns (you) as a crime
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Even (you) being alone</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(I) want to continue to understand you</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">I'm on your side to protect you"</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>
  This was also an Anime theme song along with the other single which already
  shows how much Kyari-san here is wanted for her singing talent apparently, as
  this is just as cool of a song to listen to as it is to watch the music video
  which is just a total fanservice since you get to see her dance which would
  capture most of her audience. What also did capture all of us though, is that
  the catchy melody is not shy in expressing itself, and along with the lyrics
  portraying I don't know if it's for the Anime, protecting someone with the
  power of magic which of course we can find similarities with idolism in
  general, so overall this is too good a package to miss. What I would complain
  about is how Kyari-san can't really catch up with the singing in some places
  in this recorded version, and maybe a longer than expected bridge if we are
  talking about a cooler piece it would be good to be shorter. But nothing is
  short about this being bad, I can tell you that much.

<div>Rating: Magically Above Average</div>
<div><br />(2) Aimai Shinkirou</div>
<div>From the first chorus:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "The days (I) love, love, love, love, burying the gaps (of time)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (The) night view (is) shining, shining, shining, shining, too much it's
    troubling
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">It's as if, (this) is a mirage</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I'm) sure I've spent those days (with you), (I'm) pretty sure..."
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>
  And who doesn't want a love song to couple with a cool song? It's emotional,
  it's cute, and it's lovely beyond description. This might have been my first
  impression when I listened to
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ckypeSvMJXg" target="_blank"
    >the teaser short on her YouTube channel</a
  >. Curiosity got to the better of me, and when she slaps in the "love" in the
  chorus ironically talking about the days spent with, you guessed it, and I
  already loved the song. The mood of the song isn't exactly emotional by any
  means though, but the lyrics will make sure you miss the days being with your
  loved ones, too great you thought it wasn't real. The song itself might be
  dragging itself out with the mediocre melody, but the lyrics carry much
  meaning I wish I could translate the whole song for all to see. For that, I
  think I will love this song more than the artist singing behind it, for time
  to come.
</div>
<div>Rating: Lovingly Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: I may have complimented too much on it, but above all else this is
  a very typical Anime theme song release draped with the best of Ishihara
  Kaori's image and style, I could have easily picked this up even without
  knowing about her through Anime. And so I did, and I'm still glad I've heard
  of the potential of Kyari-san herself apart from what I knew of her a year
  ago. I will only continue to "love" this single, even if she doesn't remind me
  of it through her singing. For the conventional listener, the lyrics are also
  straightforwardly meaningful, so if you want just something great to listen
  to, this might just be it.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (Seriously though, I see many familiar names from this PONY CANYON release and
  goddamn did they put the same people who impressed me before to make this such
  a wonderful release. I particularly thank RIRIKO-sensei [c/w Ueda Reina for
  Anime "MajoTabi"] and Fujibayashi Shouko [c/w Taketatsu Ayana] for the
  perfectly tuned lyrics so I can love Ishihara Kaori more. Love letter over
  haha)

<div>AND WE ALSO HAVE...!!!</div>

<div>(Yes, close-ups are better, thanks for asking)</div>
<div>
  <br />Origin: We're back with more love(ly) songs from voice actress Asakura
  Momo, member of Anime idol group TrySail, and we have been five years into her
  solo music career. Fuelled by love songs and sometimes Anime if we have the
  chance, her cute voice only accents the wonderful melodies that come with it,
  and since her 2nd album back in 2020, music production have been exploring and
  coming up with different styles and presentation for such a cute voice to fit
  in. With the 3rd album months after this single though did I then actually
  give the B-side in order for me to talk about this, so we are already late to
  the party. But I will talk more about the artistic theme of this though, for
  this is not your usual fare.
</div>
<div><br />(1) Stained Glass</div>
<div>
  <div>From the first chorus:</div>
  <div></div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "Shining bright light into the bright sky
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      (I'm) jumping, playing, (in) happiness
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      Savour this moment all the way, please
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      Feels like what (you were) trying to convey
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      Now (my) heart is increasing in flutter, and stained
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      (Your) sourness and sweetness (I) love them all
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">Beautiful happiness in pieces</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      The times (I) love when (you) give (me) colour"
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div></div>
</div>
<div>
  How should I start... my first impression should be the grand entrance of the
  instrumentals in the chorus, presenting itself as an impactful and bursting
  out freedom-like experience, sort of a presentation of a free soul, and this
  is what the essence of this song is about too. And that is along with the
  lyrics which is describing stained glass in general but also adding the idea
  of a feeling of a freely moving soul, if that makes any sense to you. These
  made the impression of this song more unique than I have heard in years, and
  thinking about it now, this will truly live to make me remember how much I
  liked the melody of this otherwise unbalanced feel of freedom. The music video
  is also adequately themed to the object in question.

<div>Rating: Marvellously Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Nemui Kedo [But (I'm) Tired]</div>
<div>From the first verse:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Though (I'm) tired, (I'm) tired; (but) going out is priority
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Though (I'm) tired, (I'm) tired; (but) the smell outdoors, (I'm) keen
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Movies, lunch or yawns (I) won't compromise on
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Because (I am) with you"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  Well well, we have come back to love song territory again, but before that, I
  should talk about why my return to this song. My first impression of this was
  more of cheap repeated lyrics and a heavy pop theme, and that really deterred
  me off when I was listening to a pop heavy week of releases back then so this
  did not stand out. But listening to it on the album again this is way more
  palatable compared to the more innovative design in melodies for the other
  songs in the release given its simpler feel, and that is what gave me the
  second chance to this tune. And of course, the simple lyrics are probably the
  highlight of this song itself, as once again, someone has written them to make
  sure she will come to you and let you be her arm pillow. What else do you need
  me to describe? I feel like I'm already tired telling you about this song; You
  should experience it for yourself.
</div>
<div>Rating: Exhaustingly Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: I don't know how to describe this single. It has all the songs I
  would want in a single, yet I don't think I would say this has a theme strong
  enough to make most people like this release in particular. The topic song is
  a theme itself, but it has a B-side which is typical Mocho fare, so unless you
  want to know something from her solo music career while still be able to hear
  something different, then you have come to the right place. The album brought
  me into this review, so don't ask how I missed this instead of diving into
  more unconventional presentation styles in her album afterwards. I won't
  question too much on how good this single feels now in my opinion, though.

This is one too many fandom to talk about, but let's see if I can wrap my head
around these. We have black vs white. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, that's the theme for
Kyari-san's two singles released on the same date, I can't say this. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
But serious talk though, maybe we should just not credit the Anime too much by
using Anime covers. Or in Limited Edition, just so I don't buy them.

  This particular single from Kyari-san though is themed in black in case you
  haven't noticed, from outfits to the cover to everything in between her
  beautiful skin, it's just black. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> What is inside isn't much, but what
  am I to expect from the single anyways, we're reviewing songs here. Though, it
  took me a while to struggle and ponder what special gift to get myself, for if
  you are in the camp of short hair and tank top then you'll pick the likes of

  ones are awesome I had to ensure my chances by going to the record label's
  parent store ANIPLEX+ to secure this free deal. I cannot <i>possibly</i> walk
  away from this empty-handed it has only been 4 months. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span> Yeah the cost is
  also higher from this store so now it feels like I bought the photo I
  guess...? The booklet is still stacked with photos though; That might already
  be worth the purchase- This is Regular Edition now? Haha okay

  Wow damn did I type and type all night and still can't satiate my talk about
  these lovely women. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Ah hey, what can I say, mainstream is
  disappointing OR not releasing singles that impress. With all the digital
  single talk and no Anime to credit it's no wonder they won't win against these
  record labels who just serve to impress my wallet. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, I hope this
  isn't the end for this year, for we have been going like a bullet train so
  far, looking back at the previous years where it's just plain boring. See you
  on the next issue, yes?
