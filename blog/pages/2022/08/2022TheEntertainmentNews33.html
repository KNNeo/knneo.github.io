Boy, was I greeted yesterday morning with a Kanno Mai Instagram live where she
announced her recovery from the fire that was going on last week affecting many
of my beloved idols, and marupi-chan who apparently is just recording a Story
while recording for her first appearance in a drama series but ended up being
live for about a minute and 1k people including me saw it? Okay haha but then
again though, Mai-chan really sounded less lively than she normally is and I
don't even mind this ASMR haha can I hug and console you right now <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>
Anyways happy birthday dear girl, and maybe you should take care of your throat
unlike Nan-chan who did the midnight 2-hour livstream on YouTube (which I
watched on Monday) coughing half the time lol why
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay intro too long already so let's Anime and music! I saw a lot on Twitter
  and that's why I should stop following Anime official accounts, and I can't
  wait to see what's up lol okay maybe just for "Engage Kiss" lmao did you see

  you get for buying the whole Blu-Ray bundle? Damn haha ok ok let's focus on
  this<br />

  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "I don't remember anything after the fifth bamboo shoot" Haha oh yeah
      Kazuya you were real drunk lol
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  I know right, Chizuru taking care of anyone? I mean, she doesn't even take
  care of herself. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> In this new episode though we shift our focus away
  from her not adding the guy as a friend via the group chat (#KanoKari19)
  because remember we have FOUR main characters in this series lol so let's talk
  about Ruka-chan and Mami-chan!! Hey, it's been a while since we get some of
  those especially if we have to explain the former's night with the dude lol ah
  hey it was great okay Kazuya is the idiot for not realizing that, but yeah,
  even though Kazuya just recovered from being blind drunk and maybe being in
  Heaven for about half a night hehe tell that to no one I guess, he is now
  working part-time with his current girl Ruka-chan in the karaoke bar everyone
  has been to in season one lol what a coincidence. What seemed to be really
  just Mami-chan dropping by to take a look at Kazuya growing up and having a
  job, but turns out she might have gotten more than she wanted but this is all
  on Ruka-chan though, being uneasy and all. But I guess they did end up
  figuring out all of it themselves just that one voiced everything out and the
  other just kept quiet about their former relationship. Heck, the ex still had
  a more solid profile in Kazuya's life than you haha <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Yeah Kazuya you're
  right, letting both of them interact they will just roast each other. This is
  becoming a great BBQ session, I tell you. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But good thing is,
  Mami-chan chose to doze the charcoal early by leaving even though she is just
  here to finish her report she wasn't really lying about that, but yeah, it
  only took her far enough to be pissed off about... well everything that has
  been happening this whole time. With a woman's bag in his place it was not
  cheap anyways it's super branded, to some girl just stomping into the
  conversation about being the ex... it seems like Mami-chan may not have
  understood or maybe even at this point, further misunderstood everyone's
  relationship with Kazuya. Thankfully, coincidentally meeting up with Chizuru
  on the train cleared all that lol don't ask why someone is inquiring on your
  bag that much, by the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... eh Chizuru you may have
  f**ked it up, or I would say, solved the mysteries trapped in Mami-chan's
  head. So uh, thanks? Well what's with more drama, yes? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But you know,
  maybe speed it up a little, I know there's a lot of monologues but damn the
  waits from scary Mami-chan is really worse than just Ruka-chan being so
  passionate being the girlfriend haha <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Ah hey, kudos to Naobou's acting
  and we all wish she liked any of us this much lol see you all next time for a
  deeper black hole

  P.P.S. "Friends? Even for me that is..." YEAH SAME DUDE haha imagine if I were

  I swear you're going to see me write "... and now we're siblings" so much more
  often than any review I've done for Anime just because. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new
  episode (#TsureKano06) where "siblings don't get jealous of each other" haha
  Yume-chan see what I did there? We have more things that will trigger the
  sister but not the brother, of all things. Firstly, grades. Yeah, remember
  last time where Mizuto mentioned about how little effort he has to undergo to
  get good grades? Kinda me IRL but what's different for him is that he has a
  sister he can beat. In grades. Don't get me a court case, please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Anyways, Yume-chan is just as usual pissed at how she did so well in the one
  paper in the midterms and will still get trashed by Mizuto here just because
  he probably spent half the time to study than she did, just got even more
  pissed finding out that the self-check after the paper's over (yes this is a
  thing, where you can bring your question paper home since it's over for all)
  and the guy is missing some entries just so which I like to believe, can piss
  the sister off since he really doesn't care about grades. But yeah now that
  the sister has mentioned it and got the mom scared lol, I guess he suddenly
  thought it'll be a good idea to rinse her in grades. And so he did,
  relentlessly. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, no one said your question paper has to be filled
  with scribbles in order to fill our answers. Maybe he's that good he doesn't
  even need to do any calculations or write notes to fill it in. Now THAT is
  pure genius. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next up, a friend in school. Yep, don't tell me why
  Yume-chan has the
  <a
    href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=ja"
    target="_blank"
    >j-j-j-jealousy</a
  >
  over Mizuto's friend Isana as a stepsister (yep emphasis on the "step" lol
  okay Isana-san could you relax?) but apparently she did, and with the
  different treatment when talking to the brother becoming more of a thing in
  recent days lol yeah we count by days by the way, Mizuto decided to confront
  the sister with his charms (lol why) and THEN ask her about her troubles with
  him hanging out with a girl. Well, a girl who doesn't want to be one. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  See, because this Isana-san rather just be a dude so he, uh she, can hang out
  with other guys with similar interests which in this case is
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/manga" target="_blank">manga</a> I guess,
  would not bother to compete with Yume-chan to any extent but just hope that
  her sibling relationship with the guy will go well. So yeah, screw you,
  Yume-chan. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, serious talk? I saw the official website. We
  know, we know Isana's eventual relationship with the guy. So yeah, her desire
  to be only a male? Might be over with a crush on the dude. Get it? Haha hey I
  plan for these jokes don't treat me like Isana-san, thanks. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Gotta say
  though, I like the straightforwardness despite the obvious plot developments
  in this series so again I gotta quote "OsaMake" as my best reference so much
  so I don't even link it anymore you're welcome, but yeah, maybe, just maybe,
  Yume-chan rather see his brother go out with someone than THINK she can be
  with him... forever fuelled by her

  </blockquote>
  Man, like really, thanks Pedura for the summary I can't imagine hearing this
  from Solow-san I know this is a fantasy series but can we stick to the
  slice-of-life theme too? Thanks. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where I guess we
  see them in the outfits seen in the opening theme now (#Arusuno06), LONDON
  TRIP!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, what is with the running away from Knights bullsh*t-
  Anyways haha that was a long chant can we have the intro lmao, let's see if
  anything were to happen on their trip out of the magic school. We were close
  though, I'll tell you that. So, looks like this time around the girls ie. the
  Select by the way don't forget they were the Chosen which is why they can have
  afternoon tea at a magician's quarters lol, were tasked to go out of the
  school to get stuff whether important or not, a bunch of groceries which I
  guess the school can't produce without making noise so the girls had to do it
  in stealth. Yeah, I know right, why the secrecy though? So turns out, they
  will be found out by the Knights if the girls use magic too much apart from
  going home which of course they have to, but you know, one could never afford
  to fight those
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> even if
  they have been successfully trained to kill larger bugs in recent weeks lol.
  So yeah, call on your Splinter Cell instinct and let's go to the store not run
  by fairies to buy... most of the stuff in the list haha ah hey no one said
  this is the best store in town we just went to one who would believe in
  brownies - not the food that you like but - beings like fairies who would help
  in exchange of offerings, so they exploited the shit out of that I guess.
  Just, maybe next time just let one person go into the store normally might be
  easier in my opinion, but remember, stealth. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> The girls helped each
  other out and cleaned the place before they could set the store on fire, and
  the kid is just glad he doesn't have to clean up or get scolded by the manager
  when he comes back. Ah hey, don't forget this is like the 1800s where kids are
  exploited for labour so let's not talk much. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on, we have cow
  milk to get, and this is where the girls shone I guess, and I don't mean the
  light coming down on the guy and the aggressive cow because it got bit by a
  bee lmao, but the girls handled this the same way as above by helping out in
  exchange for the only thing the farm had which is, you guessed it, milk. Same
  with the eggs, and because don't you love this flow of events, they got apples
  as help for cleaning up the store, so they gave it in exchange for what they
  wanted, how lovely. And technically Pica-chan got the newspaper because what
  else do you wrap apples in. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All in all, fantastic epiosde we finally
  get to talk about the outside world, but that doesn't mean the Knights have
  not noticed their presence, but you know, according to the guy he doesn't care
  so we are safe. For now. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Moving on let's hope we get to see more
  action hopefully, but I'm still enjoying this to the fullest, so don't ask me
  who is the best girl this episode. You know, you know. Haha we are only
  halfway through can't wait to see what's next
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "We're all scared, but we'll be fine!" Come on, we get to see handsome
  (though scary) guys!? What's bad about that? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>]

  Man, gotta teach your girls more drawing in school. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> See? Sakura-san
  knows. Haha anyways in this new episode where we basically only can point out
  the bad guy if we see him again (#LycoReco07), I mean, it doesn't take much
  for him to strike back, doesn't he, this Majima? So yeah, let's see how this
  goes. We have more stories to talk about apart from his recent attack on a
  police station though as Robota slowly helps him draw closer to the DA and
  causing panic such that they can't handle other events which may require the
  cafe's help so there's that, Chisato managed to see - and that's why
  smartphone lock screen notification visibility settings exist - Mika's message
  from a certain person inquiring about this Lycoris' future. Well no surprises
  there we know it's Yoshi-san who frequents the café and is a member of the
  Alan Institute, but we don't know much from that apart from they are good
  friends. Maybe too good because did you see that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kabedon" target="_blank">kabedon</a> in the
  lift? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, the girls are keen on what happened and also did not
  know of Yoshi-san's involvement in this talk, so they get ready to hack into
  the secret bar those two meet frequently. Apparently as Kurumi/Walnut has
  described (you think Fuki knows about this hacker?), all it needs is for the
  main couple (lol) to dress up appropriately and they can get in with fake IDs
  and names which given credit Chisato has such a booty it's worth sinking your
  head into lmao Takina <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, could not be bothered to be involved in this
  men's talk until the blondie decided to listen in to their conversation while
  sneaking out of the place. So yeah, to summarize because it would be better
  for anyone to listen in on themselves to grasp the lore here, because let's
  just say the Alan Institute is - and I hope you noticed already - some
  religious group that believes in prodigies and cultivating them through ways I
  don't want to talk about - are kinda borrowing Chisato on credit to the DA
  through Mika-san here, likely just in time to help with the Tower incident a
  decade ago. Yes, when Chisato was killing people not including Majima who
  escaped apparently, I was still stuck in school getting bullied by female
  classmates on day one. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, my purpose of being a bully victim,
  dictated by God. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> F**k off, religion; I don't know you. ANYWAYS, real
  talk now that I've offended 99% of my audience if there is any, note that we
  have "Engage Kiss" with the same thinking anyway and we still don't know what
  Chisato's purpose is for, if it's for killing with a smile on her face or
  whatever. I guess it won't matter we will know it soon enough, but all in all
  I think this episode definitely gave a whole lot more insight to what we are
  probably all curious about: What happened to the Tower a decade ago. This, I
  am very keen to know. Whether this specific approach of using Chisato as a
  superpower for the DA is an ethical move or not amongst other factors to
  consider, we shall see if all this makes sense when we get to it. See you
  then.

[TL:DR; Not being racist but, you think this Anime denying a romantic
relationship between Kusunoki and Mika is rejecting romance between different
skin colour? Just saying haha I know right I can sue these guys]

    </blockquote>
    I gotta say though, Kisara? You don't kiss the mouth in this case to wake
    him up. We all know the Sleeping Beauty woke up because she got kissed in
    the- Haha in this new episode where we talk about what happened to Sharon's
    arrival at this city who wants nothing from the rest of the world or so it
    seems (#EngageKiss07), looks like I guess the Church's representative is
    here for a simple reason: To get rid of Kisara. Well, being a friendly demon
    who helps the local law enforcement is obviously a double-edged sword kind
    of like Kisara's blade, but let's just say that is probably how this Bayron
    City has gotten by with keeping the threat in check so far, and then
    covering it with their own explanations. So if this were to be revealed by
    the Church then it will be a future problem for the state to deal with, as
    the representative will have to mention their findings about this nun's
    arrival. We also know a little bit more about Sharon, that she is let's just
    say a gifted member of a bunch of selected of 12 we don't know what her
    number is but it is getting detective Tetsuya hyped lol, and that her
    objective is as of now to get rid of this resident helper demon. If she is
    right about it though in the interrogation at the end of the episode, then
    maybe, just maybe, getting rid of Kisara would be wise in order for her to
    not be part of a greater threat when she changes sides, who knows. But right
    now, she is still fuelled by love as she relies on Shun heavily to recover
    and even though she walked into an abandoned building and had to fight
    whatever Sharon wore which really, this thing is just absorbing all of
    Sharon's *** in order to take down this demon... Kisara, you can die now
    rest in peace I just want to watch Sharon get horny. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, this is
    as nice as I can put it, please. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Hentai references aside haha I
    know nothing about those btw I don't go to Comiket lol, that even using
    powers of a demon could not take down this girl's (probably not girl since
    she is at least a thousand years old) power of love or kiss with a man who
    wants her somehow, so much as to get her away from whoever Sharon was used
    to help him obtain such demon power. But hey, Sharon wants her dead but
    she's kinda cute so... maybe Shuu is an otaku? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Maybe loli we don't
    know for sure. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What we do know though as Sharon pointed out, she
    will use women as much as to reach his objective which, I guess maybe at
    this point it doesn't matter what it is because he may have forgotten parts
    of them already, even so to fulfil those objectives in the first place. Hey,
    probably why even with all the damn memories Shuu managed to escape with a
    demon from the forces of a titan? I mean, he had to do something real bad on
    this nun- Okay yeah so basically they had sex! Haha not anal though??
    <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> DUDE haha okay jokes over let's move on so thank goodness Shuu did
    whatever else that is drug her but not that she will get super sensitive lol
    I don't know porn, but I guess it does paralyze her but not using the
    thrusting method- You get the idea. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, ironically if you
    didn't notice no one was dead so Sharon will be back to hunt down Kisara
    again sometime sooner than later hopefully with another tentacle suit haha
    ah- And Ayano is just there to watch, I guess. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Hey, you want to
    talk about romance or action here? We have both so we can talk about more of
    any of those next week hehe
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; Say Ayano, with regards to Shuu's love timeline... you might not be
    the best but you are the longest...? Ask Kisara to see if I'm right haha]

    for Anime, and yes I gave it, what of it? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Welcome to the Klassic
    Note Collection, Hocchan, took you long enough haha. I've also listened to
    <b>Hitsujibungaku</b> (FINALLY haha) and specifically
    <a

      target="_blank"
      >their EP from 2021</a
    >
    because in a rock festival live months ago I heard them sing two songs from
    two different releases so I took their most popular song from their major
    debut album, and then the weekend I listened to something a little
    different, both exhibiting their alternative music style which is kinda what
    I dig so let's see if I can remember them by next year to give more. Their
    most popular song did not get me though, don't ask me why. And finally we
    can move on to actual new songs haha I know right,
    <b
      ><a
        href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%85%B8%E6%AC%A0%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3/1637394374?l=en"

        >Sayuri's new album</a
      ></b
    >
    and ironically her 2nd since her major debut in 2016 is kinda... let's just
    say recycled, so much so I don't want to give the songs that were in digital
    singles almost 4 years ago and only remember of the songs I have given over
    the years related to Anime or not, and really there were only 2 new songs
    and I gave none of them. I did try, trust me, but I still ended up giving
    the one Anime ending theme for Lycoris, so that was I was there for, I
    guess. Hey, I rather give a small selection of good songs than a bunch of...
    rubbish:) haha but that just means it'll take you years to be recognized by
    me on that 18-song mark. Maybe not as long as Hocchan but we shall see
    hehe<br />
    <br />On this week's news about music that is on Twitter I really should
    come up with a better intro of a paragraph I keep saying that and I don't
    even care,

    because they were in a popular music TV show in Japan so that's good news of
    their reputation to be honest,

    and the community so I really wonder to myself if this is the end of them in
    Klassic Note because I think so really no one can top IKE-san and look at
    HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR in 2010 and tell me this is history repeating itself
    lol,

    is a masterpiece I can't even describe the master behind this Nakamura
    Yuusuke and it's going to feature a cover of an English song so I don't know
    if that will benefit or harm this release,

        >SIX LOUNGE is releasing a new EP under new music label</a

    Sony Music Japan (YEP) so that's kinda hype I already expressed by interest
    in syncing this awesome rock band with Anime series "BLEACH" which could use
    a lot of theme songs <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, and I thought they have already been on it but
    <b
      ><a
        href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1558077198887559168?s=20&amp;t=L8kYmN9XlNjPixNUcvJxPg"
        target="_blank"
        >Creepy Nuts is on YouTube series THE FIRST TAKE again</a
      ></b
    >
    with the song I started listening to them with so that's kinda cool I didn't
    miss their best song from last year this year. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span><br />
    <br />So next week we have another week of Anime theme songs which I have no
    choice but to oblige which is also why I'm holding back listening to more
    rock festival footage unless this sucks which might to be honest,&nbsp;<b
      ><a
        href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E8%AA%B0%E5%BD%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB-%E3%81%82%E3%82%8C%E3%81%93%E3%82%8C%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF-complete-edition/1636628149?l=en"
        target="_blank"
        >halca's new double A-side single</a
      ></b
    >
    for some reason with Suzuki Aina and that wasn't great so let's just give
    the opening theme song for Anime instead if I can. Not to worry, I think we
    should be good on this one the music video is already a good reason to
    remember the first A-side song lol maybe I will listen to the rock festival
    footage then<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    And now we wait for the new issue of "Douki-chan" to ship so we can have our
    new package in. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Well if you can buy in Japan be sure to grab your
    copy in stores since it's out yesterday and also in Comiket I assume
    Yomu-sensei is up there too. Trust me, I REALLY want to buy

      >that Ayano T-shirt</a
    >
    for some reason but I don't know if it will fit me they only have one size-
    Then again she has a huge rack so that shirt is probably XXL HAHA <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Cya
    guys next time then lol, and until next time... I am for once thinking of
    whether I should continue APoL if you know what that is, in the near future.
    Hmmmmmmmm...
