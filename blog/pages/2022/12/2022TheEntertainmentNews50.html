I... think I may have missed the Natsukawa Shiina single release online event
livestream last week thinking that I didn't get chosen. BUT I DID GET CHOSEN. I
can even prove it in my Club Animate account where the raffle was hosted.
<span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I need to change my email address for this account to my primary lol
(yeah or just add that secondary account to my phone)
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  ANYWAYS haha I doubt I missed much what else can I say besides "I want you to
  be my younger sister" lmao and it's no handshake or whatever idol event that
  has physical intimacy just because so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again is this what it
  feels like to be a fan? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Seriously though, wanted Ueda Reina but
  didn't get it and got
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> but
  didn't go- I feel like an idiot now I tell ya<br />
  <br />I've done a lot of dumb things this year alone, but at least... I'm
  giving money out right?? In this season of giving I think I'm already going
  bankrupt just shipping the new package in, and the hole in my pocket is
  getting bigger with Christmas events AND my sis' birthday so let's ignore
  those and talk about Anime and music instead!<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br /><br />
  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BLEACHTYBW09">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span
      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span>

  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "We may have to say goodbye" Wait, what? KYORAKU NO we just lost the old
      geezer dude
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Oh Kyoraku is literally me when they had to promote me at work because all the
  seniors left. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Too real, dude, too real. But unlike my job where I
  can just leave haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, in this new episode where Kyoraku has to take over
  the ranks from the old geezer (#BLEACHTYBW09), we are about to witness a
  drastic change in the traditional Gotei 13 we are all proud of until recently
  where it got trashed by the Sternritter army. So yeah, change, right? Let's
  talk about all the changes that will happen before us. Firstly, Ichigo and
  Renji. They changed. Well, kinda, just in physique they got more ripped- Who
  am I lying to? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They are healed though, thanks to the bath from
  Tenjirou, and are set out to heal even more thanks to Hikifune's spiritual
  energy embodied food using her modified soul Gikon tech so by the way she was
  the inventor and NOT Urahara and if you know her she was mentioned in the Turn
  Back The Pendulum Arc with the story from a century ago, just briefly. And
  Ichigo is right, thinking about how they are taking a bath and eating and
  enjoying life while the bottom of this world is just struggling to prepare for
  the next fight? Yeah, just that he didn't know that they were in a bath made
  for either close to dead bodies like Byakuya or people who have insane
  spiritual energy to withstand the heat from the bath, and food that'll already
  make me full just looking at it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, enjoy the dessert and
  muscles and slimmed down Hikifune with the rack that puts Hiyori to shame
  lmao, because she is very right the next guy will be rough. Yeah, the guy who
  MADE the zanpakuto. *kreygasm* Without him this series wouldn't even exist.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, technically without him I wouldn't have loved this series
  because it'll only be Hollows and Quincies which is BORING~!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Come
  on, swords are OP. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, moving on, next change, is Kyoraku is
  the new leader of the Gotei 13. And yeah, he'll make sure all his subordinates
  will move along with him to the 1st squad because goddamn with the burn down
  of the barracks I'm pretty sure there aren't any old dudes left to serve him
  so old dudes of Central 46 can we chill and let him make the decisions now?
  Thanks. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> The last but not least change he made to the system is to
  literally disobey the council and request for the training of Zaraki Kenpachi
  in swordsmanship. The one which was banned even after the old geezer taught
  him just one lesson in
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kendo" target="_blank">kendo</a> which we
  saw him take down Nnoitra with- Do you remember that fight or it's just me?
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'll take that as consent so MOVING ON haha goddamn I'm going to
  speak about BLEACH to people and they will have no idea if I'm lying or not
  lol. So yeah, spoiler alert, Kyoraku then called upon the trainer who will
  facilitate Zaraki's (and that's why I'm using his given name from here on)
  training to get him to know the sword's name he has been holding on to after
  stealing it from some rando shinigami: Unohana Retsu. Or actually, Yachiru
  Kenpachi. We will talk about the deja vu you might be experiencing now from
  just the name I remember there was backstory for this, but man, this first
  Kenpachi is going to hit Zaraki so hard his zanpakuto is going to awaken. Haha
  it's like Ichigo when he fought Zaraki too, remember Zangetsu came in to save
  him? Yeah, history repeating itself, boys. And I guess the best part about
  this fight so far is literally Unohana sh*ttalk on him all over the place like
  feminism is king in the underground prison barracks of Seireitei haha just
  because she is technically right that the Kenpachi over generations have
  gotten weaker- How did they even do the 1-on-1 fighting thing to take over
  each Kenpachi's place over the years? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, in case you thought
  Ichigo is a water pipe without a tap, Zaraki here is a water dam but without
  the flood gates. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all though, man we do have a lot of
  progression just this episode alone but yeah it's all over the place, but
  looks like we will continue our focus for the Kenpachi fight for now before we
  continue on the adventures of Ichigo and Renji in the Palaces which I'm
  probably more keen on. But considering that I know the former less from the
  original work and <em>really</em> wish to see more concept stuff added in, let's
  hope the decision for the fight of the Kenpachis will be one of the best
  fights for this season. We are also just at the precipice of even more new
  exciting stuff we will be witnessing at this final arc, and I'm only going to
  be hyped for every single one of them just because. Can't wait for more action
  next week this fight alone is already rad

<div>
  [TL:DR; Hey, you think
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/80/Aya_Hisakawa" target="_blank"
    >the voice behind Unohana</a
  >
  ever imagined the day she had to voice an evil villain when she accepted the
  role back in 2004? I wouldn't. Oh she was Suu-chan in "Love Hina"? Haha today
  I learnt]

  "You've stopped sinking" Is probably what all of us have heard from our
  swimming instructors at some point in our lives before we actually knew how to
  swim. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this FLASHBACK EPISODE haha again?? Man, this episode can
  only mean that many things (#UzakiChanS211) as Sakurai ponders about his life
  and specifically his relationship with the girl known as Uzaki Hana. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Ami-chan and Sakaki are totally enjoying their dinner with her talking about
  Sakurai for days to come haha and knowing this girl won't even do anything
  about it, Sakaki at least is probably glad to see that Sakurai might be
  looking forward after his visit back home and seeing him back at work at the
  cafe. Well, at least, that's what we saw. Because apart from just going home
  and seeing his family gaining a new member but not through adoption or the dad
  f**king another woman lmao can he even though, the dad just barely, and I mean
  that then I said BARELY, taught him a lesson during their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/judo"
    target="_blank"
    >judo</a
  >&nbsp;session (lol) to inquire about his love life and/or find out more about
  how much of a wuss he is dealing with boy-girl relationships just like how I
  would if I had such a girl in my life which I don't. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways haha
  why am I the one sad now, the mother taught those two men a lesson because
  they didn't finish their battle before dinner time lmao she's the MVP by the
  way, is still not better than a lesson from Nodoka-chan here who is so cute
  the only thing I learnt is that I rather deal with this family than whatever
  the Uzaki family is compromised of. Not even with Tsuki-san, no. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Also, I thought the gathering of so many men in the café I like how Ami-chan
  just saw herself out lmao, would actually trigger some sort of thing in
  Sakurai considering on one side we have Fujio and the guys from the gym
  actually knowing the other side Akihito who runs the shop- That's Ami-chan's
  dad by the way. But instead, we have triggers of people getting jealous on the
  advisory panel here YOU GUYS LITERALLY KNOW HER!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, assuming
  none of them are in sync lol how can this work at such close range I don't
  even know this is worse than wireless tech from the 90s, but in case you did
  not realize, the only thing Sakurai probably got away with all this is
  probably what his dad mentioned, that he should not leave the girl hanging.
  Literally. So yeah, he decided to push her away, as seen from Uzaki being
  rejected of a Christmas celebration together with this ex-loner turned not
  loner and reverting back as of now. What will happen for their Christmas
  though? I mean, I know what mine is but do you want to tell me again, me?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> All in all... The guys around Sakurai are just carpet bombing
  hints to this poor dude I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, I guess Sakurai is
  taking a hint or two now that he realized his relationship with this
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kouhai" target="_blank">kouhai</a> isn't
  going anywhere. How are we going to conclude next week if he keeps thinking
  like this, right? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey you too Uzaki, don't think you can run away
  from this too. Ugh, my head hurts. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, let's see if Sakurai's
  current stand by letting her go will make any of them feel better about this.
  We shall see.

  Wow we are witnessing a murder live on national TV? YIKES dude. *ahem* In this
  new episode which I assume is the signal for the final arc of the series
  (#KoukyuuNoKarasu11), we are dealing with vampires? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> B*tch said she
  needed blood so- They are called
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kyonshi" target="_blank">kyonshi</a> in this
  Chinese universe, by the way. Anyways, we are not quite there yet, so let's
  talk about what is there. Firstly, the Minister's advice is there. Always
  there. Reminding Jusetsu every time she visits probably until he has to retire
  to his hometown and stay at his brother's place... he will remind her with
  every silver hair he has on his face. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What's probably more
  impressive is how he can remember how many games of
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kifu" target="_blank">Go</a> he played with
  the previous Raven Consort who is also his acquaintance, could not even
  pretend to lose to our dear main girl here as we see her get trashed by the
  emperor haha period drama, by the way. *ahem* The Minister is also advising
  her to not have too much fun in the palace as that will imprint on her her own
  monster within which I would say sounds like a great thing if we're talking
  about in the bedroom but not really as a messenger of a god, I don't think.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> What else is there is also this week's case, where as you would
  remember from the previous episode someone was killed under a tree stump.
  Well, sucked off blood apparently, so you can guess if you have watched enough
  of just supernatural media in general what that might be. Our current clues
  are getting more obvious as the episode progresses because from the Magpie
  Consort being in bed and refusing to listen to any of her servants BUT just
  the one servant by the way, also was the one who requested upon Jusetsu's
  premises to ask to revive someone from the dead, probably is now heartbroken
  and/or unwell due to the passing of some guy she loved that isn't the emperor.
  *ahem* Hey, at a time of weakness, it wouldn't be surprising to know that
  someone will come to her assistance, promising her of the power to revive the
  dead. Just, you don't know the price to pay because you're always bedridden.
  <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> For that, I wouldn't even bother thinking that whoever that dude is
  coming to kill Jusetsu will be a threat, because whatever we mentioned earlier
  is already a problem not even considering the political consequences of
  sending her home. The last thing I want to mention that is there and probably
  will be even after all this time, is the Raven Consort's social circle. Never
  in probably any Winter King's life did they get more liberty to make this many
  friends and/or acquaintances despite being a god messenger and exorcist living
  her life in solitude all this while. And yet, Jusetsu is worried about getting
  them all involved till the point she won't even carry out some of the
  investigations herself, putting them in danger. Hey, sending the eunuch off
  and telling him to come back by nightfall is great IF he listened, but if you
  know we might be dealing with something scary at the dark of night then
  <em>maaaybe</em> don't let him go at all, yes? Nonetheless, the Summer King is
  here, so let's see if they can be of any help. Oh yeah, next week we are
  starting with a fight, I tell ya. You thought Bianyue last time possessing
  Jiu-Jiu was a problem?? Yeah, wait till THIS happens and you tell me. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span>
  Anyways, great episode, great lead-up, I want to time travel to next week to
  see what happens now lol but I can't, so let's wait in patience. You know, at
  my own abode, at night, with a well lit light source, where them vampires
  can't get me. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you at your safe places soon.
</div>
<div>
  [So uh, you think the reason the previous Raven Consort died is because of
  this "owl"? Or that she can't fight against it? Maybe dude, but Jusetsu
  technically hasn't found a successor so that's a problem? Or maybe that's how
  to break the cycle by not losing to this thing I guess]
