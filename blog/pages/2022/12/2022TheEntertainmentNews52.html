MERRY CHRISTMAS- Hey, Merry Christmas, everybody.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Hey, I think we should leave the new year part... in the new year haha
  obviously, since these posts are aligned with the holidays again! So yeah,
  until then. Until then though!! We have plenty of stuff to do including what
  was supposed to be the last package of the year which I screwed up so I hope I
  can get that next week tbh fingers crossed, as I sit at home doing nothing and
  watching YouTube videos. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah right we have things to do, me, so
  let's wrap the year up, yes?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  On a side note, I will be skipping "BLEACH" this week because I teased a
  one-hour special of it to end the season which is next week and I'll be
  watching it with that before the year ends instead of waiting for the new year
  so expect another post like, coming Tuesday or something. Meanwhile, we will
  conclude the Anime this season and talk about the ones coming in next season!
  I think I only remembered "Stray Dogs" lol I don't care about the others
  tbh<br />

  So yeah, new year, new Anime, <strike>we</strike> I will talk about my
  impressions of the Anime I will be watching in the coming three months,
  ranging from I don't care to maybe give an episode or three episodes because I
  like this metric instead of just- and THEN just simping on sequels because I
  regret giving it the one time. I'm a variety Anime watcher. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  In simulcast chronological order, and premiere dates for my reference in
  square brackets:
</div>
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      Again, filtering out super long Anime titles by default so "Ningen Fushin
      no Boukensh (exceeded character limit lol)
    </li>
    <li>
      Okay okay maybe not
      <b>"Koori Zokusei Danshi to Cool na Douryou Joshi"</b> because despite it
      having a simple romance story and my heart not being able to take another
      love story anytime soon- You know how much they pelted me last year
      already? Haha maybe I need a longer break from that, but considering it's
      adult characters instead of high schoolers I <i>may</i> give this a watch.
      But yeah, looks more oriented to a female audience though; The theme songs
      are a good indicator of that.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hell yeah I'm already excited for the return of another season of
      <b><a href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Winter%202023%20Preview/Bungou%20Stray%20Dogs%20S04.jpg" target="_blank">"Bungou Stray Dogs"</a></b>
      [Premieres January 4th, 2023] because if you haven't heard of my love for
      human extension of powers aligned with this literary character naming and
      therefore powers of this action series, you have been missing out. We are
      6 years into Anime adaptation and the stories doesn't end because we got
      more Ability organizations coming into fictional Yokohama City to do
      trouble. Honestly saying I just want a more diverse cast and lore it's
      just so cool also SCREEN mode and LUCKLIFE for theme songs because why not
      more from the latter after they left the major music label and came back
      haha TMI I know
    </li>
    <li>
      I know that dear
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/34785/Rie_Takahashi" target="_blank">Takahashi Rie</a>
      is good for such a role (see
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/168116/Kanade_Ninomae" target="_blank">"JoshiMuda"</a>,
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/216277/Anzu_Hoshino" target="_blank">"Romantic Killer"</a>) but I'm apprehensive about watching
      <b>"Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko!"</b>
      just because unlike
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/45613/Kawaii_dake_ja_Nai_Shikimori-san" target="_blank">"Shikimori-san"</a>
      who is cool and still feminine, we are dealing with a literal tomboy for a
      girlfriend. So that, I may already hold back to watch even just for the
      image itself. Otherwise, I assume the
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kyun" target="_blank">kyun</a> moments
      would be great for the female side to be honest, so I don't see why one
      wouldn't if you are a fan of the romance genre. Or her haha yeah
    </li>
    <li>
      Wow this <b>"Revenger"</b> thing sounds real cool and probably the ending
      is just politics as usual- It's original Anime too? Oh ok is this even
      worth watching though? The only female main cast looks like a brat- THERE
      IS A NUN IN THE TRAILER THOUGH!!! Haha okay me not all of them are
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/209907/Sharon_Holygrail" target="_blank">Sharon from "Engage Kiss"
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      I gotta say this though, because as much as <b>"Spy Kyoushitsu"</b> has a
      voice cast I would love to see all in a harem story with me lmao, we
      already know I'm not watching because I was tricked by some
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/65643/Koro-sensei" target="_blank">yellow octopus</a>
      years ago. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So no thanks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>"Onii-chan wa Oshimai!"</b> is gender change experiment, by the way.
      Even with
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/35441/Marika_Kouno" target="_blank">Marinka</a>
      as main girl/guy I can't bear myself to watch
    </li>
    <li>
      Haha what?&nbsp;<b>"Sugar Apple Fairy Tale"</b> is considered
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shoujo" target="_blank">shoujo</a>-directed romance <i>after</i> I read the plot?? Holy shit though but I
      like the main girl's voice- Is this enough to watch though... Yeah, even I
      wonder lol the fantasy genre is already kind of a turn-off to me tbh
    </li>
    <li>
      Oh yeah, this sh*t. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      <b>"Inu ni Nattara Suki na Hito ni Hirowareta."</b> is basically being a
      dog. Raised by the one who you liked, and meeting beautiful girls around
      your MALE dog life. So as you can imagine, it's kinda
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> as in
      very, it has
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/46861/Saya_Aizawa" target="_blank">Aizawa Saya</a>
      in it which I don't know what will&nbsp; make of my bias to watch this in
      its entirety of I do because&nbsp;<span style="font-size: xx-small;">she isn't stacked anyways</span>
      lmao... it's just all the wrong stuff. Yes, it's not dog Anime; it's
      female skin censorship Anime, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also I really don't
      want to get this site flagged after what I had with
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/49470/Mamahaha_no_Tsurego_ga_Motokano_datta" target="_blank">"TsureKano"</a>
      so- IS THAT WOMAN GRINDING ON THE CORNER OF A TABLE? Okay no way NO
      F**KING WAY haha ah
    </li>
    <li>
      Hmm among the long titles (lol) I may actually watch simple(?) romance
      series
      <b><a href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Winter%202023%20Preview/Otonari%20no%20Tenshi-sama%20ni%20Itsunomanika%20Dame%20Ningen%20ni%20Sareteita%20Ken.png" target="_blank">"Otonari no Tenshi-sama ni Itsunomanika Dame Ningen ni Sareteita
          Ken"</a></b>
      [Premieres January 7th, 2023] (oh boy I need to know the abbreviation haha
      okay read until Tenshi-sama) since it has all the checkboxes ticked coming
      in from a web comic adaptation: cute girl (hello again
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/44317/Manaka_Iwami" target="_blank">Iwami Manaka</a>), diverse cast, I know the guy singing the opening theme... and I
      haven't seen anything in the trailer that will make me want to romance
      puke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just some wholesome romance, it seems. So yeah, maybe this-
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/149318/Chiaki_Hoshinomori" target="_blank">GAMER</a>
      TOO?? I'M IN haha so much deja vu
    </li>
    <li>
      Oh yeah I don't care about sequels... that I don't care so yes
      "Nagatoro-san" as much as my bro watches it and liked the plot towards the
      end of season one I still don't like the idea of a girl not liking my guts
      and sh*ts on me all the time until she doesn't. The result might be sweet
      but the process is rough dude lol
    </li>
    <li>
      Oh sh*t I forgot about this spirit-hunting romance series
      <b><a href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Winter%202023%20Preview/Kyokou%20Suiri%20S02.jpg" target="_blank">"Kyokou Suiri"</a></b>
      [Premiers January 8th, 2023] is coming back with another season of fun and
      games between the main girl Kotoko and her "boyfriend" (lmao) along with
      his ex, in the quest of fighting against each other to bust urban myths
      and such. Also bust the guy in some ways I guess haha I don't know the
      plot from here on so we gotta watch for some aggressive lover
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/34951/Akari_Kitou" target="_blank">Kitou Akari</a>, dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> That's the fuel and you know that already- Oh yeah
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki" target="_blank">Yuuki Aoi</a>
      is the new villain haha I hope this one's also a love rival lmao
    </li>
    <li>
      Dude, did <b>"High Card"</b> just steal my idea of "A Pack of Life"?? Okay
      minus the gambling but yeah haha, <i>maaaaaybe</i> not because not enough
      female character who aren't behind the betting counters lmao
    </li>
    <li>
      Yeah I've heard of rumours about <b>"Ayakashi Triangle"</b> and how female
      romance it is in perspective so even ignoring the
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ayakashi" target="_blank">ghosts</a>
      plot which my experience is from like, "Kekkaishi" lol so no thanks
    </li>
    <li>
      Ah I've actually been thinking about whether I should be watching
      <b><a href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Winter%202023%20Preview/Kubo-san%20wa%20Mob%20wo%20Yurusanai.jpg" target="_blank">"Kubo-san wa Mobu wo Yurusanai"</a></b>
      [Premieres January 10th, 2023] because what more better of a romance
      series where
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa" target="_blank">Hanazawa Kana</a>
      (married, by the way) keeps disturbing you into loving her- Yes chill me,
      I know&nbsp;<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34902/Tsurezure_Children" target="_blank">"Tsurezure Children"</a>&nbsp;and I can see the reference in a&nbsp;<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/139298/Yuki_Minagawa" target="_blank">character level</a>
      already lmao but this one is serious about her feelings, so you know, I
      wish the guy was me in school. Or maybe it was. Just that this girl is
      persistent. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I wish girls my age were more persistent back then
      haha so yeah definitely in my lane already- DIALOGUE+ NO lol
    </li>
    <li>
      "NieR:Automata" as an Anime, by the way. That's how much animation studios
      don't care about adapting original stories anymore lol we need more new
      stuff dude
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    So yeah, more romance? I have two sequels to watch already so that's a drag
    haha especially "Kyokou Suiri" I didn't like the folklore talk that much so
    hopefully the romance antics will keep me going. And considering I might
    give two more a watch I will stop thinking about the others for even a maybe
    to be honest. And NO MORE ECCHI DOG ANIME haha that thing is just trouble
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    Then again there's the
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hanakokun_info/status/1605820518891823104?s=20&amp;t=LgNCIkGv9Xgum9iY2LY6mg" target="_blank">new season announcement for "Hanako-kun" series</a>

      WHAT DAD NO lol
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  I mean, what's wrong when someone likes your daughter, right? Think about my
  dad's feelings though my sis is still- In this final episode of a series long
  due of a proper ending (#UzakiChanS213), uh, bad news guys, we are STILL not
  getting a conclusion. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But we've heard enough already, yes? So let's
  see what ELSE we haven't heard of. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So uh... I really may have
  wondered what happened when the dad went to buy some things and on the road
  thinking about the relationships between the younger generation as if it's his
  business because seriously, how bad is Sakurai, really? That he drank so much
  to keep a secret? That he willingly stayed by your daughter's side all this
  time? That he's so okay with girls taking his clothes off- Okay that last bit
  might be a little <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, the end of the Christmas celebrations are
  long overdue and I don't mean today IRL haha, so it's better to send Sakurai
  home and give him a break, literally, from Uzaki's mother who didn't help to
  stop the kids from... whatever they were doing to the poor dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And
  then whatever you saw at his place will be a secret. Between the two of them,
  hopefully. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Please, Hana-chan, clearly you never watched Episode 6 of
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/39710/Yesterday_wo_Utatte" target="_blank">"Yesterday wo Utatte"</a> we've been through all this, it's NOT going to happen.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All the shame lol as expected of a middle schooler- Moving on haha,
  remember all the horrible things the girls did to dear Sakurai? I think those
  photos are already in the black market. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That or Ami-chan was the
  highest bidder lmao, so clearly she feels bad about taking in all this fetish
  fulfilment so much so that monetary compensation should be in place- I am
  seriously thinking about what fetish Taketatsu Ayana is in knowing her for a
  decade and beyond and I have no freaking idea what will make her look like
  Ami-chan in this very episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Thank goodness. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But among all
  this fun and end of year celebrations, I think probably the most important
  discussion or even realization in this season alone should be from Sakurai
  alone because Uzaki Hana is a childish college student who can't think, is
  that he then realized he is loved by someone. This dumb middle schooler brain.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not Yanagi, please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And he had to talk to Sakaki and
  Akihito(?) about it, apparently, so they laid on him on the truth. Literally.
  No balls. Just facts. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And they will say the same thing time and
  again, whatever he does they will be by his side. No matter what Uzaki-chan
  thinks of responding to his advances if any, no matter what Uzaki-chan feels
  about the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> we are
  very positive it's no vibes and all love haha, no matter what Uzaki-chan says
  about him being alone and needs company so she shaves off her time to be with
  him... this is truly down to earth, a boy-girl relationship, no doubt. But
  yeah, don't worry, that hasn't happened just yet, because as long as the sun
  shines with a fragment of KUSOCAT's shadow, the dream will never happen. All
  in all, I have a love-hate relationship with this series just like how the
  main two might have now. But we are still good friends, as we can see from the
  stellar cast of characters, the rice cooking joke just never gets old even if
  it's still in the rice cooker and I'm afraid it has to stay there for a little
  longer, and maybe somewhat progressive development this series has been over
  time, but not like I would want another season unless it's an actual
  conclusion, to be honest. Though I should say, I still can't get over the hate
  of the pace of the storytelling and the new characters introduced which is
  basically Fujio-san lmao, the opening theme song is STILL not licensed even
  though the music video is on YouTube lol *pray* someday that will happen next
  year, and the comedy is really rather subpar once you get used to it. So yeah,
  overall a very big meh. Well, two big meh is you need it to be "double" as
  from the title of this season haha also that rack- I'm just glad it's over and
  I can be at peace now lol
</div>
<div>
  [I think I figured out already from what limited resources we have seen so
  far: The opening theme song might be violating copyright maybe with references
  to other songs because the composer and producer of the song Tanaka Hidekazu
  is now NOT credited which hmm... I wonder what happened haha it's a mess
  behind the scenes, if I had to guess. Great song though haha so who cares

  Hey emperor? Why are you so close to her? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Clearly Jusetsu is more
  than just a woman haha because to conclude this wonderful period drama *ahem*
  series (#KoukkyuNoKarasu13), we starting with the ending song? Okay. Maybe
  it's those coma stories where she can never wake up- Did I just jinx it?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, we still got more story to talk about, so let's. Firstly,
  the dreams Jusetsu had, and I think this is the crux of the lore behind the
  Raven god or something, because as I ponder about this once again I do this
  every week lol, I really wonder if we can just kill off this messenger or sort
  of shell as host to the God that easily or not. You know, missing the
  successor thing. But less than that, looks like we have more lore to talk
  about regarding that Owl thing previously. So wink wink, not surprising, the
  Minister of Works was the mastermind behind all this. Yeah I didn't believe at
  all. That you are of any goodwill to Jusetsu. Not even close. You just know
  info. And that's already an issue. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sending letters to the master of
  the Owl's clay shell and to let him in as a eunuch so to fulfil the prophecy
  of killing off the Raven... I wonder what will happen if he succeeds though,
  because apart from him being older than my deceased grandfather lmao I'm sorry
  if I offended myself *ahem* killing off the God of like, facilitator of
  spirits doesn't sound like a good thing, honestly. How then can we send that
  Consort last week to Paradise properly? She's gonna be lost, dude. So yeah,
  luckily the emperor and the underlings figured that out and stopped the old
  man, sent him away from the palace given that he is old *ahem* but also that
  he's just jealous that his old friend ie. the predecessor of Jusetsu, was not
  cared when she was around. And the emperor brought upon a great point too,
  that her care was to the successor Jusetsu. Yeah, they made her cuter.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, maybe the emperor caring for this particular "consort" is
  the right choice: It's saving her from the hell that is having possession of a
  god. That, yeah he can be praised. Even slept with, to be frank. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Please, the beds are the same hard thing, so how can you even? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> All in
  all... Yup, I freaking knew it, they won't conclude this. I already knew they
  will just talk about company to end this adaptation. Damn, please make another
  season of this to tell us the truth. Gotta say, I didn't believe this series
  has the people and/or lore to keep me going especially considering the
  historical context of this fictional universe, but damn I was super wrong
  about all of it. Not only did it serve as such a quirky difference between
  Anime series of the same genre, and yet can still tell many lovely stories
  that move the heart. This is also surprisingly different compared to the many
  shows I've watched in years talking about such things, which is a great change
  AND has very respectable storytelling. For this, amongst other smaller things
  like the golden chicken lol, this is going to make me remember more than I
  would have hoped. Interesting, should be the conclusion I can give it

  [Okay final verdict about what the Raven Consort is now - Years ago "God" was
  split into two, the Owl stuck on a faraway island with respect to the parent
  island, and the Raven governs the souls and sends them to Paradise as such. To
  create the peace from the fight between two Kings to rule the land, the Winter
  King had to be suppressed, but way too suppressed in two ways: (1) having to
  go through some ritual to pass on the spirit of god between human bodies even
  taking some sort of poison to control the spirit within, and (2) having to be
  alone because it will raise the god's temper possibly if exposed to the
  masses. Because of these, the Consort supposedly had to be in solace and had a
  limited life expectancy, as the shell will have to be passed on each
  generation eventually. Strange, but I'll take that much info for now. Really
  intriguing if you think about it though hehe]

  Well this week is kind of surprising why I still have songs to give, but yeah,
  it's just a wrap up though to be honest. The only new release this week and
  almost missing the year already is
  <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/branch/1657578859?l=en" target="_blank">yanaginagi's new album</a></b>
  which as I've seen is based on fan vote on the subsequent mood of the songs
  released which probably did influence the style of songs produced but did not
  stop me from giving more than a couple of songs which is good? I don't know, I
  just picked the one I said I did like from the first round they did this half
  a year ago and maybe another just to pad the song count. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also,
  thanks to <b>mol-74's recent live livestream</b> (archived, but removed by
  now) they reminded me of
  <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hailsham/1653055066?i=1653055069&amp;l=en" target="_blank">the one song from their debut mini-album</a>
  which I rejected and I IMMEDIATELY gave them 5 bucks- I immediately gave back
  the song haha the money just flair by now<br />
  <br />
  So, news on Twitter this week about music! We got:
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1604793665985122304?s=20&amp;t=zj8JCTbt-jl9LQUQOgxPjg" target="_blank">Natsukawa Shiina's new single recording</a></b>
  which actually included the cut out of the B-side at the end with her laughing
  into the camera haha it was interesting to know that was an accident of sorts,
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1604810904016601089?s=20&amp;t=zj8JCTbt-jl9LQUQOgxPjg" target="_blank">Uesaka Sumire's new song preview</a></b>
  definitely sounds too epic for Anime "Nagatoro-san" series but what do I know
  I only know it's not bad,
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1604778579132399619?s=20&amp;t=zj8JCTbt-jl9LQUQOgxPjg" target="_blank">Earphones' new song</a></b>
  is now out already and Rieri why must your rapping be brought in to this group
  or is it the other way around,

  with a new song on the way so that's good news and hope that they can preserve
  their music style for longer before major label destroys their hopes lol
  that's how it works, I'll leave
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/airimania_staff/status/1605896020327399425?s=20&amp;t=zj8JCTbt-jl9LQUQOgxPjg" target="_blank">Suzuki Airi's new music video</a></b>
  for next year if I ever give the animation movie it's based on first,
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1606243220177952769?s=20&amp;t=zj8JCTbt-jl9LQUQOgxPjg" target="_blank">Fuchigami Mai is teasing something for next week</a></b>&nbsp;about the upcoming EP actually it's tomorrow so stay tuned,

  is actually okay even with the off beats but not enough to make me put it for
  this year,

  is the best summary I can come up with they are real cool just give them a
  listen.<br />
  <br />
  So next week... yes we will be taking a break from even Japanese music because
  it's time for another round of&nbsp;<b>Klassic Note Song Awards</b>!! The
  yearly event/post/phenomenon where I judge songs based on melody to my own
  preferences! Don't miss it though, result's on Saturday, will update by
  Twitter. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span><br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />Oh, so in case you wonder what will be of this column next week for the
  new year... we should be catching of Anime series I have missed I guess so
  "Romantic Killer" maybe "Heike Monogatari" or never, and whenever that
  "Takagi-san" movie gets subbed (in English) I will watch it too haha. By then
  I will probably be thinking day and night about what of the 8-bit songs
  (programming joke, so 255) I'll be giving for the year, and hopefully come up
  with a list of results I can be happy with. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We shall see.&nbsp;
