    >Welcome to the Klassic Note Song Awards 2022!</span
  >
</div>
<br />
I'm Aozaki Shouhei, Klassic Note's only listener and judge. It's that time of
the year again, where I sit down in front of my PC at the end of the year to
give out awards and rank the songs I listen over the year. This year shows the
return of normality as the world continues to burn, but as it recovers we see
more artists come back year after year, being more active and such over the
Internet, it can only mean better things from here as the competition of
mainstream over solo artists go stronger than ever. As I dig into past year
songs to discover new artists, I also continue to go back to ones I've liked,
get hype over new announcements over the Internet every week, and enjoy the
liberty of online live performances posted online where more music than ever
were taken to online video platforms to grab our attention. In every corner, we
will always find something that can impress us, no doubt.<br />
<br />As usual, I will state this every year and I will state it again, the
results below do not fully represent the many songs I listen to for the year.
New songs aren't exactly impressive on the mainstream side but they are comfort
food and I take all of those. More innovation is definitely seen on the solo
artists side as many of them turn into composition and lyric-writing roles,
trying to show their prowess in making songs their way. We have more than ever
Collection Artists hitting the numbers and joining the reign so that's good
news, with many more on their way seeing how much they have contributed within
the year too. We also have almost hit 100% in Apple Music adoption of songs I've
listened to which only shows how far we have come since the early days of music
streaming where nothing is available and I still had to rely on the Internet
community to review new songs. The songs come from more forms and genres than
ever, so I try my best to give recognition to as many of them artists as I can.
As you will see below, it has only been harder than ever mainly due to be
plateauing on my opinions for new songs trying to impress. It has been
#KN15YEARS too, by the way, so the pressure is even harder by the year to give
unique songs that are good.<br />
<br />
<div class="details">
  The results below will be split into six segments, with the first two covering
  statistics and analysis of the songs given this year and how they fare.
  Diagrams will be shown in some segments to give a better overall picture
  rather than just displaying tables of data. Finally, I'll conclude on with The
  Top 20 and an audio edit of them by yours truly, so to give you a better idea
  of what songs truly represent the year around in terms of general mood for the
  year when it comes to music around me.
</div>
<br />
(Results finalised on 31/12/2022)<br />
<br />Note: For a detailed explanation of the results, hover/tap over the small
paragraphs you see throughout the post, like the one above

  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-size: large;">STATISTICS</span><br />
  This year, I have given a total of 255 songs over the past 12 months. I've
  spent more time on each release longer compared to past years in recognition
  of their efforts, and find comfort in giving familiar artists and new artists
  I picked up alike. The Internet might have helped with exposure even more, and
  with music streaming services it has become easier than ever to give any
  recommendation I see a chance, hopefully providing than enough bandwidth to
  listen new songs too. It did not stop the momentum of giving new songs though;
  I am just giving more songs per release, more than ever.<br />
  <br />
  <div class="details">
    Firstly, I break down the songs to who sings them and sort them by artist
    composition and gender, giving a good look into a usual heavy bias of female
    solo artists singing good songs, also known as the Vocal Styles Popularity
    Survey. For this year, Female Solo vocals have risen to the yearly average
    of 1.3 to 1 against Male Solo vocals, which shows a nice balance of
    mainstream artists against female solo artists for the year..<br />
    <br />
    Then, we have the Song Integrity Survey. Initially taken as an experimental
    analysis in Klassic Note to fix my biased opinions of what is a good song,
    now it is used as a guide to follow past years judgement criteria so my
    judgement don't go too far off the perpendicular. As I give further detailed
    analysis to the many songs defaulted to the generic 4-star category, this
    survey then is an attempt to give a better insight into how most of the
    songs are rated. It is also became the new benchmark in recent years in
    pushing me to give more 5-star songs which were then based on early
    impression which is not possible now with maturity of my song judgement
    bias. As you can see, there is higher tendency to give more 4-star songs as
    songs are rated slighy above average rank instead of promoting them to
    5-stars.<br />
    <br />
    Thirdly, we have the generic statistics of the songs of the year. These
    include language (for those with a vocalist), year of release (old songs can
    appear in the list as far as 2002 for this year), Anime songs (because when
    I say "sometimes" on Twitter I meant this) and B-side analysis for singles
    which is a direct representation of proving that songs which are good need
    not be their release's topic songs, and we should give more criticism and
    praise to songs not under intentional spotlight.<br />
    <br />Last but not least, we have the Song Appetite Report. The chart
    represents how many songs I've given every month, and show peak and trough
    periods typically based on release month dependent on the music industry or
    periods of time where I just want to give more or less songs. I would say
    despite the difficulties and therefore delays in releasing new songs this
    particular year, many still were released in due time, and therefore did not
    miss much in terms of leaving an impression in Klassic Note, and I am
    thankful for that. Exceptions do apply though, where certain releases are
    still out of reach with the return of love event-only releases.

      <span style="font-size: large;">SONG OF THE DAY</span><br />
      Every day is unique as it is special; songs that surface in our minds will
      set us in a mood and drive our everyday lives. From waking up to going to
      sleep, there's always a different melody that will pop up in my mind from
      listening to the huge amount of songs within and in past years. I would
      confidently say that my mood for the year could be summarised with the
      songs I'm listening to every single day.<br />
      <br />And that's why we have a tie this year so congrats Kroi
      and&nbsp;Ryokuoushoku Shakai for&nbsp;being the most memorable Songs of
      the Year in 2022!!<br />
      <br />
      <div class="details">
        The first two tables below show what are the most popular songs I've
        listened for the year and for each month. The last two tables show the
        most popular songs to wake up and sleep to to give a different
        perspective as to how they potentially can feel if you start and end the
        day with maybe. Criteria are subject to conditions in sleeping habits,
        mood, and mostly due to songs I've listened recently during certain
        times of the day.<br />
        <br />
        Starting from 2019, Song of the Day has been transformed into a
        rank-based system, where every mention pushes you up one rank so that
        rank sharing will make sense. The results shouldn't show much of a
        difference though, but it will more accurately reflect on the position
        of songs within.

      <span style="font-size: large;">RELEASE RANKINGS</span><br />Klassic Note
      may be all about the songs, but what is with songs if they aren't released
      in some form? I say that though, but with the rise of digital singles and
      how music is distributed more often through digital platforms instead of
      coming up with physical releases to substantiate music libraries, it's
      always in comfort to listen to albums every once in a while. Many releases
      performed better than ever as I spend more time with them this year, and I
      continue to give more songs beyond the one or two topic songs with a music
      video. Many artists are going for more than one good album with the world
      opening up, and we do see this year some are adding a couple of singles
      and/or new songs from time to time within the year. Regardless of their
      approach, I will still give them due attention, but with best albums
      looming from artists we've known for long time and mini-albums being a
      conventional middle between bulk and single releases, I will still give
      them praise to the albums and surprising singles I have given throughout
      the year.<br />
      <br />
      <div class="details">
        In Klassic Note, top singles are determined by (1) whether they are in
        Klassic Note Review ie. all songs of the single have been given and is
        not digital only release and (2) how good they fare in impression, so
        ratings come to place. Details for giving these singles shall not be
        discussed further since there is The Klassic Note Review for your
        reference. Top albums are determined mostly by how many songs have been
        given in it, so best album have a natural advantage if I've been
        listening to the artist for years, and mini-albums tend to get an edge
        on these due to low song count too but they have been put lower in
        priority to allow full length albums to shine.

      <span style="font-size: large;">COMMENDATIONS</span><br />
      In Klassic Note there are Awards; And then, there are Commendations.
      Commendations are thing that are worth mentioning but not necessarily in
      competition since it can be unique in circumstance. That, or I want to
      credit them as many of them as possible and it doesn't exactly qualify as
      a regular award. Many listed may be repeats, but this is the place where I
      give proper recognition to certain things for songs who stood out amongst
      the others. Congrats to Kroi for giving me music videos to remember I wish
      I could put them in more; The effort they make in their videos are just
      uniquely fantastic. This and many others easily show the power of music
      videos which are all the more important at a time like this where the
      Internet is the best place to promote new songs.<br />
      <br />
      <div class="details">
        Commendations are generally given to topics which stand out on their own
        with unique features (eg. terrible English, same song title) known as
        Song Commendations, releases that I reviewed and/or are outstanding
        known as Release Commendations, artists which may or may not be singing
        this year also known as Artist Commendations, and honours for
        (promotional) music videos which excelled in impressions also known as
        Video Commendations.
      </div>
      <div class="details">
        <br />
        Instead of giving them as awards, Klassic Note here compliments videos
        which stand out better than their music, sometimes better than not, in
        order to give better representation and thus impression to their audio
        listeners. And so, I commend and also criticise (a bit) on those, as you
        can see below too. Many of the music videos can be found online too, so
        be sure to check those out for yourself. I'll post the links to get you
        started.

      One of the most important things that built the foundation of this Song
      Awards are of course, the Awards themselves. They have also been
      historically the toughest to decide every year apart from the Top 20
      itself, which shows how much thought is put into figuring out the distinct
      feels of all the songs I give for the year, and how important they are
      compared to all of the others above. As with previous years, it has always
      been a challenge to get the right songs to fit the Awards and what they
      should represent, and as much as I try I still hardly feel for some of
      these songs which are worthy of their titles, especially pertaining to
      certain emotions and moods. Regardless, I have made my decision, so here
      are the results.<br />
      <br />
      Congratulations to Hitsujibungaku for THE NEWCOMER I need to listen to
      more of your music library next year to be honest I've not given enough,
      we finally have competition in THE MUSIC category because PHONO TONES and
      SPECIAL OTHERS released album this year but we know who wins, and it was
      hard to decide on THE INSPIRATION so I went for gut feel and amazarashi
      woke me up once again since 2016, so thanks for that.<br />
      <br />
      <div class="details">
        The Award titles mean exactly unless stated otherwise, which are as
        follows:<br />
        <ul>

            the role)
          </li>
          <li>
            THE IDOLISM awards idol songs (sung by voice actress who became solo
            artists mostly) which have been on the rise and the award goes to
            the one with judgement possible to be independent of usual criteria
            eg. melody, music style
          </li>
          <li>
            THE INSPIRATIONAL awards songs which spark motivation and/or
            creativity for me, encouraging and pushing me along in life
          </li>
          <li>
            THE NUMBER ONE SONG OF THE YEAR is based on SONG OF THE DAY results,
            and the Award is presented to the best here
          </li>
          <li>

            award is presented to the best of each category here
          </li>
        </ul>
        The nominees are excluded from the list due to presentation space
        constraints.

      Last but not least, we have the song rankings. Every year, I try my best
      to showcase Klassic Note in the most vibrant way possible, hopefully with
      a good balance of what I truly love and representation of what the year
      means for Klassic Note in 2022. And in these 20+ songs I recommend, many
      have left an impression, some I cannot miss putting them in just because,
      and others I think they are genuinely worth a mention. It was hard to come
      up with the list as usual, as there have been many dramatic changes to
      when I initially thought of this, but now that the results are out, I'm
      not going to think too much into it and hope this is adequate to show what
      Klassic Note 2022 is after a year in the making. Let's get to the Top
      20!<br />
      <br />
      Congratulations to mol-74 for changing my impression of them from meh to
      great to the #1 song in Klassic Note! Maybe emotional is my theme for the
      year, so I can't help but dampen the lively tunes to give a moment to
      remember what the roots of Klassic Note might have been, and these guys
      are right up my alley.<br />
      <br />
      <div class="details">
        In Klassic Note, The Top 20 will include certain conflicts in rank
        number as some of the songs have to share the same rank due to my lack
        of criteria to differentiate between them, but is also a ingenious
        method to show certain trends or similarity within topics and
        timeframes, to a smaller extent. So do not be surprised to see up to 25
        songs every year on this supposedly "Top 20" list.

        Here are my thoughts about this year's Top 20 as elaborated from above,
        as a summary:<br />
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
          <li>
            I have already set my sights for mol-74 taking in the top spot
            mainly because none of the others impressed me in the long run with
            a particularly strong emotion. It was already hard for them to
            impress even in the short run, which will be the influence of the
            rankings this year.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the idolism grouping rank, I opted for Kouno Marika for a simple
            song on her 1st album early this year, and Minase Inori which I
            thought the song which started the year was actually good, which
            made me hesitant to choose between this and "glow", the topic song
            from her album in July. I even thought these songs are actually
            better than mainstream, putting them above Scenarioart and nano.RIPE
            for comparison. Natsukawa Shiina did not join in the ranks because I
            felt like her best effort is not going to win her 3rd single, and
            Asakura Momo went above the ranks just because of a very different
            melody I can concur.
          </li>
          <li>
            It was wise from this year's song list to include mainstream artists
            whom I think mattered for the year in the review boom halfway
            through the year, which were Creepy Nuts, Kami wa Saikoro wo Furanai
            ie. KamiSai, and Kroi. The problem is where to put them. I chose to
            group the latter two together and put down Creepy Nuts for the rap
            genre which I'm not too keen but so is Kroi. It was hard to juggle
            between these and not putting the other one on top on its own, so to
            speak.

            Prospective artists I want to give more chances to are Kitani
            Tatsuya who I've known from Anime just recently, and miwa who
            actually did well overall but hard to pick up songs to give for the
            Top 20. For the latter I opted to promote her album topic song but
            even then I can't put myself to place her too high just because.

            The Top 5 songs have already been pre-determined to some extent.
            Ryokuoushoku Shakai ie. RyokuShaka did well this year so it was
            obvious to choose between the topic songs of their 2 singles and 1
            album for a winner. harmoe is the best idol song which impressed me
            so I had to leave a spot for them, and I still cannot believe I can
            be back giving songs to amazarashi and for them to be up on the
            ranks. I guess depression might be getting back onto me since I
            ditched it in 2018.
          </li>
          <li>
            Genie High is the last-minute option due to me realizing how simple
            the melody is for this song, and of course that it has been accented
            by guest vocalist Kouno Marika (see above) so this is just an extra
            win for the voice actress, in my opinion.
          </li>
          <li>
            For emotional tunes there aren't many or even any to be frank
            compared to last year I just realized, so I'm glad I still
            remembered the ClariS and TrySail collaboration song to put them in
            here. As usual, the composer who also did many for Anime series
            "Madoka Magica" doing wonders every time I get into it.

        And that is all for Klassic Note this year; I hope you enjoyed looking
        through these results, giving them as listen, and enjoyed as much as I
        did. If you were here to give yourself a chance and listen to the above
        snippet of what I've listened to in 2022, you're welcome for the glimpse
        into my music listening experience for the year. If you have given any
        of them a listen afterwards - even just one of them - it will make me
        happy. The legacy of Klassic Note has moved ahead once again and with
        the world outside changing in perspective, I'm still happy to be able to
        share my thoughts about music every year, how much I have done by the
        week, and still spare some time and dedication to make all of this
        happen at the end of the year.
