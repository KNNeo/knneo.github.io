It's not like that plot but the plot twists and stuff might be similar, involving a plot of actually figuring out why someone would have to buy back their own famous artwork but- Oh oops, too much information right there I need to submit my own spec script so I can be the next Makoto Shinkai so if you would excuse me...</div><div><br></div><div>I wrote this intro right after breakfast and the next package is ready for shipping so let's talk about Anime and music and whatnot! Happy birthday to Minase Inori though; I can't see you half-naked so I'll at least listen to your... songs...? Haha ah hey she never showed us more than thighs, mind you WHERE IS THE PHOTOBOOK EVEN RIKACHIMALU WITHOUT AN AGE RELEASED ONE okay me lmao<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BLEACHTYBW08><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Stay in the 4th squad barracks; That was what the Head Captain (Yamamoto) ordered us to do" <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span></div></blockquote>Man, now that old geezer is gone... now what? Hey, in this new episode where we will need new leadership (#BLEACHTYBW08), let's talk about not what happened or else I'm going to cry like Isane lol, but about what should happen next. So first, about everyone who survived. No really, not going to talk about the dead; I don't want to b*tch like Soifon who can't cry like a baby because she can't look forward to the future of the spiritual world unlike Kyoraku- BOOM GOT HER. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, Renji and Rukia are fine I guess but definitely not in a condition to fight no more- You telling me Byakuya and Kenpachi didn't die?? WHAT THE F**K WHY CAN'T MORE PEOPLE DIE- Oh they are main characters <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, as you can see here, most people survived but that doesn't mean they are in a state to fight in any capacity considering the Quincy enemy might only be out for a night or two <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, we probably still need to think of a way to assemble what is left of the Gotei 13. Speaking of assembling, we have Ichigo's broken sword. Byakuya's too but not like he can use it now so ANYWAYS lol Ichigo got called in by Mayuri and THEN told him his sword is also beyond repair because ironically just like an Arrancar's released sword a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> released sword is also not recoverable upon damage so what else is new lol. So looks like we're not in much of a state to fight against even just Hollows at this point lmao, so I guess the higher-ups came in to help. Cue Zero Squad and their five captain members, and if you need a slight recap, let's just say they live above the Seireitei dealing with protecting the Soul King we have so known about all these years that Aizen has never seen it even after so many years. Their purpose in coming down is basically, as the baldie "leader" has mentioned haha, to assist the Gotei 13 in recovery... in accordance of the Soul King's awakening. Hmm... all of that is suspicious and all considering he's- Oops, too much info again haha, but we quickly see the prowess in their hot talk against the... that's 13 minus 2 down minus 1 dead so 10 captains who have gathered plus Ichigo of course- Welcome to math class, everybody. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We will talk about the origins of the five Zero Squad members soon enough since we will be doing a round robin of all the people when we are up there with orange hair haha, but suffice it to say that if you thought Kon being in Soul Society with his head opened up so we can communicate with Urahara is a joke, then these guys are even more of a joke- Like, one of them literally got influenced to do the Hip-Hop stuff in the 70s, right? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then there's Unohana's acquaintance who looks like he's a past gang member in the Yakuza video game series. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> it's just that hair bro- You wanna do like, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiE85n-P1bc" target=_blank>One Night Carnival</a>" with your bros? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> That's a 90s J-Pop joke right there for you peeps haha hey I knew that as a kid not in Japan so that was some level of influence. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We have handy pickpocket who fetched all the injured AND Ichigo's sword from Mayuri's lab like we don't need security in here lol, and some fat b*tch who was hungry wanting to eat Shinji lmao but I PROMISE YOU that will be the best out of the five once we're done... looks like we have quite a team in here to be honest. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... FANTASTIC EPISODE as always please keep it up, we will not talk about how the Shiba family knew of the one and only Kurosaki Isshin as 10th squad captain OR the Fullbringers OR Grimmjow haha no really we can do that reunion stuff later, but can we just appreciate how colourful everything looks after what was essentially grey and fire red? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, that'll keep us going, and with our first stop of recovery at hand and Ichigo enjoying the bath of replacing blood with hot water lmao I feel like I need it too can I join in? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> It's like kidney dialysis, but better. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We will soon realize how useful this trip towards powering up our main characters (lol) will be considering everyone else down there don't even need it and can probably do better than them. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Haha we shall see the difference when they go through the antics of the Zero Squad next week!</div><div>[TL:DR; "You drove the enemy boss away!" Well in Ichigo's defence he really didn't, it was the old man (RIP) who did that tbh not even Kenpachi did anything lol]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_WcRda7bjf_FJD0BHJhGki0ptHn5XehXTitKW0beaekb7w-wmnhKq7AIP_zxeX5CUCp2Xj7Nu_2au8VBaDqb4HS59M82n6SZ1HLFex29Ur-fez1jAkQ2cAtAMLlEvbGKB_VNC7NxDGLRMh1YHC3nCDO6w9XTjZkGUgHzJhnmzSauCsvU2vDIwmfJL/s320/bleachTYBW08_bath2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When I talk about "bloodbath" I don't think anyone would literally mean this lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq6TyGiOWzzCAhXAAzZ-Up4XJ3Crm0bsB5fkvhAjckVZf6pWVKQR9JjCOcU9DIWyn3EQQ_q5cu5RlUSJK7PNNb8PMyAL1fhF71-0BkS4ekBifBxdqCzOcslSn-a7YhHJjqRQ8URfnpasmFj6g4rgsx8O0dFBF6w4QSbyM-3M1zMH-NPI_ucYV5i0O7/s1600/bleachTYBW08_joyous.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When my friends arrive at the chalet when I took the bus before them lmao</table></div></div><div>P.S.

On the drinking party Ami-chan is having (lol) with the whole gang here but NOT Sakurai this time around haha so Sakaki and Uzaki of course, we just ended up hearing stories of Uzaki talking about her senpai which isn't too surprising so now these two are also caught up on the lore like we do just for even the first half of the episode where Uzaki really doesn't appreciate the gentleman in Sakurai to let her borrow his shirts and even underwear (I assume boxers) to wear at his place. Damn. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, she doesn't know what is gentleman, huh. As expected of a middle schooler- Haha ah hey, Yanagi said it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And horror, not letting your girl watch horror movies. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I may, but if my partner is dear Waki Azumi that might not work. I'll try for Kitou Akari. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, Thai horror movies are the best 15 years ago haha, and as an apology for... everything I guess lmao, Uzaki decided to stay the night out of fear of ghosts appearing in her life now, cooking him breakfast and lunch the next day to compensate. So wait Uzaki, that's it. Food. Food is Sakurai's weakness, not horror. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Then, we talk about why Sakurai isn't in the drinking party. He had to go home. Because he didn't in two years. Because more importantly, the dad summoned him, but as in why he wasn't summoned back earlier probably was due to the fact that the mother is babysitting... his <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yep, I can only envy Sakurai this much I want one so bad but not like my 60-year old mom will deliver lmao- Introducing Sakurai Madoka-chan who is 8 months old, and only on the behest of the mother missing the son and asking the dad to get him back home DID HE THEN call the son to call him back, actually thought he's better off away so these two parents can <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha target=_blank>flirt</a> with each other to have kids halfway through their forties. Man, the mom is strong, I'll give you that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Plenty reasonable way to making sure the son stays away from their marriage but damn, you do this after 20 years? Okay dad. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, wished my dad had such plans- MOVING ON haha we should really not think too much into this lest Uzaki asks too much into this honestly lmao, we have not yet concluded on the actual event: Spending Christmas with the senpai/kouhai depending on whose side you're on. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all though, definitely a great change of pace from smelling shirts and horror movies to your parents making out while you're at college lmao, and maybe this is what will end the season this time. Christmas, I mean. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Will Uzaki actually have to take the initiative to do something on the special day? Hey, I know Sakurai won't do it and not because he's not a gentleman but Uzaki you can.

CRINGE haha *ahem*  In this new episode of a period drama by the way (#KoukyuuNoKarasu10), we learning about a lot of cursed stuff, huh. And the Raven Consort, heard that name too often to be good. Say, you think everyone else in the palace knows of the Winter King? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know right, that might be a problem sooner than later, I guess. Rumours, you know. What isn't a rumour though, is our new guest this episode. Haha yeah, like, as in the ghost haunting the mask that moves when the music of a lute is played, by the way. Strange, perhaps, and yes the emperor thought it a great idea to bring this mask into the attention of Jusetsu which I would argue why would you lol this is not how friendship works dude haha, still decided to help release the soul into Paradise because why not, right? Anyways, that lute player who played in some bar downtown (lol) isn't in the capital right now and I don't think she is the culprit, so we had to ask around to know that the guy possessed in the mask was someone from the palace, as a lute player, actually. From his acquaintance in the Hall itself, we then learnt of how bad everyone played compared to this master player but because he wasn't that social he wasn't further invited to events to show his skill... Why do I see a similarity between this and modern indie artists today? *ahem* But yeah maybe it's his obsession, or maybe his anger of not feeling recognized, but yeah, maybe that's why he hasn't departed even thought he hanged himself in spite of his lute being confiscated, I guess. *ahem* So yeah, we are going to play it so bad the guy is just going to come out of the mask haha hey I would if I were a legend of the five-string lute. And so he did, but it wasn't so bad the spirit had to rip that lute apart from his... superior? Yeah, who can't play for sh*t? Haha okay jokes over, but probably was happier to hear it again despite not being able to play it. Probably also why he did day and night and if not stopped will just turn into a demon just like Jusetsu mentioned. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Damn. All in all.. holy crap dude what has this Anime not done to my heart and soul? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I'm just not that guy who is envious of the lute player, dude, just saying. But as we see the corpse of freshly dead... I'd like to believe that's Huaniang herself so RIP but probably not I guess lol (also bye whoever voiced her Ueda Reina), this might be a problem even for the emperor himself. *ahem* Politics incoming I suppose will be ending the series? *ahem* Also suicide be a frequent thing back then lol let's see if this will cause any trifle with the old man we saw- They are all old men what am I saying haha they don't know anything about the Raven Consort she cute-</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiU-kg_5J8DZrCpaC47MLdvakZLilq02NcthYHhRbGyJlh-OceQH-hskRWk3Jd7Pb0qDy5DfccPz0oVnTQ1lrHgJ6Hlc4PeTuh81M43MTWrQcfwcm1PS77cUONHAbf1jL9uc2i8gMxEZ2xyhW0Lfmkv73hdQLrSKNnl9agf9rj58BuD_Auzo6hFi05g/s320/koukyuunokarasu10_mask.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Oh wow we continuing the drawing from last week?

I don't even have the <b><a href="https://twitter.com/MKLNtic/status/1575828246981058560?s=20&amp;t=tAEcR23lMxdgazHuT9Iaow" target=_blank>Anime "Uzaki-chan" theme song single</a></b> (I did not dream of this FYI) to talk about but I guess I did end up giving <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/happy-life/1654623394?i=1654623502&amp;l=en" target=_blank>the ending theme</a> first I guess. I mean, I've already given the opening theme from the music video already so what gives with the cancellation?? <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Maybe I should do myself a favour and make believe the single's existence and give the songs first; This is seriously disrupting my review schedule. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> On other things though, I did not give good credit to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/stay-beautiful-stay-beautiful/1654431236?l=en" target=_blank>Waki Azumi's new concept album</a></b> which yes arguably it's better than Tomita Miyu's concept album a couple of weeks ago but goddamn I have seriously no mood to give any of these releases at this point so I guess I'm not touching them anymore from here on. Also, didn't realize <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/lovers-ep/1656529747?l=en" target=_blank>Cocoro Auction's new EP</a></b> released today and that's why I should just follow them on Twitter they released two EPs this year alone lol so I did check out <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E7%81%AB%E8%8A%B1-ep/1631325216?l=en" target=_blank>the other EP</a> but I think this newer one is better. Just one song better. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Last but not least, because remember last week I said I'll listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/etto-no-march/1653055066?l=en" target=_blank>mol-74's debut album</a></b> if this week gets boring? I suppose emo alternative songs are still for me and their style really sinks into me so I think them from 2015 wins. Haha ah hey, it's unfair I just am not keen on idolism right now and thank goodness this might be end of it for the year. Just.<br><br>This week's music news on Twitter isn't that much but we will still talk about the important ones, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1597183528378126338?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>SHE'S new live video</a></b> is about their new song which I liked so that's good for them, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1597547903941169152?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>Ryokushoku Shakai's new live video</a></b> is here to remind me to put them on the ranks for this year's Song Awards lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1597606312526987265?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>SID released more of their live audio footage on music streaming services</a></b> so if you are a fan of them because honestly I'm not even close on that you should listen to them, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1597916101257535490?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's fanclub event digest</a></b> did reveal the new song she had on her fanclub anniversary which was also in her recent album but I did not give the song so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span>, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1597949701407789058?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>ClariS new cover album digest</a></b> is good enough for the occasion at this time of the year so let's hope something will hit me by then next week, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1598104598836756480?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's new music video</a></b> is for her upcoming album next year and man did I not expect an emotional track so that's already a good start, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1599214147304316928?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>miwa is releasing a Valentine's Day-themed concept EP next year</a></b> so maybe she might be my Valentine by then to be honest which sounds great considering her performance this year to be really good for mainstream artist, and last but not least this is hot off the press, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/neatsyui/status/1599373061819871233?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>Niitsu Yui's 2nd album</a></b> has been announced and man I might as well say as of now it's an event only release due end of the year so... maybe we wait for digital at some point. Fingers crossed for the good stuff here due next year, people. Oh and also <b><a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1599065476059258883?s=20&amp;t=1w5AQcsU3s4Acn0iKX2bTQ" target=_blank>Higuchi Ai is on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> I realized, singing the one song we all knew her from in "Attack on Titan". Man, that Anime series needs to end lol<br><br> So next week though, I will talk about <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/world-record/1654430457?l=en" target=_blank>TWEEDEES' new album</a></b> which dropped by just like, yesterday and I'm really done with this week so I will give that a listen probably from tomorrow onwards. Yeah they hate Wednesdays lol. For this one I also don't expect much so I'll just take the rest of the time thinking about the Song Awards I guess. Also KN15YEARS since I still care about that to be honest. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And maybe <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/winter-tracks-%E5%86%AC%E3%81%AE%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F-ep/1654115038?l=en" target=_blank>ClariS new cover album</a></b> if I really care. Big "IF" right there.<br><br><br><br><br> Oh shout out and happy birthday to Itou Mayuki and Azusa Hikari on their birthdays which was right at the end of November apparently I found out only after knowing these girls for about 2 years now and maybe you should not find out about them after maybe recalling the former from our calendar review of her... naked- I can't show them without skin, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> On the other hand Inorin why can't I see- See you guys next week I guess haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, and until then we don't have much until the end of the year so... maybe live through this year? Haha I will at least to see the calendar I bought for next year- You know how bizarre it is that <strike>my bro bought Sumipe photobook but not along with the calendar</strike> my parents don't buy their calendars?? UGH lmao<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I'm really trying to shorten the Anime write-ups here so I don't think this is a chore every week but maybe I should stop this entirely to be honest then maybe we can watch more Anime or something who knows this is basically my life now lol I need to find a woman lmao</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
