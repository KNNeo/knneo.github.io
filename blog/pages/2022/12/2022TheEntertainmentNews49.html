And that's why we need 4-day work weeks because this is pretty much it on
Sundays after I thoroughly enjoyed Saturday but considering I have a China boss
that might be impossible- Maybe I should not put this as the intro haha I'm such
an idiot like my boss-
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways haha, last night I dreamt of some movie plot after watching someone
  (lol) play The Callisto Protocol. It's not like that plot but the plot twists
  and stuff might be similar, involving a plot of actually figuring out why
  someone would have to buy back their own famous artwork but- Oh oops, too much
  information right there I need to submit my own spec script so I can be the
  next Makoto Shinkai so if you would excuse me...
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I wrote this intro right after breakfast and the next package is ready for
  shipping so let's talk about Anime and music and whatnot! Happy birthday to
  Minase Inori though; I can't see you half-naked so I'll at least listen to
  your... songs...? Haha ah hey she never showed us more than thighs, mind you
  WHERE IS THE PHOTOBOOK EVEN RIKACHIMALU WITHOUT AN AGE RELEASED ONE okay me
  lmao<br />

  Man, now that old geezer is gone... now what? Hey, in this new episode where
  we will need new leadership (#BLEACHTYBW08), let's talk about not what
  happened or else I'm going to cry like Isane lol, but about what should happen
  next. So first, about everyone who survived. No really, not going to talk
  about the dead; I don't want to b*tch like Soifon who can't cry like a baby
  because she can't look forward to the future of the spiritual world unlike
  Kyoraku- BOOM GOT HER. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, Renji and Rukia are fine I guess
  but definitely not in a condition to fight no more- You telling me Byakuya and
  Kenpachi didn't die?? WHAT THE F**K WHY CAN'T MORE PEOPLE DIE- Oh they are
  main characters <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, as you can see here, most people survived
  but that doesn't mean they are in a state to fight in any capacity considering
  the Quincy enemy might only be out for a night or two <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, we probably
  still need to think of a way to assemble what is left of the Gotei 13.
  Speaking of assembling, we have Ichigo's broken sword. Byakuya's too but not
  like he can use it now so ANYWAYS lol Ichigo got called in by Mayuri and THEN
  told him his sword is also beyond repair because ironically just like an
  Arrancar's released sword a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>
  released sword is also not recoverable upon damage so what else is new lol. So
  looks like we're not in much of a state to fight against even just Hollows at
  this point lmao, so I guess the higher-ups came in to help. Cue Zero Squad and
  their five captain members, and if you need a slight recap, let's just say
  they live above the Seireitei dealing with protecting the Soul King we have so
  known about all these years that Aizen has never seen it even after so many
  years. Their purpose in coming down is basically, as the baldie "leader" has
  mentioned haha, to assist the Gotei 13 in recovery... in accordance of the
  Soul King's awakening. Hmm... all of that is suspicious and all considering
  he's- Oops, too much info again haha, but we quickly see the prowess in their
  hot talk against the... that's 13 minus 2 down minus 1 dead so 10 captains who
  have gathered plus Ichigo of course- Welcome to math class, everybody.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We will talk about the origins of the five Zero Squad members soon
  enough since we will be doing a round robin of all the people when we are up
  there with orange hair haha, but suffice it to say that if you thought Kon
  being in Soul Society with his head opened up so we can communicate with
  Urahara is a joke, then these guys are even more of a joke- Like, one of them
  literally got influenced to do the Hip-Hop stuff in the 70s, right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  And then there's Unohana's acquaintance who looks like he's a past gang member
  in the Yakuza video game series. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> it's just that hair bro- You wanna
  do like, "<a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiE85n-P1bc"
    target="_blank"
    >One Night Carnival</a
  >" with your bros? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That's a 90s J-Pop joke right there for you peeps
  haha hey I knew that as a kid not in Japan so that was some level of
  influence. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> We have handy pickpocket who fetched all the injured AND
  Ichigo's sword from Mayuri's lab like we don't need security in here lol, and
  some fat b*tch who was hungry wanting to eat Shinji lmao but I PROMISE YOU
  that will be the best out of the five once we're done... looks like we have
  quite a team in here to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... FANTASTIC EPISODE as
  always please keep it up, we will not talk about how the Shiba family knew of
  the one and only Kurosaki Isshin as 10th squad captain OR the Fullbringers OR
  Grimmjow haha no really we can do that reunion stuff later, but can we just
  appreciate how colourful everything looks after what was essentially grey and
  fire red? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, that'll keep us going, and with our first stop of
  recovery at hand and Ichigo enjoying the bath of replacing blood with hot
  water lmao I feel like I need it too can I join in? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> It's like kidney
  dialysis, but better. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We will soon realize how useful this trip
  towards powering up our main characters (lol) will be considering everyone
  else down there don't even need it and can probably do better than them.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Haha we shall see the difference when they go through the antics of
  the Zero Squad next week!
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "You drove the enemy boss away!" Well in Ichigo's defence he really
  didn't, it was the old man (RIP) who did that tbh not even Kenpachi did
  anything lol]

  P.S. It is kinda cringe to see that the one and only Yamada Hanataro is
  ACTUALLY working his own job at 4th squad taking care of patients and Ichigo.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I missed the days when WE were the ones invading Soul Society lmao

  P.P.S. "So this is the place Aizen desperately wanted to come to..." Yeah and
  Ichigo just waltz into here LIKE A BOSS!! Haha oh well Aizen that's why it
  sucks to not be main character haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> "We either choose to let you come
  in with us (into the palace)..." Yeah so for you tech nerds out there it's
  like a hardwired IP filter lol
</div>
<div>
  [And with more good news and that's probably why that listing had a season
  number slapped on it, ALL, and I mean all, of BLEACH episodes are now on
  Amazon Prime Video! All the filler episodes too (ack), and the movies! Yeah,
  just watching Ikkaku's bankai is already making me wonder whether I should
  even touch any of the episodes afterwards lmao it took a dip from there
  alright]

  Oh wow it's kinda early but Merry Christmas, everyone. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You guys
  having some celebrations and a trip to Universal on your employer's account?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways haha, in this new episode where it's Christmas again
  but now we have Fujio-san lmao (#UzakiChanS210), well maybe not that far yet
  but we are setting that up to say the least. On the drinking party Ami-chan is
  having (lol) with the whole gang here but NOT Sakurai this time around haha so
  Sakaki and Uzaki of course, we just ended up hearing stories of Uzaki talking
  about her senpai which isn't too surprising so now these two are also caught
  up on the lore like we do just for even the first half of the episode where
  Uzaki really doesn't appreciate the gentleman in Sakurai to let her borrow his
  shirts and even underwear (I assume boxers) to wear at his place. Damn.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, she doesn't know what is gentleman, huh. As expected of a
  middle schooler- Haha ah hey, Yanagi said it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And horror, not letting
  your girl watch horror movies. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I may, but if my partner is dear Waki
  Azumi that might not work. I'll try for Kitou Akari. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, Thai
  horror movies are the best 15 years ago haha, and as an apology for...
  everything I guess lmao, Uzaki decided to stay the night out of fear of ghosts
  appearing in her life now, cooking him breakfast and lunch the next day to
  compensate. So wait Uzaki, that's it. Food. Food is Sakurai's weakness, not
  horror. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Then, we talk about why Sakurai isn't in the drinking party.
  He had to go home. Because he didn't in two years. Because more importantly,
  the dad summoned him, but as in why he wasn't summoned back earlier probably
  was due to the fact that the mother is babysitting... his
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Yep, I can only envy Sakurai this much I want one so bad but not like my
  60-year old mom will deliver lmao- Introducing Sakurai Madoka-chan who is 8
  months old, and only on the behest of the mother missing the son and asking
  the dad to get him back home DID HE THEN call the son to call him back,
  actually thought he's better off away so these two parents can
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha" target="_blank">flirt</a> with
  each other to have kids halfway through their forties. Man, the mom is strong,
  I'll give you that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Plenty reasonable way to making sure the son
  stays away from their marriage but damn, you do this after 20 years? Okay dad.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, wished my dad had such plans- MOVING ON haha we should really
  not think too much into this lest Uzaki asks too much into this honestly lmao,
  we have not yet concluded on the actual event: Spending Christmas with the
  senpai/kouhai depending on whose side you're on. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all though,
  definitely a great change of pace from smelling shirts and horror movies to
  your parents making out while you're at college lmao, and maybe this is what
  will end the season this time. Christmas, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Will Uzaki actually
  have to take the initiative to do something on the special day? Hey, I know
  Sakurai won't do it and not because he's not a gentleman but Uzaki you can.
  Hehe we shall see when the time comes I guess

  I know right, recommending your granddaughter to the emperor. CRINGE haha
  *ahem*&nbsp; In this new episode of a period drama by the way
  (#KoukkyuNoKarasu10), we learning about a lot of cursed stuff, huh. And the
  Raven Consort, heard that name too often to be good. Say, you think everyone
  else in the palace knows of the Winter King? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I know right, that
  might be a problem sooner than later, I guess. Rumours, you know. What isn't a
  rumour though, is our new guest this episode. Haha yeah, like, as in the ghost
  haunting the mask that moves when the music of a lute is played, by the way.
  Strange, perhaps, and yes the emperor thought it a great idea to bring this
  mask into the attention of Jusetsu which I would argue why would you lol this
  is not how friendship works dude haha, still decided to help release the soul
  into Paradise because why not, right? Anyways, that lute player who played in
  some bar downtown (lol) isn't in the capital right now and I don't think she
  is the culprit, so we had to ask around to know that the guy possessed in the
  mask was someone from the palace, as a lute player, actually. From his
  acquaintance in the Hall itself, we then learnt of how bad everyone played
  compared to this master player but because he wasn't that social he wasn't
  further invited to events to show his skill... Why do I see a similarity
  between this and modern indie artists today? *ahem* But yeah maybe it's his
  obsession, or maybe his anger of not feeling recognized, but yeah, maybe
  that's why he hasn't departed even thought he hanged himself in spite of his
  lute being confiscated, I guess. *ahem* So yeah, we are going to play it so
  bad the guy is just going to come out of the mask haha hey I would if I were a
  legend of the five-string lute. And so he did, but it wasn't so bad the spirit
  had to rip that lute apart from his... superior? Yeah, who can't play for
  sh*t? Haha okay jokes over, but probably was happier to hear it again despite
  not being able to play it. Probably also why he did day and night and if not
  stopped will just turn into a demon just like Jusetsu mentioned. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Damn. All in all.. holy crap dude what has this Anime not done to my heart and
  soul? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I'm just not that guy who is envious of the lute
  player, dude, just saying. But as we see the corpse of freshly dead... I'd
  like to believe that's Huaniang herself so RIP but probably not I guess lol
  (also bye whoever voiced her Ueda Reina), this might be a problem even for the
  emperor himself. *ahem* Politics incoming I suppose will be ending the series?
  *ahem* Also suicide be a frequent thing back then lol let's see if this will
  cause any trifle with the old man we saw- They are all old men what am I
  saying haha they don't know anything about the Raven Consort she cute-

  if this week gets boring? I suppose emo alternative songs are still for me and

  so maybe she might be my Valentine by then to be honest which sounds great
  considering her performance this year to be really good for mainstream artist,
  and last but not least this is hot off the press,

  has been announced and man I might as well say as of now it's an event only
  release due end of the year so... maybe we wait for digital at some point.
  Fingers crossed for the good stuff here due next year, people. Oh and also

  which dropped by just like, yesterday and I'm really done with this week so I
  will give that a listen probably from tomorrow onwards. Yeah they hate
  Wednesdays lol. For this one I also don't expect much so I'll just take the
  rest of the time thinking about the Song Awards I guess. Also KN15YEARS since
  I still care about that to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And maybe

  Oh shout out and happy birthday to Itou Mayuki and Azusa Hikari on their
  birthdays which was right at the end of November apparently I found out only
  after knowing these girls for about 2 years now and maybe you should not find
  out about them after maybe recalling the former from our calendar review of
  her... naked- I can't show them without skin, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> On the other hand
  Inorin why can't I see- See you guys next week I guess haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, and until
  then we don't have much until the end of the year so... maybe live through
  this year? Haha I will at least to see the calendar I bought for next year-
  You know how bizarre it is that
  <strike
    >my bro bought Sumipe photobook but not along with the calendar</strike
  >
  my parents don't buy their calendars?? UGH lmao<br />

<div><br /></div>

  P.S. I'm really trying to shorten the Anime write-ups here so I don't think
  this is a chore every week but maybe I should stop this entirely to be honest
  then maybe we can watch more Anime or something who knows this is basically my
  life now lol I need to find a woman lmao
