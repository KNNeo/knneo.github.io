<div>
  Hey, in the season of giving though, I've been given a fruit blender during a
  gift exchange recently so I <em>guess</em> that's something. Also SSRs in DOAXVV
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gacha" target="_blank">gacha</a> but who
  cares about those <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, welcome back, we are at the end of the line
  real soon, and boy am I still not close to prepared for Klassic Note this
  year. And that's why I have the last week to myself because who cares about
  work my boss is already on leave longer than me lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So let's! We may have more photobooks to review on our way which will be
  exciting if I can survive the new year so let's take some stomach pain pills
  and push on! Haha I may need to see the doctor if this continues I ate a lot
  of shit yesterday<br />

  Oh boy, we are in the lore, boys. So, I'm sure this is as fast-paced as last
  week so let's continue on the new episode (#BLEACHTYBW10) where everyone
  continues their journey to awaken themselves from the defeat of the war in
  front of them. Firstly, we end the fight of the Kenpachis. Heck, guess who
  won. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, the Zaraki of Kenpachi isn't joking when Yhwach specified
  that he was a war threat to the Quincy army, okay? Even back then when he was
  killing as a kid in the Zaraki district (if I didn't remember wrongly, 89th in
  distance from the centre of Rukongai villages off Seireitei, I'll check the
  Wiki in a bit) (Edit: Oh 80th haha) he didn't find anyone satisfactory to
  fight with. And then he saw the first Kenpachi of Gotei 13. And defeated her
  one to one. Yeah, talk about being misogynist but hey we are not on that topic
  here lol, and it literally took the 11th squad back then to put an end to his
  madness, still can live to tell the tale and help Soul Society fend off
  enemies today as if the enemies aren't strong enough for him. Well, until now.
  That is probably the case why, and that's also Unohana's objective right now:
  to bring him back to the level he used to fight without restraint, because he
  was so used to bring in restraint. Heck, even when his eyepatch is off he is
  still fighting with restraint. And took down all the enemies we have seen
  before this arc. Yeah. He's that powerful. But not now. So, for having to wake
  him up, Unohana had to play with her blood-playing Bankai which is as
  disgusting as it is sick, to force him to fight someone who can't die...
  unless you overpower her which isn't exactly hard for Zaraki, but only in
  doing so will then make sure he will be an asset in the war from here on.
  Also, that his spiritual energy level will be high enough for the sword to
  awaken. Yep, you heard that right: Kenpachi has been holding on to a... I feel
  like we should talk about the Namaiya court first, but this is a released
  sword in hiding, so go figure. Not going to hint much just yet since the story
  also haven't, but <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> you can guess how this Kenpachi will get stronger
  from here on. I'm just glad it isn't bloody red haha. Up next, we awaken
  our... masculine senses?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, at least Kon and that sword creator
  is, as he greets Renji and Ichigo with a stage performance like he lived in
  the late 80s to 90s lol what do you even know, and it's as if the guys walked
  into a cabaret greeted with so many chests my bro wished he was the owner of
  the establishment haha, then IMMEDIATELY got offset by the assistant of the
  Captain who showed them on what the actual place is. And we shall not talk
  about the shabbiness and why their infrastructure budget is best left at that
  place earlier haha, we immediately send the two into a pit of swords named
  Asauchi. Well they are not named per se, but they have the potential to have
  one. And finally I can talk about this, so the origin of zanpakuto is as such:
  You train as a shinigami with one of these empty swords, and mould them with
  your soul and time and eventually learn of their name and power. So yeah,
  Ichigo's training but maybe give it a decade and put him in high school.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically Renji also hasn't been treating his sword well too we know
  Ichigo's story already Zangetsu is holding on to a multitude of powers I can't
  even lmao, so Namaiya gives them the punishment: Find a damn sword down in the
  pit who can listen to you. Not impossible, but it'll take some time to realize
  how much this relationship between soul and sword should have been in the
  first place. How is this working though? We will get the super cool guy
  explain next time I guess. Speaking of next time though, we will have an hour
  special which will conclude the season so far (yep this is ending already
  haha) and if the Twitter account was right looking at the thumbnails, about
  Ichigo's mother. Yep. We will talk about that Quincy soon enough. See you
  then.

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Come on, Uzaki Hana has to do something now right? Right...!??? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
  this new episode where my Christmas celebrations are better off than theirs
  now which is none lol (#UzakiChanS212), someone is already crying for help
  right here lol as she tells the people in the cafe about what she has
  experienced previous episode which is nothing from her beloved senpai.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, too real, and might as well, we can FINALLY get Sakurai into
  a drinking party so that he can get laid as early as tomorrow- But maybe too
  soon because apparently Yanagi the sister has other plans upon hearing of this
  wonderful news too. Which isn't too surprising, I can already link it up
  myself, but the idea of Yanagi hanging out with Sakurai is actually great
  since it'll actually be a fight between gamers and we can officially change
  the contents of this series without changing the title maybe featuring less
  smugness and more cuteness haha Yanagi is kinda adorable, AAAAAND it's already
  ruined because Hana-chan here dared to suggest instead of going to the
  senpai's place in which he has already decided to forgive her for her
  bruteness just because, to go to her place which houses - and yes we can't
  emphasize this much even after Yanagi said it - the father. Yes, the one we
  thought Fuji was the family name, that one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah as one can
  imagine the face the father made when he knew that the guy who has been
  hanging out with his eldest daughter was this dude he has been spilling the
  beans about her life in front of in the gym, is probably more scared of him
  now because the dad has been just showing a weird face of not confusion all
  the time until he also realized there might be more than just the guy in front
  of him to be worried of. Also, who cares about prospective son-in-law
  interviews now he can't even call the dad by his family name, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyways, the family Christmas celebrations with Sakurai was a blast if not for
  literal blasts of shots of alcohol to the guest's brain and boy why did they
  think that was a great idea to keep his mouth shut when we also do recall that
  he's kinda spilling everything afterwards. Because yeah, he said he will
  forget but that doesn't mean everyone in the house does lmao Fujio you dumb
  shit, but yeah, he loves her. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, still probably not true since
  when Sakurai wakes up he probably will forget about stuff but let's just not
  say everyone else who is present lmao, but hey, at least they are still
  together... right? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, I'm living with the pace of the series as
  bad as Fujio's temper so you tell me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm really trying not to shit
  on the pace of the storytelling here as if they lack of content but yeah, we
  have already been this far. We are at the end real soon, so let's see how the
  main couple will wrap this season up next week. If you are expecting any type
  of confession though? This series has already disappointed you from the start
  so what else is new haha so heck, just some company is enough, innit? I mean,
  look at Kiri- I'm so sorry dude but same here by the way
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; This season's MVP is Yanagi, by the way. I'm not even joking here- She
  is the seducer, dude. Can't beat that on a middle schooler haha on the other
  hand Hana-chan is <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

  </blockquote>
  Oh come on, we can do without the opening theme already. Where's the direct
  confrontationcon, dude!! <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Disappoint. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, in this new
  episode of a story I wish was like lightning and fire from the start
  (#KoukyuuNoKarasu12), I gotta say though, this might be too much lore to take
  in about the one and only Raven Consort so I guess we are at the true reveal
  of everything now, I hope. So, let's conclude whatever that zombification
  thing was from the previous episode because really, that's not the revived
  brother, I forgot your consort name lol. Yeah, looks like things have gotten
  quite out of hand over here already, hearing her stories being together
  forever with her love and you know, just the dude dying in a horse accident
  *ahem*, now is just a blood thirsty core that just moves around and talks
  gibberish kind of like, you guessed it, a zombie. Man, this b*tch needs
  therapy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Is this what it's like to be in the inner palace? *ahem*
  Haha ANYWAYS so my assumption last week was right: Xiao Yue that Owl guy just
  effectively created a zombie. I would assume that is one of the dude's powers
  but we shall highlight that in a moment, but just one word with the consort
  and it's not even on behalf of the emperor himself... Like, how the absolute
  F**K is this still your brother? CLEARLY this woman hasn't watched
  "Kuroshitsuji". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay Anime reference over, and yes I anticipated a
  drop somewhere apparently not from the sorcerer mastermind but just yeah, the
  brother just wanting more blood, more human blood because animal blood won't
  work and we can't kill one of the eunuchs for this thank goodness, is to just
  bite on your sister who probably thinks you're alive. Welp. *ahem* Anyways
  moving on haha, she is the least of our problems even though the emperor has
  to deal with political relations from here on, we have to track down the
  culprit, dude. So turns out, this dude here which we will refer to as the Owl,
  is the other half of the god spirit of the Raven as is with Jusetsu now, and
  is here to... uh... execute his sister? Yeah, sibling relations is complicated
  even in the world of the gods haha, but to put this simply because I'm also
  confused to be honest, the god's soul was born and split in half with the Owl
  who is an executioner of I assume souls, and the Raven who guides them. I take
  it as this is how the underworld works in this universe, but there are more
  things we don't know about just like how Jusetsu doesn't also. For starters,
  she is not God's messenger. Well, half of God. Okay also not that so uh...
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Turns out, she IS the embodiment of half of God. Unlike the Owl in
  this clay body form where a body is made to contain a soul to control which
  isn't that flexible, I assume the lore holds true where if you are more human
  you can move better but with another soul's will, feeding on like, poison
  which was the flower and incense they smoke (lmao) so to sustain the pain and
  anger bursting out of the Raven itself in order to pass on the succession of
  controlling this God in the most cruel, ultimate form. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Remember when
  we mentioned that the Raven stays in the palace? Don't think so now. But to
  save Jusetstu from the God itself might be more of a stretch, and that's where
  the Summer King comes in. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just joking, he can't do much besides play
  a swordfight with the clay body which can't die even with the other servants
  trapping him in unless... yeah the two, uh, messengers? Yeah, those, fight
  with their familiars, I would translate to. So yeah MVP Xing-Xing strikes
  again, and with Jusetsu taking a hint in battle because damn she smart and
  cute too? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Took the guy down with the golden feathers, and that's how
  we can fend off the other away for now. So all in all, let's conclude of what
  we know now. The Owl fears the Raven not because it was ruling the land
  wrongly, but of the first successor who did the impossible by shoving the
  Raven in her (lol family show btw) to control her indefinitely, and only took
  action when it felt the Raven raging back when we had to save Jiu-Jiu. I mean,
  we HAD to. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay okay, among all these lore though, we go back to the
  emperor's goal.... Can Jusetsu be saved? No, right, at this point? We always
  thought this was her job, she was tied to the Gods but turns out, God is
  inside her? Hmm... I wonder if reversing whatever ritual would help. Then what
  other job can she do? Be an actual consort to the emperor? <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> We shall
  see in the conclusion next week.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I'm just glad this lore about Raven Consort isn't on the previous
  dynasty talk but of the folklore God-like talk because damn the former will be
  worse than most period dramas and I don't like that tbh]

  is not the least exciting and/or disappointing in both ways and I mean that
  not just as respect to the artist, but the melodies didn't hit me as much as
  they are great in production, only got me on the one song I've actually
  listened to the music video some time ago so I shall go with that.

  didn't get me much too but I guess we have already given the one, but I also
  tried to give another song just because the lyrics had the mood and the melody
  is short. And that's good, we don't get much short songs anymore it's all from
  No Buses and Cwondo lmao<br />
  <br />
  Wow the news this time of the year on Twitter can only mean future things and
  I don't mean this year so that's a problem, so we are skipping

  (titles not accurate). Let's see if these names will appear again in Klassic
  Note Song Awards hehe<br />
  <br />
  So next week, this will be quite a stretch but I will try because we have to
  end by Christmas, it's <b>yanaginagi's new album</b> from the time she started
  letting fans vote for the mood of the subsequent songs to listen or produce I
  think. Yeah, the compilation is complete lol, and I haven't been listening to
  much yet along give any which says things, so let's see if I will have the
  mood to do so. And maybe I'll hit on
  <b>Ueda Reina's music video release</b> but for the purpose of listening to
  her topic songs. Or maybe we don't because might as well research her next
  year instead tbh<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  And damn we are two weeks till the end of the year. Or one more week till
  liberation where I don't have to think about work and ACTUALLY work my brain
  out thinking of what songs to promote for the year. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> It's just going
  to be past year songs lmao that was not a factor when it comes to giving songs
  but also show how bad the new songs are for the year to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Let's just hope that's not the case. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time then, and
  until the holiday days actually hit us... I don't know, go play a Kairosoft
  game to kill time or something. They are GREAT phone management games that
  will get you hooked for hours if you're into this sort of thing. Or just play
  Genshin I don't care haha get out<br />
