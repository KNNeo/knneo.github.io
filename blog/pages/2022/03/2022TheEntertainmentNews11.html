Hey, it was so good, I think I saw her crotch- Anyways the archive isstill up until this is live so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><div><br /></div><div>  So happy birthday Touyama Nao! I don't even know how I got into you but I  realized even if you turn 30 I only want you more. Like, I always remember how  she had to join Sumipe's Instagram live out of the shower... that was such a good idea just being her long-distance boyfriend on the other end HAHAHA okay daydream over I should unsubscribe to her fanclub which doesn't give me as many wallpapers as Akarin does lol</div><div><br /></div><div>  I don't want to miss Moeshi's birthday livestream at noon so I'll buckle up  and watch some Anime earlier lest she drags her stream for the whole afternoon  who knows she is the best if you want to have s*x haha what lmao let's Anime  and music<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan84">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;">        Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "Night and day, I'll sip on the finest alcohol" Dude, is that what people      think retirement is like? lol    </div>  </blockquote>  Oh yeah, almost forgot what "genocide" meant, thanks for the reminder  Hange-san. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways, more Eren killing people talk in this new  episode (#AttackOnTitan84), let's actually explain what happened last week.  Remember the escape of Yelena and Jean and the gang? Yeah, along with  Hange-san and Magath and Pieck (umph) (okay me) they sat down for a night  to... let's just say, sit on the regret they did for the past few years in  redemption of everything required for them to work together so they can stop  Eren one way or another. From Annie doubting Mikasa and Armin's talks with  Eren would go well (highly unlikely, but you know, gotta see one of them die  immediately to Founding Titan to believe Eren is no longer sane), Yelena  talking about Marco getting killed by Titans thanks to Reiner's orders back  then, to talking about how 2000 years of them not being there is nothing  compared to what is happening right now... well we can do a reset remember how  dinosaurs were (supposedly) wiped out by Earth's natural events? Yeah, we can  do that again, start off the biological cycle that is one in a universe time  impossible to achieve. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, Yelena won't budge in telling where  Eren would be even if she knew so whatever, they still had to try to get out  of the island I suppose. I don't know if Gabi and Falco apologizing and  telling them to work together to stop this war will help anyone or not, but  yeah, if forgiveness is something you want out of this series then look  somewhere else lol. But whatever that is, Hange-san is right though: enemies  sitting down on the fire eating stew in the middle of a forest is unlike any  other diplomatic meeting we have seen in this world so far, and Levi's awake  so all these so far is good news. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, I must say too much  talk already we are literally in Third Season territory right now lol, but  it's a place to spend some time to talk this through I guess. Problem is, the  Jeagerists ie. Floch and the others have already took a step forward, so the  stew gang here (lmao) aren't able to cross the docks now. And with the... my  bro called them Japanese so yes we have seen them before, being threatened up  to their necks while holding the fort, I don't see how this is going to be  easy in progressing the steps to stop this upcoming genocide. Seeing next  episode though, not going to be surprised seeing the people in Paradis Island  supporting Eren, that these guys will encounter more people who will go  against them, even if it's people they know of. So yeah, cya guys next week as  we deal with more people things I guess. It's war, remember, I didn't even  sign up for Eren's mom being eaten by a Titan so I don't know why I'm here  this far in lmao</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhiFHQrCcEGIqJOZPJcXYli0T5O6MAGfZ8VmZSKZVi4u6XBtPd-wyWPhdNNPStsx77rNHaU6SDUPPVIwzp1cj7gELybxZ704mZSl7KGJ1y6Sa8POxTqziFawf3PpyQGQN-9_J_OFOLBSV-5VKtN87g1kEyl5cLVTlQlltjjg-ezZ78tlczybFVb9lQk=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              TFW Hange-san has to talk about the past <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhW1dCIXhW-Eq5ihaHBiFcqj3oQVCsDGovVvqUHNWt_4_H6-FE9rBd2pT0nObfEOKZJy9pu1t4dJ1_TVxwpWRbeL6HEeLfsdUTv4tgWGyWs0XBticDeMEmnQTMpoTKdux2GLEEf-HGLZaGzyaxM-W05j4mFOiHmzTRFcL50OvEi6Wkd4nsv3w6tBmvg=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Quick Levi check over here looks like he's okay lol            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgOKX2FlBRAs09zfoIsaUI6VStbFAL-PPAwzgP_QV9lwYISDKlTYLjIOgirVBO8n8fuzcIbFTZJk5Cni8Lx82JkLJ_svHx_uTZL0dahCuuJCPUiRgPoyWXGY-oGYsRfUwbXVHXvcljO6ZobgbXwBjHjQGec4skPtqoPl7-fmWonm2IK_TCjrpv3PxWd=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Oh he's awake haha            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. "I won't let Eren kill anymore than he has already" Wow Mikasa brave talk  I think he just overpassed the threshold for human genocide even at this point  lol</div><div>  P.P.S. "If you let Eren succeed, you will get your ideal world, a paradise for  devils" I mean Magath you're not wrong, but that probably is worse considering  it'll just be never-ending civil war since everyone can get those Titan  powers. Maybe euthanization was a choice after all huh, Zeke.<br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS310">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "We don't really fit in as (family or couple) , so it's kind of weird,      huh" Oh damn Takagi-san, such a tease. Come one we know you two are a      couple    </div>  </blockquote>  I know it has been three months in already, but Happy New Year, everyone.  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp; Okay this is not a joke for in this new episode  (#TakagiSanS310) we already know, I mean, you guys already know Nishikata is  NEVER, and I mean FOREVER, never be able to guess what Takagi wished for this  new year. No really, we know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So firstly,  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hatsuhinode" target="_blank">the first shrine visit</a>. Japanese have been doing that for years, and for seasons of Anime if you  have only been watching those lmao, but yeah, just coincidentally, the main  couple meet. They prayed to the gods but not like God has listened to  Nishikata (lol) and Takagi (we will see how she circumvents that later), they  pulled their fortunes to only learn that Takagi is so lucky because she was  with the second luckiest person on Earth lmao (<span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> why), and Nishikata wants  to showdown next year too. Hey, at least, there's a next year. *winks* Next  up, snowman making. Thanks to the snow falling in a night I don't remember  what's the name for that I guess "White New Year's" lol that's what they say  when it falls on Christmas, Takagi challenged Nishikata to a showdown to make  the best snowman, but not the biggest snowman. So the strategy is easy for her  I suppose, just make it look better than if this dude ever stops making them  big ones and then fail to put them together. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I mean, he's got big  balls, I'll give you that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Haha JOKES!!) Gotta say though, even if  it's a showdown to make the biggest snowman, Takagi would still win. Just  saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, the new school semester starts once again. but who  cares what the trio did over the long holidays because why not chase down your  relatives for money as motivation to run lmao, we talk about Hojou. She's  cute, she wants to give her boy Hamaguchi something to his birthday, so he  dragged Nishikata in for her brainstorming, asking what his friend would want.  Goddamn, and this is the sweetest shit ever, that coincidentally the guy wants  some homemade cookies the girl has been doing recently. Aw... and this isn't  the final part stop making me want to cancel the main couple for these guys.  Also, screw you "KanoKari" Yuuki Aoi in this is so much better. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> But  yeah, Takagi saw these two get together for no reason and decided to do the  <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en" target="_blank">j-j-j-jealousy</a>  thing (shout out to this song man really a good running joke I can beat to  death with) by interrogating- asking the guy what they were talking about.  Good guy Nishikata keeps his secrets though, that's the honest guy your girl  likes about you. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Takagi then took the chance (because she's such a  prophet in guessing what Hojou wants to know) to also ask her boy what he  wants for his upcoming birthday present. Like, directly, by the way,  Nishikata, this is not the dog joke anymore so if you said dog food I'm pretty  sure it'll be sent to you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Goddamn can we have that instead? It's way  funnier lmao ok anyways... but yeah she said it, brave girl Takagi, and I  still CANNOT BELIEVE this dude has nothing on his mind. The best kind of tease  you can do to her all year, tell her to knit like, a full woollen outfit or  something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, Hojou MVP lmao, Kimura got fat lol, and yes  Nishikata last season's final episode at the summer festival was quite a thing  to recall. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah. Haha cya guys for more... I wonder how they gonna  conclude this though, I don't see anything incoming besides the new school  year in April...??? Oh. OH!!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span></div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgpOWqbfyDUSjgt4szeLL_XUGqbLJxEQ8ArHrIGZ3ZQEh1ie34JFfDWO70yC-0ha9kUHWAVLN3ccNCiHlF_54K84jGiHzhb07snybXyr8mMb1NX2b1WQ4oCunkmCjae-_j1KaOG_LT1gMrEXoaOAFWUhAZ1sldfwiCEquYw2N2Z2_sYtlBII7JajCH2" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Don't know why I clipped this but hey here's a "what?"

Maybe apart from the loaded chest but  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we are still enjoying the cosplay since  Shinju took all the spotlight last week (#KiseKoi10), we have a lot more to  cover, but not really on clothing so just be careful when I say this is an  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> Anime  series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So firstly, about the actual group cosplay which is not  Souma-kun lol. I can only summarize this session similar to what Juju-san  thinks too tbh, where she is just trying not to lose it at the fact that Gojou  is awesome and everyone had a great time, Kitagawa can't take her role  seriously to take some serious shots at the camera somehow, and Shinju broke  her B holder. Yeah, the last part is probably more interesting I was expecting  a window shatter considering they zoomed out for that part lmao. But yeah,  Gojou Wakana is some legend. Well, he is considering all the girls he is with  now have no prior experience in dealing with cosplay outfits his level and  himself, honestly. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, he wins I guess. then, we have Veronica.  If you have noticed what was in the opening with that  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shitachichi" target="_blank">underboob</a>  character, I guess she is some badass character from a different video game  series but who really cares, because apart from the sharp teeth and white hair  and tanned skin, she also wears a very revealing outfit. Like really,  everything else can even be done with some Photoshop but I can't help Gojou if  he can't deal with some female skin. Well, normally anyone wouldn't but who  knows. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, Kitagawa was excited to try and appeared at his  place in the middle of summer vacations so she be sweatin' (hehe ah-), so she  took a shower before... well they didn't do the cosplay so whatever lol. This  time around though Gojou did not walk into the shower at the wrong time.  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Then again, why not, right? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>) But yeah, we have that  experience already so MOVING ON!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (She cannot know, Kitagawa, for  like, Gojou's lifetime lol) I guess this counts as last but not least, the  couple go shopping. This time around though, it's not for cosplay stuff, but  for Gojou himself. Like, himself himself, so he doesn't wear whatever his  grandfather wears in 2022 lol no insults but that is only a right for the  tradition, and you are not that, sir. You can practice it but just wear some  T-shirts, please. Says Kitagawa by the way as she lets him try everything at  the clothes store only to realize she didn't care about fashion at that point  it's just him being cool to her anyways lol why can't I be like this, while  Gojou himself is getting more anxiety than I would have at my job interviews  lmao. But seriously bro, try to dress up to suit your  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gal</a> partner,  yeah? Even the receptionist refused to believe you two were an item. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>  All in all, I thought the last part was the series' conclusion but I guess  not, and Gojou did try to be honest in his innocent and pure feelings towards  this bangin' girl in front of him so... send pics to me please I won't be  embarrassed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But real talk, they are a couple already, right? Can't  wait for the confession from... anyone of them, really. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> You think  they will let Juju-san in on this action? I really want to see that though but  hey, can't wait for what will conclude this awesome series before it turns  into a cash grab like that Anime "Dagashi Kashi" series lol please don't</div><div>  [TL:DR; Dude, the scenes that came up in "Blaze" when Kitagawa found out about  Gojou being alone with <strike>Shinju</strike> a middle schooler (lol) really  brings in those j-j-j- feels, isn't it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You think Kitagawa's jewel  got tainted?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="1379" data-original-width="1280" height="345" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhfQ8mUwxghQMX-wA4NxzBpeO61IdEDSRflvCZS504UHlPzZQlEaRrvs82I5CNVa9a3PvF24exyJvaMqleAwiZQyQMl1M08dwXykhRTqkuQo1oqfpURibileTQIBCDtX7PvHGMeOMv8hwYnSr4RH7967s9a4wztEYSHEy17A98IGiQU-9MqLfkHn4OH=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I wish I can put the actual girl herself here and this is the next              best thing so            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj2Lv9cFWo98FCmrQhVgohzoySIUZaQkuhazqsuBOM2_2T-jsqK_fHPqUlNR0tJmmPPXrjWfhmpwP4S6DIQ9wenyD-W-0HyAIG1-O2Ai157Bf6FAW5X3e7k7qqTufw--v8wUR4vtn0zhNYdeTx8n-RfQNlu2fccaZfwPuwV2rJpW1ScXYGjkyE6dPQJ=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              The best thing<br />(lol)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Firstly, I told myself to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%9C%80%E6%82%AA%E6%9C%80%E6%84%9B/1609932615?l=en" target="_blank">Higuchi Ai's new album</a></b>&nbsp;which released last week but didn't join the party (lol) partly because we have heard of her in Anime recently but also I feel like she has the vibes of other singer-songwriters like Andou Yuuko so might as well give her a try, but so far I was only disappointed not by the style but more of the melodies since she makes the common mistakes of adding extra notes where they don't matter, and not creating much impact. I said that to myself, until I gave <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%82%82%E9%80%85%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3/1609913895?l=en" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia's new album</a></b> which I also realized it didn't feature composers I know of (ironically I have been listening to songs from the artist, and are written by yorushika's composer n-buna without realizing), which is probably also what made it weaker than usual since I like to believe Mia-san's face reveal is probably doing the sales here instead of the quality of the songs so I only ended up giving the topic song. And it reminded me of the former again, so I went back and gave something there. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So as you can see, it's complicated. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But seriously, both not great examples considering we just gave the best and new Collection Artists last week and this week we have these. Haha okay I'm sorry guys<br />  <br />  For this week's news from Twitter that is talking about music and maybe I'll ignore Anime soundtracks lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/HiguchiAi/status/1500466830137511942?s=20&amp;t=FcZUwaDEy0pMuGGL-0THCA" target="_blank">Higuchi Ai's music video</a></b> for Anime "Attack on Titan" has subtitles for 10 languages so I'm pretty sure you can understand this song compared to the others you listen to on YouTube, I still cannot believe <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rikeigakoini/status/1500676758273617920?s=20&amp;t=FcZUwaDEy0pMuGGL-0THCA" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's new song will be for Anime "RikeKoi"</a></b> lol OMG haha but yeah looks like we are joined with CHiCO with HoneyWorks in collaboration with... some other dude which is similar to the arrangements in the first season of this series, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/FlyingDogInc/status/1501393083828785157?s=20&amp;t=FcZUwaDEy0pMuGGL-0THCA" target="_blank">Numakura Manami's music video collection is out on YouTube</a></b> and surprisingly that happened before <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1502237904902496256?s=20&amp;t=FcZUwaDEy0pMuGGL-0THCA" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana's music video collection</a></b> being out on YouTube too and her announcing the revival of her channel which barely had anything as of now so you would think they are friends who arranged this or something, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1502586824220606468?s=20&amp;t=FcZUwaDEy0pMuGGL-0THCA" target="_blank">TrySail's delayed single finally got a release date in April</a></b> and they are doing full-on collaboration with Anime series "Madoka Magica" so don't ask me what <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1502932477584814081?s=20&amp;t=FcZUwaDEy0pMuGGL-0THCA" target="_blank">the web series</a> is about it's just a PR stunt,&nbsp;<b><a href="https://twitter.com/riefuofficial/status/1502630977289752576?s=20&amp;t=FcZUwaDEy0pMuGGL-0THCA" target="_blank">Rie fu is releasing live video archives on YouTube</a></b>&nbsp;to celebrate her upcoming live tour in 3 years, and&nbsp;<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAtnYTUVSA7eOUOwr-W6Z9A" target="_blank">CrosSing</a>  is a new artists cover YouTube channel</b> similar to THE FIRST TAKE but now focuses on Anime songs. We aren't really in familiar territory yet but I see a lot of familiar names  in there so yeah we getting cover songs all over I guess<br />  <br />So for next week, looks like we have some spare time, so this time around unlike last year, <b>I will walk into the indie artists landscape once again</b> to listen to songs that'll make me think twice, so yeah not Skream or Bandcamp but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.audioleaf.com/" target="_blank">Audioleaf</a>, don't think I forgot about you unless you shut down your site, for I will try on my luck to find artists to inspire my passion for whatever I've done for nearly 15 years. Yeah, soon. Soon.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Wow that was actually an awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/toyotamoe/status/1502906153399123970?s=20&amp;t=m2If2t5gqEWB1xCeQLDGIw" target="_blank">Moeshi 27th birthday livestream</a>! She held an <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>  audition because she wants one and she chose Natsukawa Shiina over her  friend Itou Miku lmao (hell yeah Moeshi lol), she won a horse bet on the day which aligns herself  with Lynn-san winning over 106 times her bet (hell yeah Moeshi), and she did a solo guitar  performance HELL YEAH MOESHI!! Wow, just so much wow I can't even. Glad I was there to watch it though; I swear I skipped the second half of it last year. Now I have to buy her  birthday goods to sink into some of her luck, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, the  upcoming package hasn't even arrived yet and it has her goods too lol I got until next month so we  shall see. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time then, and until next time I hope I will muster whatever energy left in me after work in the weekdays to write up stuff on this blog so I can actually talk about KN15YEARS in due time. Let's see how that works out. Working sucks haha bye</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
