I gotta say, still  the only thing I hate of you now is how short your hair is now lol maybe if  I'm her boyfriend I'll have a say in this haha oh well I'll look forward to  your photobook then I have not been spoiled too much so far so I'll be waiting  for that</div><div><br /></div><div>  Maybe it's all the waiting that is going to make this month real boring in  contrast. Waiting for new package to arrive, waiting for stupid in-camp  training at the end of the month, waiting for new employees to appear so I can  actually offload some of the stuff I do at work to someone who probably won't  have an idea what she (yes, she) is doing... This is as exciting as I can make  it sorry maybe it's watching too much Spongebob gameplays from the one  streamer I follow is turning me into Squidward too lmao</div><div><br /></div><div>  So! Goddamn the announcements keep appearing for new Anime next season, and I  tell you, you be darned if "Aharen-san" isn't the only new series I'll be  watching because I'm drowning in sequels dude! <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I'm the exploring type I  don't like to be tied down by  <a    href="https://twitter.com/comisanvote/status/1498674419639545856?s=20&amp;t=yZ_oXmWgbNVR-oJ3Ngv_UQ"    target="_blank"    >Kaguya-sama</a  >  or  <a    href="https://twitter.com/kyokou_suiri/status/1499550193116753937?s=20&amp;t=yZ_oXmWgbNVR-oJ3Ngv_UQ"    target="_blank"    >Kotoko-chan</a  >~!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, no one said Anime adaptations can't be your new addiction  one can only follow this many series lol</div><div><br /></div><div>  Okay, pep talk over, I wish I did more yesterday with a planned blog post  about Klassic Note (not review) but I got lazy as usual so we try that again  next week haha let's start this!</div><div><br /></div><div>  [Note to self: Really need to write shorter reviews just because or else you  will hate doing this on a weekly basis]</div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan83">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span      ><span style="font-size: large;">        Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span      >    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "Probably for the same reason you are not dead yet: because you're an      Ackerman" W~HAT!!! lol no really is Levi one too?    </div>  </blockquote>  Oh well bad news Hange-san, not like Armin and Pyxis did anything in this  situation... which they do not know of yet anyways so in this new episode  (#AttackOnTitan83) we can finally talk about what happened to Levi and Hange.  I recall now, the last time we saw them and Zeke, this dude revealed his  spinal fluid wine ideas and made all their people turn against these two who  don't drink. Not gonna make them smarter though, as Hange stayed in solitude  with injured Levi, whatever she said did not even come close to what really  happened, seeing that she also has no idea seeing the message from Eren soon  after they evaded being killed by Zeke. So, minor flashback, and in their  conversation with Magath and Pieck (umph) (haha ok me) (but seriously though  *gets pushed away*) Magath is probably wise to not shoot Levi and hear what he  has to say along with military expert Hange here so yeah. We'll get back to  them later, but first, Connie. Gotta say though, from not having a plan to  making Falco believe this soldier alongside him is innocent and doesn't know  anything about him... great job so far but as how to make your Titan mother (I  really forgot about that) eat Falco though I must say that is the weirdest  thing to have to think about AND execute so yeah, I can take jokes like this  from time to time, thanks author. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, Armin and Gabi walked in  on time to see them wash the mother's teeth lmao (don't laugh, Connie had a  great plan), and I must say I thought Armin will kill the mom but maybe it's  because I forgot about Armin talking about how useless he was from last  episode, so yeah, to keep Connie's mom and Falco human, Armin can get eaten  instead. Probably most emotional episode in this final season so far, so thank  Connie for being such a buddy and not let one of the main guys die this way.  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> The rumbling finally subsided in Paradis Island, Annie left with the  other guys coincidentally on the streets eating pie lol, and Floch enjoyed the  life of being a ruthless dictator under Eren's orders...? Whatever he sucks so  why Jean did you not let him get eaten by the Cart Titan? Haha okay that was  part of a plan apparently. Apart from the one guy who is looking at the whole  thing happening and I don't think it can be anyone left but who knows, looks  like Magath and Pieck has arranged to pick up Yelena and the other dude in  exchange for some escape plan somehow I don't really understand. But yeah,  Jean isn't that much of a follower after all, thank goodness. And last but not  least, the talk about a plan to save the world after waking Reiner up. My  guess? It's going to be some plan to try to stop Eren in his tracks, but we  all know this is just going to end up in a massacre where most importantly,  the Titan powers will cease to exist. Will I be right? I guess we gonna  continue watching to find out. Man, we are so close to the conclusion, I'm  already wanting to- You know how much it sucks to wait for a week for another  episode? Haha cya guys in the next.</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh3AvttVXeX-ot_OJGHSqnsxZZCGF9N1yQzGpK3O4JhSXLcvxOUBBPcP05w7ENR01GiRz8X7m2Ct6hmF-YVrYS_2m4dtZFrKJL0207BBGujdidnMsp3FzAW5DlmJOta2GJYLfYEuzQWuA3JR16FN4ISH62VOix9ti5ZfP8Ok4wBtkUUdYvEUYTnXkcF=s320"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              The AoT "I don't know what face to draw" compilation<br />(Connie              just turned into his father when he lied lol)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjwZrnZ5iA0KiMk-heF8MfZR6QCNLDyim8kkxnGd75J0TBxJe9bBC2S2hcHnX5g9a19hz16vOq4mWFA5o4rEd-4DYbPm86w8igxjBb7rntsAlRS2UecWTUi0qnBfUhxXejN05SblaouUsH4BWCvTKdhrxfyNn8EfPZb9xhvy-iMdSlijMHgjVHzowYo=s320"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              The AoT "I don't know what face to draw" compilation<br />(Like              really, what face do you draw when you survived an explosion)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. "If we run and hide. what will we have left?" Eh Levi either you all turn  into titans or get tramped by them since a wall of them are advancing out of  the island lol</div><div>  P.P.S. "How do I even get Mom to eat Falco?" I mean Connie, just kill the kid  in front of your mother, easy. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> (Please don't do that OR do that and say  I said it thanks)<br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS309">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "That means another year of losses to Takagi-san unless I win her today!"      Okay that's how you make new year resolutions, Nishikata? lol    </div>  </blockquote>  Merry Christmas, everyone. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, if this season was meant to be  aired three months ago, I wonder what stopped them from doing so. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  Anyways, new episode (#TakagiSanS309), we know where this is going, so let's  sum it up. We got the pre-date dream as always, thanks Nishikata we know you  are real desperate, and the day has come. No, not Christmas. The airing date  of that movie, dude. I know Christmas Eve is a couples thing but come on.  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You were late for the date too? So, so rude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, there  aren't any parts to this episode since they managed to patch the story into  one smooth flow, so let's see if Anime production can do it as smooth as Ikeo  is to Kyunko. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nishikata recalled his losing streak for the year with  his girl lol, so he kept thinking of ways to win her, even if it means it's a  crane game and he has to not get the stuff he wants because he's an idiot who  doesn't know how to play crane games. Please, to get the puzzle you lift the  edge upwards that is <i>away</i> from the hole. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, Takagi is a  pro so whatever you get what you want in the end- Why is Takagi doing the  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> role?  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They were so ready for the movie he had to tell the receptionist they  were together lmao, even bought the couple snack set I can't even, and like  seriously, what else is missing in this romance Anime? Oh yeah, glad you  remembered, me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This episode had everything: couples touching hands  while getting popcorn, scenes to make the girl cry lmao yes Nishikata why are  you crying, and Takagi jealous that Nishikata might be taken away from her by  Kyunko because she isn't his type. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Hey, if that wasn't a good enough  hint, Takagi did another showdown with Nishikata of just a simple race to the  next electric pole. And he won. Wow. Truly a Christmas miracle. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, I  forgot to tell you Nishikata, Takagi was the Santa Claus so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also,  I know he has that satisfaction going on him by winning his girl, but don't  you feel a little empty inside? Like, even if Takagi wasn't pretending don't  you feel like you lost? Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not least though, if you  would recall I say every episode had that moment? Yeah, shoutout to the snow  and the Christmas Tree as side characters, but yeah, it's gift exchange time.  Takagi gave him the one scarf she did knit for him and not for the dog as I  mentioned before because why wouldn't you make another for your boi, and  Nishikata got his girl some mufflers because he noticed her hands were cold  all the time. Now THAT is a caring boyfriend. Good for you, sir, I'm so proud  of you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... is this not the most chill episode of this  series EVER? Like, seriously, right?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't know if that's a good  or bad thing though, after experiencing this much so far it really feels like  this is real mellow as it is wholesome of an episode for this series, it  shouldn't even be in this story. But hey, I think we can gracefully let these  two be a couple in peace for once <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>, and you know, let their  relationship grow just because. I can't believe I wrote all this haha cya guys  for more wholesome moments but really this is good enough for me even if for  this season we've reached the peak lol</div><div>  [TL:DR; This episode really made me think, about what makes of a perfect gift,  and how much you can screw up. What if those gloves' colour isn't what she  wants?

I mean, Grandpa knows. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, they  met up again for the new cosplay at his place ie. the shop of course, we are  one step closer to making all the cosplay magic group happen. Yeah, all three  of them. Eh? Yep, you didn't see it wrong, we have a third person joining in.  So surprise surprise, Gojou asked her out, Shinju. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay let's clear  that misunderstanding, we are talking about cosplay, so yeah Kitagawa we good.  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, Shinju's story. So yeah, looks like I was right too from  last week, that deep inside her, this middle schooler also wants to cosplay,  and after we have seen the marvel that is on Kitagawa and Juju-san and them  waiting on the studio location for the sister to appear, it looks like I was  right after all. Gojou isn't wrong about saying that anyone has a right to  cosplay though, but ironically this is his biggest challenge yet. Because  apart from having to do this cosplay for Shinju under a budget since we are  dealing with someone without a job lol she still underage bro, we are also  dealing with a totally different physique. Yes, Kitagawa undressing is just  prelude to what you have to experience for the rest of the episode haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>  So, probably the best way to make this miracle happen, Shinju wanted to  cosplay as that brother in that "Flower Blaze" Anime we watched in this Anime  lmao what (haha), so basically you can't have a rack or have contours in your  manly body. I mean, right? The easy part was getting the makeup already,  really. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> After much trial and error and finding out that  <a    href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiJW6uKDd3HPNTfyE1MSASPi9YRBFaHGNX-7X3JsNmUAQfO01S8_Z9znnJn5rkCxlopDsF4tF6ajjL7Q97fWHhfx0Az1uI8gZHPurm_4pVRLYjl02uBF0gkr_M6bjxX97OG5K1Gqjk7lkQntoDNOoieY8gQJjhsgWgB3ZEVXlIYgwvxFjd0PwkNxcL9=s320"    target="_blank"    >B holders</a  >  exist haha that's with a copyright symbol by the way I wonder how much in  royalties they had to pay to put this in lol (you can google it yourself, it's  basically a specially made two-layer wrap which presses down on the nature of  sagging breasts) and giving Shinju some black hair and makeup... I gotta say  this is the closest she will ever get to cross-dressing as a man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She  did impress the other two though with the cosplay, I mean, we didn't expect  this to have some Shoujo manga crossover and fanservice stuff for the girls  but I guess we did. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, thanks for the ecchi references  especially this episode to be honest haha, and I still can't believe they made  this happen. Somehow more stark in contrast to Kitagawa, and of course I  wouldn't even bother comparing to Juju-san just because. But yeah, speaking in  Kitagawa's defence, these two might have too much alone time together it's  illegal. No really, hanging out with a middle schooler? I have the right to  call the cops on you, bro. Haha see ya guys for more honest feelings- Dude,  this might be a killer for this season honestly can't wait for the cosplay of  that character with just horizontal lines covering the nipples-</div><div>  [TL:DR; For those who still think Shinju as Souma-kun didn't look quite right  even after so much, I would argue that most cosplayers hardly look any closer  than their actual characters so this is already pretty damn impressive  especially when we can do camera shots on angles that'll make her face look  like a dude so yeah]</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="180"                data-original-width="320"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh0uDf160gSzHHETx8rGNa0AVo-dCTva4Jf_IIKhmMH14TVyOPwzL1P8GpetuB1w2Myqbmn7qFzz1nN4ivmsu-toaUP0HY6bav09WLBaMmfHTJjS2Sr8aIq9u_crurScHtJ6HV8U-0AukywL3hIhUDyq_-943BEVpK1pxs50G5ypiLiVR2gJ2AAxiWS"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              How it feels like to be an onii-chan in an Anime lol<br />(Gotta              say, this kinda cute haha)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="180"                data-original-width="320"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiSCHf-pr0ukTBOa4JQU2D7QeeUotN4mRQxSO76lg72yarhu-ReymODBD5T9NEzPqfJjQUdfM361AfdMaXNfM05VS7p2zNaNCBayH85uGdlAGaN9cl9qoDVXeRUwI6OpyWaiQayadjVQkcxzdrbSWaUjrzmlLII1NhFWe9NodHPlGIpqEb4anZ-1UQl"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              How it feels like to be an onii-chan in an Anime lol<br />(I don't              know what to make of this but okay)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="1394"                data-original-width="1280"                height="348"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgDVRBYd0DJ11S9KEXdzSmhHmFK0qSHJyxzLiRglxwqrWjFNVOzRANQqG4hYugtJhbGxa62nUXkYKb_1L_ReAjiwUFoPhFnEHOUoF5-MWkuZlaFj1UpZwZxaw3eBgLsLc2r3ZD3BKVdeld6hfntL4xCIRxstmZtx6gokxAP5eFcWTmPtc6W8Fw_Q60V=s320"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              LOL<br />(It's that big, guys, it's that big)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

I did get around to listen to  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%84%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8E%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8E-10%E5%91%A8%E5%B9%B4%E8%A8%98%E5%BF%B5-%E3%82%BB%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%90%E3%83%A0-roundabout/1608131256?l=en"      target="_blank"      >yanaginagi's selection album</a    ></b  >  which really besides  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m65vpWcBq5E" target="_blank"    >the new song</a  >  which started the release and the next song which was from her time in  supercell I'm darned how they gave her the song to sing and put in this album  tbh, but yeah, not like the rest of the album deepened my impression of the  already Collection Artist.&nbsp;<b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%BD%A9%E8%89%B2%E7%A1%9D%E5%AD%90-ep/1607963660?l=en"      target="_blank"      >Asakura Momo's new single</a    ></b  >  is rather expected as I did not give the B-side despite never hearing it  before, already know she is dropping by as Collection Artist with one song but  really wanted to review the single so I can talk about how interesting the  topic song is especially  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxNZjExDkBU" target="_blank"    >the music video</a  >. But hey, at least we can give  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/blue-thermal-ep/1609388909?l=en"      target="_blank"      >SHE'S new single</a    ></b  >  which DID drop by as Collection Artist recently, now gave themselves a reason  for me to review the single as they put in their best for an animated movie so  yeah, giving the CD though I don't care about a movie about airplanes lol.  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/bohemia/1605988989?l=en"      target="_blank"      >ORESKABAND's new album</a    ></b  >  is a major release from them in a while so I did try to give as much as I can,  and I think I am very satisfied overall even picking up on  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQbPEMLLQ6Q" target="_blank"    >older digital single songs</a  >  because I think the music videos probably gave me the wrong mood or emotion to  give them. They also made in the Collection Artist list, by the way, took them  long enough haha you're welcome girls. Last but not least, we have  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ooorder/1608121062?l=en"      target="_blank"      >mol-74's new album</a    ></b  >  which I only knew of last week but I think I better follow them on Twitter  because besides a strong first impression trying to give half of the album's  song for some reason lol, I eventually got critical and dropped it down to the  topic songs that are new or I missed. I gotta say though, one of the reasons I  would do so is probably from giving so many songs from the above I feel bad  queueing them at the back of this, but also because I really preferred their  indie style which was more emo in nature. So yeah, I picked up the not-so-emo  styles instead, if that makes any sense to you.<br />  <br />  For the newest stuff about music on Twitter, we have...  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1498645478979694595?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A"      target="_blank"      >SID released a new music video</a    ></b  >  for their upcoming album but I think I'll leave that for now,  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/_kanaboon/status/1498855766207643648?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A"      target="_blank"      >KANA-BOON pre-released a new song</a    ></b  >  for their upcoming album which I did not listen since a music video is likely  in place if you can guess, I saw this YouTube premiere on my way home from  work so  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1498978695326748675?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A"      target="_blank"      >SHE'S music video</a    ></b  >  is just as awesome as the song I mean we have given it already at this point,  shoutout to the awesome  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1499580419666235427?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A"      target="_blank"      >cover for ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new album</a    ></b  >  by if you don't know who Nakamura Yuusuke is you need to see the sophisticated  art and Anime character designs done by him,  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1499686029921456128?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A"      target="_blank"      >Sangatsu no Phantasia appeared on THE FIRST TAKE</a    ></b  >  with arguably her most popular song to date, and we have a  <a    href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1500423314732290048?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A"    target="_blank"    >Mia-san livestream planned on the day before album release</a  >  which I would say might give her record number of viewers just because she  revealed herself after all these years. Last but not least,  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/HiguchiAi/status/1500466830137511942?s=20&amp;t=l_8I9LwNPYxBFtZ9gaBdAQ"      target="_blank"      >Higuchi Ai's new music video</a    ></b  >  is for the single for Anime "Attack on Titan" but of course done in course of  her recent full album. And don't be too surprised on the view count it has  subtitles in 10 different languages lol that's how you do MVs, Japan.<br />  <br />  So next week, and I'm glad to take a break of those crazy packed release  schedules from the past two weeks, we only have  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%82%82%E9%80%85%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3/1609913895?l=en"      target="_blank"      >Sangatsu no Phantasia's new album</a    ></b  >  which I hope will be good not because vocalist Mia-san chose to present her  image in a more honest manner, according to her. So yeah, if they suddenly get  into the Klassic Note Collection Artist list don't ask me why. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And  maybe I'll listen to  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/HiguchiAi/status/1498677446174179328?s=20&amp;t=l_8I9LwNPYxBFtZ9gaBdAQ"      target="_blank"      >Higuchi Ai's new album</a    ></b  >  from last week if I have the time because why not.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Oh yeah Sasaki Nao happy birthday to you too- Dude, if not for  <a    href="https://twitter.com/sasaki_nao_0306/status/1500401556507742213?s=20&amp;t=te_AkpXM4s58ICvSASSHwA"    target="_blank"    >your Tweet</a  >  I really forgot how much you will impress my parents compared to Ede-chan if  you were my girlfriend. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, I got nothing besides photobooks  and/or social media posts instead of a real girl, so I lose. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Cya guys  next week then, the package is coming together, my life is getting boring by  the day lol, and be sure to take a look at the  <a    href="https://twitter.com/_m_aaii/status/1500456144254681090?s=20&amp;t=te_AkpXM4s58ICvSASSHwA"    target="_blank"    >behind-the-scenes of IDOLY PRIDE in real life</a  >  to remind yourself how you are the leftmost girl who forgot how to cry.  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>...</div><div><br /></div><div>I should sleep more haha good night</div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S.
