And damn, damn, damn do I have more artists I can talk about in reviews now that they have become popular and came in under the spotlight. Hey, the more the better, isn't it? This time around, unlike artists which target specifically me so female artists, we have a male group here! And a male band dedicated to singing songs for women? Happy International Women's Month, by the way. See, I'm an advocate and this is not a coincidence</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div id=SHESBlueThermal><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq music"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>SHE'S - Blue Thermal [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=300 data-original-width=300 height=300 src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/01/45/TYCT-39170.jpg width=300><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=300 data-original-width=300 height=300 src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/00/20/TYCT-30128.jpg width=300><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><tr></table><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><div>(I mean, The Regular Edition cover is a bunch of balloons behind a punched hole of a thin wall behind a layer of plastic and bubbles? Artistic, to say the least)</div><div><br></div><div>Origin: I have to say, I should thank SHE'S for bringing me closer to feminism than I will ever be with their music. Being soft with their music but bringing impact on everything they create, they just tend to exude a little more of those feelings from the female perspective better than any other male artist(s) could ever within the industry, and I applaud them for that. Their style also brought me to like them more than ever since I knew of them five years ago, with singles to love and album to please. This recent single is no doubt just credited for the animated movie of the same title, and I can say this is the easiest way to exhibit how their style doesn't fade when being associated with credit, as they are still being able to stand on edge with their music.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Blue Thermal</div><div>From the first chorus:</div><div style=text-align:center></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"The pains that pierce the heart</div><div style=text-align:center>Draw the curves that the wind carries</div><div style=text-align:center>Admiring, riding and overcoming, flying up high</div><div style=text-align:center>(I) will take you along"</div></blockquote><div style=text-align:center></div><div>As you might have figured out from the lyrics, the song sings about flying in the sky, ambitions to soar in the blue world above us, with power and with company. For having inherited the song title from its credit, it's hard to think that it should be more relatable to the show itself, but surprisingly they are still able to create such a good mood out of it, and I admire them for that. For the melody, it does borrow the vibes of epic tunes they have written over the years, brought in with impact and with much love. Overall a nice package for a song you cannot screw up on, and hearing it more just makes me feel guilty for preferring their classics over this. I also managed to watch the music video premier on YouTube on time, and it paints a blue picture of teen hope and courage as a statement to follow for the movie.</div><div>Rating: Beautifully Above Average</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Beautiful Bird</div><div>From the first verse:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"I know,I know,I know</div><div style=text-align:center>Seeing (my) footsteps</div><div style=text-align:center>(The) Things enough to make (me) afraid and unable to proceed</div><div style=text-align:center>So I walk,I walk,I walk</div><div style=text-align:center>I walk straight without a stop</div><div style=text-align:center>When (I) see you that was what (I) decided"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>This song... this feels like a song of praise. Praise them birds, or praise them braving the skies... this song feel like a song of encouragement, once again, with company. The emotions are strong on this one, which really made me think twice the first time I heard of this. Its simple melody and impactful lyrics did leave an impression on me, and with much thought I accepted it and gave them praise for making such simple yet nice music once again, as they have been doing all these years. The English in the lyrics just make them stand out a little more than you might imagine.</div><div>Rating: Simply Average</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: This is a perfect single to show how great SHE'S actually is, and I encourage you to give them a listen. I often say that if you can like at least two styles of a band you will love them, and this single has both of them. Of impact, and of emotion, these guys handle them all gracefully and with style. What more can I say? I am sure coming out from watching the animation this will bring an even greater impact, but I don't even need that to know these guys gave it their all.</div><div><br></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(Yeah, I know right?

Yeah, back in January. So.. maybe it was a good idea to listen to new songs early after all, eh? I could've gotten this signed, man!!</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqZMh0uE0q1W3C5zeivzZAAI6JrYtOhlDqyKxxicgWrpEw1lD6tkmEi-RMmLvahd3Wdn1aI1RoV6C1jt2AikOvQk_CO2nwp-CQziXCC3RtBXCSFb-N1ZH2fL9Zezs18VKYuuaAoe-cPmC-53qc_6PBWd8XWWobPOjUN1GOYgX8BRs2Gw/s1600/PXL_20220315_123333148.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqZMh0uE0q1W3C5zeivzZAAI6JrYtOhlDqyKxxicgWrpEw1lD6tkmEi-RMmLvahd3Wdn1aI1RoV6C1jt2AikOvQk_CO2nwp-CQziXCC3RtBXCSFb-N1ZH2fL9Zezs18VKYuuaAoe-cPmC-53qc_6PBWd8XWWobPOjUN1GOYgX8BRs2Gw/s320/PXL_20220315_123333148.jpg width=320></a></div><div>So! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Never thought I'll buy a SHE'S release, so here I am thinking of what special gift I should give myself after missing like, a great opportunity to get a signed something haha it's fine. And because I have been buying CDs to fill my shelf for nearly a decade, I went back to my "hometown" CDJapan aka Neowing because (1) they are one of the first to know to internationalize their store to make me buy stacks of CDs back in 2012 without much friction and (2) still offer reasonable shipping rates despite only literally buying this one disc. And it comes with a free postcard of the members too! What more can I ask for?</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicVcEDfTuIyM_I0ObhNBPRXJPVaSKLUE9MttMRmn-ptQJw4tONxtZde4WGs-ROQxTjFNXqsCFy_WC1eUY9QNo1KuhuWz2mP-gxSPAWf_b8iQkt-4yQX-otK9i7Z9L2Aes72VcvahhsvU3dFA_xXklvP9ZyHyG-hiKlIrUWjPEY79gafA/s1600/PXL_20220315_123359576.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicVcEDfTuIyM_I0ObhNBPRXJPVaSKLUE9MttMRmn-ptQJw4tONxtZde4WGs-ROQxTjFNXqsCFy_WC1eUY9QNo1KuhuWz2mP-gxSPAWf_b8iQkt-4yQX-otK9i7Z9L2Aes72VcvahhsvU3dFA_xXklvP9ZyHyG-hiKlIrUWjPEY79gafA/s320/PXL_20220315_123359576.jpg width=320></a></div><div>Okay, maybe not the animated jacket enclosed in the booklet because who cares lol</div><br><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>And that shall be it! As I ignore my dad walking into my room asking what have I bought lol what does he know, I continue my journey talking about great music I've found in Japan where people abandoned them for whatever popular is in Korea now because who cares about those. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, I may have some plans for the upcoming months, but whether I will fulfil them or not, it's really up to me. Come on, me, do it for KN15YEARS. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you then.</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
