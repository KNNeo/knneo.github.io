  Hey, thought I wouldn't be back on another review this quick, but we know THIS
  is the actual kick-off for review this year since this single was released
  this year unlike the other two we have talked about last month.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, welcome back! And damn, damn, damn do I have more artists I can talk
  about in reviews now that they have become popular and came in under the
  spotlight. Hey, the more the better, isn't it? This time around, unlike
  artists which target specifically me so female artists, we have a male group
  here! And a male band dedicated to singing songs for women? Happy
  International Women's Month, by the way. See, I'm an advocate and this is not
  a coincidence

<div>
  (I mean, The Regular Edition cover is a bunch of balloons behind a punched
  hole of a thin wall behind a layer of plastic and bubbles? Artistic, to say
  the least)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: I have to say, I should thank SHE'S for bringing me closer to feminism
  than I will ever be with their music. Being soft with their music but bringing
  impact on everything they create, they just tend to exude a little more of
  those feelings from the female perspective better than any other male
  artist(s) could ever within the industry, and I applaud them for that. Their
  style also brought me to like them more than ever since I knew of them five
  years ago, with singles to love and album to please. This recent single is no
  doubt just credited for the animated movie of the same title, and I can say
  this is the easiest way to exhibit how their style doesn't fade when being
  associated with credit, as they are still being able to stand on edge with
  their music.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Blue Thermal</div>
<div>From the first chorus:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"The pains that pierce the heart</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Draw the curves that the wind carries</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Admiring, riding and overcoming, flying up high
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(I) will take you along"</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>
  As you might have figured out from the lyrics, the song sings about flying in
  the sky, ambitions to soar in the blue world above us, with power and with
  company. For having inherited the song title from its credit, it's hard to
  think that it should be more relatable to the show itself, but surprisingly
  they are still able to create such a good mood out of it, and I admire them
  for that. For the melody, it does borrow the vibes of epic tunes they have
  written over the years, brought in with impact and with much love. Overall a
  nice package for a song you cannot screw up on, and hearing it more just makes
  me feel guilty for preferring their classics over this. I also managed to
  watch the music video premier on YouTube on time, and it paints a blue picture
  of teen hope and courage as a statement to follow for the movie.
</div>
<div>Rating: Beautifully Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Beautiful Bird</div>
<div>From the first verse:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"I know,I know,I know</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Seeing (my) footsteps</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (The) Things enough to make (me) afraid and unable to proceed
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">So I walk,I walk,I walk</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">I walk straight without a stop</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    When (I) see you that was what (I) decided"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  This song... this feels like a song of praise. Praise them birds, or praise
  them braving the skies... this song feel like a song of encouragement, once
  again, with company. The emotions are strong on this one, which really made me
  think twice the first time I heard of this. Its simple melody and impactful
  lyrics did leave an impression on me, and with much thought I accepted it and
  gave them praise for making such simple yet nice music once again, as they
  have been doing all these years. The English in the lyrics just make them
  stand out a little more than you might imagine.
</div>
<div>Rating: Simply Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This is a perfect single to show how great SHE'S actually is, and
  I encourage you to give them a listen. I often say that if you can like at
  least two styles of a band you will love them, and this single has both of
  them. Of impact, and of emotion, these guys handle them all gracefully and
  with style. What more can I say? I am sure coming out from watching the
  animation this will bring an even greater impact, but I don't even need that
  to know these guys gave it their all.

  Every time I remind myself of this I recall how much I would've already given
  this single when they announced the pre-order versions which will be signed by
  the members, by the way, but are only available two months ago. Yeah, back in
  January. So.. maybe it was a good idea to listen to new songs early after all,
  eh? I could've gotten this signed, man!!

  So! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Never thought I'll buy a SHE'S release, so here I am thinking of
  what special gift I should give myself after missing like, a great opportunity
  to get a signed something haha it's fine. And because I have been buying CDs
  to fill my shelf for nearly a decade, I went back to my "hometown" CDJapan aka
  Neowing because (1) they are one of the first to know to internationalize
  their store to make me buy stacks of CDs back in 2012 without much friction
  and (2) still offer reasonable shipping rates despite only literally buying
  this one disc. And it comes with a free postcard of the members too! What more
  can I ask for?

  And that shall be it! As I ignore my dad walking into my room asking what have
  I bought lol what does he know, I continue my journey talking about great
  music I've found in Japan where people abandoned them for whatever popular is
  in Korea now because who cares about those. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, I may have some
  plans for the upcoming months, but whether I will fulfil them or not, it's
  really up to me. Come on, me, do it for KN15YEARS. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you then.
