Yes, I am watching FOUR Anime series next season, what of it? And that's
assuming I haven't seen the season preview and I already know of "Aharen-san"
AND there are THREE OTHER SEQUELS IN THE SAME SEASON wtf dude who do you think I
will choose between
<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/136359/Kaguya_Shinomiya"
  target="_blank"
  >Kaguya-sama</a
>,
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/141790/Shouko_Komi" target="_blank"
  >Komi-san</a
>
and
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/165457/Ayame_Himuro" target="_blank"
  >Himuro</a
>
from "RikeKoi"?&nbsp;<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/150916/Reina_Aharen"
  target="_blank"
  >Aharen-san</a
>, by the way, nice girl too haha you will find out how right I am in three
months
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Talking about Anime, the weekly <strike>chore</strike> post
  is here again, but I'm afraid, me, that we have more to cover over the next
  week because of the impending fate of the upcoming package dropping... really
  soon as in tomorrow so we shall see how to space that out since I have to
  work.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So me, how do you intend to watch the "Heike Monogatari" series if you can't
  even deal with the length of 3 episodes every week? Well. the write-up is
  shorter I guess haha maybe I should stop doing this-<br />
  <br />

  </blockquote>
  I know right, Annie, stop asking Armin for a plan we all wished Erwin was here
  to make a decision lol then again he may have drunk that spinal fluid wine too
  so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we try not to kill people now this is
  the pacifist episode lmao (#AttackOnTitan85), we notice how desperate Gabi
  just wants to kill. Like seriously, girl, you okay? Falco, you not worried she
  will kill you in your sleep when you guys are married? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
  story. It was a mess. Traitors all around, you know what I'm saying? Haha I
  meant the title of the episode, very appropriate. In a nutshell, the gang here
  knew that Floch's team is just threatening the Hiizuru people to cooperate
  which they likely won't so people are just slowly dying (shoutout to the
  engineers I look like that IRL and I'm not even under threat lol), so they
  don't have much time to think. Armin and Connie thought it'll be better if
  they stayed away of this or even try to not kill any of their friends who took
  the wrong side, literally up to Annie's expectations, but as they argue,
  Magath encourages them to take in the fight. To end this war as stupid as it
  may seem. Like really, when will this end? I meant like, we going for another
  season or...? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, looks like everyone's joining in to say the
  least lest Gabi has to do it herself lol you freak, so they start with bait.
  Floch probably already knows this so Armin's plan technically failed, but
  suffice it to say Armin and Connie managed to walk towards the flying boat
  which was of course guarded and rigged to blow should anyone like them appear,
  even if they are friends. Well, they almost got it I guess. Almost. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  But I guess they knew already, so Mikasa and the others were ready to strike
  if Floch did not go along with the plan of releasing the flying boat. Oh well,
  so much for trying haha. So yeah, they are the traitors I guess, I don't know
  who's betraying who already it's a mess just like the Hiizuru ambassador
  mentioned. Everyone tried to hide into the basement for cover so Titans can
  start roaming in the area which Reiner and Annie did covering each other's
  backs so they won't be blasted in the nape, and Armin got shot a lot. Like,
  why-are-you-still-not-transforming a lot. *OOF* Connie did his job as a
  soldier and took out his friends with total regret... and that's why you can't
  have nice things. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, fair talk, the flying boat is technically
  saved, but not until they get rid of all of them Jeagerists on ground. Or on
  the air, yeah. So we shall see of Floch's fate next week where hopefully, we
  see him in red. See you guys then. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  But seriously, Nishikata, you think your girl is as dumb as you are? Serious
  question though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where looks like we ending the
  school year soon since Love Day is here (#TakagiSanS311), we almost forgot
  that Nishikata is a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> now.
  Yeah. So should we be surprised to see girls fall for this nice dude who
  doesn't know people like him. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways (haha), glad he realized that
  Takagi can't pull such a joke on him because
  <span style="font-size: xx-small;">why would she make herself jealous</span>
  HAHAHA so! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, in a nutshell... I think Takagi is not real. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Wait for it, for I can explain. I mean, Nishikata probably also felt that way
  too at some point to be honest. So yeah, it started with Nishikata seeing
  three boxes in his shoe cabinet, the place where all students have a certain
  slot to put their shoes in. So... yeah. Can't believe we are at this point,
  Nishikata finally got popular, wow, and probably will get Takagi jealous. (I'm
  not referring to the song, no way) (Haha) With the world around them
  prospering even if it's Nakai-kun getting chocolates from his girl, to
  Hamaguchi getting whatever dark chocolate from Hojou making him think he's
  likely not the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/honmei" target="_blank">honmei</a> one lol I
  would to to be honest, gotta say everyone's having a great time even Nishikata
  is leaving his old buddies behind haha. But yeah, it got stuck in his head.
  Like, how popular he has become after the school festival. After all these
  years, he finally had a chance to shine. It was so great, even the girls
  walked into the classroom to find him. It was perfect. The best tease of all
  time to even Takagi. And... it wasn't for him. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> No really, I thought
  I foresee the planning for season four it's going pretty well so far with the
  female
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kouhai" target="_blank">kouhai</a> haha but
  uh... maybe not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What is real though, is literally only Nakai's
  chocolate because we know he's the coolest only second from Shibasaki whoever
  that dude is lmao, Hamaguchi's one was the right one and probably the only one
  to be honest because Hojou is a shy girl in essence unlike Sanae (lol don't
  beat me up) she did try to make chocolates but screwed it up so guess what
  happened dear boy <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>, and Takagi did visit Nishikata's shoe cabinet
  this morning. Hmm... what do you think happened in this part? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Remember how throughout this series we have focused on showdowns and teasing
  all along? What if you found out the truth was otherwise? Would you still be
  able to... give your dear boy your chocolates? I guess unlike Hojou haha,
  Takagi had some problems. And here is where the wholesome part comes in, and
  despite the initial tease lol shout out to all the sardines out there, Takagi
  did do the thing on Valentine's Day: Give his boy some sardines- Okay, give
  his boy some chocolates for real. Yeah, Nishikata, get a grip, THIS is the
  reality, not those younger girls lmao what does it take to be cool amirite?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, great episode, love the twist and appreciate the lack of
  Takagi's tease and increasing Nishikata's imaginations because notice how
  quiet Takagi was thinking of ways to get him to meet with her in private
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>, we also have a hint to what was to end this season. So thanks,
  Hamaguchi; I'm pretty sure Nishikata will confess to Takagi earlier than you.
  HAHAHAHAHA cya guys for that miracle I guess but why is my mind telling me it
  can happen
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Did I mention about how Yuuki Aoi who voiced Hojou was such great
  romance material? Can I talk more about it right now? Like, in this series for
  some reason?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

  In Kitagawa's defence though? Gojou maybe sweating because he has never been
  closer with a girl than ever before, but Kitagawa is just gyrating at the fact
  that she is with the guy she likes so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we
  find out life's mistakes just after we decided on them like how I did last
  night with my order lol that's no joke btw (#KiseKoi11), we see Gojou getting
  excited with another cosplay. This time around, he may have to think twice,
  because besides the nice setting of some devil coming to make sure you sleep
  at night and I totally would instead of being that dude who just can't stop
  writing his novels lol, we, uh... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Where shall I start... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Firstly, if that is not obvious enough, is how much the cosplay will show
  skin. I mean, I don't know how Gojou would be okay with this, but he did say
  yes to it despite Kitagwa mentioning how much it wouldn't fit her size and
  build but yeah not wrong, so they went with it. That's fine, until they wanted
  to find a location for the photo shoot... and ended up in a love hotel. Yeah,
  sorry, Gramps, I'll leave your grandchildren in there in case you want some.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, I meant condoms, we won't be wearing any of those we be putting
  them in our wallets so we can get rich!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (But seriously though,
  that's how women know you rich 'cos you be fuckin') (lmao) So yeah,
  intentional mistake I might add, but coming from Kitagawa she should know she
  would have a great time since the rental is soooo cheap anyways lol, but yeah
  might as well make the most of it. And they did. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They did not
  disappoint haha because despite them trying to do cosplay and technically
  enjoying the luxuries of being in a... hotel room lol with the TV that can
  only watch porn and a bathtub big enough to sit two people... <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> You
  get what I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And also also, Gojou coming up with his imagination
  considering this is a low sketch easy read&nbsp;<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/yonkoma"
    target="_blank"
    >4-panel</a
  >
  manga with little details and he had to come up with something this impressive
  because I wonder why I haven't get laid with such a succubus myself. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Jokes aside, we still have more lol, these two definitely did NOT try to avoid
  all the stuff that couples would do if they were in a love hotel room. Yeah.
  That. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, totally upscaled when guy literally asks girl to be on
  top of him. Like, DUDE. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And as you would expect, everything went
  perfectly because besides the perfect cosplay shot, he also managed to- NOPE.
  NO, NOPE. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't worry that didn't happen or else they can't air this
  on national TV but that bulge, man... I just can't explain man, natural
  instincts? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, thanks for the phone call by the way to tell
  them to get out, but other than that I think they had a great time, and I'm
  still surprised how Gojou hasn't fainted yet with all that blood rushing
  towards his crotch. As expected this guy has great libido- <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys
  for the conclusion next week- HOW DO YOU EVEN CONCLUDE THIS?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Can confirm now how this rose up to be one of the most popular Anime
  series this season because DUDE!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like, that's how you beat
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a> sequels

  This week is kind of a break for me to be honest, but I did try to listen to
  some indie artists, and I am glad to say Audioleaf you have delivered once
  again, for I have found someone to like. That, after that

  which you should absolutely take a look, I ended up with Sans, and besides
  being a video game character's name, it's also... basically just a bunch of
  guys born in the 80s making new music. But I gotta say, it got me, so I
  basically gave

  a listen which released actually this month. Yeah, no joke. And their 2nd EP
  is in production. They really don't have a lot of audience, so man if you like
  their dance pop style be sure to give them a listen. Pity about the song
  length though, like, Cwondo doesn't even make songs this short lol. Moving on,
  I got read bored after giving these which means apart from Sans because the
  rest are real bad haha, I went to Skream and then found out

  is out this week too, so I decided to give it a listen. Problem is, I don't
  know what songs to give since none of them left an impression which no
  surprise, is typical considering their subpar skills in creating songs to
  remember. And I am not joking, Anime is the thing carrying them by the way.
  Anyways, I'll decide on that before the releases next week, I hope.<br />

  <br />So for next week, we have a couple of albums to listen to which will

      >SID's new album</a
    ></b

  which started from them signalling their return back in 2019 and man, will I
  enjoy this even though I know the new music video did not impress. We'll find
  something; I need emotional songs for the Song Awards this year haha. And as I
  listened to the album preview, I will also listen to
  <b>Horie Yui's new album</b> which man I am just glad she is still singing
  dear Hocchan, and I might just give a couple os songs. But my bet is still on
  SID; We know each other too well to be able to give more... I hope the past
  few releases aren't exactly stellar in my opinion lol the album preview isn't
  that good haha<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Man, it's such a good time to just chill to songs every night instead of
  having to bear the burden of watching either livestreams or YouTube videos-
  Kanno Mai's Instagram Live of the month was soooo good~ Haha okay why am I
  deceiving myself here everyone should be doing livestreams every month I will
  be watching them every day. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week then, and we know next
  week is going to be hectic in this blog because my actual birthday present for
  the year is here <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>, so yeah be sure to check back every day as I
  slowly but surely update what I find meaningful in my life right now.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I even doubt myself on that so we shall see haha playing mobile
  games and working does suck the life out of you and I wish someone would take
  care of me just like how those
