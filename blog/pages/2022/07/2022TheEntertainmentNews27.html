COME ON ME WHY YOU NOT LET KOKO-CHAN PHOTOBOOK BE THIS WEEK!!??? Haha I can only
blame myself I guess because besides not putting in payment in the original
store pre-order and then waiting for another day after consolidation to send out
from the forwarding service... I could've done that yesterday to be
honest.&nbsp;
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  But I discovered the wonders of animated wallpapers on desktop and mobile! I
  think that's more important haha I can now just look at bikini clad women on
  my desktop all day- Okay maybe Naobou interview wallpapers are better haha
  I'll get bored of the former in a week to be honest who can win Touyama Nao
  anyways?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, new season of Anime time! So this is basically just testing out the
  mines out there week probably next week too, so apart from Anime "KanoKari"
  and "Shikimori-san" let's hope I can reject the two new originals so I can
  give

  that wasn't in the Anime Preview post I listed last week somehow- Like really
  RC, you don't give a shit about cute girls slice-of-life? Because I do.

  <div>
    Let's get to it then! It's Japan immersion week here I went to Donki
    yesterday and then Anime today! Haha It's kind of like Anime Expo in the US
    of A but who cares about Koga Aoi being there lmao<br />

      </div>
    </blockquote>
    Oh okay the front is just a recap, goes to show how much propaganda is
    already in this series when you learn of all the girls' true characters.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, welcome back to this series with a new episode
    (#KanoKari13) where I almost forgot Chizuru was considering quitting her
    rental girlfriend job. Well it has been nice, girl; We'll let the other two
    pick up the slack. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, let's start from the top. Oh yeah, if you
    forgot how any of these four main girls have ever left any impression on you
    hopefully Sumi-chan too lol, you would've remembered that dear wimp boy
    Kazuya accidentally rented a girlfriend after breaking up with his ex
    Mami-chan, ended up with Chizuru and even showed this fake partner to her
    grandmother (shout out to her, MVP every season lol) which made them
    technically real as of now I guess, but actually Kazuya's current partner is
    Ruka-chan and we all know he's secretly dating, uh, I mean, training
    Sumi-chan to be a independent rental girlfriend. Hey, tell me you remembered
    all this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or if you also forgot that Chizuru is aiming to be a
    stage play actress too. Yeah, that I almost forgot about that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Umi-san too, Kazuya had to bring that male colleague of hers up. So yeah,
    this episode might be short since it's just Kazuya's trip to watch the damn
    play she is acting in and apparently Sumi-chan is here to probably to learn
    from her
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a>, the
    play was great. Chizuru stood out of her role so well, it was the highlight
    of the play itself. Problem is, that one director who was supposedly
    scouting new talent out of this play, is I would say, strapped up in
    relations to be able to give our dear MVP of the play a chance and instead
    chose the main girl of the play since I guess someone s**ked that old man
    d**k or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, ironically though, Kazuya already knew
    what she was thinking even without knowing the truth about the darkness of
    the showbiz industry haha I mean Chizuru what did you expect outside of the
    rental girlfriend industry lol, and that he nailed it at telling her to
    still put in her best to pursue her dreams of being an actress. Which isn't
    wrong, rental girlfriend isn't exactly a great job anyways especially with
    more criticism than ever, but what's the difference, right? It's all acting
    anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Either way, definitely triggered something in Chizuru I
    believe, and that might be the motivation and/or whatever other stuff going
    forward I hope. All in all, it has been refreshing to watch this level of
    drama again or Kazuya idolism or something haha. I recalled what I hate most
    about this series though, on how all the characters can't get into
    themselves apart from Kazuya to be honest maybe my focus has changed since
    the first season, but this really doesn't matter when we have to put
    everyone else into this mess of a hotpot anyways so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you all
    next week where hopefully the series will pick up their pace back and show
    us more... More... I don't know what to expect, more acting? Haha yeah, more
    acting, yes, because everyone's lying anyways lol see you then

    Yeah, if I had to be a criminal just to be erased by cute Anime girls, I
    might as well be one right now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> "I'm perplexed!" SAME DUDE lol
    because in this first episode of an original series I don't quite get
    (#LycoReco01) we have cute Anime girls apparently orphans because cute boys
    can't do this lmao, who are trained as hitmen to get rid of all the
    criminals in the area. So much so, the fictional city of Tokyo in here is
    the best in security on the planet. Yet of course, if you make it this
    clean, problem is we will see even more people who dare to take on the
    authority, and thus this is probably how it will pan out. Politics, I mean.
    If you wonder why this can be so, look no further at Takina-chan's final
    mission before she was kicked out of the DA which sounds like a higher level
    executive force who are involved in more covert operations including this
    maybe "no drugs involved" deal up in the building which will require, and
    this is probably our Joker card for the series, Chisato to help out early in
    the morning. So yeah, that. Not surprising that Takina is the flexible yet
    ruthless character where her actions of firing that MG across the whole last
    stand where the opponents are, probably was a bad idea because according to
    higher ups means their final clue to this supposedly drug lord is gone as
    they need the baddies alive, also risked to kill one of her other teammates
    held hostage, probably got kicked out for all those reasons plus something
    to cover the organization's operation whilst being hacked by someone from
    outside which has his name censored in the credits lol we don't even know
    who Walnut is and you censor the voice behind it AND its credit? Okay,
    Anime, final boss warning I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Other than that, we are also
    quickly introduced with black sniper Mika who probably oversees the café or
    safehouse they work in, and Misaki who is a retiree of the organization and
    literally summed up what this "Lyroris" thing is basically. So in case you
    need a hint the "Recoil" part of this title is probably something biting
    back at the organization, no surprises there. What is surprising though, is
    what they do in this specific outpost in the guise of a café. Uh, not
    killing, for starters. Helping others out though, is Chisato's main duty. No
    guns though, even though I say that when they had to and that's where she
    shows even more proficiency as a killer compared to Takina, noticing minor
    details at the scene like spy drones out of sight to
    <strike>killing</strike> eliminating the opponent by making them unconscious
    and using the super expensive Cleaner services to deal with them instead of
    giving the people involved to the DA. Which is of course no point since
    these guys were probably hired to get rid of a bystander who happened to
    take a selfie with her boyfriend with the background being the drug deal
    earlier and posted it online. Welp, gotta check your surroundings next time
    or screen your photos first before some cute girls come talk to you about
    your recent death threats. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I haven't rejected this
    yet, not completely. I'm not the DA who has to cover my reputation and not
    give this just because I watched an Anime original about girls with guns.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also this is not isekai-themed so we good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Everything else
    seems to be in order though especially the animation with author of "KONOBI"
    series Imiguru-sensei as character design and familiar artists ClariS and
    Sayuri with the theme songs, but I would definitely say my only grime I
    really don't want to see in any Anime series nowadays is guns, but looks
    like non-lethal guns can exist so this might be nicer and more stealth than
    I thought, think "GREAT PRETENDER" but more politics, which is technically
    worse in my opinion. And I like to believe cute Anime girls Chisato and
    Takina here can carry the series for another 3 months so... why not?
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I will watch another 2 episodes though following the three-episode
    rule whenever I heard of this lol, to see if it still can hold up. But
    seeing the end we have a bad guy who blew up some building waltz in to the
    café I can't believe this will be any simpler with this fast pace drama, so
    we shall see.

  <div>
    [TL:DR; I know it's Anzai Chika as main girl but don't you think Chisato
    should sound cuter? Like, waaaaaay cuter?? Just a thought haha this just
    sounds like another

    Haha the main guy Shuu is literally me when my parents ask me about my life.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just that, that was his ex. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this first episode of
    another Anime original by the same damn production studio Aniplex as the
    above by the way (#EngageKiss01) I would like to ask you all a question: Do
    you even need more than TWO women in your life? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For main guy Shuu
    apparently, yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because apart from living off his ex Ayano who he
    supposedly was working under the same company as her until he quit, is now
    then welcomed by Kisara who is a high school student and occasionally comes
    to his place to help him with his independent company? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, it's
    confusing enough, but with levels reasonable to explain within this episode
    though, so hear me out. Firstly, the triangle relationship. If you are here
    for the differences between one guy living off his ex while technically
    dating a high schooler, you've come to the right place. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because
    clearly this relationship exists and maybe even sexually as can be seen by
    Kisara and her need for... I don't want to elaborate haha, somehow along the
    lines the b*tch fighting will happen even if it's just Shuu coming back home
    to let the demon girl smell him out that he was with another woman,
    thankfully just the ex lol. Then again, if you are keen on this, then this
    might be more than enough to let you watch this series I guess, which I
    honestly don't because have you seen the jokes in "Kyokou Suiri"? That's how
    I was able to watch another upcoming season of that mystery folklore trash.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next up, Shuu's "job". Yep, I won't look into the virtual bid this
    much but you should have noticed the somewhat futuristic setting where
    demons lurk around the humans and someone who lost all his money is raging
    in a casino killing humans lol is that even necessary. I'm not so much as so
    annoyed by the bidding process though it just only reminds me of the
    projects at my work and I hate it lmao, but more of how Shuu is just
    hopelessly broke if not for Ayano and her mom which is the head of that very
    company dealing with such demons, taking his low bids as an "entrepreneur"
    and keeping him somewhat alive until now. Yeah, that I assume Kisara here
    can't do much considering she doesn't have much backing and is basically a
    demon but powered by love? Yeah, and this is probably is what pissed me off
    despite the idea of this being real novel and probably unique in
    circumstances. Like, who talks about problems with money in Anime nowadays?
    "KanoKari"?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, there's that. Lastly though, it's the
    contract. Yep, to no surprise to anyone, clearly Kisara is killing demons
    with the power of love and NOT killing everyone in the casino including the
    ex because... yep, you bet something happened. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean, ignoring
    how much I can already call the cops on myself by seeing Shuu making out
    with a minor lmao, it's also that which might be the final draw for the
    series just because this is probably coming back to kill the main guy at
    some point and we can do nothing about it. Maybe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that is
    probably what I am not convinced about. Comparing this to series like
    "Kuroshitsuji" and even "LycoReco" above, we have that absolute power not
    driven by revenge or mystery, but love. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> What level of love that is
    I'm not too sure it's an original series anyways, but that is what I will be
    apprehensive about at the end apparently, probably also why this guy left
    where he was working in anyways, for this girl's powers to show his career
    independence. All in all though, I'll give this another 2 episodes I guess.
    Also, the demon things aren't even talked about by the way, how the cores
    were not even needed to kill the damn thing because it ended up being a
    slash or something. I don't know whether I can be satisfied (not
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> enough,
    get it?) from just watching the triangle relationship and THEN forgetting
    how much I made out with the cutest girl in the series lmao I did say I
    wanted Ayano as my girlfriend in the preview but that's last week bro.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We just have typical action level series story, a poor bloke and
    some relationship thing where I don't even care because they just fought
    about it in this very episode and will do it every episode anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    So yeah, we shall see if this can even carry itself for a while before we
    even talk about antagonists in this series because someone's printing out
    them demons out there, don't ya think? Yeah

    [TL:DR; The romance in this series is like Shuu's dinner: Huge feast tastes
    great but it can't last forever, and you have to deal with cold rack once
    you reach home lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>]

      </div>
    </blockquote>
    You know, Izumi got used to it. But seriously though, would you be used to
    your bad luck? Like, ask gamblers worldwide why they don't quit, dude.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#ShikimoriSan11) where we have more
    flashbacks, well according to the timeline this is full on flashback but not
    like, one year ago where the main couple were together period. Like, way
    before, when Shikimori was in middle school? Yeah haha. Surprisingly though,
    she is NOT cute back then she just looks like Izumi with pink hair lmao, and
    much of her life is still determined by the mother who by the way though?
    Shikimori's mom? Not cool. Not compared to Izumi's. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> And of course the
    brother, mostly influenced by them don't ask where's the dad, she did karate
    as a kid, and wore clothing which might not be cute due to her mother's
    tastes? I mean, when she overcooked a fish and she said it's okay? This
    mother is not cool. Look at my mom and you'll know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah,
    things change around the years that went by, and so do the people around her
    which then the brother kindly reminded her to have some individuality in
    choosing umbrellas- Okay that one who cares I didn't like the Avengers but
    they only have that Thor umbrella in Miniso you can't blame me for just
    buying anything popular lol, but yeah, more like life choices, in a
    nutshell. So just like how I chose to buy voice actress goods all the way
    from Japan and paying all the damn money to international shipping lol we
    gonna have more of that soon hehe, but suffice it to say many things in life
    you have to decide on your own. Which also kinda explains how Micchon
    doesn't have any hobbies even if she does read manga and got recommended a
    book by the classmate which shout out, introduced her to the world of love-
    Okay, world of Anime love because we know real life isn't like this. And
    even more ironically, it really IS NOT as cool as Shikimori would have
    thought growing up, as she screwed up her first impression in front of a
    dude in high school entrance exams trying to pick up the ticket flown RIGHT
    into a tree. Yep, there can only be someone with that level of bad luck
    especially without a gust of wind blowing. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And that's probably how
    their love started. Which is interesting, the least to say. Because if you
    think about it on how shallow their romance is so far (like seriously, at
    where they are now? Normal couples would've made out day and night hehe)
    it's not just because of Izumi's luck or just him not being brave enough as
    his ageless father when he was in middle school and how he got along with
    his mother lol, but also likely because Shikimori herself is not aware of
    how to be the girlfriend in a relationship. I mean, look at her mom.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, we have a real amateur couple right here despite being a
    couple for almost a year, and we can only still envy them after all this
    while because they can go on dates alone now that the festivities has
    concluded and they have some time to themselves. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> So yeah, desperate
    as Izumi as he is... keen on talking to the girl more lol yeah no sex ladies
    and gentlemen, in which they quickly decide on an amusement park with a
    trailer they saw online to please. They&nbsp;gotta go now; Shikimori wants
    the kiss scene, right? Says the director haha fourth wall break. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    All in all, the girl is totally prepared to go on a date with the boy again
    despite not buying anything new while still getting a free lipstick by the
    brother haha hey shout out to the best brother in Anime lol he's cool too
    constantly getting seduced on the streets, so I hope you all are haha I mean
    prepared not like, seduced. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because if the conclusion for this
    series is an amusement park date with a kiss? I'm ready. Totally. Watched
    two kiss scenes this previous season already. We are due two weeks, I'm
    already all stoked up. Haha see you all next week for the series that blew
    away my expectations and more, like, seriously, I want a Shikimori as my
    girl hehe
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; I'm not as cool as Shikimori's brother to see someone who wants a
    certain something and THEN find a way to buy it for them. I can't do that,
    honestly, even if I noticed. I know, I am not cool enough haha also
    pretending to put on lipstick for someone lmao]

    Unlike last week in Klassic Note where I just simp over Scenarioart and damn
    it was great, this week in music is NOT great, so let's talk about what
    ended last month since we're in the new month already so I hope my

    from 2002 sure is rough, mainly because of their initial style resembling
    folklore music, so they sound a lot more coarse and undefined compared to
    their recent albums which had better themes and don't sound like I'm
    listening music from another planet, or song titles long enough to reach
    Pluto or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I will still try to give maybe one song though
    for its uniquely familiar melody if that makes sense?

    which was the one released this week was not great I could even say
    terrible, as most of the melodies did not make much sense or click within
    me, so I'm literally struggling to give the one song which maybe I'll just
    not give to be honest.

    with some dude lol and it isn't bad, it's just her with city pop feels which
    is refreshing considering her generic pop style so it was still worth a
    listen I might just pick up one song I guess. So yeah, as you can see, not
    too much praise this week, which really brought down June as I know of it.
    Well, we got the other Collection Artists doing the carry so we are fine

    P.S. Also this weekend I learnt the power of live wallpapers on desktop and
    Android and boy this "Wallpaper Engine" app can do wonders (desktop is paid

    good seeing girls in underwear any time of the day lmao ah, and Alternative
    Girls because they have perfect loops I can put in repeat that will only
    make me cry the more I see Ookubo Rumi's character smile. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> The past
    is harsh haha
