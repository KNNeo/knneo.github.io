>&nbsp;is joining in on the action. I really wish them the best of recovery
because since I got through it I can't believe any of them won't and don't ask
me how much I want to be by their side considering I've recovered and therefore
am immune and have all the right to take care of my &lt;insert relationship(s)
here&gt;
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Looking back at my old Entertainment News posts though, I feel like I'm
  talking too much about even my own life in these posts so I might as well
  stop, it's not that interesting anyways. Hey, short week next week and the
  next one though! Okay okay let's start I need to forget everything about life
  on a Sunday which isn't much of a convincing statement but my head is aching
  so

      "I should take out the trash" Yeah Kazuya you meant yourself right-
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  "I'll never get used to how cute she is!" Yeah Kazuya, I say that to all the
  voice actresses I know- ANYWAYS haha in this new episode where neighbours
  should just stay as neighbours lol (#KanoKari17) but seriously though why is
  the main guy treating his Anime life as a porno? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, but really, as
  he takes out his... his trash (lol) along with Chizuru if you remember from
  the previous episode is just at the door coming out when Ruka-chan shouted how
  she enjoyed her night with Kazuya lol, clearly misunderstood whatever happened
  at his place anyways, but yeah who cares her birthday is up too so whatever.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of birthdays and that's why it sounds like a great time to
  clear this misunderstanding up really I know Kazuya only thinks about sex with
  &lt;insert any woman's name here&gt; haha but this time around he has to think
  like a man. Maybe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He can't and knows she doesn't have the time for a
  holiday lol so he asked Sumi-chan for help... indirectly haha he literally
  just rented her to slot this into the conversation, what a chad. Hey, if I had
  that much money to spend on women... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the silent girl just
  joined in for some fun, she sure is having a great time, and above all, we can
  see that considering we only saw her two episodes in season one, this time
  around she really looks like a rental girlfriend, with all the appeal and
  everything in between while still staying in her character, which is real cool
  to be honest- I'll rent her. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, as he asks for advice for
  what to buy for her
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a>, not like
  Sumi-chan had any great ideas lol maybe buy a Three Kingdoms book? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  But yeah, she showed the guy to the rooftop performance in a department store
  where Chizuru was performing. Not relevant or whatever but hey Kazuya was
  indeed surprised how she can still stand on stage from whatever happened last
  night lol. Of course no one cared Chizuru is an actress anyways her
  neighbour's one night stand with another woman shouldn't affect her lmao, but
  in the end Sumi-chan was right, it's the thought that matters in any gift.
  Also, whether they will even care, that part too. And I guess she did come out
  on top considering she remembered to ask Kazuya for his birthday hehe I wonder
  what will happen on that day- You also going over to his place to cook turtle
  meat curry rice for him? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, don't ask what the present is
  lol Chizuru only had to laugh and we know Kazuya already won haha, but as much
  as all this goes, I think this is just a great episode to roll in Sumi-chan
  from where we saw her in the first season, so that's good. Other than that, I
  doubt one present will appease the lord that is Ichinose Chizuru haha but come
  on, let's just say we know that he is already forgiven, this idiot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Let's see how far he can take this then lol bro maybe you should move away
  from this apartment haha

  Yeah, siblings go out together. I do go out with my sis but I wouldn't call
  that a date we just wear the stuff from home to go eat dimsum so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But
  this new episode where I can't believe there's a date episode here
  (#TsureKano04) welcome back to the new season of "OsaMake" where we- Wait.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Trust me, there is more than that, hear me out. So it's just an
  aquarium date with the Irido siblings lol seriously though this wouldn't be
  the case if we were talking just half a year ago, but Yume-chan doesn't know
  what's up, and Mizuto doesn't have an intention to tell her that her friend is
  probably about to undress her in the bathroom if we did not keep the front
  door of the house closed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, he's just doing his duty as a
  loving brother so what's wrong, just that this time too, we have to do more
  than just being a brother so that Minami can give up on her possessive friend
  nature to Yume-chan who recently just cemented herself to being the best girl
  in class... I think. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> The sarcasm is still there, they still seem to
  be rather cold to each other at first, and Yume-chan is already almost
  fainting at the sight of this
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> in front
  of her. Not saying she doesn't have any fetishes, but I can't believe it's
  <i>still</i> him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And we are also reminded of their dating days in
  middle school, and now we actually know more, from how it all started with
  Yume-chan I guess that makes sense, to how she is lost in the aquarium right
  now just how she was also lost back on her first date with the dude, did not
  appreciate people coming to find her and just blaming herself for her
  mistakes. Hey, you date someone so you can get lost, girl, what are you
  saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I know everything, girls out there, you don't have to
  correct me. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> But Mizuto is right though, by relieving the boy-girl
  relationship and being siblings, they can still be more honest to each other
  ever more and not have to worry about being together since... you know,
  siblings. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah that also means we can do all the stuff including
  talking about books like two nerds lol they met at a library by the way, to
  holding hands, to even hugging the girl from behind? What madness is this?? Is
  probably what Minami-san would say, and I think she got the point but not
  because the siblings went on a date probably, but you know, Kawanami probably
  brainwashed her about keeping in check her own possessiveness when dealing
  with friends in high school, so to speak. So yeah, free date, good on you,
  Yume-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... the drama level might really be heavy and
  even slow at times, but I think it's fine because as mentioned before
  ultimately, this is written with respect to the girl, and we are all fine
  gentlemen into this fetish, so we good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, the Tomita Miyu
  part is still missing, as I've read the character description, the prospective
  new girlfriend for Mizuto. Hey, I'm just saying, we need some progression haha
  see you then

  Maybe it's just me losing the itch of a slice-of-life Anime series, so I'm
  thankful for this mobile game that didn't die and made this unlike the other
  one I played. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways in this new episode where looks like we doing
  night classes (#Arusuno04), what is with all the new characters lol I think
  you're going the wrong way, girls. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, story. Question: why would
  anyone choose Astronomy over this magical flower session we are about to
  witness? I mean, I did the former in university and it was fun but THIS!
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, about the flower. We don't <i>really</i> know what it is. But it
  looks great at night with the full moon, so apparently the five of them
  submitted requests to have this viewing session of sorts, than actually listen
  to lesson about the stars themselves. Little do they know it's pretty much the
  same thing, but better. No really, headmaster Solow-san is hosting the lesson
  how would you not think this is better? Seriously, such disrespect. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyways, we get a slight glance on Anime-only new girl Figure-san along with
  her buddy who got lost in the school, knowing the location of their Astronomy
  lesson has changed but did not know where to go so I guess we're just dealing
  with idiots now lol, did also get pranked by the five of them hiding by the
  curtains of a room which is supposed to be a shortcut but screwed it up
  despite fulfilling its purpose haha slice-of-life everyone that's half the
  episode. The other half is more interesting of course, where we get to witness
  the mysterious white flowers bloom at the shining of the moon without the
  clouds, and dissipate what looked like stars which probably is just
  aphrodisiac lmao, and made of a wonderful sight. As they still had time to sit
  down and drink tea in the middle of the night because there's always time for
  tea and two scones haha don't ask me how badly the others danced compared to
  Abramelin and Pica-chan, apparently this flower can also be made to tea with
  what looks like a pinch of lemon which turned the tea blue. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'm
  going to sleep haha says Mell-chan too, but it's quite a sight to behold, to
  say the least. Whether it tastes sweeter than normal tea, you might want to
  ask my serving of bubble tea at my table with 50% sugar right now for the
  answers lol. All in all, wonderful episode I really think we might never see
  the antagonists from the series including whoever that is who tried to (I
  assume magically) burn a treasure chest supposedly holding some secret like
  the Coca-cola recipe or something haha, and since it's just a chill and
  relaxed series to watch, I like how they try to make you immerse while also
  doing small things that matter. That's slice-of-life for you I guess. Also
  they are great at time management to fool around before reaching the lesson
  location lol. Yeah I want this to last forever too, Mell-chan, and let's see
  if this peace can hold on to itself for as long as this series can last which
  is about two months lol I can only list MVPs this often and it's not always
  Alberta so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "In the morning, during the day, during lessons, at night, at tea
  time, (together) always..." This series in a nutshell lol there will be no bad

  Wow how can I describe this new episode (#LycoReco05) without telling you
  whatever happened? Haha I mean, we are guiding a semi-dead person so what else
  is new. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, the cafe's new mission is out, and looks like it really
  is from the previous episode where Mika received a call from a potential
  client maybe, and it's about guiding someone important in Japan. Hmm... as I
  continue to think about how I should describe this story so that I won't
  tell&nbsp; you everything haha, let's just say the mission itself it just for
  Chisato and Takina to be bodyguards once again, but instead of a renowned
  hacker, we have someone on a wheelchair who can barely even do anything else
  so don't ask him if he wants a drink, just don't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically we also
  learnt about Chisato and her being somewhat fake too in her own sense mainly
  her heart is just a machine not even a transplant so you can't even hear a
  heartbeat so no more reason to lie on her rack now welp haha hey at least the
  booba exists though I hope those aren't fake lmao, we set off to protect
  this... former large company chairperson who probably is going to die by the
  end of this episode even if I don't tell you what happened next. No really,
  does it look like he has the will to live? Because SAME dude haha ah hey.
  Anyways, they went on shrines, sat on a boat trip which technically reduces
  the chances of discovery and opportunities to strike apart from sniping which
  you know if you have Chisato reflexes one can just dodge on time you idiot
  haha, then found out from the cafe's new intelligence officer Kurumi with her
  drones about an assassin Jin coming in their way. How they know his name is
  not surprising, as Mika mentioned him working with this silent gunman some
  time ago before his current job, and the wheelchair guy... let's just say Jin
  killed his family some time ago. So yeah, even if they caught the assassin
  around with if you can recall Chisato's bullets don't kill but half a dozen of
  them will effectively paralyze you, the girls were then revealed to be tasked
  to kill the man? Hey, that wasn't in the paycheck. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, looks
  like the client is back with a vengeance to make sure he finds out the guy who
  also intends to kill him but also probably hired by someone else who wants
  this dude dead, sought to make sure he cuts off this line because remember how
  I mentioned about how the guy in the wheelchair will die anyways? Guess what
  he's dead so it doesn't matter if the assassin got to him or not, he can just
  deploy another clone. Excuse me, THEY can just deploy another. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> You
  get it now? Man, and that's why this types of series are hard to talk about
  just like when I place my stick in between Chisato's- All in all, I don't
  think the Alan Institute badge on a necklace Chisato wore was attracting this
  client to do all this vengeance thing just because they can and the old man is
  technically a vegetable in hospital proclaimed dead so yeah he's done for
  either way, would then not let any of the guys in the café realize he's just
  remotely controlled all this time. I mean, I don't know we're in a time where
  artificial hearts can work this well and there are hackers better than
  Kurumi-chan here so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Great episode though, still raking in the Twitter
  trending charts, and I hope you enjoyed seeing another Lycoris being killed as
  a mini snuff film series. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let's just talk about how much I want to
  touch some Chisato booba haha who cares about bullet shells in the subway

  P.P.S. My analysis? I like to believe is that someone in the wheelchair guy's
  family (not his family who were killed 20 years ago, but relatives maybe) who
  is holding the leadership in the company now trying to, you know, tidy up some
  strings and thinking this Lycoris thing can help them do it. Boy, did you hire
  the wrong people for this lol should've just hired Takina alone haha ah hey

  Oh we got money for communication equipment now? Nice! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, they
  can't stay poor forever, that's the Bayron City promise, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
  this new episode where we almost lost sexy ex haha (#EngageKiss05), of course
  Kisara would come in to save her. We're trying to hunt this demon down, what
  did you expect? Haha apparently this is at expense of allowing police
  assistance though, which brings us to the heavier focus of the detective
  (goddamn the official website loaded so long to let me know from the URL that
  his name is) Tetsuya where he thought collaborating with Shuu on this case and
  even more specifically on the origins of this case where demons started
  spawning in a city with gun controls, is kind of convincing considering that
  Shuu has always been relying on a certain someone in investigation of his
  family's death this whole time. What we do know now though, is that his
  family's death was because of an initial occurrence of a human becoming a
  demon from the mines where they got the ore, so uh... no one commenting on the
  dangers of exposure to that Orgonium thing? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, relying on this
  detective might be a good idea, and along with Ayano's side we might get
  closer to the truth, because really, it's a true mystery when the only
  survivor of the incident doesn't even know what happened at the incident. For
  the detective though, their trail died down again when they found out how
  complicated the case was for this specific demon and other people involved
  who, not surprising, might have killed off their lead... so yeah, next time
  boss. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As a consequence of the demon's hunt on Ayano because it can
  bounce off reflective surfaces so yeah basically the assassin of the mayor
  illusion powers but reflections so what's the difference between walls and
  this I have no idea, Ayano had to be quarantined and not directly looked at
  lest- We know it's not about the demon haha the mom just had family issues
  with the daughter and Shuu just can't stop imagining her in erotic situations-
  Wait,
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/161283/Kazuya_Kinoshita"

    >wrong guy</a
  >. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, do you even need to imagine when you can just do it-
  *gets punched by Kisara* I'm sorry. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And in case you wondered why this
  then recall the previous episode that the enemy demon was a girlfriend of some
  other human so... you get the idea- We did get the demon because of all this
  shenanigans and deception to her though, just so you know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in
  all... seriously bro I don't have enough middle fingers to point middle
  fingers at you because f**k you, man. Seriously, f**k you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I still
  liked the drama and action in this series though, that's for sure. Sure, they
  might be slow in progression and in dropping more of the situation for you
  considering the other original Anime up there <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Lycoris <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> is doing
  it faster than this, but heck, at least it's making sense to me so I'll take
  this round robin romance deception bullsh*t surrounding Shuu and his forsaken
  promises and memories haha ah hey if he doesn't remember we can make the truth
  however we want and leave the truths to Kisara like how he hasn't
  <strike>kissed anyone</strike>&nbsp;touched a huge rack before in his life-
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> I f**king hate you Shuu haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "If (as a demon) you are going to give away such amazing power to some
  human, then you might as well trash about yourself" This series logic about
  demons in a nutshell but hey, that's more fun, innit?]

  Hmm this week on Klassic Note... well to end the month which literally ends
  today haha what a coincidence too, we conclude July on a bunch of releases
  long-awaited and maybe then we'll talk about what we listen to next month
  which is just filled with Anime theme songs so yeah screw my music tastes lol.
  Anyways, what I do have tastes for though ironically is also related to Anime
  haha with

    ></b
  >
  not being too much on the casual side as they chose to let her play with many
  music styles and also formats so introducing her in Dolby Atmos if you have
  some AirPods lying around haha, still did impress me with songs either
  revealed with current approaches including digital pre-release and with music
  video so I just I like her singing love songs after all. I also took some time
  to listen to

    ></b
  >
  because we had such a good time listening to the one song we might as well hop
  into another and sure I did one day before release and got too into it I just
  ended up listening to the album. Trust me, it's not much to give too, not as
  much as the half a dozen album teaser videos on YouTube in Morse code for some
  reason counting down to the release. But yeah, they are kind of my thing, but
  not really because this is also as much as they can offer in my opinion, but
  I'll be on the lookout. I just listened to

    ></b

  just now and if the genre is not to your tastes I understand it isn't to me
  too haha maybe it's just for the Anime I guess. Last but not least just two
  days later to kickstart my weekend,

  isn't exactly impressive still showcasing the usual styles which I picked but
  also a lot of the styles I didn't like so those aren't going to be in my music
  library. Other than that, I guess I really need the mood to listen to these
  guys considering they are very different from the norm, huh. Oh well next time
  guys haha<br />
  <br />And finally we can talk about new stuff showcased on my Twitter feed
  related to music,

  any more songs I cleared half of his solo music library because he was the

  talks about the process of being in the essence of this series while singing
  her new album title song she going high at the end part though,

  on Saturday and they are all AWESOME!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Thanks, Fuji Rock, I cannot
  ask for more of this, really. Okay maybe I'll ask for the archive of No Buses
  which hopefully will happen soon maybe next week.

  <br />So next week here comes the slew of releases to start the month of
  August with 2 singles and 2 albums, with <b>ClariS' new single</b> for Anime
  "Lycoris Recoil" which no doubt I'll be giving something either way lol they
  are regulars in my café now hehe,

      >CHiCO with HoneyWorks' new single</a

  for Anime "KanoKari" and yes we just listened to her and reviewed it in this
  blog just a couple of months ago so we're keeping this train going I guess,
  <b>GLIM SPANKY's new album</b> which hopefully with the recent live
  performance we have watched live yesterday will help to make this album more
  palatable because their 80s style Rock and melodies aren't exactly bangers all
  the time, and

  which is even less of an impression considering they are veterans and if you
  would recall I ignored them for about 5 years since 2011 and then got back to
  them so take my review of this next week with a pinch of salt, thanks. Haha I
  feel like we're on to a rough start for the month somehow and by the way that
  is not including I almost forgot about my interest towards listening to

    >two of them</a
  >) releasing next week too. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Maybe I not go to work on Wednesday?
  Haha too much backlog<br />
  <br />On a side note: I'm also somewhat stuck with my impression of trio band
  "Hitsuji Bungaku" for quite a while but I can't find the time and/or mood to
  listen to them so it's either tomorrow lol or maybe somewhere this month. I'll
  figure it out, girls. Someday.<br /><br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Well I guess to celebrate Kanno Mai in quarantine I bought the latest magazine
  she was cover girl in!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey China didn't want to give it to me for
  free so I'll buy it for her birthday coming up in two weeks. You're welcome
  Mai-chan and thank goodness for Amazon Kindle amirite?? Haha cya guys then,
  and until next time... I don't know maybe I'll go back to fix some of the
  stuff in this blog so I can target to migrate it (again) maybe next year lol
  I'll see how I can do this I guess<br />
