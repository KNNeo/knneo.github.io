I really wish them the best of recovery because since I got through it I can't believe any of them won't and don't ask me how much I want to be by their side considering I've recovered and therefore am immune and have all the right to take care of my &lt;insert relationship(s) here><div><br></div><div>Looking back at my old Entertainment News posts though, I feel like I'm talking too much about even my own life in these posts so I might as well stop, it's not that interesting anyways. Hey, short week next week and the next one though! Okay okay let's start I need to forget everything about life on a Sunday which isn't much of a convincing statement but my head is aching so</div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanoKari17><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Kanojo, Okarishimasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I should take out the trash" Yeah Kazuya you meant yourself right-</div></blockquote>"I'll never get used to how cute she is!" Yeah Kazuya, I say that to all the voice actresses I know- ANYWAYS haha in this new episode where neighbours should just stay as neighbours lol (#KanoKari17) but seriously though why is the main guy treating his Anime life as a porno? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, but really, as he takes out his... his trash (lol) along with Chizuru if you remember from the previous episode is just at the door coming out when Ruka-chan shouted how she enjoyed her night with Kazuya lol, clearly misunderstood whatever happened at his place anyways, but yeah who cares her birthday is up too so whatever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking of birthdays and that's why it sounds like a great time to clear this misunderstanding up really I know Kazuya only thinks about sex with &lt;insert any woman's name here> haha but this time around he has to think like a man. Maybe. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> He can't and knows she doesn't have the time for a holiday lol so he asked Sumi-chan for help... indirectly haha he literally just rented her to slot this into the conversation, what a chad. Hey, if I had that much money to spend on women... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, the silent girl just joined in for some fun, she sure is having a great time, and above all, we can see that considering we only saw her two episodes in season one, this time around she really looks like a rental girlfriend, with all the appeal and everything in between while still staying in her character, which is real cool to be honest- I'll rent her. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, as he asks for advice for what to buy for her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a>, not like Sumi-chan had any great ideas lol maybe buy a Three Kingdoms book? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, she showed the guy to the rooftop performance in a department store where Chizuru was performing. Not relevant or whatever but hey Kazuya was indeed surprised how she can still stand on stage from whatever happened last night lol. Of course no one cared Chizuru is an actress anyways her neighbour's one night stand with another woman shouldn't affect her lmao, but in the end Sumi-chan was right, it's the thought that matters in any gift. Also, whether they will even care, that part too. And I guess she did come out on top considering she remembered to ask Kazuya for his birthday hehe I wonder what will happen on that day- You also going over to his place to cook turtle meat curry rice for him? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, don't ask what the present is lol Chizuru only had to laugh and we know Kazuya already won haha, but as much as all this goes, I think this is just a great episode to roll in Sumi-chan from where we saw her in the first season, so that's good. Other than that, I doubt one present will appease the lord that is Ichinose Chizuru haha but come on, let's just say we know that he is already forgiven, this idiot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Let's see how far he can take this then lol bro maybe you should move away from this apartment haha</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaBVOBM_b_GvKP3COxoxrUtLy0XVQ8VmxQWA_CD6EjdLBMa-nZ1LOpd6hGTxOcehEtgNwUd476IETdSQDzy8t2m8oY6cWQ9k5YyS5rwNQX8VzZ8uZLb_8-CnWF6vxDdrHU2fPR8QmRLuMYkwNJqcPxWOlO0MkI4r1YGqv_Lta9OddYU-0nz9bESCD6/s1600/kanokari17_bath.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Someday a girl like Sumi-chan will come in and fix my screwed up life haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrjLp9XDsW6sgWR4U-svs90V2SpivUSsRvtWR9phjXMGjii5-vrIjyO5yPkk8ti64JJndDg_Q2YwYgEM8rkXruaIRkc5fBoOS5BectiDfbskawfhJR0OocvMbT8P6nI86qE-bSk0b16i8DiDntCI0QCgCj2Pt3kOdv-eQ1cB1lClwO6e8yO_0H6FyQ/s1600/kanokari17_sigh.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I see girls on the streets lol</table></div></div>P.S.

I do go out with my sis but I wouldn't call that a date we just wear the stuff from home to go eat dimsum so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But this new episode where I can't believe there's a date episode here (#TsureKano04) welcome back to the new season of "OsaMake" where we- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Trust me, there is more than that, hear me out. So it's just an aquarium date with the Irido siblings lol seriously though this wouldn't be the case if we were talking just half a year ago, but Yume-chan doesn't know what's up, and Mizuto doesn't have an intention to tell her that her friend is probably about to undress her in the bathroom if we did not keep the front door of the house closed. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, he's just doing his duty as a loving brother so what's wrong, just that this time too, we have to do more than just being a brother so that Minami can give up on her possessive friend nature to Yume-chan who recently just cemented herself to being the best girl in class... I think. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> The sarcasm is still there, they still seem to be rather cold to each other at first, and Yume-chan is already almost fainting at the sight of this <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> in front of her. Not saying she doesn't have any fetishes, but I can't believe it's <em>still</em> him. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And we are also reminded of their dating days in middle school, and now we actually know more, from how it all started with Yume-chan I guess that makes sense, to how she is lost in the aquarium right now just how she was also lost back on her first date with the dude, did not appreciate people coming to find her and just blaming herself for her mistakes. Hey, you date someone so you can get lost, girl, what are you saying. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I know everything, girls out there, you don't have to correct me. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> But Mizuto is right though, by relieving the boy-girl relationship and being siblings, they can still be more honest to each other ever more and not have to worry about being together since... you know, siblings. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah that also means we can do all the stuff including talking about books like two nerds lol they met at a library by the way, to holding hands, to even hugging the girl from behind? What madness is this?? Is probably what Minami-san would say, and I think she got the point but not because the siblings went on a date probably, but you know, Kawanami probably brainwashed her about keeping in check her own possessiveness when dealing with friends in high school, so to speak. So yeah, free date, good on you, Yume-chan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... the drama level might really be heavy and even slow at times, but I think it's fine because as mentioned before ultimately, this is written with respect to the girl, and we are all fine gentlemen into this fetish, so we good. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, the Tomita Miyu part is still missing, as I've read the character description, the prospective new girlfriend for Mizuto. Hey, I'm just saying, we need some progression haha see you then</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2wZO0ur7bA8uxXmYfGW024CSlUfCWsKpkiWpIr38EfgzszfC-Xbj79EElmvtSwrN0W7KJ0o1Q2eUm5QRbRtTu4iMWsJHua8Opb3d5TDsKDt2He-4i0Ry5O3JYVBtt7ddlxRiEeK4CQQHx7raHSSLEGYmPqN7TcSFH1RUg2asELmZ5MeTnhB6IOrjh/s320/tsurekano04_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Aquarium Tour Highlights - A Series:<br>Is this seal in quite a small container to be in?

Haha Mell-chan how do you sleep with your eyes open</div></blockquote>Maybe it's just me losing the itch of a slice-of-life Anime series, so I'm thankful for this mobile game that didn't die and made this unlike the other one I played. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways in this new episode where looks like we doing night classes (#Arusuno04), what is with all the new characters lol I think you're going the wrong way, girls. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, story. Question: why would anyone choose Astronomy over this magical flower session we are about to witness? I mean, I did the former in university and it was fun but THIS! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, about the flower. We don't <em>really</em> know what it is. But it looks great at night with the full moon, so apparently the five of them submitted requests to have this viewing session of sorts, than actually listen to lesson about the stars themselves. Little do they know it's pretty much the same thing, but better. No really, headmaster Solow-san is hosting the lesson how would you not think this is better? Seriously, such disrespect. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, we get a slight glance on Anime-only new girl Figure-san along with her buddy who got lost in the school, knowing the location of their Astronomy lesson has changed but did not know where to go so I guess we're just dealing with idiots now lol, did also get pranked by the five of them hiding by the curtains of a room which is supposed to be a shortcut but screwed it up despite fulfilling its purpose haha slice-of-life everyone that's half the episode. The other half is more interesting of course, where we get to witness the mysterious white flowers bloom at the shining of the moon without the clouds, and dissipate what looked like stars which probably is just aphrodisiac lmao, and made of a wonderful sight. As they still had time to sit down and drink tea in the middle of the night because there's always time for tea and two scones haha don't ask me how badly the others danced compared to Abramelin and Pica-chan, apparently this flower can also be made to tea with what looks like a pinch of lemon which turned the tea blue. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm going to sleep haha says Mell-chan too, but it's quite a sight to behold, to say the least. Whether it tastes sweeter than normal tea, you might want to ask my serving of bubble tea at my table with 50% sugar right now for the answers lol. All in all, wonderful episode I really think we might never see the antagonists from the series including whoever that is who tried to (I assume magically) burn a treasure chest supposedly holding some secret like the Coca-cola recipe or something haha, and since it's just a chill and relaxed series to watch, I like how they try to make you immerse while also doing small things that matter. That's slice-of-life for you I guess. Also they are great at time management to fool around before reaching the lesson location lol. Yeah I want this to last forever too, Mell-chan, and let's see if this peace can hold on to itself for as long as this series can last which is about two months lol I can only list MVPs this often and it's not always Alberta so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "In the morning, during the day, during lessons, at night, at tea time, (together) always..."

Haha I mean, we are guiding a semi-dead person so what else is new. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, the cafe's new mission is out, and looks like it really is from the previous episode where Mika received a call from a potential client maybe, and it's about guiding someone important in Japan. Hmm... as I continue to think about how I should describe this story so that I won't tell  you everything haha, let's just say the mission itself it just for Chisato and Takina to be bodyguards once again, but instead of a renowned hacker, we have someone on a wheelchair who can barely even do anything else so don't ask him if he wants a drink, just don't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ironically we also learnt about Chisato and her being somewhat fake too in her own sense mainly her heart is just a machine not even a transplant so you can't even hear a heartbeat so no more reason to lie on her rack now welp haha hey at least the booba exists though I hope those aren't fake lmao, we set off to protect this... former large company chairperson who probably is going to die by the end of this episode even if I don't tell you what happened next. No really, does it look like he has the will to live? Because SAME dude haha ah hey. Anyways, they went on shrines, sat on a boat trip which technically reduces the chances of discovery and opportunities to strike apart from sniping which you know if you have Chisato reflexes one can just dodge on time you idiot haha, then found out from the cafe's new intelligence officer Kurumi with her drones about an assassin Jin coming in their way. How they know his name is not surprising, as Mika mentioned him working with this silent gunman some time ago before his current job, and the wheelchair guy... let's just say Jin killed his family some time ago. So yeah, even if they caught the assassin around with if you can recall Chisato's bullets don't kill but half a dozen of them will effectively paralyze you, the girls were then revealed to be tasked to kill the man? Hey, that wasn't in the paycheck. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, looks like the client is back with a vengeance to make sure he finds out the guy who also intends to kill him but also probably hired by someone else who wants this dude dead, sought to make sure he cuts off this line because remember how I mentioned about how the guy in the wheelchair will die anyways? Guess what he's dead so it doesn't matter if the assassin got to him or not, he can just deploy another clone. Excuse me, THEY can just deploy another. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> You get it now? Man, and that's why this types of series are hard to talk about just like when I place my stick in between Chisato's- All in all, I don't think the Alan Institute badge on a necklace Chisato wore was attracting this client to do all this vengeance thing just because they can and the old man is technically a vegetable in hospital proclaimed dead so yeah he's done for either way, would then not let any of the guys in the café realize he's just remotely controlled all this time. I mean, I don't know we're in a time where artificial hearts can work this well and there are hackers better than Kurumi-chan here so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Great episode though, still raking in the Twitter trending charts, and I hope you enjoyed seeing another Lycoris being killed as a mini snuff film series. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Let's just talk about how much I want to touch some Chisato booba haha who cares about bullet shells in the subway</div><div>[TL:DR; Poor Mizuki having to run around with her huge rack and panting and getting assaulted by a perv (lol) and tied in a closet- Action series btw haha]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuJv0MLCjrBxUwZwqihpgy_JhmXzMJpP8LxSq7JeBm3wHC-XygfQFy6_JGG3u8bYofTVtHVO3S019MsCuUhVf4KAD3DUqxxRhYonXm2O2pwlNaYQBApZuWyhzfHN05ezRVzYYmxK5kixFVtv7ey_YNdo3DhUg_mOOAUKkusEpq2pFqH0hrEbAMLShj/s320/lycoreco05_mizuki.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I mean, normally in a porno one would've-<br>(Haha)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3uMqx4aIzyHl9CmaxlBao_bjTuteYhE1T6avDhINUU1WHJv1mWbYKHP5I_YozzcSW6VHLrR-ENI7kN01OUiovpIaN5_epNciknMtnxZBoVoihqXZDy0mdd5K_QvVHIacdUqlXmuwPLJl0a5-QRjecOSpGztkL9JZA_SYklX9JfljlFzIjra-kPEE8/s1600/lycoreco05_mask.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me trying to be nice while being dead inside lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Nice! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, they can't stay poor forever, that's the Bayron City promise, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we almost lost sexy ex haha (#EngageKiss05), of course Kisara would come in to save her. We're trying to hunt this demon down, what did you expect? Haha apparently this is at expense of allowing police assistance though, which brings us to the heavier focus of the detective (goddamn the official website loaded so long to let me know from the URL that his name is) Tetsuya where he thought collaborating with Shuu on this case and even more specifically on the origins of this case where demons started spawning in a city with gun controls, is kind of convincing considering that Shuu has always been relying on a certain someone in investigation of his family's death this whole time. What we do know now though, is that his family's death was because of an initial occurrence of a human becoming a demon from the mines where they got the ore, so uh... no one commenting on the dangers of exposure to that Orgonium thing? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, relying on this detective might be a good idea, and along with Ayano's side we might get closer to the truth, because really, it's a true mystery when the only survivor of the incident doesn't even know what happened at the incident. For the detective though, their trail died down again when they found out how complicated the case was for this specific demon and other people involved who, not surprising, might have killed off their lead... so yeah, next time boss. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As a consequence of the demon's hunt on Ayano because it can bounce off reflective surfaces so yeah basically the assassin of the mayor illusion powers but reflections so what's the difference between walls and this I have no idea, Ayano had to be quarantined and not directly looked at lest- We know it's not about the demon haha the mom just had family issues with the daughter and Shuu just can't stop imagining her in erotic situations- Wait, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/161283/Kazuya_Kinoshita target=_blank>wrong guy</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, do you even need to imagine when you can just do it- *gets punched by Kisara* I'm sorry. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And in case you wondered why this then recall the previous episode that the enemy demon was a girlfriend of some other human so... you get the idea- We did get the demon because of all this shenanigans and deception to her though, just so you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... seriously bro I don't have enough middle fingers to point middle fingers at you because f**k you, man. Seriously, f**k you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I still liked the drama and action in this series though, that's for sure. Sure, they might be slow in progression and in dropping more of the situation for you considering the other original Anime up there <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Lycoris <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> is doing it faster than this, but heck, at least it's making sense to me so I'll take this round robin romance deception bullsh*t surrounding Shuu and his forsaken promises and memories haha ah hey if he doesn't remember we can make the truth however we want and leave the truths to Kisara like how he hasn't <strike>kissed anyone</strike> touched a huge rack before in his life- <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> I f**king hate you Shuu haha</div><div>[TL:DR; "If (as a demon) you are going to give away such amazing power to some human, then you might as well trash about yourself" This series logic about demons in a nutshell but hey, that's more fun, innit?]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCVOZ9CsGhRR-if7Afyoq81LD23OEpvSfXnoC9HHGaDs0LfLflmFyOR62q4tUv6v3d7OYrvUkrug_t9V1vXyySrbfP6Y0OwTLbBTLUdcHwTgrGtc2qHnJ0qLuZt-6kCP2j_LdO8zD44VHIIrmXHHUnNyItbKtKC9XNGvh2arIuSK5K7Sl6wZgjKDEW/s320/engagekiss05_table.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I like how Ayano is hyped up on a drink called "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/seppun target=_blank>seppun</a>" lmao you're the best</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj90lPxzCa7Mg-UHudrpeViKliwvjSs0jrOZ433fa8ui259DD-8FZ-DQq-j9zpewUFoDY44fRszTD3BhGGHYPRhxJ4ldAp3fBlNjiCFGtGkyx1kHdJ-qXtBeUk2AYSjjTzoNh4C3FmfPtICBdYbwzhVIK_PG5ync0VDNfj2Ne6Kdf4OI1yA_jRYCu5J/s320/engagekiss05_sketch.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Haha anyone wants this BL content?

Anyways, what I do have tastes for though ironically is also related to Anime haha with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/apiacere/1632170419?l=en" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's 3rd album</a></b> not being too much on the casual side as they chose to let her play with many music styles and also formats so introducing her in Dolby Atmos if you have some AirPods lying around haha, still did impress me with songs either revealed with current approaches including digital pre-release and with music video so I just I like her singing love songs after all. I also took some time to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/telegraph/1633575349?l=en" target=_blank>Kroi's new album</a></b> because we had such a good time listening to the one song we might as well hop into another and sure I did one day before release and got too into it I just ended up listening to the album. Trust me, it's not much to give too, not as much as the half a dozen album teaser videos on YouTube in Morse code for some reason counting down to the release. But yeah, they are kind of my thing, but not really because this is also as much as they can offer in my opinion, but I'll be on the lookout. I just listened to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hitoshibai-ep/1634722672?l=en" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's new single</a></b> just now and if the genre is not to your tastes I understand it isn't to me too haha maybe it's just for the Anime I guess. Last but not least just two days later to kickstart my weekend, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/spell-bound/1620552653?l=en" target=_blank>Murder by Death's new album</a></b> isn't exactly impressive still showcasing the usual styles which I picked but also a lot of the styles I didn't like so those aren't going to be in my music library. Other than that, I guess I really need the mood to listen to these guys considering they are very different from the norm, huh. Oh well next time guys haha<br><br>And finally we can talk about new stuff showcased on my Twitter feed related to music, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/pg_koushiki/status/1551765957038575616?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>Porno Graffitti released TWO new music videos</a></b> which I assume <a href="https://twitter.com/pg_koushiki/status/1552488765557547014?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>the later one</a> was the topic song to their new album next week, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1552249232509112320?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>miwa's new song is releasing on digital tomorrow</a></b> by the way let's see if it's actually good this time around, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/realsoundjp/status/1552273063924084736?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES new song is releasing on digital</a></b> in two weeks and from the teaser video it looks pretty screw up like their image in the past couple of years which is cool I guess, remind me to give a damn about <b><a href="https://twitter.com/huyuyasumi_/status/1531970858683871232?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>Sasagawa Mao's new song</a></b> released two months ago but also because I didn't have the urge to give him any more songs I cleared half of his solo music library because he was the composer to Natsukawa Shiina's album this year, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1552942001972297728?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>miwa was on INSIDE THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> which is a documentary series which (of course includes the song itself but) talks about the process of being in the essence of this series while singing her new album title song she going high at the end part though, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/honkidance/status/1552942011518713857?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance is releasing a new album end September</a></b> so that's rad let's see how far off the perpendicular they are from me now lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1552999224169865216?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>ClariS new single trailer</a></b> is a meh I can't wait to not care about it when it releases next week, and lastly let's talk about the <b>Fuji Rock Festival livestreams on YouTube</b> and how I missed <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1552876265786720257?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>No Buses</a> at work and watched <a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1553031001562984449?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>SPECIAL OTHERS</a> that night it was a great night and <a href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1553351643973836801?s=20&amp;t=8kIlKTpxchrgyrZYzDTKAw" target=_blank>GLIM SPANKY</a> on Saturday and they are all AWESOME!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Thanks, Fuji Rock, I cannot ask for more of this, really. Okay maybe I'll ask for the archive of No Buses which hopefully will happen soon maybe next week.</div><div><br>So next week here comes the slew of releases to start the month of August with 2 singles and 2 albums, with <b>ClariS' new single</b> for Anime "Lycoris Recoil" which no doubt I'll be giving something either way lol they are regulars in my café now hehe, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%92%E3%83%9F%E3%83%84%E6%81%8B%E3%82%B4%E3%82%B3%E3%83%AD-ep/1629870185?l=en" target=_blank>CHiCO with HoneyWorks' new single</a></b> for Anime "KanoKari" and yes we just listened to her and reviewed it in this blog just a couple of months ago so we're keeping this train going I guess, <b>GLIM SPANKY's new album</b> which hopefully with the recent live performance we have watched live yesterday will help to make this album more palatable because their 80s style Rock and melodies aren't exactly bangers all the time, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%9A%81/1634556196?l=en" target=_blank>Porno Graffitti's new album</a></b> which is even less of an impression considering they are veterans and if you would recall I ignored them for about 5 years since 2011 and then got back to them so take my review of this next week with a pinch of salt, thanks. Haha I feel like we're on to a rough start for the month somehow and by the way that is not including I almost forgot about my interest towards listening to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/abracada-boo-ep/1630860888?l=en" target=_blank>Ishihara Kaori's new singles</a></b> (yes, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%A2%E6%83%B3%E7%9A%84%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AD%E3%83%8B%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB-ep/1630873213?l=en" target=_blank>two of them</a>) releasing next week too. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Maybe I not go to work on Wednesday? Haha too much backlog<br><br>On a side note: I'm also somewhat stuck with my impression of trio band "Hitsuji Bungaku" for quite a while but I can't find the time and/or mood to listen to them so it's either tomorrow lol or maybe somewhere this month. I'll figure it out, girls. Someday.<br><br><br><br><br> Well I guess to celebrate Kanno Mai in quarantine I bought the latest magazine she was cover girl in!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey China didn't want to give it to me for free so I'll buy it for her birthday coming up in two weeks. You're welcome Mai-chan and thank goodness for Amazon Kindle amirite?? Haha cya guys then, and until next time... I don't know maybe I'll go back to fix some of the stuff in this blog so I can target to migrate it (again) maybe next year lol I'll see how I can do this I guess<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. And let's add <a href="https://twitter.com/satosatomi58/status/1553721142535286784?s=20&amp;t=Jrvz50gMkln_Ic9UhGib5g" target=_blank>Satomi-chan</a> to the list!!
