Aw damn is the livestream of Natsukawa Shiina's game-only livestream series such
a joy to watch! She played Fall Guys albeit under a custom server and name, I
just joined one session because I forgot there aren't as many people who will
join as compared to that Twitch streamer with thousands of viewers, and saw her
pass the 2nd round while I lost in that lapped race, you know the one. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
This game sucks haha also this game isn't really meant for such a thing since
watching her play is probably more entertaining than- Also, on my Switch she was
right by me at the first race BUT the avatar showed wrongly, I got screenshots
and the stream to prove it. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Seriously though game why haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay simp mode is over, it's the first stream anyways so only memberships will
  be able to see second half next time AND the extra where she played some
  Stardew Valley which I honestly don't care anymore that game took part of my
  youth away I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Hey Nan-chan, Abigail with the purple hair
  is a gamer just like you xD) (Married her a** though so guess why I like this
  girl right here too hehe) So yeah, that was fun, probably most exciting part
  of this week since I was in bed all day. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let's not talk about it,
  shall we? You saw the postscripts last week... right? Haha ah
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    Let's Anime! Not going to talk about that pharmacy Anime because look at my
    list now and tell me I have more time for Anime. Also good chance to stay
    true to my isekai ban which somehow existed start of this month just because
    it was never there and I have it now HAHAHA hey screw you every Anime that
    deceived kids out there with the perception of alternate worlds lol we have
    one alternate world already and that is the metaverse <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span><br />

    Yes, Kazuya, Chizuru HAD NO CHOICE but to stay at her neighbour's place for
    the night, what of it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, can you be a gentleman for once and
    just get her somewhere to sleep in than, preferably not your bed? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    In this new episode (#KanoKari15) well remember someone lost the key to her
    apartment? Like her neighbour mentioned at some point where she can contact
    someone else but looks like they all aren't available so that's sad, so I
    guess this filthy boy (lol) was her last choice. Not for long though, as I
    would have expected from last week, she would have tried to see if she can
    sneak in through the balcony to her place but looks like it was locked. It
    also looked like she had great butt cheeks and a slim waist, according to
    resident... well resident haha calling him "resident rapist" would be
    overkill considering he would only be doing it to himself lmao, but you get
    the idea. Would I overreact like him though? Place a bimbo in my room and
    we'll find out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Amongst all the misunderstandings though, someone
    appeared at the door. No wins for guessing it right, it was Mami-chan, the
    ex. So for whatever reason she is here for maybe based on season one so
    please go back and find out what is in this unpredictable woman's mind, for
    all she did was open the unlocked door to the lit apartment, saw no one
    (almost no one), and left. Yep. Weird kid, ain't it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What she then
    realized assuming Kazu-kun left without locking his place up, is that some
    woman's bag is in his house floor, long after she left the place. Probably
    more than enough for him to get a court case, but not like Mami-chan was
    going to defend her love rival? Again, this b*tch is weird okay she just
    j-j-j-jealous that someone gotten himself a girl after they broke up. Will
    this ever get settled? You guess is as good as mine. Also, the guess that
    Kazuya THINKS Chizuru might be slightly more into him than ever. Yeah,
    slightly. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... in case you haven't felt that yet, the
    pace of the series tends to be slow, from Mami-chan spending almost 10
    minutes on the door and Chizuru telling us about her family tree which is
    left like, a single branch now lol. And if the author's new work about a
    family of five sisters is any indicator of success, is that these in TV
    drama are going to sell better than the Anime, then be glad this new one
    might just take over the "Hanayome" series in its entirety just because it
    has more intricate storytelling or even just a slower pace of events that a
    general audience would prefer. Not me I won't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Mami-chan
    is here next week, she did not go back to confront him the night before, no,
    so let's see how bad this goes haha we see another glimpse of Ruka-chan
    again why can't they get all the girls together in one episode- Ah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

          >"There is no benefit to gain from befriending me" Wow this guy Mizuto
          just spoke my life out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;</span
        >Also, I rather the girl sitting behind you call me "bro", bro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
        In this new episode where the social circle of these two kids finally
        opened up because what else you gonna talk about in school
        (#TsureKano02), we have new characters appearing. I don't even remember
        who Mizuto befriended haha why must every high school main character
        have a sidekick lmao, but we did get to know who Yume-chan's new
        sidekick is. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She is Minami-san since her given name is hard to
        read even for a female lol, but overall she passed the Anime friend
        test. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She is good at sports, she is the most extroverted person
        we have seen in this series so far, she looks shorter than the girl, she
        doesn't have a rack... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All the goodness on her just that we
        have Yume-chan as best girl here so you're out of luck, girl. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
        Anyways, it's sports tests apparently we aren't far from the first day
        of school so there's that, and of course Minami-san here clears
        everything without much trouble compared to Yume-chan who despite trying
        barely can keep her chest together haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> (Why did they not show
        her chest bouncing around at the short jumps though- How is "Engage
        Kiss" better than this?? lol) She did overexert herself though, and of
        course if you wonder how Mizuto knew of this and caught her at the right
        time before she collapsed, I would like to remind you that they both
        moved under the same roof some time ago and unless we have built-in
        soundproof walls it's good time I share with you the super, super erotic
        sounds that can be heard from his bedroom. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways that'll be
        revenge for later lmao you're welcome Mizuto, and that's how the sister
        got her first friend in school after whatever farce was about her great
        test scores. You know, that "everyone's got a weakness" thing, or else
        how do you even get friends lol. Ah hey, say for yourself, I'm not that
        perfect and I don't have many friends so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, Yume-chan
        then felt unwell and stayed home which is fine since no one knew of her
        but considering we have Minami-san here now she is keen to execute her
        duties as her best friend to appear at her place and make her some food
        to help her recover like any other friend would do- <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I feel
        lonely. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways that doesn't work for guys anyways and
        seriously this series is gross lmao just joking, it's also a time for
        Minami here to question Mizuto's relationship with his newly found
        stepsister. Yeah, as if it's not new. Uh huh, someone found you out
        alright. Time to f**k her in the shower- Not to that extent though,
        since Yume-chan is doing all the bullying again despite her probably
        already over fever at this point and STILL requested to be held hands in
        order to sleep, what a tease haha. All in all, I'm just glad they threw
        in some story about them in middle school to start things off, and thus
        can explain the smaller things that are happening like holding hands to
        sleep lol that's just adorable I can't even, and it only makes me even
        more keen to know about their past. You know, they lovey-dovey past
        which, I would argue, should REALLY be kept secret because I'm afraid if
        you explain them all to me I might just bleed out from all the
        wholesomeness I will be experiencing lol wait is it that really that
        good? Asking for a friend haha we shall find out with another episode I
        guess? I might just be giving this already despite the slower pace I'm
        just into the lore and Yume-chan with a see-through thick skin
        personality that is her chest- D81 by the way, you saw that during the
        tests? Haha see you all then

        "When you see a bug, exterminate it!" Yeah okay Headmaster whatever you
        say lol also you look beautiful so just chill boss <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new
        episode where these girls from the magic academy take bug extermination
        more seriously than our town council lmao (#Arusuno02), looks like we
        have to keep them impurities at hand, shall we? Reminds me of some of
        the very few magical series I've watched in my Anime lifetime <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
        Kannagi, but suffice it to say it is not a small task, as small as the
        bugs might appear to me. According to SunSun's visit (lol I gotta) to
        the headmaster's quarters where we met Solow-san oh boy you look great
        haha, it appears that they may have gotten news, won't say they spotted,
        presence of them black stuff (lol I'm sorry I try to be universal here)
        which needs some magic to you know, get rid of them lest they turn into
        bigger threats to the school. Yeah, there aren't just these girls but
        they are the most important of them all so I guess they have to do it.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, they searched high and low even using ropes and
        climbing walls lol Mell-chan, and all they might have found outdoors
        were wild strawberries waiting to be eaten- Do they not have catering in
        the premises? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They had to pay for their snacks and now this is
        their afternoon snack? Geez, don't tell the ministry how we treating
        cute magical girls in this school. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, SunSun did help
        narrow down the location of the sprite though, and as much as it is
        running around the kitchen from what it looks like,
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ko" target="_blank">Lil</a>' Alberta
        is hiding in the stove waiting to be cooked lol can I also have a
        margherita pizza thanks, and Mell-chan just shouted at the bug so it can
        run all over the damn place to freak pretty much everyone out besides
        Pica-chan who just blew it away using her shield I suppose? Yeah,
        Alberta also had that too or else we might see some undressing going on
        haha ah- Hey, this is a pure series, guys, no more bonks from here on.
        <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> They ended up so far as to intrude other people's quarters I
        assume <strike>Hamlet</strike> Hammit (Dammit lol) is one of them
        seniors here, but as they already knew what was going on so was not
        doing anything about, turns out, if you didn't realize whey magic girls
        can't detect it, it's just a fairy who has been covered in ash, and it
        took SunSun a while to smell that out and clean it up. So false alarm
        everyone, but that was a fun afternoon I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, they got
        some snacks as a reward so it was a good time to kill the clock and
        also, clean up part of the school while they are at it lol. All in
        all... I enjoyed the series. To dismiss this off as just a mobile game
        adaptation of an animation would be so unrefined of me to do so.
        <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Well, we might as well give more chances to this slice of life
        series while we're at it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hopefully we will have some
        confrontation with the supposed antagonists of the series we have seen
        but not known of them much who are all
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> too
        lmao, so I hope for some jokes and so on apart from the inevitable
        fighting we might have to do between these magical girls against these
        dark knights. See you then.
      </div>
      <div>
        [TL:DR; Okay as of Pica-chan's suggestion I might as well call the main
        girl Arsno Arsuno "Tori-san" it's easier haha as expected of best girl
        with the best nicknames for people lol *tehe*]

        Yeah Takina, must be too many old guys at the table, we've all been
        there. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, in this new episode where I guess we're dealing
        with Takina problems haha ah hey someone wants back at the DA
        (#LycoReco03), we finally concluded what was I guess Takina's dismissal
        from the main group. Well, without investigating too much into it, let's
        talk about what happened. Takina is still not hanging about with the
        others if others meant whoever they should be hanging out with in the
        café which includes Kurumi for some reason lol I hope these regulars are
        also people from the organization but who knows, is therefore just
        hanging out with herself still drawn to the prospect that she can get
        herself back into the team. Obviously we all don't think so including
        Chisato who really is trying to get her to socialize because if there is
        one thing we learnt in mystery and/or action shows like these is that
        the more people you know the more you can find out about stuff, like,
        how to get back. Maybe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Chisato had to do to physical
        checkup in order to renew her license (you have licenses?) but obviously
        given her hero status it doesn't matter but she does need that cleanup
        squad lol, so she had to go to the mountains... with Takina apparently,
        with the latter thinking she can convince the commander to get back into
        it. You know, what's the term for when you aren't fired but you are
        downgraded to like, do customer service? Demoted? Yeah. But as soon as
        they reach the quarters where everyone is at, nearly everyone knows how
        to point fingers at the girl who defied orders and the girl who saved
        the world. You know, put two and two together or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
        Watching Chisato hang out with Fuki here doing the drill is interesting
        since clearly we saw the winner, but also she then learnt about from the
        commander Kusunoki herself that the DA was being hacked while that
        operation in Episode 1 was ongoing, thus losing time to send orders. But
        you know, the DA is perfect but not its people, so guess who got laid
        off. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> ANYWAYS, not Takina's fault we know, probably Chisato
        went through this too probably not to this extent, but that's where the
        former does not know what to do about it, thinking that she can only go
        back to her own parents who raised her. And blah blah conflicts happen,
        the replacement of Takina introduced herself with quite an accent but we
        know who is cuter hehe, and they decided to do a showdown against these
        professionals. I mean, I would assume you are a pro once you "graduated"
        from the building, right? It's like an idol thing, once you graduate you
        just earn way more than you do now, with a more flexible schedule and
        things. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, it took a while for Chisato to tell Takina
        that living life is more than listening to orders. But yeah, also poor
        planning and maybe burning out your license or whatever on cleaning
        services but hey, what am I to say. And that's why we call that freedom.
        Although I would argue too in Takina's defence that she doesn't have
        that hero status, so her future is still rather uncertain. What is
        certain though is that she has NOT been abandoned, not really, but
        placed in care at the café where she can tame her behaviour just a bit
        and learn to be with others once in her life. I know, I'm saying big
        words here I don't even hang out with my friends who play board games.
        <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> All in all haha, yeah I will be giving this series. I like the
        drama I see here as much as it pisses me off which means it's working,
        and since Takina-chan here has gotten cuter I'll forgive her smug
        personality till now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Moving on though, I really wonder if
        Kurumi here can give us some insight in her actions towards that drug
        deal back then, since, if you would recall, she did initiate the hack
        haha we shall see then

        The city might have a blackout but you guys just didn't pay the bills.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or you know, pay for candles. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
        where I'm still on the fence (#EngageKiss03), I think we have enough
        info about this series to make a proper bid this time around, trust me.
        <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, story. This time around, we have some demon who just lobs
        itself upon the power plant trying to cut off power for the city, but
        not like Kisara and Shuu needed them lol but you know, for knowledge
        just so you wonder. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course the ignorant mayor is confused at
        all this because seems like his two daughters are the ones (yes the one
        with Oonishi Saori in it lol she is in charge of covering up press media
        haha can she "press" me against the wall please?) who are in charge in
        managing such threats in the city from spies who have eyed on this
        city's resources for a while and its technology in harnessing its
        energy, to how there are heavy gun laws prohibited by other countries
        lest they become the next superpower but who are we joking with this
        dumb dad lol, to how one of them baddies just bred demons on land so
        that they can be a threat to this eden, we don't know too much about it.
        But we do know that they are doing their job, these girls, and not the
        dad who just keeps approving bills and sh*t to pass off this blackout as
        a work of a demon. A bid will no doubt fall upon them too, and Shuu's
        leaks to Ayano through the mother's company will no doubt give them an
        edge on this also of course try to keep him fed too, but you know, just,
        Kisara is watching. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, due to a change in requirements on
        the bid namely that the demon is powered by the ore which fuels this
        city so should be kept in one piece but seriously who cares when it
        managed to leech enough energy to spread open its wings to kill all the
        people that have been dispatched to stop this damn thing. So you know
        the drill, just that with this episode we have learnt something most
        interesting about Shuu's contract with Kisara, NOT the one with Ayano's
        mom lol you think they shared a kiss? Haha ah hey it's not like Shuu
        minded to be with a demon the moment he realized what his objectives
        were which to be honest I don't know of, but the price he has to pay for
        to do so. Just that, instead of being MILF thank goodness we can still
        air this lmao, he just chose to protect his ex by making out with
        another... woman? Girl, let's just say girl. Even though this demon girl
        is probably centuries old- Okay let's not talk about generic Anime
        knowledge and this is why I don't want to give this cr*p. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So
        yeah, noble as is? We aren't even sure now. What Shuu does know though,
        is that he didn't give up his hopes for doing all this from two years
        ago just so he can have bean sprouts on his dining table, that's for
        sure. As with his family though? Who knows how long he can remember them
        if this goes on? All in all... man, I'm just kinda bummed that Shuu
        already forgot the time he had with that woman. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ayano, I mean.
        Those memories looked so good though, I wished I was her boyfriend.
        <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, sad stuff aside, which is probably why I wanted to
        look at this series positively, but so far? They just gave us all of it,
        the kisses to the bangin' body and everything in between. And then they
        dump in the bean sprouts and beautiful memories as if Kisara was a
        Dementor and THEN asked us if we will like this series. I mean, if this
        wasn't supposed to be a slice-of-life romance Anime because f**king
        demons ruined it, I would've said I love... for the romance only to
        happen instead. But since I'm Shuu and
        <strike>forgot</strike> did not know about the many things about this
        world even and how f**ked up this city is in general... I'm good with
        the current ignorance. So yeah, I guess I'll continue on this. For the
        Ayano and the Ayano and the Ayano before I really forgot what she wore
        on their first date. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Now this is just a sad series and I can't
        even <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This series is engaging (get it?) though, I'll give you
        that. As expected of an original lol

        he gave up all his memories of his love with Ayano. So uh... What else

        This might be a dull week considering this isn't much and I really
        didn't go find new songs to listen to, but I could take a smaller one

        which is basically Anime "Takagi-san" themed so no surprises there if I
        want to give any more than the ones I already have thought of giving
        including the opening theme, that insert song for the final episode, and
        the movie... let's just say we will come back to give this release again
        at some point so we shall see about that, I can't watch it with Japan
        cinemas without subtitles lol. Anyways, clearly the winner here will be

        and as much anticipated it is to me as it's also another nostalgic trip
        because of their style is kinda retro, they are innovating to be
        somewhat different but I guess it doesn't make much difference since
        I've been giving songs left and right. Hey, appreciate the effort, yes?
        People be writing songs that have such bad melodies I could use a change
        in pace. And I might just give

        about but let's see how far the single can even take us because I'm
        pretty sure

        will be the focus then if I'm not still stuck with Ohara Yuiko by then
        lol. Anyways, this is not going to be another walk in the park, and I
        hope I can find other things to listen to if I am bored. You know, like,
        Kroi isn't that bad just that I can't give anything from them because
        they aren't that much different compared to Creepy Nuts. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
        Somehow Klassic Note is all mixed up at 15 years I don't even know now
        haha<br />

        If you guys have not noticed, then I'm glad but as with the last part of
        last week's post that no one would have read besides me (as with
        normally anyways I am my own audience) that I have been tested positive
        of whatever fire is on out there, so am just spending days in literal
        fever (not Saturday night fever though) and it might just continue next
        week, so that's fun. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Cya guys then, hopefully next week I will
        have more time to not rest at home lol my pay is in danger haha, and
        until next time I guess hopefully by then I can confirm the list for
        this season's Anime. Damn, five again, huh. Maybe it's just me changing,
        who knows? Without the two Anime originals maybe this would have been
        reasonable, but hey, where is that perfect romance Anime I wanted
        featuring a voice actress who I just follow anyways? I mean, Aizawa Saya
        isn't looking too bad now with "Engage Kiss", eh? Haha see you soon<br />

        P.S. Oh yeah Natsukawa Shiina is announcing on her birthday midnight
        which is in about an hour which I will only update in next week's
        post... if it's relevant. I wonder what it is...?
