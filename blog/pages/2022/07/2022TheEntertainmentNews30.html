Thanks Starbucks, it's not the firsttime I got this and that's why I know to get from them, but uh, probably not asgreat since I'm not sitting with 5 other girls to eat them. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> But the jamis good though! Haha sorry Mell-chan yours is in a jar but mine's in aconvenient tear open packet-<div><br /></div><div>  Anime and music time! I know, I'm kind of burnt out these weeks so hopefully  we can get more packages down the road to make me happier. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Kind of  feels like Koko-chan did not do much to get me but she did do her photobook  museum this weekend and is still a lovely individual though so don't mind my  recent change of taste to whoever Aizawa Saya is haha hey didn't even know she  voiced Chiharu in that "Chio-chan" Anime goddamn if I knew you were swearing  on national television I wouldn't have thought you just recently did the  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/seijinshiki" target="_blank"    >coming of age ceremony</a  >. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm old lmao</div><div><br /></div><div>  So yeah, "Engage Kiss" and everyone else, here, on this week's Entertainment  News. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Oh no, wrong hint. *sniff* Haha does that work? I feel like if  you can smell this blog post you can- Let's move on haha<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KanoKari16">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kanojo, Okarishimasu</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "Seriously? Don't you feel empty inside when you pay (for rental      girlfriend)?" Hell yeah this is the Mami-chan burn lol    </div>  </blockquote>  Yeah, Mami-chan, it was ALL your fault. Haha but then again what you have  changed for Kazuya's life, he would rather be in than be with you...? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>  Kazuya might not agree with me but in this new episode (#KanoKari16) this is  the best episode ever in this series, I'll say it here first. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No  really, if 15 years of watching Anime has led up to this, I'm just glad I took  this path of no return. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, what happened before Ruka-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  Hey, gotta get the ex out of the way first, dude. Ironically though, Mami-chan  went for the "oh we need to talk about what happened in season one" approach  which of course just meant some time ago in narrative, about knowing Chizuru  being a rental girlfriend, and just casually advised him about spending money  on this just to blow off steam. I mean, I would if I had a girlfriend and  broke up with her. Turns out, you need one to do the breakup. *taps brain*  Anyways haha, looks like Mami-chan knows everything here but is just not  sh*tting on him for some reason, so maybe she's just being nice... to herself.  <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> And then, the night over. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not Mami-chan though, we talking  about Kazuya's current now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Well, he just agreed to it anyways not  like he really is into her- And that's why you suck, bro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like the  devil in his head might assume that she is probably so much so willing to do a  couple of rounds with his stick lmao she even brought condoms bro, but yeah  Kazuya is still technically right in that they haven't really spent too much  time to be interested in each other... yet. The girl just doesn't know much  about his idolization of Chizuru and the guy... let's just say he is still  clear on why he isn't into her right now. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't know to be happy  or sad on this one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But seriously though, I am as happy as Ruka-chan  seeing what she planned so meticulously for his boy, from suddenly thinking of  going to his place to cook some potent dinner for him to aggressively staying  over at his place likely foreseeing the typhoon that is to strike the place  lol so no transport is running... it's like things that WOULD happen in a  romcom and that is well planned. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, Ruka-chan, still too  early, my girl. Though I would argue unless Kazuya indicates any interest  (besides sexually lol) in you, you might still be at a dead end on this  relationship. But I would say Kazuya should still do the gentlemanly thing by  satisfying this girl for all she wants... not sexually haha. Besides, she did  close an eye for you to still support Chizuru by renting her for some reason.  Give and take, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And you know, Ruka-chan had to shout it out so I  guess the whole apartment stretch also knew about it already to be honest.  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I can't say this enough, but I despise you, Kinoshita  Kazuya. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hmm... how should I say this? As mentioned at the start, this  is an episode I wanted. Or despised if I'm laid at this point but hey me?  You're not, so this is as close as it gets. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I don't do turtle meat  though so maybe think of something else next time, Ruka-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  Anyways, still most exciting episode ever which didn't make me cry for some  reason I mean can you even cry to Mami-chan lmao, and I hope they keep the  momentum that way... fingers crossed haha ah hey Kazuya if you really want to  touch them boobs you can just sleep with her and touch them dude, no sex.  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> I speak from experience lmao</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQfxJ2PqQe15CTSInkLSgpaiP13I3YQTM25ITcY5qRc6Ssa3qOSbyB9Ki5dWu_0OKJfrc3VmWvxAzo2MpfaDNKtZamtgr1LjsFUZUP0MgsL6XkTjSfmEDLzKbEMycJfmLSgrzWEQWLwt4OEe7Ic5HX9QuAEXWt4KZcnEVoyfQQzpgIzmIBt6tOy5fh/s320/kanokari16_chairs.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Okay animation team can you explain how this works?<br />(Haha yes              the chairs in his row, and the lack of space for Kazuya to fall in              between)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXOS9B3X6e8sbQJpF3YngmIOiAenzHsbbO2WOi9h5AGvrxYOxML5-aLJGD0TUkuDo0Keuus8jspx0azIpV1MGvg2O6hYBU-apcIbWRbMDrm6oM-PHjJzot_VmA4ljhAXEujqO3xOrd6V6yxo--q87d3OOR7YdUhg9EHVWXKBhlVeB-DQzR48O61Nrv/s320/kanokari16_chizuru1.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Eh Amamiya Sora?              <a                href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50346/Yofukashi_no_Uta"                target="_blank"                >Wrong Anime</a              >              haha            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBLjph35A1yFFikbUeFOWt5QKPpOan_4_0-RcKHa74SGXaLX8ZkVa3SxFOgUKB2hubVxu05zNNgSYaYq_6-49je2p62L-4j56CLMh68SxCFtk2n4aSGbunJhHdG8VmvWnel98F8C3vfDViQwlIzjt9C9tZ_4Qz7Q_2d8VyTVsyewnJhtltquwkEt2c/s320/kanokari16_video.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Okay why doesn't this Anime have a TikTok channel so we can get              Naobou to do this<br />(Hehe you all want it, we can get her to              80k likes, no problem)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Mine involves a messaging service on my PC  and a printer. Go figure. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah in this new episode though looks like we  have more lore to talk about (#TsureKano03), let's talk about the underwear  incident. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, all of them have problems, okay? And not like the  parents knew about it anyways haha so about that, we start with Yume-chan's  past. Apparently she is obsessed with Mizuto to be keeping stuff received from  him in middle school and I'm still impressed she kept all of them till date  because isn't that the point of the breakup? Which is why I suggested that  it's the guy who initiated the break and not her but regardless! The brother  also did the same thing somehow with the underwear, both stating that it's  some accident which I guess it is and they both can just explain to their  parents whose underwear are these instead of hiding them and bringing them to  their rooms lol, then treated each other like they violated the rules and did  a minus on each other, with punishments pending to come. Oh well, I mean, what  else is new? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Interesting to hear about Yume-chan lore though, and  yeah, also can't believe Mizuto doesn't have something similar but let's just  assume he's not like, Kazuya or something lol that's a "KanoKari" joke. Moving  on, the sister actually spotted the brother going out with another girl! YES I  can say the j-j-j-jealousy thing!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, don't say this song has  been re-used umpteen times I washed it already so at least it's not  stinky...?&nbsp;lol underwear joke. Jokes aside though, looks like it's not  just Mizuto's tastes that Minami-san who nailed it right lol at least to  Yume-chan I guess, and it appears more than so that she intends to be with the  stepbrother in order to be the stepsister-in-law to Yume-chan? Okay, girl,  relax, we aren't that close anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This is getting complicated and  I like it haha. And looks like our approach after consulting with the friend  who knew of Minami-san, might be for her to die on the idea of associating  herself with this bangin' girl or something by... going out with the sister?  Hey, tell me this isn't an issue already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yume-chan be screaming  already so we are good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, likely to put Mizuto himself between  the two to make that infatuation stop, but who knows if this will make things  better or worse, so we shall see how this goes. It is interesting how this got  me more than I think apart from whatever underwear mismatch beforehand but  looks like we have more problems on our hands and we're dealing with them "<a    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/43007/Osananajimi_ga_Zettai_ni_Makenai_Love_Comedy"    target="_blank"    >OsaMake</a  >" style (no really, basically the same) before we move on to someone who will  actually like Mizuto for who he is which is not yet so we'll leave it as is.  For now, I guess we can enjoy the idea of Minami-san sneaking into the Irido  household and slotting in a fifth chair to be part of the family?? Can someone  lock the door, please? We have an intruder in our hands lol this is kinda  creepy if you think about it we should call the cops haha let's see if  Minami-san will take their bait before that</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjtxrIQLs2rr59rioYPTbbBjtIUp-Uk9iOJfn3n5zSKODcjjcC3-9GnWJ6sEFL9E_6aIh1tt3ep-2gyPD3c3tRia3Y5cErUHiE8kJZcw2J4i0kq7B7spqqr5Orto20hWGZtHmCv71b-TfT3cCQ8Wk1-2C4q3IpcBHA1FqafgM8TjS6-d2fGPyYyZGd/s320/tsurekano03_eraser.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Dude, imagine being THIS happy about an eraser from your              beloved<br />(Haha ask me how I felt during middle school)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHWB3-ZlqqxR2abGIuG2jaVAa1e53P7PJXFmGM7sXqCidPoGSIiM-5gGHuUBsTNsjCUvDL9FoWfcZvogqnp0gCSnq-LEKyHGnwe2RnaxbLjqO8NC_KgTq72eQ43u_Es4X1LqQsvPNdfFMbCjKxua99yWOnPZ79ur_Zi328d7THFXiByihAH4wJ5UD8/s320/tsurekano03_yume6.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I guess poor or lucky teddy bear whichever way you look at it lol            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

"It's all his fault for wearing underwear in the first place!" Well,  guess I have to take it off then lmao Yume-chan how have you descended to this  level lol</div><div>  [I like how they show you the Yume-chan's perspective even though we know both  did the same thing anyways and this is a  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shounen" target="_blank">shounen</a> manga  series? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey]<br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Arusuno03">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Warau Arsnotoria Sun!</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "I don't like the smell of medicine" Well not like you're going to smell      it haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  Oh warning again- I assume this is part of the whatever lore that is in the  adaptation from the mobile game so I'm not going to question too much.  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also what is with that intro it's so quiet I thought my speakers are  broken lol. In this new episode where someone lost her smell haha you can  guess who it is yourself (#Arusuno03), my question to you is: Can there be  such a potent smell that kills you even without you smelling it? I guess so,  assuming you're Arsnotoria in this particular day. And since this is a slice  of life series, you get one episode of it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Turns out it's just her  being down is probably affecting her magical sense of smell, but the journey  to find out how that works and how it has been healed is interesting, so I  guess we can talk about it. Firstly, looks like her favourite food won't work  on her, as decided on the snacks for afternoon tea lol do they just live for  that haha what a life, so that kinda sucks already. Also, probably a huge  waste of  <strike>money</strike> mana considering it's a special order. But hey, at  least it tasted good haha me when I have a flu is also basically not smelling  the stuff I eat so what else is new. Moving on, the girls then thought of  finding shocking smells that'll awaken <strike>Arns</strike> Tori-san's smell  again we should just use that nickname from now on, from durians haha shout  out to D24 season over her in the Southeast Asia region and the not small  Alberta I assume, to smelly plants and where's the Rafflesia, to whatever  Abramelin brought in from the storage with permission from the headmaster...  man all the lengths they did to find back Tori-san's smell did not work,  sadly. And as Pedura the cat has hinted which is probably the wiser answer,  something is affecting her mood so probably happier stuff and smells will make  her better and thus, probably bring back her strong sense of smell. So before  Tori-san went to bed, Abra-san brought her some smell to sleep on haha maybe I  should buy those in local shops too tbh, Pika-chan brought her some chamomile  tea to drink because what is best for sleep then some tea without any taste  lol bear in mind that's flower tea which in general has no much taste compared  to leaf based tea, and it wasn't until they had a pillow fight that triggered  back the smell for Tori-san, and the girls were relieved. Turns out, the smell  of the sun from the blankets and pillows flying around (and the girls'  collective sweat haha ah) did the trick, and our girl is back to normal. Well,  just look at her  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ahoge" target="_blank">ahoge</a> and you'll  know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I still cannot believe they are really not throwing  more action stuff at my face because this is also the deciding episode for the  series for me. Then again, this series has been wonderful despite the simple  storytelling in this case, can't stop serving up antics from within the girls  to the food that looks better than animation than in real life, I can't stop  watching and liking this series to be honest. So yeah, we're in it now, and  let's hope the gentlemen we are going to fight are as nice as everything else  in this series. Hey, they can be antagonists but still be changed by all these  Pentagram girls hehe who is to tell</div><div>[TL:DR; "What if it stank so bad her nose fell off?"

Or  that she doesn't care about anything else besides the "work" she thinks she  lives by haha *pfft* but anyways, Chisato surely doesn't think of it as such  which makes sense, so she brings her new buddy shopping for underwear, amongst  all things, and everything else from new clothes to going to the aquarium and  let's just say all the stuff that makes up for a good afternoon date, yes?  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Again, Takina's the boyfriend in this relationship, ok? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  Anyways, talking to this girl is rough as Chisato tries to wrap her brain into  feminism and what it means to be yourself, as well as also share a bit about  her own objectives in life. Haha I'm talking like a Takina too, what a  surprise. Anyhow, we learnt a lot of stuff from these two, specifically more  of the blonde master herself I guess, about how she fires bullets that are  only good at close range but hurt so much you rather die lol we don't say that  when delivered to you by a cute girl haha, and how she is finding someone who  apparently, surprise, is that Shinji who has been visiting the café as of  late. Looks like though, he's not some bad guy, but he might still be on that  side which is probably the mystery of this series and even Chisato's past in  general with relation to that fallen Tokyo Tower but who knows. Mysteries  aside though, Kurumi is still figuring out the shooting from Episode 1 through  VR of all things so that's cool, but probably didn't figure out where the guns  went which if it's not sold on the black market can only mean export and/or  the government is in this lol hmmmmmm, and also the recent metro explosion and  shooting involving a train with Lycoris girls. Who are probably all dead at  this point so RIP them, Chisato probably figured that out Takina's enthusiasm  on this witness is futile as it has already been done so <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> All in  all... I like how they keep the story going. Giving you the action while still  giving you the character development and jokes and everything in between.  That's probably why it's on Twitter trending every single episode, I guess.  And that's good, they nailed the formula, aren't exclusively on Netflix unlike  "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/40052/Great_Pretender" target="_blank"    >GREAT PRETENDER</a  >" (don't know why I keep referencing this but storytelling style is similar),  it has cute girls... so why not. But seriously though, looks like we have more  bad guys upon us (starring harem master&nbsp;<a    href="https://twitter.com/lycoris_recoil/status/1550858511525232640?s=20&amp;t=aFywZWXDFfphWsSjByB5pQ"    target="_blank"    >Matsuoka</a  >  of all people lol), so back to work again Takina, and maybe, just maybe, we  can do work wearing some cute underwear this time around just to make the  baddies die happy lmao see you then</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinFmxrayGEtFYtjmpJTIG6hjjVYa0pbScNkliOCZiR-DKyzI6jYLii0JpuswE46MSQA9ofEupyi62V8hyTHYyUQP0BO0b2x4zDnxpqfoOn75H5v9oWn_gL0K_vXp5xxrs_cJ7eief15V5apiJ4yjhd36MW-feMllpypl-ywC93479fOZLUzKS8lQgl/s320/lycoreco04_kurumi3.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Like, did we mention there's exposure in this series?<br />(Haha)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhc0xDDAtAnK2XABv7U3vbdwxqe_7Y1kwci4XjK16KhUW9_eUsez0NM-b6xSrJ1_aiiFe3QEfPT1Q76VvY8-lOLmW1g-MAIQzW0QxTN4r11v9H2GDv-j2csfr7nQkX2H4clIFCzLR6f8ojVzKmnpqHGSr3KltrIR4C-IArvVnX8QbGP4Zp65-nShraP/s320/lycoreco04_peek2.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Like, did we though?<br />(Hey this is actual underwear btw, loved              that shame)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Well Ayano you mean to kill      them&nbsp; or to have it with them? Haha ah hey    </div>  </blockquote>  Yeah, Kisara and Shuu are in a mutual <strike>contract</strike> consent, what  of it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we have more truths to tell  apparently (#EngageKiss04), yeah imagine having SCHEDULED power outage just  because your government can't recover the energy source off some demon meant  for powering of the city even though you payed for the bills? That's the  worst! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, not like candlelit dinners need power anyways lol at  least not after you're done with the cooking or we can just have salad haha,  it seems like this episode we have more than just a mystery, so let's talk  about it. This time around, we have mafia problems. Looks like this society is  real screwed up huh, having to deal with mafia who themselves sometimes deal  with demon powers to solve problems because why not heavy weapons are in ban  anyways and they need a new way to kill people. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, looks  like this Toni guy is already dead probably from the girlfriend who is a demon  apparently so that's fun. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We might know more of that soon, so let's  talk about the <i>other</i>  girlfriends who might die next. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, about Ayano. She's hot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  Okay, and that's why they say we leave age out of this, but can't believe  she's into  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shota" target="_blank">little guys</a> so  even though I don't mind the age gap my chances of dating her are zero lol  thank goodness, but also we may have found out at least in surface, that Shuu  broke up with her because he looked more grown up now? Haha definitely not the  reason because we now know he is still bent in finding the demon who killed  his parents, whether it's alive or not we don't really know. Kisara is still  one of if not the strongest demon in the area so unless the killer went into  hiding or have any conscious who knows if his life purpose is still on hold.  What is not on hold though are his memories, and how Kisara decided to reveal  all of it and her contract to the ex, just to straighten things out.  Ironically, both of them are dumb in dealing with the same purpose finding the  one perpetrator through different means lol Ayano just has enough relations  and money and wine to put on the table, and that's why all is in the past  anyways, so Ayano... who knows if Shuu really enjoyed the one time you bought  sexy lingerie for him to see anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, should I be laughing?  Haha anyways, what I can probably laugh on is Mikhail being an idiot trying to  get rid of Shuu if anything, Linfa's crazy alcohol levels lol this might be  reflective of her voice Oonishi Saori's own drinking haha, and Shuu in a  bicycle because he probably stole it in the first place. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all,  this series is kind of in a mess, but it's enjoyable to say the least.  Probably will still be the reason(s) for me to watch this moving on especially  now that the talk about Shuu's past with Ayano effectively ended, and as I  mentioned last week, that Kisara would be happy being his last girlfriend, if  that's what it is. But yeah, also why Shuu is still in this anyways, for who  cares doing everything for that someone you have forgotten? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean,  who am I to say myself, eh? At least he has a girlfriend, past or present.  <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Haha the new demon looks like it knows of some illusion so that'll be  fine to see if Kisara will save the ex if that is what the demon would do</div><div>  [TL:DR; "It's not for foolish passion or for a struggle between unfaithful and  faithful love or for the bloodshed stemming from jealousy..."

So screw you Ohara Yuiko you screwed up Klassic Note real good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  Thank goodness Natsukawa Shiina slapped a release date for her new song or  else I'll be going mad again. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, trends talk aside, we have new  songs to give. So I will not talk about  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%81%8B%E6%84%9B%E8%84%B3-single/1631116697?l=en"      target="_blank"      >Nanawo Akari's new song</a    ></b  >  and  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/with-you/1630743592?i=1630743593&amp;l=en"      target="_blank"      >cluppo's new song</a    ></b  >  because I have little interest in their music careers even though they  represent Anime theme songs in this new season. No really, I even know cluppo  was the vocalist of some girls' band but who really gives a damn? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  Moving on haha,  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%A7%86%E3%81%91%E5%BC%95%E3%81%8D%E3%81%AF%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9-ep/1630934079?l=en"      target="_blank"      >Hanazawa Kana's new single</a    ></b  >  is really a meh as I hesitantly give up on the topic song because I just think  it's not great even not as an Anime theme song but I did give the B-side and  hopefully this combination won't come back to bite me again when I have to  review this single down the line lol. But this is not even close to  disappointing than  <b    ><a      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/glow/1631262270?l=en"      target="_blank"      >Minase Inori's new album</a    ></b  >  because apart from the topic song which really still carries Inorin's singing  powers and managed to keep a mood I can live with, I simply have no interest  in giving all the other new songs on the list just because none of them left  an impression big enough for me to nod. Heck, fuzzy knot last week was more  impressive lol. Also, <b>Rie fu's new album</b> after a month release during  her live event end June has been on  <a    href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/beautiful-boy-side-a-ep/1626770013?l=en"    target="_blank"    >music</a  >  <a    href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/beautiful-boy-side-b-ep/1626772548?l=en"    target="_blank"    >streaming</a  >  services so I finally got around to it, now feels like this hybrid style  between her in 2019 with "PLACES" and all the acoustic melodies and then her  getting high from her digital singles over the years while having her first  child. So, uh... I guess I can give some songs here and there? I always have  the mood for her to be honest, and the above aren't doing that well so I'm not  surprised I rather listen to someone I've listened for more than a decade.  Thanks, Rie-san.<br />  <br />  This week on music on Twitter though I don't think there is much so let's boss  rush through them lol why did I think of that phrase,  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/tweedees_tokyo/status/1548681535708008448?s=20&amp;t=3e7Tu6luPAEiUd1Mt_XcHA"      target="_blank"      >TWEEDEES new song</a    ></b  >  is a collaboration with an Anime apparently and it doesn't sound too bad to be  honest haven't gone around to giving it yet though, as announced and  livestreamed from her new single release event in a zoo of all places yes  penguin lover  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1548892490115469314?s=20&amp;t=3e7Tu6luPAEiUd1Mt_XcHA"      target="_blank"      >Touyama Nao announced a new album</a    ></b  >  due September with a amusement park theme and where have I heard of that  before lol,  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1549711353065066496?s=20&amp;t=3e7Tu6luPAEiUd1Mt_XcHA"      target="_blank"      >SHE'S new live video on YouTube</a    ></b  >  is one of my favourites too due to its two level volume switch and impact if  you get what I mean,  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1550111789693943808?s=20&amp;t=3e7Tu6luPAEiUd1Mt_XcHA"      target="_blank"      >yuiko's new song will be theme song for a video game</a    ></b  >  and honestly saying it isn't all bad but considering no release date in sight  I hesitate to sink in to anything from this just yet,  <a    href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1550797875940048896?s=20&amp;t=3e7Tu6luPAEiUd1Mt_XcHA"    style="font-weight: bold;"    target="_blank"    >Natsukawa Shiina announced a new single</a  >  due end September shortly after the  <a    href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1548683951270551563?s=20&amp;t=3e7Tu6luPAEiUd1Mt_XcHA"    target="_blank"    >release of the topic song itself on her birthday</a  >  which was Monday and seriously it isn't bad reminds me of her 3rd single mood  swings I'm into,  <b    ><a      href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1550797879953989633?s=20&amp;t=3e7Tu6luPAEiUd1Mt_XcHA"      target="_blank"      >ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single will be upcoming September</a    ></b  >  for Anime movie series "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei" but with time travel and you  bet I want to watch the movie more than listen to the song but I don't live in  Japan and they don't do international releases for this- Why haha<br />  <br />So for next week, we have long awaited releases waiting to be listened  to, and I can assure you I have more confidence listening to  <b>Murder by Death's new album</b> compared to  <b>Asakura Momo's new album</b> even though the latter may be releasing two  days earlier because you know, English releases don't follow the Wednesday  release window lol. Anyways, their 1st album isn't them today and I liked  today them so hopefully their new music holds up. I have no comment on how  many songs I can give Mocho, honestly. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Let's see... for the next package(s) I may have to plan out a bit because the  new "Douki-chan" book is not out until end August, and I have found out some  Klassic Note Reviews I missed but I won't be doing posts about them it's to  complete the collection, and I'm testing out a more sustainable way to keep my  bromides. So, just putting sleeves on them in boxes than in albums. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  Yeah, I know, this is going to cost a lot considering the inconsistently of  the sleeves that came with them initially especially when they are none lol  see the previous package review post, I may have to pay a lot to keep these  things so I can burn them up in my grave. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See you guys then haha,  and until next time... hope I'll be fine so I can actually clear whatever  obligations I have and still go to work to endure the air conditioner *cough*  Okay bye I need more sleep already lol</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
