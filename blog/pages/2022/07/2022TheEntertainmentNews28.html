    Wow so you left home at the dead of night because you don't want to date
    someone? BRUH <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, lucky guy this jerk lol, we have a series at
    night setting apparently because in this episode (#YofukashiNoUta01)
    different from the source material from Kotoyama-sensei who I know of him
    doing the "Dagashi Kashi" series, I have only read I think one chapter?
    Yeah, that's as far as I went, and Ten-chan's here to motivate me to watch
    this, so why not? How is it though? Hmm... how should I put it... not
    enough? Let's talk about it a bit and then you tell me. Story goes that Kou
    is some middle schooler (by the way) who doesn't want to sleep at night or
    maybe he can't so I'm not going to talk about how he LITERALLY rejected a
    confession because dude ask me when was my first confession you a**hole lol,
    decided to walk into the streets at the dead of night because freedom, dude.
    And maybe it'll help him forget his school life or something. Ironically, he
    got spotted by some girl Nazuna, who, similar to the drunk dudes at night
    and unlike if there is any police walking around the streets at this time of
    night lol they are probably dozing off at their posts, did not bring him to
    the police but instead, showed him more of the night. I would argue the pace
    of the series is more appreciative of the scenery and talks about how to
    enjoy the night a lot more, so if that isn't your thing then this series may
    never get you, just saying. Moving on, we go to Nazuna's place to, haha
    yeah, sleep with her. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> HELL YEAH lol what is with the lack of chest
    though which is probably one way to make you wonder what happened already at
    this point, for she is no normal human. I mean, is she human? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Even
    without chest it won't be like this- Anyways haha, Nazuna probably believed
    she got away this easily even though Kou is technically just fake sleeping,
    and so she sucked him off. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yep. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of blood of course, not
    coming from his crotch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Please, mosquitos won't aim for- ANYWAYS
    haha I can make the jokes for days, so yada yada she reveals she's a
    vampire, but her purpose is just for survival, so I'm pretty sure she'll
    settle for those drunk dudes if Kou just thought of going home early that
    night. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Kou then got interested in the line of being a vampire
    apparently, and asked on how to be one. The answer: to love a vampire. Which
    is kind of a joke when you realize he doesn't know about love, so why would
    this vampire here at night make you want to- Yes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I
    would like to say the mood of the series is monotonous at best. There are
    some scenes which did get me especially how cool Nazuna looks compared to
    this middle schooler, but that is all. Unless further down the line you tell
    me the other characters (some of which are vampies) are interested in
    copulation... Kou's chances of being a blood-sucking devil might be scarce
    at best. So yeah, maybe I should not watch this after all. Gotta say though,
    this is the best of its own unique genre that we will ever see, so if you
    are keen to enjoy this slow pace at night please do give them and the
    noitamina timeslot your support. It's these shows which they approved that
    brings them to where they are today, allowing very unique series like this
    to exist. Unique enough for me to not like it though, somehow. I'll take the
    theme songs though haha purposely listened to some Creepy Nuts to prepare
    for this but turns out music isn't the obstacle lol
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; Nazuna here is like the devil. But not as devil as the one in
    "Engage Kiss" lmao yeah kissing is better ain't it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

    Yeah, stepdad or stepmom or whatever, you guys sure are lucky for this
    re-marriage because the kids know each other. Very well. Maybe to a sexual
    standpoint already but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I feel like we have a lot of these kinds of
    story about step siblings but in this new series (#TsureKano01) they were
    exes. Yep. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, I know right, they are in high school, dated in
    middle school, and are now step siblings? I haven't even got any of these
    aligned when I reached high school. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, what makes this story
    different? Hmm not much, just that the dare in here is that in order to
    determine who is the elder one which like, they are basically twins at this
    point even born on the same date and time isn't much of a matter too, but
    the condition is that since they... uh... graduated from being lovers?
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Whoever feels awkward from the transition to being siblings loses.
    So like, "Kaguya-sama" but siblings. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But you know, siblings can be
    more intimate than lovers, though. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah? You understand where this
    is going now, eh? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Also, Anime siblings my sis and I no do such
    shit lmao) And that's the premise of this series to be honest. But that
    isn't the only thing about this series as we have learnt, that the guy
    Mizuto is kind of a nerd, has his personal porn stash hell yeah haha, and
    knows the stepsister is kind of reserved unless it's done to achieve
    something, with stuff like her grabbing on to her brother in school, to
    showing off her banging body (goddamn) (haha I know) in front of him out of
    the bath... that kind of reserved. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And on the other hand we have
    Yume-chan who is rather shy, but is a genius to be top in the entrance
    exams, hates the brother's guts but still goes all the way to tease him
    somehow... Now THAT'S character development. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's no wonder the
    parents (Kayanon as mother is DOPE lol we've reached that stage huh) did not
    notice anything even if we shove Yume-chan under the sofa <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> because
    apart from the obvious secret which I hope both of them did not consult
    their parents on because they be busy planning for their separate divorces I
    suppose <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> probably will continue to live on this secret while still
    playing with the game of calling each other by sibling terms and figuring
    out who lost because it's a man's instinct to stare at almost naked women
    and/or having to deal with stupid nonchalant guys on the people around him.
    Haha is that a good enough summary? The school drama on day one definitely
    did not help much I guess, especially when they really want to distance
    themselves from the sibling AND ex-lovers relationship at this point. All in
    all, there's something missing in this story. Yeah, and it's the fact that
    they were dating before. That, we don't have the context, so everything they
    do becomes a mystery. It's weird. This is probably what bugs me the most. I
    appreciate the
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> stuff to
    be honest Yume-chan can be my elder sister where I call her imouto lmao,
    whoever put this song as opening and let DIALOGUE+ sing the theme song needs
    to be fired out of a cannon lol, and if I didn't tell you about chicken
    breasts you wouldn't have bothered to consider that a joke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's a
    real hit and miss though, in my opinion so far. But I'll stay around to
    watch a couple of episodes. Or whenever I get so aroused by Yume-chan's body
    I can't stop ogling it then this might just be it haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Talking about

    Hmm, I do not know how to make of this series. I sat down the other way last
    week thinking of whether I should give this series or not but in this first
    episode (#Arusuno01) I already see the lack of progress I desired. Maybe
    it's because of watching Anime originals? Maybe. But in this magical
    slice-of-life with actually some action to deal with by the way so I'm
    holding back on that for now, we have to talk about the girls in this series
    before we move on to the bad guys. A few things to take note before we talk
    about what this is about in general. Firstly, magic. Yes, this is a rare
    magical series I am picking up, and I think with my experience in "MajoTabi"
    and how pretty much every of these types of shows will have a miracle thing
    happen so I'm not going to wonder too much about those, it looks like we are
    dealing with maybe Harry Potter style stuff I suppose, set in like
    pre-modernized England. That's fine by me though. Next up, is the school.
    These girls are in a school of magic which in particular takes care of
    formality and style known as Pentagrams which I suppose are just magic girls
    who fight but also you know, study magic with elegance so they can heat up
    milk for their tea. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't know what to make of this though, but
    without heavy jokes on every corner this is definitely not your my favourite
    comedy series at hand, I can assure you that. To appreciate this particular
    school with the stuff we all have seen before, it might be harder to digest
    than we think. The scones look great though, gotta say that much. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    Lastly, the girls themselves. I am not going to pick my favourite for now
    even though I already have lmao, but suffice it to say we have a diverse
    cast which is what slice-of-life series do to create a larger audience
    within because we all have our preferences covered, (goddamn with the
    nicknames so I'm referring to official names) from quiet girl Alberta doing
    her own thing being under cover this whole tea time lol (get it, under the
    pillows?), to main main girl with a keen sense of smell Arsnotoria who
    probably had nice smelling hair than I have smelled EVER lol, Mell-chan here
    being the hype girl of the group and totally not a lady by any chance,
    matured girl Abra because she is nothing like the Pokemon especially when
    you look this good haha ah hey, and Pica-chan for best girl just because she
    is also due to be the leader of this group I guess. All is in a day's school
    I suppose for this episode alone, but we are teased at the end about the
    actual lore in this series, so I guess I walked out of this first episode
    with something at least. All in all though? I'm apprehensive. I know the
    slow pace of the series is to set up for future action, but I am also afraid
    the action may not come, or if it does it will kill the pace of this slow
    start of a slice-of-life series I was set in for. Hmm... this is somewhat
    troublesome if I would to say, but I definitely will give some more mana to
    see how this goes next week and smell this out so I can decide for myself if
    I want more girl fight bad guy with magic action down the road. If this is
    lowkey masterpiece then I hope I can actually give it it's so low key Random
    Curiosity didn't even bother talking about it so what gives? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

    Yeah, took us how long to get a confession from Kazuya? Haha I thought we
    did that before. Now we wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I guess we
    go back to renting girlfriend time lol (#KanoKari14), wow I can NOT believe
    this series made me cry again. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Let's talk about it, shall we? Story
    goes previously we saw Chizuru's play but her grandmother didn't (OOF), but
    we know it was good and if you don't agree with Kazuya why are you even
    watching this Anime lol, but suffice it to say that Kazuya is doing his, um,
    satellite supporting role to this girl's life as much as possible? By
    booking so many slots of rental girlfriend? But yeah as they meet Chizuru
    mentioned something which has a point, and it's not like people won't rent
    her she is super popular so not like without this bloke she won't be
    pursuing her dream no more so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, shout out to Ruka-chan
    letting his boyfriend go lmao, and who cares about Mami-chan she needs to
    get over herself at some point, but goddamn this date is still fine. And
    yeah, I guess you can request the rental girlfriend to be herself...? I
    mean, can you even do that? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, you gotta know if she is acting
    or not first, right? What if she isn't? Yeah, like she's ALWAYS real?? What
    gives? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Says Chizuru's grandmother though, as Kazuya literally got
    baited into watching her play baseball after her job ended lol she did it so
    casually, which then also is wait time before visiting the elder at the
    hospital, did not hesitate to explain to her granddaughter's... "boyfriend"
    lol, about what she is in person. Turns out, real spoiled and frail unlike
    her grandma who can joke about dying tomorrow lol please can we not make
    jokes like this again, but yeah, which makes Chizuru a perfect actress. She
    therefore never opens her heart to anyone, and is just lucky that Kazuya
    might be here to change everything. Probably even her virginity too but
    that's for the far future. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Like real, dude, it's all this effort
    and the final sweet bed scene with her is going to be the best in your life-
    Well, probably also first in your life but) Gotta say though, we know that
    we might have taken Chizuru's grandmother too seriously, but in all the act,
    we also have to remember that technically the granddaughter has only seen
    such a person who would care that much about her, and of course through
    circumstances, learnt of how to help her out, so to speak. I don't know how
    to describe it, but yeah, I guess this will no doubt make Kazuya more
    motivated to support this wonderful woman in any way he can. I meant
    Chizuru, sorry, not MILF by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I like the next
    episode drop because the girl dropped (get it?) her key to her own apartment
    and guess who is sleeping with her neighbour tonight. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, you
    can just climb the parapet or something but maybe after Mami-chan comes to
    visit, yes? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I sense great drama action in the next episode so I'm
    excited to see what happens now that we know more about Chizuru hehe see you
    all then
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; I guess the relationship between Kazuya and Chizuru has to reach
    another stage, so I suppose it's now "neighbours" or maybe somewhat good
    friends, eh? Keep it up bro you can marry your best friend hehe]

    Wow why do we have such stereotypes about hackers? Well thank goodness I am
    not I only program stuff I don't care about security. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new
    episode where we embark on another mission (#LycoReco02) and goddamn Chisato
    is so free at home I wish I was her boyfriend lmao, looks like we have a new
    hacker in town. His name is Robota, and just like the Walnut dude we have
    heard of previously who was involved in the operation in Episode 1, looks
    like Walnut paying a lot for his escape out of his current operation centre,
    we shall call it, before it got blown up. I mean, you can sleep and eat in
    there, right? Good enough. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, we will find out how Walnut
    always does the disappearing act so smoothly every single time, because
    under orders the girls were supposed to protect what is a dude driving a
    normal car in a squirrel outfit instead of some handsome guy in a sports car
    which is a shame lol, and changing cars as they try to outwit the pursuers.
    Problem is this Robota guy, very smart, has drones trained on these guys so
    it's impossible to figure out an escape, the car almost got sent into the
    sea which probably won't kill anyone to be honest so we gotta take care of
    the suitcase lest his passport or something goes missing. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, he
    may be a hacker but still gotta stay as a lawful citizen. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
    they hid into an abandoned supermarket which they still got found out, and
    between a bunch of shots and the suitcase getting in the way lmao, the girls
    managed to take the enemies down... which doesn't mean they are dead because
    you know, Chisato doesn't kill she's even cooler than Batman at this point
    lmao, and as they make their escape one of the remaining killers who
    survived then hinted to not walk through the exit they were headed lest they
    get shot... into pieces... by the gang waiting outside for them. So RIP
    squirrel I guess. At this point you may have figured out how someone who has
    infamous of dying so many times should be able to survive this,
    so&nbsp;yeah, as expected, the suitcase is the actual hacker, which probably
    also explains the arrival of our new character in the cafe... Kurumi-san I
    guess? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because remember that Mizuki was covering the escape route
    with a vehicle. She didn't say what vehicle, isn't it? An ambulance counts
    too. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So I hoped you figured this out faster than I did, it was
    definitely fun figuring this out myself beforehand. But that also means that
    Robota is just an idiot who thinks his opponent died. Oh yeah, the rival is
    a "she", by the way, probably not even of legal age but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in
    all... I think I'm in. It has serious "GREAT PRETENDER" vibes of setting up
    scenarios and I liked that but this one may have more lore as that one guy
    Yoshi-san keeps patronizing what he knows is not just a café so... let's see
    how that goes. Maybe they will decide if this is worth watching next week,
    one more episode to the deciding stage I guess.
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; Oh Takina-chan? I know you're concerned but Lycoris are authorized
    to kill, not FORCED to kill. You aren't terrorists, you're like law
    enforcement. You kill when you have no choice to. So stop being a
    psychopath, girl.]

    Hell yeah more making out let's go <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I'm
    pretty sure I can die happy doing <strike>the thing with</strike> an A-class
    demon lmao (#EngageKiss02) we have another case to deal with. This time
    around, without a bid. This time around, they will get paid. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This
    time around, we may get to know a little about Shuu's past. So, story. Shuu
    is still poor, we don't get paid until the end of the following month, so
    now instead of cabbages they are living off bean sprouts. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, this
    is even more ironic when their next mission is to take care of security in
    the mayor's next ball event in which he talks cr*p about people having equal
    opportunity and thriving advancements towards their dreams. I mean, the only
    dreams Kisara has is just sleeping with the main guy and my only dreams are
    having wet dreams thinking of banging Ayano-chan because GODDAMN SHE WORKS
    OUT TOO also this is how you motivate me to go to the gym. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And as
    Shuu struggles through his every day along with Kisara who might have to
    work part time to support both of them yeah the struggle is real, not like
    the mayor's... leftover son (lol) will help to finance their lives and
    unlike the classmates have mentioned is not being abused it's more like a
    self-abuse tbh lmao, it's no wonder these guys would need that 3k in direct
    deposit to maybe get through this month alone- What is with the economics
    jokes in this series? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> But yeah, as you can see, the guys had
    to do it as stealth as possible because you know, cannot ruin the mayor's
    speech, so they dressed up for the ball. Guess who I will compliment first.
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Well that leftover son is here so he can deal with the demon.
    <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, Shuu is just smoking pot all day and getting more from his
    acquaintance that's how he keeps his habits going I guess maybe don't
    actually spend money on those and we can have something better than sprouts
    lol, until he noticed someone was spying on them. Turns out, the demon here
    has wall penetration powers, so it isn't hard for him to sneak in through
    every corner to find an opportunity to stab the mayor from behind. Luckily,
    Kisara caught him red-handed and they proceed to take him down, not until
    the orders changed to having to keep the guy alive though. Suddenly their
    budget increased which I wonder why this can't be credited to Ayano's mom's
    organization because this is unexpected spending anyways so they don't have
    to burn their pay, which then may have been further reduced if not for the
    delivery truck's speedy arrival to take the demon guy out lol what is with
    this Anime logic. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I enjoyed this episode. Which is a
    problem when I said I really want to reject this series in its entirely, but
    they impressed me episode after episode, and now I feel like I should find
    out about Shuu's probable past because who knows how many of his parents the
    government has killed. You know, society amirite, fellas? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> That's
    why you see the reasons for us living now is not because of justice or shit,
    it's more for like Kisara's mouth and Ayano's hips or something else related
    haha see you again for more dress-tearing action
  </div>

    [TL:DR; Gotta say though, production totally nailed Ayano-chan's character
    and voice and everything if not for that other demon b*tch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

    </blockquote>
    Well Izumi won't do anything bad to Shikimori. I mean, I also won't but it
    doesn't hurt to fantasize, right? With a girlfriend and all. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> And
    that's why ladies and gentlemen I'm still single and finding a horny partner
    haha because this final episode of this wonderful series (#ShikimoriSan12)
    we only accept wholesome content, and only wholesome content. Wholesome
    crying included but still has to be wholesome. No bonks, no way. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    Anyways, the amusement park date the couple have long awaited for and I
    guess me too I get to watch more of them being lovey-dovey, it's wholesome.
    Too wholesome, you don't want to know more. But I gotta say it, right? How
    much I liked this? Hehe so here goes. Firstly, we have outfits. Yeah, gotta
    dress up Shikimori because she came in with a coat which is beyond lame
    where's the dress lmao, but end up also didn't wear any fake ears so that's
    a bummer. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, they went to thank goodness it's the Sleeping
    Beauty ride instead of Cinderella I don't want to pay tribute to Kamiya's
    loss here lmao, and we almost got that kiss- Oh yeah, Izumi may have a plan
    here but Shikimori wants some smooching so don't mind as she continues to
    find an opportunity whenever she can, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But serious talk
    though, like, those people around them who got tired of waiting? Legit, try
    talking more with your partner or something, dude. These two talked like
    it's their first date- Hey, it might still be, we don't know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then,
    it's the dinner. I wouldn't consider this bad luck it's very bad arrangement
    on the restaurant's part to be honest, but turns out we got turned up thanks
    to Shikimori's luck because they ended up in a better location I guess? So
    you know, what bad luck? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They had a wonderful time eating and
    probably watching Izumi eating because he is just entertainment tbh, then
    went on to talk about how Shikimori wants to replicate what she saw on that
    commercial video we saw last week. Apparently, not escorting, you idiot.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like, Izumi did figure it out at some point as they sat on the
    gondola alone but you know, he did try to do it I guess. Like, maybe luck is
    even helping him out there turning the lights off, so just turn off your
    smartphone flashlight and kiss already- Do you even know, how much Shikimori
    was worried and concerned about their relationship the whole time? And Izumi
    just single-handedly fixed it with a kiss, but sadly, to the cheek? I mean,
    does mouth to mouth matter anymore? Huh? "Kaguya-sama"? "Aharen-san"?
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because look at this best explanation of intimacy you guys would
    never have done here. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> So yeah, turns out, Izumi is the COOLEST
    character in Anime EVER lol, and as they returned to school well Inuzuka is
    not as great at interrogating his buddy compared to the girls' side, so
    yeah, everyone's kinda hype at some point I guess haha. All in all, I
    applaud this series for making it good as I would have ever expected in a
    romance series despite the slogan of a cool girlfriend and an unlucky chap
    as the dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Because seriously, despite the circumstances, we can
    still make out (get it?) such a wonderful story and scenario and such to
    make you cringe enough but not make you think this is another one of those
    Anime about love, in my opinion. You know how every voice actress has that
    one romance Anime they were main in? Yeah, I'm glad Oonishi Saori even gets
    one for herself, and I can't be thankful enough. I'm SO glad I picked this
    one up to watch despite the heavy schedule last season, I'm dampened by the
    delays, but I'm just happy this turned out better than i thought. And that,
    probably makes this the best amongst those I watched earlier. Thanks
    Oonishi-san, you were a good reason to watch this. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

    So yeah, I did a bit of exploring this week in an attempt to you know, fill
    in the variety in Klassic Note and of course, to find new artists to listen
    to to like, compensate for the disbandment of so many of them so you know,
    might as well.

    which is the only new thing this week is kinda okay, but I think it's just
    me getting used to his pop style that I'm just giving more of the music, so
    that's fine by me I guess. Remember when he used to sing in these? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

    back in 2014 it was that long ago, and it wasn't exactly bad but unless
    you're super into their dancing beats which I'm not really, you might be
    able to give their most popular song of all time which interestingly, I gave
    up after listening to it for a while. Hey guys, don't say I didn't give
    enough attention to you guys because I did give you two more songs than the
    one I already gave for Anime so you're welcome I guess. I also managed to
    listen to
    <b>Anime "Aharen-san no Hakarenai" soundtrack</b> which released last week
    for the one and only character song in the series which is actually not bad
    and it's Inorin singing cute songs so why not.<br />

    in celebration of her 10th anniversary as a voice actress I would say I
    hardly know her and knew her through Oonishi Saori so I'm keen what this
    will be in end September (at least this is not a physical release unlike
    Kayano Ai's one last year), I enjoyed listening to her for the past couple
    of years who why not give

    and is going on a tour with it. Don't know if there will be an actual
    release under this with its own unique songs though, so we shall see about
    that.&nbsp;<br />
    <br />So next week, we have <b>Ohara Yuiko's new mini-album</b> for Anime
    "Takagi-san" so let's hope whatever theme songs they placed for the movie
    was good because I can't watch them in Japan cinemas but otherwise I'll take
    the other songs we have heard from the third season, and
    <b>fuzzy knot's new mini-album</b> because why not I have enjoyed their
    releases so far despite being a combination of members from different bands
    including SID so let's see what else they can offer. I also did some live
    video listening this week too and got interested in
    <b>Kroi's EP from last year</b> if you knew of this R&amp;B group so they
    will be the Suchmos substitute I guess. I also got somewhat hooked into
    Hocchan's voice so went to listen to her radio show which had been airing
    for more than a decade (don't ask) and then noticed the theme song was great
    so my lowest priority for the week will be
    <b>Horie Yui's album from 2003</b>. Yes, she released songs way earlier than
    every single artist mentioned in this very paragraph, just so you know.

    in Japan! Okay, loved your work was watching the Anime back yesterday too so
    this kinda rings a bell to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, you do you, sir. If
    you think the country really needs something to push hopefully for the
    betterment of the art in Japan, go for it. I have a feeling we have
    mentioned this before but whatever, I don't know what to write here too.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you all next week, and until then, I just hope I have more time
    (two days to be honest) to do whatever I want. WHATEVER I WANT- Screw work,
    man. I wished the stuff I like to do which this is one of them can pay. Oh
    well, time to run ads here lmao what haha bye
