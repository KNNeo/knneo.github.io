I really wouldn't have thought that I would be able to continue watching Anime
on Sundays my way ie. this post after whatever happened to my main PC on
Thursday when I couldn't even power it on and sparks are sounding in the power
socket.

<div><span title="*silence*">😐</span></div>

  It was the PSU, yes, thanks for troubleshooting. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I just had to lug
  this damn thing to the service centre to get it fixed. Luckily, instead of 3
  business days they decided to fix it in one Saturday afternoon because it's
  literally just replacing this one thing, and we're good. Had to go down twice
  in one afternoon though; That was a waste of public transport resources- This
  is what they refer to as warranty?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, still better than the
  previous times I had to service computers and they said no lol
</div>

  Okay, talk over, let's Anime and music! Legit thought of significantly
  reducing this write-up IF yesterday's case were to take 3 days. Of course,
  this isn't as important compared to what will be on my phone wallpaper next
  week- I HAVEN'T EVEN PLANNED IT YET!! Haha don't worry I actually did and
  including the birthdays next week we'll talk about them by then<br />

      matter...? Yeah Japan huh haha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Just, imagine making out this desperately with Touyama Nao. I want you to
  picture it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay we don't have that in real life so yeah, Ruka-chan!!
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode (#KanoKari22) where yes thanks for asking because
  doing
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> stuff
  behind peoples' backs is
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/saikou" target="_blank">THE BEST</a> haha
  okay me. Also, that's how you prove animation is trash because that voice
  acting though...!!! Haha we can't talk about this all day, so let's move on.
  Literally though, for this episode? Again, I probably mentioned this last
  week, Kazuya letting the family know who's his actual girlfriend right now
  would solve pretty much everything. But instead of that, we are till date
  still stuck in the limbo area of the illusion that Kazuya is dating Chizuru.
  Firstly, for Ruka-chan. She's desperate. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, I can only say
  this much though, that you can only get his heart, and it's just not working
  out for you. Not that Kazuya is not woke about it, but it's definitely not
  working out. Even then though, and if just literally getting the guy to have
  babies with you (lmao) I don't think will change his mind. But not like he's
  not aware about it though, letting this illusion stay as is. Then, there's the
  elderly. Both their grandmothers are still under the reality thinking that
  their next generation are hanging out well and thus can continue the family
  line for the better. For the better even, this just sounds like too good of a
  reality that Kazuya's grandmother would rather give out her family heirloom
  which is a ring apparently haha of all things, to this prospective
  granddaughter-in-law. She won't be, spoiler alert haha I don't know to be
  honest, but even then, because she reached the same idolism level as Kazuya is
  with this beautiful woman, one cannot help but give all of themselves to them,
  as if this will be the only opportunity upon them. Not wrong though, even
  grandma Sayuri rather just let her granddaughter go hang out with the future
  in-law to make this reality happen. Last but not least, for Chizuru. Remember
  this was about just rental girlfriend and how she was accidentally introduced
  to the family of Kazuya as a real one? Yeah, looks like as of now, Chizuru is
  changing her mind about this. Of course, it's for the grandmother we will only
  get this
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a
  >&nbsp;woman to look back at this jerk 20 more seasons from now lmao, so now
  it's just total white lie territory, as much as the guy wants to back out for
  the sake of everyone. Again, the sadness gotta happen once, right? Whenever it
  is. It's just too big of a lie that Chizuru rather keep it to her elderly till
  her grave, and maybe then she won't come back with vengeance to haunt her kids
  about how the family line was not cemented in place before her departure. Not
  gonna elaborate on this part, but you get the idea. All in all, the monologues
  are real long, the kissing scene is the best though kiss long enough and we
  might get Kazuya to spill the beans faster haha I mean they can tell everyone
  apart from grandma Sayuri... right?? Well someone's gonna screw up the secret
  but that's not on him. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, I'm gonna go back to make out with
  Ruka-chan if you don't mind so don't ponder too much about the future, yes?
  Alright lol

  <a

    target="_blank"
    >heart transplant</a
  >
  we just have re-marriage of their parents. Nothing wrong with that. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  We get to know more about how this all happened though, in basically what was
  another flashback episode- Hey, they can only do flashbacks, okay? They can't
  be together now there is no return. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, looks like we finally
  reached the conclusion of how their breakup came about. And if I should
  summarize this? I would say it didn't end because of them not having any love
  for each other as with previous episode can easily disprove this, but that
  they have grown up. In their final year of middle school where they were
  having a time of their life, firstly, they were in different classes. Maybe
  Yume-chan was right about being in the same class having its benefits, because
  you know, if she did make any new friends and spent more time with them thus
  may~be neglecting the maybe boyfriend? Haha, at least he would've known, and
  just joined in on the fun. And this would've been a different story. Okay, it
  won't, they may have to keep mum about their relationship, but that's not why
  we are here for, is it? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But maybe Mizuto was also right about his
  own actions which he regretted on, from not accepting of her newly made
  friends and maybe end up with a harem such that he can piss Yume-chan off so
  much they break up earlier? Haha ah hey. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, maybe this
  segregation in the first place was a bad idea. And then my argument is of
  course of all misunderstandings, they were not as grown up. So a girl sitting
  beside Mizuto in the library means cheating on her, and making things up but
  not holding her hands again even after the apology. Something's already odd
  here so I don't think I want to explain it to you too clear. So at the
  graduation ceremony, they did the fastest of breakups in Anime history lol not
  that I've experienced much of these to be honest haha, and walked their own
  ways... only to be dragged back into the reality where their parents love each
  other. I KNOW RIGHT DAD WHAT THE F- All in all... And that's why you shouldn't
  have friends. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, just have a boyfriend or girlfriend like a real
  normie. Everything else, not important. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But of course, they can
  regret as much as they want of the past, but I would say though, that the love
  between them has not ceased, and maybe, just maybe the sibling relationship
  will make this less of a joke moving on. For now though, I'm just glad they
  can still mock on each other on a daily basis even though we know they both
  lost. Lost big time. Haha let's see how much more they can screw up next week
  oh Yume-chan call Mizuto "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/oniichan"
    target="_blank"
    >onii-chan</a
  >" and only then you can touch the books on the shelf lol <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> We still
  playing this huh

  Yes, it snows also in... I forgot the name <strike>Arsham</strike> Ashram?
  Yeah, flying castle still subject to gravity, dude. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So, in the
  winter episode of this wonderful series where I mean you can guess what is up
  next (#Arusuno09), it's snowing outside what else are we going to do? Go for
  lessons? *Pft* Haha ah hey, I mean, Solow is probably right as Headmaster to
  do things like this as in, let everyone play with snow for the day seeing that
  it hardly snows in this magical school apparently once in a century, and
  Hammit-san isn't disapproving of it so screw that PUSH PERDURA THE CAT INTO
  THE SNOW and let's have some fun! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We did go from having a lot of fun
  just playing with snow to like, building igloos and slides though haha wtf, so
  yeah, stop thinking about the other girls who were introduced into the Anime
  because I really don't care lol, let's talk about the Select's adventure to
  get some real gold. Gold as in the finest snow that no one has trampled on
  haha, so not the ones in the courtyard of course, not the ones Paulina has
  landed in falling from the library tower and only being discovered after a
  while because she is so far up the deep layer of snow it'll take fairies to
  dig her out. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But the girls wanted some clean snow to have some
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kakigoori" target="_blank">shaved ice</a>
  in (well Mell-chan wanted it lol), so they thought the highest point of the
  school would be a wise choice. They weren't wrong, they probably didn't have
  to go that high up to get it considering only they appeared in such places if
  it wasn't Paulina's minions who looked around for help for her initially haha,
  would they still be stuck in the snow following a pending storm calling upon
  all students to go back to their dorms just because. It didn't take long for
  everyone to be called inside thanks to the fairies who acted as the relay
  system haha they are the best, but what was even better about the fairies is
  that bunch who were digging up snow and spotted the Selects up the highest
  point in school. They dug up a hole for them to avoid the winds, gave them tea
  and snacks to chew on so goddamn even in danger they can have afternoon tea
  lmao, and Paulina did eventually get to them before Death does, I guess. All
  in all, I think I need to remind myself to watch more slice-of-life series.
  It's a genre I've learnt to adore, and I wonder how much of this I would have
  missed if not for finding out who voiced Pica-chan in the first place. But
  none of them are quite like this series, where they forego all the action in
  the video game it's based on, and just give you some wholesome school life
  content without much frill or weird
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a> content
  I'll have to live with. I mean, this is technically in another world but we
  are close to London so I guess not? Haha you can't prove me wrong there is no
  isekai in the title. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Everyone had a part in each episode, it just
  warms the heart to watch this and not have to think of the craziness happening
  with the other shows I'm watching this season. Such peace, I'll only have that
  many weeks left to enjoy. See you again for more.

  Ah, bad news is upon us. LycoReco is closing down. Damn. I haven't even had
  anything from there yet. I mean, Japan just opened their borders and I can't
  already? What a disappointment. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where all great
  things must come to an end (#LycoReco10), yes we talking about the café first.
  Now THIS is called plot progression. "Engage Kiss", learn a thing or two,
  would ya? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, instead of sh*tting on another Anime coincidentally
  aligned with this masterpiece at this point lol, let's talk about what this
  has done correct. Firstly, about the reveal. I'll start with a question: At
  what point of this episode did you confirm your suspicions of Majima being one
  of the Alan Institute children? Hm? If it was when he was talking to
  Yoshi-san, and you didn't need more reasons to know why, you are spot-on. It
  also didn't take long for Mika-san to actually have to tell the real story to
  Chisato, how he was in charge of Chisato as a kid Lycoris, how he sought to
  prolong her life and power through the Alan Institute and thus the help from
  Yoshi-san, and how Chisato's life so far has been dictated by not just the DA,
  but the two dads she loved and treasured the most so far. Was it wrong to not
  be in her choice though? In her defence, she then talked about the stuff she
  did afterwards having this hideout of a café and people to hang out with as
  she sees the many regulars walk in on the day they posted a notice about its
  closure, still could not compare to what started it all: giving Chisato life.
  As I mentioned before, all of this could have ended years ago, and maybe
  Majima would have really made a mess long time before now. But guess who we
  got as backup. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next up, what happens to the superior power in an
  emergency. As much as the DA tries to get Majima and his gang they barely did
  but not to definitive success of course, but that doesn't stop them to control
  Majima as much as possible even without a hacker on their side. Well, not like
  Kurumi is going to entertain any number of them she is in Germany by now
  playing board games so yay? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, maybe that's the upside the
  baddies have on the DA, Robota is technically the best in Japan now. And I
  guess we really have no choice but to "deploy" Chisato now just so the DA can
  assure its mission of not spilling the beans about this fictional Japan's
  peace. Last but not least, to let Chisato come to a conclusion. Of course,
  don't expect her to fulfil her duty to help the DA at any point haha she will
  anyways, but she WILL definitely save Yoshi-san tied to a bomb first. And
  that's why you don't kidnap their closest kin; Their family will be sure to
  hunt you down. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I know right, what are they thinking anyways. All in
  all, I'm still surprised why this backstory doesn't involve a politician who
  is just mad right now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay maybe it's that boss of Kusunoki but- Too
  real, huh. Let's come back to this original Anime. I would say with such plot
  development and seeing how like, figureheads drop in to converse with one
  another I mean you should've noticed Kusunoki convincing this terrorist to
  think otherwise is also a cover for tracking their physical location which in
  case you don't know is super f**king hard today lol also we don't have Walnut,
  it just feels more like an action series to me, seeing the levels of the onion
  peel off as we see more panic reside. Japan will be fine with knowing that
  they have been protected so far, but more importantly, we just hope the local
  law enforcement can be careful in pulling out their guns to kill, just like
  Chisato I'm pretty sure she will with the baddies soon. See you for the heated
  action then.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; You know why they have removed Kurumi and Mizuki out of this equation,
  right? One's a hacker who could not help anyone anyways because they are dead,
  and the other would be too distracting I would mistake this as "Engage Kiss"-]

  Ah yeah, in case you wondered where Kanna-san is... I guess the intro is clear
  enough. Man, legit thought Kisara would do real well as Shuu's sister but
  *welp* Haha in this new episode where we proceed towards the final part of
  this demon hunting I assume (#EngageKiss10), like seriously man, everyone who
  talks to Shuu nos I get pissed, I can't explain why. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay okay
  ignoring that, we got a mystery to solve. Oh we did that last week? But this
  will redeem itself, trust me. Let's wrap this up so we can go to the final
  battle. Hey, Shuu said it's final with his weak memories, it's gotta be.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, plot talk. Uh... it's complete now? But yeah, still, with like,
  now I think I know why Mikhail is the centre of representation of the
  government along with Linfa who helped out with Ayano in figuring out the
  location of Kanna-san who is apparently alive and probably Shuu's sister I
  guess it did come from the same father. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Anyways, the idea is that
  the father mayor is useless, and the grandfather when he was mayor did some
  terrible things to protect this City from the demon threat that is Asmodeus.
  But looks like, even if this mission isn't to save the sister... stepsister
  lol
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/49470/Mamahaha_no_Tsurego_ga_Motokano_datta"
    target="_blank"
    >not ex though</a
  >
  <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, it is probably still to stop all this by eliminating this final
  threat... or are we even able to? As Sharon has described considering she's
  the only one with the history books haha she doesn't hold anything else though
  especially chastity lmao ok please focus, it looks like we are just dealing a
  rebirth of a demon in disguise that has been around for... well, since
  forever, and Shuu's dad did do something to ensure that demon entity who has
  been possessing his wife for a while, cannot continue to exist in this world.
  It did disappear, but what was left was the problem. So as you can see, we
  have basically two factions of people right now even if they are going to
  fight in front of the mine which was buried deep in the ocean haha, people who
  want to not approach the demon so that it would not be awakened and thus
  summon demons into the world to you know, destroy all humans haha come on
  Sharon you think coexistence can be a thing? And people who want to save
  Kanna-san. So not the demon inside her. And with that, I guess Shuu might
  actually have to lose all of his memories to power up Kisara to do this...?
  All in all though, and I guess we have a clearer picture right now of what is
  happening from the two factions at this point even AAA was suspected to side
  with Shuu's side of saving the kid, still could not do anything because didn't
  a demon and human fight right in front of the demon entity to wake it up? I
  mean, what are we to do now? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, might as well take it down I
  guess, and maybe save Kanna-san in the process. You think Shuu has enough
  memories to communicate some sense into the not sister? I don't know man, it's
  all in a mess I would someone would stick a demon spear into me lol oh Shuu's
  dad what have you not done to make sure history doesn't repeat itself
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "A world where human and demons are hand in hand, living together in
  harmony" I mean, isn't Kisara and Shuu the perfect example though? Hmmmm hey
  even more so if you count Hanamura Junya and his demon partner, was it? Yeah
  but they died though lmao <span title="*shrugs*">🤷</span> Maybe the conclusion of this Anime is the
  start to this vision, for better or for worse]

  which I intend to review the mini-album next month, and man, RIRIKO-sensei at
  it again, if you don't get it go read the Klassic Note Review and you'll
  understand, she wrote for one of her singles for Anime "MajoTabi" too.
  Definitely a different feel though, don't know if it'll stick by the time I
  have to come around to it to be honest.<br />
  <br />So next week, we getting rid of <b>harmoe's new single</b> out of the
  way because they are an obligation after I rejected DIALOGUE+ and I still have
  a hard rule of giving any theme song from all the Anime I watch so Anime
  "TsureKano" by the way it's not bad though I just don't care (lmao), we will
  be listening to

  who at this point is already giving me more songs since June when I knew of
  them and probably more even though I didn't watch Anime "Yofukashi no Uta"
  which they are primed to write songs for and maybe the bulk of this particular
  release. Well, not putting my hopes too high, I guess we are all going to get
  trashed by

      >Aizawa Saya's new cover song</a
    ></b

  as mentioned during an Anime "Engage Kiss" livestream on Monday and will be
  released in full on her birthday which is upcoming Friday so sure, I'll give
  cover songs again. For Kisara, I mean, so not her. Well... depends on how you
  see it lol (Ironically still unannounced yet though haha I assume this was
  supposed to be a birthday surprise and they just leaked themselves...?) (HELL
  YEAH lol can we not)<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br /><br />
  And I guess that's it. I am still STOKED how I can still write this post as
  usual this week without skipping a beat. Well, I skipped half a day of beat
  and literally did nothing on two nights after work just because all I could do
  on that Surface Pro is watch YouTube videos. Haha trust me this sh*tty m3 Pro
  4 can only do one thing at a time real well, any more and it'll just get a
  fever and die just like me. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> See you next time again, and hopefully by
  then, hopefully, I'll be drowning in Saya-chan or whatever I'm into now
  because yeah, the cover song, please. Haha cya then<br />
