Wow did the week pass by real quick.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Hey, you stayed up and saw
  <a
    href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CiStBD-gN6h/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"
    target="_blank"
    >Koko-chan's Instagram livestream</a
  >? Yep, she decided to do one before she sleeps without any reason whatsoever
  talking to chat for an hour. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> More celebrities should do this.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh yeah of course I stayed up it's Friday anyways I also bought
  <a
    href="https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/detail/4550344615935"
    target="_blank"
    >whatever drink she got from Muji</a
  >... from Japan haha hell yeah but it's more of some stuff I can't get on my
  local Muji outlets so we'll talk about those in due time
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I also had some time to sort out some of the stuff in my room a bit, it's
  still a mess, but I just need more storage for photobooks. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, I
  thought we were done by last year but turns out not really lol you can see the
  blog this year for yourself
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay intro quota exceeded haha so let's talk about Anime and music! Man,
  really sad for the upcoming endings already I should only watch comedy and/or
  slice-of-life for less life-changing endings for drama lol it's just me huh<br />
  <br />

  </blockquote>
  "What women want when they are sad" Hey Kazuya this one's for free: Women want
  to be alone when they are sad bro so just... Oh well. In this new episode
  where I should call the cops because Kazuya is again going out with a girl in
  a school uniform lol (#KanoKari23), I guess more Sumi-chan!!! Hey, we can't
  always have bad news; we got enough of those just this week alone in real
  life. Anyways, we have been hinted about Sumi-chan and this planned date with
  Kazuya since a couple of episodes ago, oh yeah it's going to be great.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Like, seriously, his grandmother should be more impressed by this
  girl. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, the date. We already knew, ironically Sumi-chan didn't
  contact him directly so he had to find out from Chizuru who seems fine by now
  but yes we know she isn't so what you gonna do about it lol, which made Kazuya
  not exactly happy to attend the planned date by Sumi-chan herself to celebrate
  his birthday which wasn't much revealed until the end since the guy thought
  this was just another practice date. Bro, rental girlfriends won't plan this
  much for other clients, trust me. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this date, Sumi-chan dressed as
  a schoolgirl because he though that's Kazuya's kink lol it isn't he just
  wanted to date someone as if he's in high school this loser lmao, probably got
  more high seeing drenched Sumi-chan during the dolphin show at the aquarium
  despite all the precautions they made they might as well come in raincoats
  lol, did make Kazuya happy in the end though just planning for this aquarium
  trip since this guy is into it anyways, so mission successful, dear girl.
  Don't ask me why they chose a... makeout spot (lmao) to look at the scenery of
  the river but they are alone, and Sumi-chan before dying of embarrassment
  managed to pass on the gift to Kazuya, and he seemed happy so again, did she
  fail this date though? Probably not by "KanoKari" standards haha I would say
  she would've failed if not for the drench. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, since Kazuya had to
  worry about Chizuru in this date, it's not hard for the girl (Sumi-chan FYI)
  to notice, and you know, let him pour his heart about his... "friend" problems
  lol you think Sumi-chan knows? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, much needed help, I guess,
  maybe Chizuru needs it too- Ah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... the pace of this series
  is rather slow, for better or for worse. Don't let action series define what
  it means to tell a story, because I can tell you this series also has its
  moments, and I must say it is presented quite well this time around, along the
  many layers behind Sumi-chan's birthday date with Kazuya. Like, how did they
  hide this gem in this Anime amirite?? Hehe ah hey. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And looks like
  next week we are at the final episode, where I assume in this flashback?
  Kazuya will show the way to Chizuru on what is up with their futures. See you
  then.

  Yes feed me with more of Yume-chan's fears that's literally my fuel- I gotta
  say though I fear for those things too so if we run out of pesticide I'll also
  scream. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where the best things happen when these
  stepsiblings are alone lol (#TsureKano10), we got more scenarios that we can
  dump them to be in so that everyone else around them can be happy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Let's start with the parents. I don't know what is going on in their minds
  seeing their kids getting along with each other, but it is rather preposterous
  for the mother (*umph*
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/10765/Ai_Kayano" target="_blank"
    >Kayanon</a
  >
  haha) to think that even stepsiblings can go out together to buy swimsuits. I
  mean, not like I want to but really? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Well this is Anime but I hope
  you guys aren't going swimsuit shopping with your opposite gender siblings-
  What am I even saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not a porno, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And so they
  went I wonder what's the budget anyways lol the parents look like they are
  rich, and yeah why didn't Mizuto have to buy a new pair of trunks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  But yeah, if you have seen the official Twitter episode thumbnails you
  probably already... already... you know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, next up, we have
  Isana. According to the mother again lol it looks like it's just Isana popping
  over to Mizuto... and his shelf of books lmao during the summer vacation, but
  it's more than that, as we have witnessed a rather cozy maybe too cozy, movie
  screening with the stepsister who is already feeling uncomfortable and it's
  not because she drank too much water and is holding her piss. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe
  it's just like a couple who has been comfortable with each other for years,
  maybe it's just they are ambivalent to their own couple-like actions to one
  another less from Mizuto of course, but yeah, maybe too much of aggression
  from Isana? Not a porno, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, all's in a day of their
  school holidays where they kiss...? No, no kissing, just thinking of those. In
  bed. With each other. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> That's all- I mean, we can't
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu" target="_blank">skinship</a> as
  siblings? Being siblings SUCKS lol I swear on my honour I will not do anything
  like this with my sister. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> All in all lmao, it's like what Isana
  described: Every week we unlock more character card images. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From them
  wanting to kiss faces, to the mom getting so high over boy-girl relationships,
  to Isana pulling her hoodie zipper down... it's all good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We just
  happen to unlock river play next week too so that's just a nice family trip- I
  wear Mizuto you may want to change out your perverted dad haha let's see who's
  replacing his father then
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I can't erase the fact that we broke up. And that we became
  stepsiblings" Yeah me too Mizuto this story is bullsh*t haha Yume-chan knows]

Wow, how can I talk about this episode while holding a book on my head? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
I mean, manners, where are mine even? Sleeping somewhere perhaps? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yes
which means in this new episode (#Arusuno10) I can't even laugh, so let's see
how long I can last before I forget. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, this episode is about
manners, about Solow-san apparently, about the Headmaster wondering why the
standards for manners have dropped far in Arsham, so maybe, yeah, the girls in
this school may need some coaching after all. And that will explain the surge in
visitors to the library to pick out the perfect, and I mean <i>perfect</i>, book
to put on their heads- That is just cheating. For as you have seen in the lesson
with whoever that model student with pink hair is and that's why we colour them
hairs or else you wouldn't even know who I'm talking about, the way to practice
walking with balance is probably with anything, and I really mean anything,
plopped on top of one's head.

  >Even a peach</a
>. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Oh Mocho is a model student in a magical school? What else is new)
And that's pretty much it for this episode though, unless we dive into the
background lore a little more, and so we shall. We shall discuss about the
<strike>imbeciles</strike> Knights holding a meeting about them Listeners that
they have spotted gaining in strength and how it might ruin London some day, and
am trying to ambush them in hopes of stopping them at their feet, unlike the
girls in the academy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Whether this will have any link to the girls
though? I'm afraid I don't have any answer. Because turns out, this might just
be one of those side series from the video game where they just fool around-
Oops. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Where they just talk about everyday life and only leave the
fighting and tough stuff to people like Hammit-san or something. I mean, not
exactly an issue here I'm just here for the Select anyways hehe, and I don't see
a reason why they would jump into the action when we have two more episodes
left. I mean, prove me wrong I guess, just like how I proved that I can extend
this write-up long enough so that people won't know this Anime series doesn't
have enough content to talk about. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Ah hey, what else do you even need
in this?
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/217171/Sworn_H" target="_blank"
  >Akarin</a
>?
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki" target="_blank"
  >Paulina</a

<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I can't I'm sorry I need more practice haha

  Ah, so Robota got to them first. Well, should I be surprised though? In this
  new episode where the real action now begins ah hey life without Walnut is
  more risky and unpredictable my friends (#LycoReco11), and that's probably
  what got Takina worried, is the problem. Kusunoki doesn't give two damns about
  any of them though, just so you know. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let's talk about what she
  gives a damn then. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Firstly, about concealing the truth. That though,
  I think that DA superior above her might be raging right now already so YIKES
  haha because the actual trap is really in the Lycoris heading up to the new
  tower and thank goodness Takina left the actual operation because it's
  probably safer not being there as Majima prepared the reveal of the girls'
  identities for ironically the first time and previous time they managed to
  hack into the system to show that weapons are around for them to use to be
  honest, but then again what, hundred people suffered at the hands of knowing
  the truth? Still small number if we regard them as potential criminals. Like,
  are you even a citizen if you want to know the truth? Pft, what a joke. Don't
  think that'll work for the hundred of them who got shot by local law
  enforcement since last episode though so... uh... let's move on. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next
  up, let's talk about Takina's condition. We know Chisato got her back in the
  DA, but clearly she is only interested in the safety of Chisato, so I'm not
  going to bring up
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yuri" target="_blank">Lily</a>-san in this
  place and time. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What I will bring up though is that this is also
  part and parcel of Majima' plan, where he knows already to make sure the
  identities of Lycoris is revealed to the public, but also, you know, removing
  the biggest threat in the ways of his plan somewhere else ie. Chisato herself,
  which I hope he doesn't know of her dying artificial heart because looks like
  he doesn't, then wants to challenge Chisato to a showdown again on the old
  Tower using his own hearing senses we have so much heard about (get it?) so
  far just in name, and looks like, that's why he had to block out all external
  voices with the shutters so to be able to hear the reverbs and gauge his
  opponent's movements. Like Yoshi-san, for example. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well he's fine,
  looks like he already cut himself out to dodge a shot, by the way. Last but
  not least, how we know all of this story so far. Thanks to the impeccable
  curiosity of <strike>Walnut</strike> Kurumi-san and the flight delays on their
  outgoing planes lol the latter is more the reason of course, she has found out
  that Yoshi-san was planning on restoring her artificial heart with another
  (this is business anyways, or else why develop this technology) for Chisato
  but obviously doing the shorting in spite of Mika-san and needing another
  "contract" or some form for Chisato to continue her duty... as a girl in a
  school uniform with a gun. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I don't know what to call them now,
  "heroines"? (Haha hey how am I doing as a bad guy? You think I can align
  myself with Majima- FUCK OFF DUDE lol) So yeah, regardless what happened
  beforehand though, the development between the two dads was an eventuality,
  just that this time, Majima was in the way. So we gotta settle him first.
  Using real bullets, Chisato, or else none of us can move on. Not even for the
  many who have died due to this series of events. Yes, the girls included.
  Maybe let Takina do it lol we shall see the conclusion of any number of those
  next week I guess.

  </blockquote>
  Man, what if it's just jealousy and the sister just wants part of the action?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#EngageKiss11) wow do we have great
  developments on this going forward so we better cut to the chase. Ok, and I'm
  going to abbreviate each satellite strike with *ahem* so we can simplify this
  talk so do take note. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, story goes that Kisara got shoved with
  a spear from Kanna-san... while struggling and getting all the memories of her
  or else how you gonna take that thing out of you lol, then actually revealed
  that Kanna had all the memories of when Shuu was a kid including, and I'm not
  even joking, how Kisara has died along with some distant relatives who aren't
  important lol. As this will be passed on a little bit later we will talk about
  that soon, but suffice it to say that even if Kisara were to take down Kanna
  she also won't be able to because maybe giving all the memories to her to
  remind you about how Shuu's sister is right in front of her may not be the
  best idea after all. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And thus, she went down to the ocean apparently
  floating because I don't think that's how it works but she's lightweight, I
  guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What took down Kanna-san though, is *ahem* about two of these
  *ahem* sucking the demon power dry which ironically as impressive as it is, is
  also really hard to explain this situation as the mayor of Bayron City to the
  many diplomats all over the world as if some alien attack happened so let's
  move on haha, that doesn't mean that Kanna-san is defeated though. As we have
  learnt this is THE demon incarnate so it won't take long for her to come back
  as Sharon would also have feared but the rest of the Church might be in turn
  to make sure this being doesn't wreck havoc in the future. For now.... we
  still saving Kisara, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, we gotta, right? That's all Shuu has
  now to be honest. Well, at least, in his memories I guess lol. But Kisara
  decided to, and I am still not joking, to return all the memories back to him,
  and thus, revoking the demon contract. Why though? I think maybe this requires
  a flashback or two haha. Also yeah, giving back all your memories will take a
  while, so we gotta kiss for a while more. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Hey, tell me I wrote this
  Anime, tell me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, about the flashback, turns out the hint from
  the front was correct; Kisara was a distant relative (so same grandfather?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) lost in action but ironically because she was not because she was a
  half-demon? And is pinned down at some point but Shuu decides to bring her
  back in a form of a contract haha yes THIS is where it doesn't make sense to
  real life anymore, then collaborated with Sharon at the time if you would
  recall, to take down Kisara and of course, to make Shuu stand on his ground to
  continue demon killing in the City which would require him to stop Sharon on
  her tracks to capture "Kisara" (wait, so the first kiss wasn't Ayano? OOPS) if
  that is probably what she will get out of it from. As you can see it's all
  very complicated. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, I guess this counts as Shuu walking down his
  father's tracks which will also explain why his dad did the same thing by
  stopping Kanna-san and that demon lord disguised as the wife back then, which
  is why Shuu is now investigating his family's whereabouts and stuff I guess.
  I'm... really confused already so I hope I make sense. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And it looks
  like it was a pain to grab Shuu's brain and steal memories every time so
  despite his efforts of writing up an actual contract lol, Kisara did read them
  all like a pathetic literate haha and managed to change out stuff (because it
  looks like Shuu gave himself an escape plan) including sealing every "deal"
  with the infamous kiss too. So that's where the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yandere" target="_blank">yandere</a> part
  came about. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But more importantly also though, and this will concern
  the finale I guess, them holding hands fingers crossed means termination of
  contract, and I think we have reached back to square one. Literally. We can
  kill Kisara as an A-class demon now while we plan how to take down what is
  left of the incarnate of Asmodeus. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> This makes too much sense now,
  will it? We shall see how much human emotions will take part in this finale
  then.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Hey Sharon maybe achieving peace with demons will be achievable after
  all- Yeah right. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

  and maybe that's why these two newbie voice actresses are gaining in
  popularity only four singles in, is that their vocals do come in nicely to the
  also nice pop songs that accompany them, so shout out to the composers for
  making me think twice about this release enough to give twice the amount of
  songs too, almost got on to the shelf.

  might be considered the winner this week since I just ended up giving in to
  more familiar melodies from them despite listening to a lot of new songs from
  them since I don't follow their digital singles released throughout the past
  year, so that's good.

  also held its feet though despite being a more popular release in rankings but
  not on mine, still did impress with some melodies especially mellow ones which
  really made me think twice about their styles in general, to be honest. That
  much, I give recognition to their experience in making rap and hip-hop sound
  so good today.<br />

  On news about music that are on Twitter and this time I might touch on Anime a
  bit too,

  and with producer Sawano Hiroyuki who also did "Attack on Titan" I can't help
  but think of the mood of the songs especially the ending songs that they will
  be any more happier which worries me,

  for an upcoming album likely next year sure is different and I can't make of
  it to be honest to say if it's good but it's very different from what we have
  heard so far though,

  for their upcoming album which is fine it sets the mood for the release but I
  must say I am not impressed compared to what we have heard so far this year.
  Maybe I should take a break haha<br />
  <br />So next week... onwards might be a bit rough because we don't have much
  coming up in releases until the end of the month so for now I have a couple of
  options including

  catch up on more older songs as if those aren't enough. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then
  maybe the following week we can listen to
