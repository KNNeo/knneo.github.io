Yep, she decided to do one before she sleeps without any reason whatsoever talking to chat for an hour. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> More celebrities should do this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh yeah of course I stayed up it's Friday anyways I also bought <a href=https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/detail/4550344615935 target=_blank>whatever drink she got from Muji</a>... from Japan haha hell yeah but it's more of some stuff I can't get on my local Muji outlets so we'll talk about those in due time</div><div><br></div><div>I also had some time to sort out some of the stuff in my room a bit, it's still a mess, but I just need more storage for photobooks. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, I thought we were done by last year but turns out not really lol you can see the blog this year for yourself</div><div><br></div><div>Okay intro quota exceeded haha so let's talk about Anime and music! Man, really sad for the upcoming endings already I should only watch comedy and/or slice-of-life for less life-changing endings for drama lol it's just me huh<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanoKari23><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Kanojo, Okarishimasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Sumi-chan wants you to help her practice again" This is not a practice Chizuru hehe</div></blockquote>"What women want when they are sad" Hey Kazuya this one's for free: Women want to be alone when they are sad bro so just... Oh well. In this new episode where I should call the cops because Kazuya is again going out with a girl in a school uniform lol (#KanoKari23), I guess more Sumi-chan!!! Hey, we can't always have bad news; we got enough of those just this week alone in real life. Anyways, we have been hinted about Sumi-chan and this planned date with Kazuya since a couple of episodes ago, oh yeah it's going to be great. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Like, seriously, his grandmother should be more impressed by this girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, the date. We already knew, ironically Sumi-chan didn't contact him directly so he had to find out from Chizuru who seems fine by now but yes we know she isn't so what you gonna do about it lol, which made Kazuya not exactly happy to attend the planned date by Sumi-chan herself to celebrate his birthday which wasn't much revealed until the end since the guy thought this was just another practice date. Bro, rental girlfriends won't plan this much for other clients, trust me. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this date, Sumi-chan dressed as a schoolgirl because he though that's Kazuya's kink lol it isn't he just wanted to date someone as if he's in high school this loser lmao, probably got more high seeing drenched Sumi-chan during the dolphin show at the aquarium despite all the precautions they made they might as well come in raincoats lol, did make Kazuya happy in the end though just planning for this aquarium trip since this guy is into it anyways, so mission successful, dear girl. Don't ask me why they chose a... makeout spot (lmao) to look at the scenery of the river but they are alone, and Sumi-chan before dying of embarrassment managed to pass on the gift to Kazuya, and he seemed happy so again, did she fail this date though? Probably not by "KanoKari" standards haha I would say she would've failed if not for the drench. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways, since Kazuya had to worry about Chizuru in this date, it's not hard for the girl (Sumi-chan FYI) to notice, and you know, let him pour his heart about his... "friend" problems lol you think Sumi-chan knows? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, much needed help, I guess, maybe Chizuru needs it too- Ah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... the pace of this series is rather slow, for better or for worse. Don't let action series define what it means to tell a story, because I can tell you this series also has its moments, and I must say it is presented quite well this time around, along the many layers behind Sumi-chan's birthday date with Kazuya. Like, how did they hide this gem in this Anime amirite?? Hehe ah hey. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And looks like next week we are at the final episode, where I assume in this flashback? Kazuya will show the way to Chizuru on what is up with their futures. See you then.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtgwXsj3xOCWZ0AphjLTpjgkm-M5k9MUkwB7oVPFVPbbAW7TUHDqSw0szF-WhseuwegUofBxPXeNrj2HCgAg_I0Dqbtmr2GTooAwuUECzA7YfCXRgGtNqWWZaBSnDXQil61sQ6LJhiRKKco_tZ-BNv-KjJiLaJEIhsf0K6Iu7t9INsjdnkaWOGMmwi/s320/kanokari22_couple4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Reasons why Kazuya x Sumi is a good couple:<br>Even her on top of him is <span class=emoji title=😚>*chef's kiss*</span> lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGqMT2urHXX_VKvIGIMjXnIKt9yMQ83Ptqxa9c11AAeQo3tMgfuW_46lpaPqpjnqnWbf3eek4CMHyoawimQNWBT9csjmKbv1xPNT28KcXnWdhcz-0IfWGJM49dW4331Gn_vknxQwdemWLbIkuGEHQ3KES-PfYdj5QMnF5U3fIWFBiB-QOWGTXDf_yx/s320/kanokari22_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Reasons why Kazuya x Sumi is a good couple:<br>THEM LEGS DUDE haha ah</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg98xjAQmIgynYqmC-ziaXCPl6pVBsAV_061aVuaL_uT-8jRCte18Ryf_e4d0EhOYQE1Yih15EOAHKPF-Oc9daUMlyY1TjhKD9_t5L7uu94cAMioUsusY_or9muOS0NaqbrsMaL0aAIV6khX7sBria1FYHHa22ivpzVEWd6H1oH83KcW79Q9fXOwRkv/s320/kanokari22_couple3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Reasons why Kazuya x Sumi is a good couple:<br>Cute couple? lol</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I don't know what is going on in their minds seeing their kids getting along with each other, but it is rather preposterous for the mother (*umph* <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/10765/Ai_Kayano target=_blank>Kayanon</a> haha) to think that even stepsiblings can go out together to buy swimsuits. I mean, not like I want to but really? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well this is Anime but I hope you guys aren't going swimsuit shopping with your opposite gender siblings- What am I even saying. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not a porno, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And so they went I wonder what's the budget anyways lol the parents look like they are rich, and yeah why didn't Mizuto have to buy a new pair of trunks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, if you have seen the official Twitter episode thumbnails you probably already... already... you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, next up, we have Isana. According to the mother again lol it looks like it's just Isana popping over to Mizuto... and his shelf of books lmao during the summer vacation, but it's more than that, as we have witnessed a rather cozy maybe too cozy, movie screening with the stepsister who is already feeling uncomfortable and it's not because she drank too much water and is holding her piss. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe it's just like a couple who has been comfortable with each other for years, maybe it's just they are ambivalent to their own couple-like actions to one another less from Mizuto of course, but yeah, maybe too much of aggression from Isana? Not a porno, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, all's in a day of their school holidays where they kiss...? No, no kissing, just thinking of those. In bed. With each other. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> That's all- I mean, we can't <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu target=_blank>skinship</a> as siblings? Being siblings SUCKS lol I swear on my honour I will not do anything like this with my sister. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> All in all lmao, it's like what Isana described: Every week we unlock more character card images. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> From them wanting to kiss faces, to the mom getting so high over boy-girl relationships, to Isana pulling her hoodie zipper down... it's all good. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We just happen to unlock river play next week too so that's just a nice family trip- I wear Mizuto you may want to change out your perverted dad haha let's see who's replacing his father then</div><div>[TL:DR; "I can't erase the fact that we broke up.

Sleeping somewhere perhaps? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yes which means in this new episode (#Arusuno10) I can't even laugh, so let's see how long I can last before I forget. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, this episode is about manners, about Solow-san apparently, about the Headmaster wondering why the standards for manners have dropped far in Arsham, so maybe, yeah, the girls in this school may need some coaching after all. And that will explain the surge in visitors to the library to pick out the perfect, and I mean <em>perfect</em>, book to put on their heads- That is just cheating. For as you have seen in the lesson with whoever that model student with pink hair is and that's why we colour them hairs or else you wouldn't even know who I'm talking about, the way to practice walking with balance is probably with anything, and I really mean anything, plopped on top of one's head. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CgtfTm5gmhu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target=_blank>Even a peach</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (Oh Mocho is a model student in a magical school? What else is new) And that's pretty much it for this episode though, unless we dive into the background lore a little more, and so we shall. We shall discuss about the <strike>imbeciles</strike> Knights holding a meeting about them Listeners that they have spotted gaining in strength and how it might ruin London some day, and am trying to ambush them in hopes of stopping them at their feet, unlike the girls in the academy. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Whether this will have any link to the girls though? I'm afraid I don't have any answer. Because turns out, this might just be one of those side series from the video game where they just fool around- Oops. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Where they just talk about everyday life and only leave the fighting and tough stuff to people like Hammit-san or something.

That's all there is to it."</div></blockquote>Ah, so Robota got to them first. Well, should I be surprised though? In this new episode where the real action now begins ah hey life without Walnut is more risky and unpredictable my friends (#LycoReco11), and that's probably what got Takina worried, is the problem. Kusunoki doesn't give two damns about any of them though, just so you know. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Let's talk about what she gives a damn then. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Firstly, about concealing the truth. That though, I think that DA superior above her might be raging right now already so YIKES haha because the actual trap is really in the Lycoris heading up to the new tower and thank goodness Takina left the actual operation because it's probably safer not being there as Majima prepared the reveal of the girls' identities for ironically the first time and previous time they managed to hack into the system to show that weapons are around for them to use to be honest, but then again what, hundred people suffered at the hands of knowing the truth? Still small number if we regard them as potential criminals. Like, are you even a citizen if you want to know the truth? Pft, what a joke. Don't think that'll work for the hundred of them who got shot by local law enforcement since last episode though so... uh... let's move on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, let's talk about Takina's condition. We know Chisato got her back in the DA, but clearly she is only interested in the safety of Chisato, so I'm not going to bring up <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yuri target=_blank>Lily</a>-san in this place and time. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What I will bring up though is that this is also part and parcel of Majima' plan, where he knows already to make sure the identities of Lycoris is revealed to the public, but also, you know, removing the biggest threat in the ways of his plan somewhere else ie. Chisato herself, which I hope he doesn't know of her dying artificial heart because looks like he doesn't, then wants to challenge Chisato to a showdown again on the old Tower using his own hearing senses we have so much heard about (get it?) so far just in name, and looks like, that's why he had to block out all external voices with the shutters so to be able to hear the reverbs and gauge his opponent's movements. Like Yoshi-san, for example. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well he's fine, looks like he already cut himself out to dodge a shot, by the way. Last but not least, how we know all of this story so far. Thanks to the impeccable curiosity of <strike>Walnut</strike> Kurumi-san and the flight delays on their outgoing planes lol the latter is more the reason of course, she has found out that Yoshi-san was planning on restoring her artificial heart with another (this is business anyways, or else why develop this technology) for Chisato but obviously doing the shorting in spite of Mika-san and needing another "contract" or some form for Chisato to continue her duty... as a girl in a school uniform with a gun. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, I don't know what to call them now, "heroines"? (Haha hey how am I doing as a bad guy? You think I can align myself with Majima- FUCK OFF DUDE lol) So yeah, regardless what happened beforehand though, the development between the two dads was an eventuality, just that this time, Majima was in the way. So we gotta settle him first. Using real bullets, Chisato, or else none of us can move on. Not even for the many who have died due to this series of events. Yes, the girls included. Maybe let Takina do it lol we shall see the conclusion of any number of those next week I guess.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBS0rfSUTixPboZknQwXS-RvNHRCaNsqR5b0uDXyOpcyBDQ4n2Y_I3Dtn7PVA8L2p8DbQU1WTMfzR7KKArvxzuXWYovdzXxhfktAq6llENligFtlmECGVkYfkIEcM3WpLOZvsXFA5v-wrXk9wlTfWgOMoLAtgcmM75qfQ4DiM9MMiuBmOetv9UzWss/s320/lycoreco11_chisato1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I'm late for school and there's a traffic jam lol not true</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioAHMdvjoFC4AtCzelvXfWiy-qS2_AVCh4p5JnUu4k0D9B4bEaie_MeAJOLtyfmRGUp-si02tbeqGayfbVv-khnPEtStBAY8NqsUqZUAryY8f5pJBIAeJZSxqRnmNTIilSZDM1-bLDH7JRzIpyUzNlIWNfkfTbt-U_wKII3DGbPVD1bfPOlPIKSznm/s320/lycoreco11_takina.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Okay gotta say this is kinda cool imo</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQCI2dmqSW1dU2vueQ40pb7r-2jSe6IIop_ldUeu_Vp4ObszhbzhGX6LJqdbPbQlenNG021yRLVhNdOC2N3TLQJulGO_yAuKYPJhfRh6RsPwENxHJOCEWAIGncHP_PxbNWhPxKhSCwdsdI-hZIM1D3uynQWXRTpFPnHjwcMhR31fhzzio6Pd1qrOez/s320/lycoreco11_mizuki2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>LOL</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha</div></blockquote>Man, what if it's just jealousy and the sister just wants part of the action? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#EngageKiss11) wow do we have great developments on this going forward so we better cut to the chase. Ok, and I'm going to abbreviate each satellite strike with *ahem* so we can simplify this talk so do take note. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, story goes that Kisara got shoved with a spear from Kanna-san... while struggling and getting all the memories of her or else how you gonna take that thing out of you lol, then actually revealed that Kanna had all the memories of when Shuu was a kid including, and I'm not even joking, how Kisara has died along with some distant relatives who aren't important lol. As this will be passed on a little bit later we will talk about that soon, but suffice it to say that even if Kisara were to take down Kanna she also won't be able to because maybe giving all the memories to her to remind you about how Shuu's sister is right in front of her may not be the best idea after all. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And thus, she went down to the ocean apparently floating because I don't think that's how it works but she's lightweight, I guess. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What took down Kanna-san though, is *ahem* about two of these *ahem* sucking the demon power dry which ironically as impressive as it is, is also really hard to explain this situation as the mayor of Bayron City to the many diplomats all over the world as if some alien attack happened so let's move on haha, that doesn't mean that Kanna-san is defeated though. As we have learnt this is THE demon incarnate so it won't take long for her to come back as Sharon would also have feared but the rest of the Church might be in turn to make sure this being doesn't wreck havoc in the future. For now.... we still saving Kisara, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, we gotta, right? That's all Shuu has now to be honest. Well, at least, in his memories I guess lol. But Kisara decided to, and I am still not joking, to return all the memories back to him, and thus, revoking the demon contract. Why though? I think maybe this requires a flashback or two haha. Also yeah, giving back all your memories will take a while, so we gotta kiss for a while more. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Hey, tell me I wrote this Anime, tell me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, about the flashback, turns out the hint from the front was correct; Kisara was a distant relative (so same grandfather? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>) lost in action but ironically because she was not because she was a half-demon? And is pinned down at some point but Shuu decides to bring her back in a form of a contract haha yes THIS is where it doesn't make sense to real life anymore, then collaborated with Sharon at the time if you would recall, to take down Kisara and of course, to make Shuu stand on his ground to continue demon killing in the City which would require him to stop Sharon on her tracks to capture "Kisara" (wait, so the first kiss wasn't Ayano? OOPS) if that is probably what she will get out of it from. As you can see it's all very complicated. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, I guess this counts as Shuu walking down his father's tracks which will also explain why his dad did the same thing by stopping Kanna-san and that demon lord disguised as the wife back then, which is why Shuu is now investigating his family's whereabouts and stuff I guess. I'm... really confused already so I hope I make sense. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And it looks like it was a pain to grab Shuu's brain and steal memories every time so despite his efforts of writing up an actual contract lol, Kisara did read them all like a pathetic literate haha and managed to change out stuff (because it looks like Shuu gave himself an escape plan) including sealing every "deal" with the infamous kiss too. So that's where the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yandere target=_blank>yandere</a> part came about. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But more importantly also though, and this will concern the finale I guess, them holding hands fingers crossed means termination of contract, and I think we have reached back to square one. Literally. We can kill Kisara as an A-class demon now while we plan how to take down what is left of the incarnate of Asmodeus. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> This makes too much sense now, will it? We shall see how much human emotions will take part in this finale then.</div><div>[TL:DR; Hey Sharon maybe achieving peace with demons will be achievable after all- Yeah right. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrimFP8pHRx_48LZ99vo02k5MrBcUDawBGuaU0IZd8hVyADrnZYWQlz4iwJ_5mLwL73OXZcHm-zdhVD9aZHkz-L1V8otgETDEdj-Si2vSNDkSxPbxFDBjHz1hcBPxgtSJw9zHB1dRJpvnvcR1vDQZ160OyVySsLCoFN_3qpJIeiTgy-cu3Af3rjXYr/s320/engagekiss11_shuu2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I received my first paycheck haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkJEYANCneHgCd5JLVpXNhdjRLuqKi-KrsX_k3_A-YFLXMBnoO6oLPGasX5z_jk-vH_fM9OwpBgMwUob1U4nkcISxOMMVmnExx_yZn6rY96U_rNYPnqY5zQBVXgjPcXoYZCwZ2THLji-C2O7bURzIQ3nbLlxK6l2It8n50x5nb-BQdlqxUqDgU7bgb/s320/engagekiss11_kanna2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>My girl when she finds out I cheated on her lol</table></div></div><div>P.S.

That much, I give recognition to their experience in making rap and hip-hop sound so good today.<br><br> On news about music that are on Twitter and this time I might touch on Anime a bit too, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/BLEACHanimation/status/1568902791992844288?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>Anime "BLEACH" is returning with new theme songs</a></b> and with producer Sawano Hiroyuki who also did "Attack on Titan" I can't help but think of the mood of the songs especially the ending songs that they will be any more happier which worries me, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/marika_staff/status/1568585079110205440?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>Kouno Marika's new music video</a></b> is only nice not because the song is good so I will have to think twice when it's out next month, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yucat1031/status/1568192592663449605?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>yucat's new music video</a></b> for an upcoming album likely next year sure is different and I can't make of it to be honest to say if it's good but it's very different from what we have heard so far though, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1568162294059638784?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>Taketatsu Ayana will be releasing a 10th anniversary digital single</a></b> written by Okii Reiji who wrote her debut song so that'll be interesting to listen to when it's out in October, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/engage_kiss/status/1568162423412064256?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>Anime "Engage Kiss" Kisara covered song</a></b> is released on voice actress Aizawa Saya's birthday and damn did it not need <a href="https://twitter.com/engage_kiss/status/1567831674976878592?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>a music video</a> but here we are, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1567422683603935234?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>Aimer's new song</a></b> will be for a new drama, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1565989127744811010?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>Touyama Nao's new album trailer</a></b> in on YouTube and I don't even know if I can even give a couple of songs in there to be frank, and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/nanoripe_info/status/1567165839031554049?s=20&amp;t=V9KLs3vIUtsCmw4ZIZ-gUw" target=_blank>nano.RIPE released a new song</a></b> for their upcoming album which is fine it sets the mood for the release but I must say I am not impressed compared to what we have heard so far this year. Maybe I should take a break haha<br><br>So next week... onwards might be a bit rough because we don't have much coming up in releases until the end of the month so for now I have a couple of options including <b>going back to indie site <a href=http://www.audioleaf.com/ target=_blank>Audioleaf</a></b> once again and see my luck for next week, and <b>check out some live festival performances</b> I have backlog of so we can catch up on more older songs as if those aren't enough. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then maybe the following week we can listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/departure-my-new-me/1633995839?l=en" target=_blank>FIVE NEW OLD's new album</a></b> I saw them releasing an album lol oh yeah <b>No Buses new album</b> (?) releases next week too<br><br><br><br> Oh yeah happy birthday Waki Azumi but more importantly haha, Aizawa Saya. How many happy times have you given me since last year with Anime "Taisho Otome" and then "Engage Kiss" now? I am truly in bliss. Like, have you even seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmHn1UCT7w" target=_blank>that music video</a>? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Why is this still not in music streaming services?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay calm down me Aniplex gotta earn their YouTube views first. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Cya guys then, and until next time let me think about reasons why I still like Kayano Ai and Kotobuki Minako so we can celebrate their birthdays next week haha bye</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Oh yeah Kayanon for <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/81659/Lucy_Yamagami target=_blank>shame</a> and uh...
