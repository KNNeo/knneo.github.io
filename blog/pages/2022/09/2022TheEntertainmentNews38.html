Well I've really been spending this weekend only doing up that Klassic Note
Web... "application" so I can actually make this happen sometime next year so
don't ask how I've been spending my days this week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, there
are a lot of things happening in the games I play just that I have no luck and
I'm not actually playing them just because of what I've mentioned a moment ago
so
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  On the upside, the new package is on its way! Might not be the end of the
  month though, so maybe next month? I could save some money I guess not until I
  have to buy more Marinka live tour goods from not the same forwarding service
  haha oops shouldn't have spoiled it
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So, Anime and music time! Let me grab my lunch first and I'll be back soon
  lol<br />

  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "How long is her day, 30 hours?" Chizuru can slow down time, okay? Don't
      ask haha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  So wait, Chizuru as a middle schooler is just when she was acting as the ninja
  in that play? No wonder she's a natural. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode of
  season two we are ending with a flashback apparently (#KanoKari24), we talk a
  little bit about Chizuru's past. Starring literally her in middle school which
  is funny to watch because it's kinda
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yankee" target="_blank">yankee</a> I guess
  she is still in her rebellious phase I believe, and her grandfather. Apart
  from this dude voiced by the one and only Nakao Ryuusei (even in my deathbed
  I'll still recognize your voice haha thanks "BLEACH"), this geezer had a lot
  of passion. Of others. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, when you're 70 you do things like that,
  but also of course, Chizuru is their only family. Remember how her parents
  aren't there? Yeah, we gotta go that far back in the past where grandma Sayuri
  was still in the acting industry to talk about them. Yep. So cringe, maybe we
  should not talk about them. We can talk about the grandfather though, as he is
  one ball of a supporter to whatever Chizuru does even if she got bullied at
  school, and talked about dreams coming true including the stereotypical
  how-I-got-your-grandma scenario lmao, but wishing them to come true is just
  part of the equation, especially when it also means you have to try. This is
  probably what Chizuru lives with now, and it's no surprise she might be
  influenced by the grandparents to even give acting a try. Also, she isn't
  exactly rich so acting school probably costed a lot, and even today it took
  her so long to get her first role ever, if you would recall at the start of
  this season. She attempted to believe that dreams do come true as long as you
  work at it, so amongst other things she spent a lot of time and effort making
  that come true while still studying all the way through college. Also probably
  why she took on the rental girlfriend job because it pays so well when you
  have customers like Kinoshita Kazuya. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sadly, we are talking about the
  past so something definitely happened to the grandfather, you can guess what
  happened. Someone walked a hundred times on the shrine to wish to see him
  survive a T-bone. I mean, your grandpa didn't lie, Chizuru. Just that the
  truck driver wished he could get past that red light. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Man, I can't
  even laugh at this now. Though, Chizuru has only been more close to being an
  actress. And looks like, to conclude the season, we have a surprise from
  Kazuya, our main guy. Yep, I mean, you have heard of it: It's season thr-
  We're going to crowdfund a movie for Chizuru!! Yeah, now we're talking about
  REAL goals. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, turns out, Kazuya has been deep in thought of
  how to conclude this arc of getting Chizuru's dreams to happen, so, we gotta
  show grandma Sayuri a movie which has her in it. Easier said than done, but if
  you have heard of this method of getting people hyped to fund a movie, then
  you know this is more likely to happen before we get another elder to kick the
  bucket. Success rates aren't perfect as we will see in the near future I
  suppose, but let's just say it's an attempt. An attempt for everyone involved.
  Kazuya will use his management skills to make this happen lol they don't even
  have anyone on the script I like to believe the useless friends around him can
  be involved don't get Mami-chan to write it lmao, Chizuru will be main girl
  maybe her friends at the acting school can join in too, and we will live to
  see it happen. Really though, if this announcement of season three (haha

    target="_blank"
    >oh yeah, it's on</a
  >) is not to make sure this happen... I'll get myself T-boned. Haha okay just
  joking please make it happen I don't want to die now lmao see you then where
  we continue this joyride of- Is Ruka-chan moving into their apartment
  complex??? Uh oh this is already getting spicy before it even starts so let's
  see how good this will be then lol yeah it's a new character if you follow the
  original work. Until then, stop jerking off to Chizuru naked, please. Geez-

  "I love Irido-kun" Oh Yume-chan what else is new. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, imagine you
  have someone of the opposite gender to "just talk to" whenever you want.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Heck, Mizuto still has Isana to talk to NOW so f**k me. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> In
  this normie life of a new episode though (#TsureKano11) we just don't put in
  the disclaimer that these guys are stepsiblings now. That's all. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Oh
  it's in the title? Moving on haha also this is the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bikini" target="_blank">bikini</a> episode
  in case anyone is asking lmao, the family go to I guess the paternal side
  family gathering at what looks like a river side resort. Man, this family's
  got budget. Haha it also has a lot of members in it so Yume-chan got to know a
  lot of relatives and cousins I guess including for this particular episode,
  Madoka-san. She's hot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She's voiced by the one and only
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Youko_Hikasa" target="_blank"
    >please go find out for yourself</a
  >
  lol *ahem* old hag, and Yume-chan thinks Mizuto liked this
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">onee-san</a> of a
  woman at some point. Spoiler alert, no freaking way we know Mizuto is into
  cute girls just like how the other cousin seems to be haha, but suffice it to
  say that this is what is carrying Yume-chan her whole life, worrying about the
  other people in her now brother's life. Oh, we call this&nbsp;<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/burakon"
    target="_blank"
    >brocon</a
  >&nbsp;too. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the girls had some fun in the river and that's
  all we got to be honest which is rather disappointing in my opinion lmao this
  is a drama series by the way, everyone else got drunk at the BBQ party and
  then inside in the evening so none of our youngsters are joining them,
  Madoka-san had to serve the drinks lol don't ask about feminism in Japan
  thanks a lot, and Yume-chan saw her brother hanging out in the
  great-grandfather's library whilst trying to get him into the bath... by
  himself. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Jokes aside, besides seeing Mizuto read books all day and
  the relatives say the single father did a great job raising this literature
  nerd lol, he was then seen reading the elder's autobiography. It was the first
  book he read as a kid, and he let Yume-chan on it too. Well, the reading. The
  crying was just part of the experience. Someone actually sell that book as a
  theme park ride I gotta try it too <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically though, this time
  around, with Yume-chan and her jealousy with the people who interact with
  Mizuto typically women lol, she talked about a bit to Madoka-san who thought
  the best way to resolve her emotions with this guy is to put them alone.
  During this family trip. Okay. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But I would say Yume-chan did realize
  something after so long: That she was selfish. She would've turned back the
  clock if she had done all in her power to believe him and patch things up
  instead of letting the guy apologize and STILL think he's insincere about it.
  Because honestly? That's all he is, and being a liar is not one of them.
  Whether Mizuto talking about his first love and how she used to be happy will
  ever get to Yume-chan... That'll be another day for realization. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All
  in all... I really need to stop picking up shows like these. From next season
  I'll only watch pure comedy series, not even romance comedy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
  it was quite a drop, and I can't believe they can still hit me after this many
  episodes, because seriously every time they do it, the lore just gets deeper.
  Not Yume-chan's misunderstandings about Mizuto's love life, but about herself.
  And that's good to know. I think we are at the final stretch though, so I
  really wonder what would be the conclusion for this series. This much is the
  truth, right? Do any of them need to be <em>more</em> woke about their
  relationship? Hmm... I guess we will find out next week.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; All this series as proven, and I'm not joking, is just that whatever
  happens in the future will NEVER beat the first time. Period. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I
  agree haha I speak from experience]

<div>
  P.P.S. "I trust you are going along well with Mizuto" Yeah no shit granny I'm

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Again, you can try <em>not</em> to talk about fun but that doesn't mean you
  <em>can't</em> have fun. I mean, look at this Anime series. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this
  new episode (#Arusuno11) we are talking about whiskers. Or tails? Of a horse?
  Or whale? I mean, you watch and tell me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, you don't watch this
  unless the girls fight some Knights? Okay fine, I guess I'll tell you what I
  know then, I'm just as confused. So, let's just say the girls picked up a
  cat's whisker. I mean, with some knowledge of cats you would know that a cat's
  whisker can hardly be seen even in animation so being able to see it is a
  miracle in a magical world or they are just wrong haha, but they believed that
  it'll bring them good luck. I mean, do you even need to test it out? You slept
  through two lessons back to back, you think this is working? Haha if it were
  true then you wouldn't have been in those sleep fests- I mean, lessons. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
  So yeah, I guess it's not working, but what was working was what Mell-chan and
  Tori-chan did after believing this is a thing. They thought someone was
  finding a cat's whisker but turns out it's
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/fuuchousou" target="_blank"
    >the plant of the same name</a
  >, they got a whale's whisker back which they recalled someone asking for it
  because ever since they picked this up the whole school knew of it but somehow
  heard just the word "whisker" lol, and they got some special tea leaves out of
  it. So yeah, I guess at this point one would've figured out from this series
  they are yet trying out another way to assemble an afternoon tea, well,
  evening tea party in the room once again, and you are not wrong. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> The
  two girls were running away from Perdura the shadow cat thinking that this is
  from it and only ended up in the kitchen where the fairies were working, then
  smelt the great tea and was given some in return for, you guessed it, what
  would complete the afternoon tea package. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, all in all we
  don't have any action again just more nice, wholesome stuff as mentioned by
  Pica-chan, but considering it's the Knights preparing and even marching
  towards a floating castle... I have my doubts this will be the end of it all.
  Man, next week is either going to be a massacre or just another one of these
  shenanigans, whichever comes first. But for now, drink up, ladies, then go
  take a nap because I still have a couple more shows to watch on this Sunday
  afternoon and these aren't exactly lectures that'll put me to sleep so I'm
  good. Haha see you then, the final episode I mean.

  Well, that was a quick conclusion. I mean, you figured that out yet? How to
  take down Majima-san. Yeah, so killing his hearing will do, by the way. What
  was NOT a conclusion in this not final episode though yeah not yet by the way
  (#LycoReco12), remember what happened last week though? Yeah, like the Lycoris
  are pretty much screwed at this point, for being ratted out to be the actual
  law enforcement of the country haha now are probably set to be eliminated by
  another group of misfits lol again that's how Powerpuff Girls got the male
  branch because this one has one too lmao, is then sent to get rid of them
  because that's what the people want...? Okay. We filming them getting killed
  or what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, in case you are really confused at what is happening
  now, let me fill you in. Firstly, about Yoshi-san. Yes, the final
  confrontation is up because guess what if Yoshi-san is intent on letting
  Chisato live he would've stayed there while the duo take down Majima, but
  obviously he's a guy of that Institute so don't ask me to explain to you the
  extent he will go to to ensure Chisato kills someone with live rounds. He
  himself is at risk he even wanted to sacrifice himself or that artificial
  heart that is inside him too by the way he has one also, Takina was at risk
  because Yoshi-san's sidekick appeared and trust me this girl wanted to kill
  the woman so bad thank goodness every time Chisato stopped her, so yeah, going
  their own ways might be a good choice. Maybe what was harsher was to shorten
  Chisato's life back then. Maybe. But to be honest? I rather see Chisato's
  funeral than Yoshimatsu's funeral at this point? So... yeah, as mentioned
  before, Chisato has crazily outlived her presence. Whether it is to save the
  country, or to be what Mika-san wanted her to be... it has all been a fever
  dream. Despite this fever dream being able to hold back a rival group which
  just which just stormed in over failed negotiations because the fotmer has
  been found out, despite this fever dream being able to save Takina, despite
  this fever dream being able to stick a USB drive into the new Tower's control
  system so that Walnut- I mean, Kurumi-san can do her thing and take over
  Radiata and play whatever that is the new Lycoris theme park attraction lmao
  "killing in your nearest Disneyland this holiday season" haha, despite this
  fever dream being able to save Lycoris reputation singlehandedly even without
  instructions from Kusunoki who just did a long time at the toilet haha thanks
  for the 4G LTE phone call to Mika and that heli I guess... this would all have
  never happened if not for the initial save from Yoshi-san. For that, we can
  only thank Mika-san for doing his job. And Yoshi-san for not trying to die.
  Like, him being alive doesn't make Chisato more of a killer so why are you
  still around? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Majima's still around, that's why. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, I
  guess we're not done yet. We really aren't, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> After so much
  of talk this episode, you would think, eh? Haha well it's not up to any number
  of them Lycoris, just so you realize. But things have changed since then on
  Chisato's side while Majima is busy getting himself out of the old Tower. So
  what will be of their fates? I guess we can figure this out somehow. What I
  will say though? Someone's gonna die. How many though, it's up to these two.
  See you then.

  [TL:DR; Yoshi-san's confrontation is the most boring. Of this series. Think
  about it. No really, who cares about Majima why am I not pissed at Yoshimatsu]

    >Akarin</a
  >&nbsp;despite being a fanclub member&nbsp;haha can you say that again to me
  though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where this series also refuses to end
  similar to Kanna's demon will (#EngageKiss12), maybe we can do something about
  this situation. Which situation? Yes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's talk about all of
  them.&nbsp; Firstly, the situation about Kisara's memories. So apparently,
  truth number one and that's why all of Shuu's memories can be returned, I
  almost forgot that memories need to be consumed in order for the demon powers
  to work, instead of Shuu's memories though Kisara chose, of all things, to use
  her even lesser amount of JK memories, to get rid of every demon so far. Yep,
  talk about cringe, right? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> As such, Kisara remembers nothing now, but
  Shuu knows the whole truth. Whether this is a wise choice or not is a choice
  in itself, but let's just say Kisara is on the hospital bed so is not in any
  capacity to fight... for now so we shall deal with her later. Even the
  infamous kiss between them has been reduced to be on the forehead. Dammit.
  What has this series become? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I WANT MY MOUTH TO MOUTH AND THIS SERIES
  HAS NOT DELIVERED lol okay me. The next situation, we talk about Kanna waking
  up. Yep, the demon has not fallen, she has awakened, that Asmodeus
  reincarnate, and is wrecking havoc in the city with international media
  watching the Mayor falter at his words lol. Ignoring the cameras watching this
  action including ours too we just have more exclusive footage haha is this how
  news media works, we have to really stop or get rid of Kanna any way or
  another at least, just so this won't be any more worse or anyone is to be
  killed in the process. I mean, Kanna-san is also nice enough to not kill
  anyone so far so that's good. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But getting to Ayano is her priority
  so- Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, turns out, and man I don't even want to argue
  with this logic, we have shared memories in this case between these siblings
  somehow I guess it's possible it's half demon from the human father anyways,
  so she can peek into Shuu's memories all this time even if it has been passed
  on to another half-demon cousin? Okay, Anime logic, hit me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I guess
  there's a buffer betwren Shuu doing something and it being taken away from
  him) Kanna-san did hit her brother though, so that probably hurts. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  What will probably hurt more is the invoice the government has to pay when
  Shuu ordered whatever hovercraft there is so he can fly around, save Ayano,
  tell her the sex was great lmao that's important btw, and also fight Kanna-san
  at the same time. This is the least hype I have watching an action series, by
  the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, good to know that talking to Kanna-san is working at
  this point, since she saw everything and what a surprise, the j-j-j-jealousy
  effect is happening again- I think it's a problem not just for women, but
  specifically female human-demon counterparts. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not least
  situation, and to sum all this up, let's talk about what will happen next in
  the final episode. Well, that hovercraft is going to run out of fuel at some
  point, so it's just a matter of time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What will run out of time too
  is obviously Shuu's capacity to fight considering he's blocking attacks using
  a demon sword and is not an A-class demon himself, will just run out of
  stamina before the thing holding him up in the sky would. Luckily, we have
  Kisara's written note on her palm to thank for, I suppose. And we are noted
  that Kanna-san will once again be sealed so back to the Hell of unrestrained
  memories where she will continue watching her brother enjoy loving all the
  women he can with everyone else besides her, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Man, one would
  wonder what would be worse than Shuu's demonic behaviour towards lying to
  women but THIS. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, the action's lit so far, maybe the power
  plant will be MVP and explode to help out in some way, but one thing's for
  sure: Men can always be forgiven at the end. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> So will Kanna-san too lmao
  we shall see if this holds true I can only talk about Sharon's tentacle suit
  for that long HA! haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Kanna is not important a character in this series, she can die.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Kisara though, on the other hand... If you kill her this series will
  be worse than "Glasslip" haha]

  this week haha. Contrary to what I said last week and boy do I feel dumb right
  now, I actually have stuff to listen to on the week itself. Firstly,
  <a

    target="_blank"
    ><b>No Buses' new album</b></a
  >
  and not just one song was actually very similar to vocalist Cwondo's new album
  I've only heard two months ago because he doesn't know how to keep his hands
  off putting extra things that shouldn't be in a Rock song lol but what do I
  know, did still impress me with their latest songs and literally because also
  I missed that online livestream some time ago and would've already known one
  of the new songs in the album- I feel real dumb now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, did
  give a couple of songs so that's that. Also released this week was

      >marble's new song</a
    ></b

  and boy is this a name I've not heard of in years, is for some game I think,
  and it's emotionally nice. So yeah, not perfect but it's been a while so I
  decided to give it. I also did take a short trip to Audioleaf as mentioned
  last week and gave

    target="_blank"
    ><b>MOMO's song from 2020</b></a
  >
  a chance because that's probably the best one I can find in the list- They
  released a best album last year and I don't even see half their supposed music
  library spanning years on music streaming <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay we should give them a
  break they are better than

  and if I really don't want to give them songs I still have that backlog of
  live performances I can listen to... maybe next week also I guess<br />

    >about Aizawa Saya</a
  >(-chan) and her role in "Engage Kiss" as Kisara and in the Q&amp;A section
  (and I am not joking here) asked what would she give up in exchange for a
  demon contract power and she said the clothes she was wearing at that time.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, and that's how I spent that very night thinking about
  nudism. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, are you truly free if you are wearing something- See
  you guys next week then,

  Crossing: New Horizons" right now. Yes, 2 years after it released. Okay but
  can I go to her island though hehe

    >"KanoKano" getting a 2nd season</a

  by the way, so more stupid two-timing romance logic I guess. Haha can't say
  I'm not excited for either but I am more for the latter even if it's more of a
  joke lmao okay we're done
