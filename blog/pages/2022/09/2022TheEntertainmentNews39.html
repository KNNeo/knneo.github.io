Well, I gotta start this post a little earlier because we got new shows to talk
about too!
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Yeah, it's the last week of September and what comes after that is just a
  whole slew of Anime that I won't watch- Hey I've already given FIVE shows this
  season don't expect another miracle like this to happen after what we did this
  for <em>two seasons straight</em>, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also the forwarding
  service dropped me another item days after I shipped out so F**K ME lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Sad things aside, not everything will go according to plan not even the story
  ending to video game "Bear and Breakfast" I feel like I've been completely
  betrayed <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> so let's talk about happier endings... maybe? I don't know I
  haven't watched it yet haha<br />

  We've reached another checkpoint in the timeline once again, where I will talk
  about more drama and everything in between in the animated universe of Japan
  for the next few months. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, below are my opinions of Anime to
  end the year, and let's hope I don't have a laundry list to watch this time
  around, fingers crossed:
  <div>
    [In simulcast chronological order and if I watch, in square brackets]<br />
    <div>
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>
          Hmm I don't think I will be watching "Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga
          Nai" because it kinda reminds me of business genre Anime series which
          I detest, but otherwise it's just Anime
          <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rakugoka" target="_blank"
            >storytelling</a
          >... in Anime. Haha okay it's more than that, but I... just am not
          keen on the elements to give the rest- Oh hey GARNiDELiA lol <span class="emoji" title="😌">*phew*</span>

          [Premieres 1st October 2022] because I can take another season of
          jokes and cringe romance moments that goes so well with rice (I don't
          eat while watching btw but) I HAVE to see what else this simple love
          story has to offer. With the introduction of the brother at the end of
          the first season, and many new characters to come, I just hope what I
          remembered from its slower storytelling pace would not stop me from
          liking this series once again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shout out to all the sequels including "Hero Academia" and "SPY x
          FAMILY" that I don't give a shit about lol my sis does though- Wait
          there's "Conan" and "POP TEAM EPIC"?? Okay haha I don't care

          >&nbsp;[Premieres 1st October 2022] but I don't see it being a great
          premise if the new emperor just wants to do whatever he wants... to a
          woman who can do everything haha I mean, I know this won't turn into a
          porno but heck, I don't want to know more about it with the context of
          period drama. I may have to pass on this one- Also I still haven't
          watched "<a

          this isn't bad...?

        <li>
          I've heard stuff from "Do It Yourself!!" but yeah, not into this genre
          where girls can fix stuff better than me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          I saw the promotional image for "Akiba Maid

          and I'm already like <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> haha

          I stan for "K-ON!" so don't try me with "Bocchi The Rock" lol you can

          [Premieres 10th October 2022] a.k.a. the Thousand Year Blood War arc
          which is the final arc of the manga series before Kubo-sensei decided
          to end it, is finally in animation! Man, if you would ask what I would
          expect from this ever so final adaptation, is that they don't suck.
          Period. In detail though, this will be a good time to show all the
          animation of sword releases of all the

          is in this, and theme songs are selected by Kubo-sensei himself... I
          really just hope all of this will make me satisfied as a fan. Trust
          me, I could not put that imaginary sword down as I sleep every night
          swinging it by my bed: That's how much I want this to be good. Oh
          yeah, and blood; Thank goodness we're in late night simulcast so
          DEFINITELY not puke because this is no longer a primetime slot and I
          <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span> Monday nights instead now haha

        <li>
          I don't know what to give of original Anime "Renai Flops" after I've
          given two of them this season already lol, but I highly doubt the
          girls in this series will make me want to watch whatever will happen
          with this guy who lives with them holding panties. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> No
          really, I'm fine with dealing with this type of plot haha also the
          comedy from the trailer is weird lmao everything is weird why must
          they put in so much visual contrast in the characters

          >&nbsp;[Premieres 13th October 2022] but considering it's two cour ie.
          this will span till March next year, I don't think I will watch it at
          all just because I don't want long series now. Starring a new cast of
          people for the main characters and yes

          is how I knew of this, I still would think twice mainly because it's
          talking about alien love. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Man, what is Anime even haha
        </li>
        <li>
          "Yo-nin wa Sorezore Uso o Tsuku" sounds like a cute slice-of-life
          series until they had to lie. Honest me will not stand with this so
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        Oh wow, just two and they are sequels?? Hmm... maybe I'll pick up a
        couple of maybes I don't think the rest I mention here will actually be
        good but maybe I'll watch an episode and we'll work from there. Also
        great time to take a break from Anime though, my past few months have
        been watching all the shows through a Sunday afternoon and... I want to
        do other stuff lol okay me

        I mean, Marinka is in "Karasu" and "Urusei" has Sumipe so I'll figure

        year ago lmao<br />

          </div>
        </blockquote>
        Yeah no one else but Yume-chan fainted when Mizuto wore his yukata- Ah
        hey, I wish I was someone's fetish. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode of an
        interesting series which didn't serve to impress but made me think
        otherwise (#TsureKano12), I was totally expecting incest, by the way.
        Not gonna lie. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, in case you wonder if this is the conclusion
        to the original work ie. the light novel series, don't think too deep
        into it because it's unlikely haha, but we can talk about how they made
        this whole. Firstly, the festival. Two years later, the two finally got
        back alone together, seeing that Mizuto is clearly avoiding hanging out
        with his family for his own moments, but maybe, just maybe, she wants to
        be with Yume-chan even all those years ago. Remember when he said his
        phone ran out of battery? Some family member found his secret hideout,
        likely so. So yeah, if we think of it this way, Mizuto just had to deal
        with obligations, as much as he wants to hang out with the girl.
        Yume-chan, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Even Mizuto explained to us himself, that
        he really wants more of the reality that is dating someone who is so
        much weaker than he thought and he must protect. I mean, I've never been
        there for I'm the one who was weak so good on you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe, just
        maybe, it's because Mizuto thinks that Yume-chan was the one, and it
        probably is even if the past has concluded, that still makes him a kid.
        Maybe it's also because Yume-chan who still loves him after all these
        years which made him not be able to forget the days they were together.
        As not siblings. Yep. That's already just sad talking about it and just
        viewing the fireworks after they have not done so for two years
        straight. Oh yeah, and that kiss. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, siblings, dude. Kissing
        between family members is normal. Just maybe not mouth to mouth
        HAHAHAHAHA okay remember what I mentioned about incest? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways,
        screw you Isana and your rack. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Grow your hair longer. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
        Okay we need to stop these jokes, they already said it's a coincidence.
        It is also this coincidence and of course we cannot NOT talk about love
        at first sight, that brought these two together. Ah, remembering my days
        when I had a crush on someone... yeah I know it's not the same but it's
        something like this <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>, but suffice it to say that both of them
        remembered each other but of different reasons. This much, they will
        never let this intimate relationship go. Whether it's as family, or as
        exes, or even an amalgamation of both because who says you can't marry
        your stepsibling lmao oh you can't huh, then just shows how much they
        have grown. All in all, I just think this is a great series to chill off
        after all the romance stuff we have watched these few seasons and just
        lightly talk about something as complicated in plot but as simple as
        talking out each other's minds. Heck, we even know Isana is a male.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh come on, only Kawanami doesn't know that sh*t and thinks
        he's still the only friend here- Bro, why can't we have more friends?
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well I only have the one technically so I can't gauge anything
        here so ANYWAYS COMING BACK haha, this is definitely a show to watch.
        It's not dramatic as you would think, but it's also not so boring until
        I have no feelings towards this series just like how Mizuto would feel
        about Minami-san being her girlfriend. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's just a joyride,
        that's all, just like how the Irido siblings have been, and just how I
        have been in the past. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> It truly was, a sad affair. Haha finally I
        don't have to reference book titles LOL I only know so much dude you
        can't do this to me

        "Those are for today's tea, though? Mine are for to eat whenever"
        Mell-chan what a chad haha in this final episode where I guess we
        dealing with capitalism now lol (#Arusuno12), we gotta talk about the
        prices of a lot of things. Firstly, let's get this out of the way, the
        price of war. As we have seen being hard cut into and out of as if they
        are invading Ashram lol, the Knights are fighting against some enemy
        force. So yeah, the price of war for them isn't that much to be honest
        their commanders are well equipped with ways to defend against archers
        and the normal troops, but until the day they can find their threat and
        eliminate them hopefully not in the form of cute girls lol, the price to
        pay will only increase over time. Another thing that is also increasing
        in price are
        <strike>the groceries in my country</strike> the girls buying more stuff
        for their afternoon tea, anticipating good old Alberta ie. the elder
        sister's return. So yeah, just a simple round-up of stuff at the bakery,
        we see our occasional Lidel-san because in case you aren't aware is an
        Anime original character they gotta make her appear somewhere so why not
        let her find stuff all around the campus which she can easily replace?
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, you would think I know how to write the story for this
        series. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And then everything else seems to fall in place
        nicely. From my delight of trying out scones and whatever is pancakes
        with cheese *umph* haha, to knowing about not Pica-chan who is just the
        symbol of mannerism, we ended up knowing about cool Abramelin who casted
        the one magical spell to prevent a fall even though I swear it was to
        make me fall... in love with her lmao, Tori-chan's subtlety in
        everything and of course as a cheat code to facilitate storytelling or
        else we will find specific objects in a matter of years, Mell-chan and
        her lively personality and cuteness above all else somehow just doesn't
        fail to impress even when she is in a panic lol, and ko-Alberta which is
        the cutest existence I've seen in this series, no further arguments.
        <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Because all in all, who really cared about the Knights
        fighting against the Listeners, or if any of that ties to the actual
        game? I believe it's the origin story for the video game it is adapted
        from, but who cares. All I know is that I enjoyed these three months
        basked in the joys and stories of the girls in this magical school of
        manners and a lot of afternoon teas, and that's fine by me. Again, if
        not for me looking at
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >Yukimura Eri</a
        >'s list of shows she was casted in three months ago, I would have NEVER
        gained any interest in this series at all, trust me. And I'm glad I did,
        this is one heck of a slice-of-life masterpiece. Maybe the guys weren't
        necessary after all, even if for relevance. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, thanks
        for the Anime for this, I understand why mobile game "Alternative Girls"
        didn't get an actual Anime adaptation just because, but damn, this was
        such a ride, I'll remember the tales again of not the Knights in time to
        come.

        Oh come on you gotta turn off the power right now? Well RIP Sakura-san,
        didn't expect someone to die before Chisato. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay serious talk
        about the final episode of this fantastic action series- Anime original
        by the way (#LycoReco13), there is nothing serious to talk about.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, they took us for a ride, and then some. What was
        serious though, let's talk about that first. The shootout at the lift?
        Someone got hurt. Spoiler alert, not Takina haha, for she has to save
        Chisato as now being left alone with Majima after he appeared once again
        even though we thought he was done. Sakura-san got hurt instead, and
        between a choice of bringing her down to ground level from the Tower to
        save her and saving Chisato with a weakened heart per se, the team went
        both ways. Well, Takina did. And yeah, she did save the buddy after all.
        Then, the cover-up. That was serious okay? They were making a movie
        about Lycoris. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What, they have to come up with something since
        Walnut did anyways, so they had to go along with it haha I like how all
        talent agencies deny the portrayal of the bad guy in this movie since no
        one wants to tarnish their reputation. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also serious talk,
        Yoshi-san had to die, thanks to Mika-san. Yes, Kurumi is technically
        correct, Mika is not only just a commander in the DA, but also a
        professional at protecting Chisato as he has always did all these years.
        From faking his walker to throwing the new birthday message meant for
        Chisato away which should come along with the new heart, he has done it
        all to protect this girl as I guess a dad. Even if it means killing the
        mom. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well Alan Institute is screwed up too might as well draw
        the line here and now hehe not like Chisato appreciated the necklace
        return even if she is so far away from the capital already. Now that we
        are done with serious stuff, let's talk about all the jokes. Well for
        starters, Majima doesn't have much up his sleeve besides getting rid of
        Chisato as an effort to rid of the DA. The explosion countdown is just
        for the fireworks lol probably meant for something else but not like
        they can change that since Robota was arrested, his gun not being
        returned to any authority probably doesn't symbolize anything because
        how are you going to survive a fall down such a huge tower(?), and I
        guess he did his job as bad guy to expose even just a little of the
        Lycoris to mainstream media. I mean, you can cover everything up but you
        can't change the movie title. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then, it's the aftermath.
        Clearly no one is dead other than Yoshi-san in this episode ironically
        lol, and yes that includes Chisato which after realizing she has
        survived a surgery and in a hospital not operated by Yoshi-san's
        assistant this time who knows what happened to her I suppose Mika uses
        real bullets so RIP, escaped to a far away land before she was found out
        by, you guessed it, the couple who took a photo for Episode 1. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
        NOW you know this is an original series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, between
        covering secrets and finding a new purpose outside of the DA as the café
        now is mobile and travelling in Hawaii lmao, the jokes will never end as
        long as they can make it funny. All in all though... I didn't expect
        this series to amaze me but it did, just like how everyone experienced
        this I guess and how it's on Trending on Japan's Twitter for every
        episode it has aired. For what it is though? Hmm... I guess I expected a
        bad ending. They already made it sound like Chisato's death is
        inevitable, but they didn't, and I guess Mika did keep her alive so what
        the heck. Also, probably a better story if she actually died, is what I
        walked into thinking about. But hey, I didn't write the story, we can
        keep this mainstream by telling less stories of death. I mean, they had
        to censor the shooting of Yoshi-san you think this show is not for 12
        year olds? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'll only say that much that I'm not totally
        impressed, but it is very well done, even if it's just a farce of
        society woes they can only treat as serving food in a café, where we
        always want something special. I'll leave you guys at that haha Chisato
        is still mine btw I'm her real dad lmao

        Wait, why still play the opening? Oh maybe because we have 13 episodes-
        WE HAVE THE BUDGET, GUYS! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode of a
        rollercoaster ride we have been so far (#EngageKiss13), you know, we're
        just settling a family conflict. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, if you thought
        stepsiblings were trouble wait till we talk about long-distance
        relatives!!! Haha okay I'm tired of making jokes let's end this.
        Literally, they just don't want to end the fight haha let's talk about
        how it actually ended though. As Shuu mentioned, it worked before, so he
        told Kisara to literally stab Kanna-san in the chest so we can at least
        get rid of Asmodeus presence in her, I guess. Not the most confirmed of
        solutions, but this is Anime original maybe we let them get away with it
        haha also the fighting scenes are great too so that's nice reminded me
        of Ichigo vs Aizen in "<a
          href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach"
          target="_blank"
          >BLEACH</a
        >". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yes, and I meant Kisara was cool, the one who lost all her
        memories to Shuu, the one who remembered what happened because she
        employed the same memory cache method as Shuu ie. writing on her own
        hand what to do, and as Kanna accidentally released demons into the area
        the rest of the companies did not leave or stop to watch but instead
        helped out which is great for justice but not great for Mikhail's
        pockets since he's still not the new leader and has to ask the father
        for more after he gets shitted on by international media. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That
        concise enough for you? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, the kissing still works somehow?
        I thought that was part of the contract that was cancelled- Oh well.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Somehow everything went as planned as Kisara cleared the area
        of demons too after dealing with Kanna-san, she looks fine but will be
        sealed as she is still technically the demon's incarnate apparently we
        can't get rid of that for her but Kisara did wipe off Asmodeus's soul
        stemming in her? Okay, you get the idea, very logically explained.
        <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Sharon has to leave just because she is already going to get
        punished by not fulfilling her duties for the Church which don't imagine
        how much she will be violated HELL YEAH haha okay me... and I guess
        Kanna-san won't stay sealed after all she has all the power to go
        against Bayron City without releasing demons anyways. Okay NOW it's a
        harem. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well maybe without Sharon but we'll live with that loss
        lmao come on where is season two where it's just Shuu's love problems?
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all though, I guess this is the most reasonable
        conclusion after what changed my impression around with Miles'
        appearance in this whole incident revealed so abruptly AND DON'T YOU
        DARE OFFER CIGARETTES AT HIS GRAVE lol, everything seems to make sense I
        also don't believe they can seal or kill Kanna-san anyways so I guess
        Shuu has to be the one monitoring her demon status I suppose instead of
        let the authorities deal with it, and everything else... well Shuu I
        can't help you bro you literally tricked Kisara into your place I don't
        know how you can deal with these two kids switching swords AND Ayano-san
        together. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, as for comedy? I like to say this may have
        offered much more because it has a romance premise slapped on to it, so
        we can just dunk on this as much as we want, and that's good since
        single me can live with these romance jokes. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Other than that, I
        mostly enjoyed everything in this chill storytelling I guess. Demon
        fighting is a meh, storytelling is even more of a meh, but the romance
        part is probably what I will be in for if they want to give me more. In
        the upcoming mobile game unfortunately so don't expect them to do Anime
        again. I'm satisfied with hearing Kanna-san's voice actress

        So this week, we aren't quite at the peak season this month yet (lol
        does that even make sense), but I still did listen to some songs for the
        week.
        <b

        isn't exactly impressive as I'm reminded of their melodies and mostly
        pop style elements that aren't my taste which only makes me question how
        many songs I've given last year AND placed them in first place in
        Klassic Note. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oh well, maybe next time then even the topic
        songs didn't land on me. I also watched some live performances and

        this year a chance after listening to one of the songs about summer so
        light-hearted, but then am faced with the nightmare of pop tunes from
        them so maybe I'll try to give another song next week is all I've
        gotten. In terms of melodies though, none of these two are exactly great
        when they make me hear obvious extra note endings for each line, is one
        of the problems I can detect easily lol it's just me I know<br />

        in November and don't ask me what's in the tracklist lol Track #2 title
        is literally "I'm in love with Ajuju" lmao IT'S A TRAP haha let's see
        how good that song is first. You think this will be more matured than
        Tomita Miyu's concept album announced last week though? lol<br />
        <br />
        So next week, let me bring up my list here haha, we have Natsukawa
        Shiina- Oh that has been delayed to November so ignore that lol,
        <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</b> in a while for an animated
        movie I would love to watch at some point but it's fine I can give songs
        first, <b>Touyama Nao's new album</b> which I will not hold my breath
        for but listening to the album trailer during her recent livestream we
        may have some chance, and
        <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new mini-album</b> which I <em>really </em>hope
        isn't disappointing. They haven't been exactly exciting for a while
        already so I hope their style doesn't die out on me. I really hope it
        doesn't.

        relieved of watching this season's Anime I barely had time to finish
        this post in time so... oh well I'm glad I've reached home lol we had a
        long dinner is all. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't think too much I don't have a
        "TsureKano" plot lol
