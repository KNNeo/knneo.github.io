I don't normally watch these, but heck, I've been listening to live videos all evening, I could use something else for a change. You know, like, some Aki-chan cuteness you guys won't get because she's married and I watched Anime when she started getting famous a decade and a half ago. Damn me, can you stop the backlash on yourself? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Well, we shall talk about new Anime instead, yes? At least try to be relevant to them kids but I can only be because it's all romance shows this new season I can only talk about how hopelessly single I am right now. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I should stop sh*tting on myself haha</div><div><br></div><div>Let's Anime and music then!<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime"><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Uh, apparently resting for a week last Sunday night so tonight for the new episode.

Heart</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Everyone in other labs wear regular clothes, so I wondered why" Because they are f**king LOSERS!! Haha GOT'EM</div></blockquote>Like really, are you cool if you don't wear lab coats being in a lab? Come on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode of a series I wouldn't expect to come back to (#RikeKoiS201), oh yeah hey Aika long time no see lmao voiced by dear Omigawa Chiaki by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like really, if I remembered anything from this series is that Yukimura is a dumb idiot for not appreciating the banger that is Himuro haha, everyone else is just here to talk about math and science, and Kanade-chan is MVP. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Let's not talk about my fetishes haha, instead we shall talk about what gives them the reason to do this sequel. Firstly, we have new characters. Uh... they are from the natural sciences lab, and uh... I think they might already be three seasons of Anime in. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> For yes, in order to expand their experiments of love, those two, Ibarada suggested them to another department of sciences considering this is university, who focus on saliva research. And I wouldn't say that I know of that much but I did watch whatever that last movie of "Kara no Kyoukai" is to know that anything saliva-related is disturbing to me lol, but yes, further analysis is easier to do and acquire once they acquaintance themselves to little boy Chris and his long time partner and whore (lol) Suiu (or maybe Fujihara if I can't remember that name) where you know, we are in a different level I guess. Considering they have experience being together (lol) and have also done some analysis on themselves too but of course not to as great of an extent to prove it, they serve to be the rebuttal of whatever we might have thought of now, so, how can you prove love being a project. But yeah, that's the whole point too just go find the English translation of this Anime's title, but unsurprisingly, they do it better than these two who thought they were going at it in the Okinawa trip kissing on the sunset. Yeah, maybe the mood isn't there or whatever, but as we know so far, we are basically in a different league compared to the saliva guys. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, this is the challenge in this new season, I guess. Next up, the.. uh... amount of rated stuff we might have to deal with. Because so far, we have only dealt with whatever Ibarada does to her childhood friend lol which isn't much compared to him towards that idol lmao, but yeah, as summarized by Yukimura, those aren't anything to get us disturbed... until they LITERALLY just placed a whore inside this series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, I want to be nice, but goddamn, Suiu has everything and anything else but decency. Like, really. We can only get that many jokes out of the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> levels we are going to experience in this Anime, so let's see how far our oxytocin levels can go before thise psychological triggers happen. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Lastly, well, everyone else, of course, as much as we can get them in. Forget about Yamamoto that artist or something, but from Ikeda-sensei, to the straightness of Kanade-chan which never gets old because look at that new couple looking more ridiculous than the current pair lol, to Rikeikuma being a piece of shit teacher voiced by a cute girl (lol MOCHO~!!), to Ibarada and Kousuke being themselves... it's quite a trip to get back after whatever miracle of a kiss happened in the first season. All in all though? I have a harsh feeling this is going to lose to the competition. Not because I have been in a lab software project myself at work that'll make me cringe watching this on the weekends lol, but something else tells me that ignoring science we can definitely make things more interesting. Remember guys, the first season was aired in literally the quietest season of romance shows which helped it a lot. Now that it has to compete with the other romance sequels we have to watch starting next week? It's like Yukimura and Himuro against the saliva pair, dude. How can you just beat the kissing when like, Komi-san just smiles and half the class drops dead? Haha we shall see about that in the following months, I guess. Great idea to use this to jump back though, I really am wondering what is for the ending for this season now.<div> [TL:DR; "Is R-18 stuff okay?"

Animated them 2 pixels of it; She be talkin'. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>  In this new episode of a new series I know I can get into (#AharenSan01), I know it's a love story again but you know, there's always gotta be some quirk to it. Uh, I don't know how to describe it, but I'll take it along the lines of social distancing *OOF*, but not of a pandemic because she will be quarantined to hell haha, but of just socializing in general. Meet Aharen Reina, a cute little girl (voiced by <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase target=_blank>Minase Inori</a> and that's how I knew of this hahahahaha) who is nice and friendly but... you can barely hear her speak. And it's not just because she can't communicate (haha), she can she has more friends than me <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, but that's the problem in itself. Maybe, Raidou, you should talk to the OTHER guy beside you in class. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, story. There are a lot of things wrong about this we should clarify at first, just so you know. Firstly, why is this girl sitting at the last row of the classroom? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I feel like this is a logistical mistake but Anime dude, one can see from the back of the class, she got 20/20 eyesight AND x-ray vision lmao. And then, her appetite. I really thought it's just her needing this much fuel but probably so, because from her waking up early and then crashing making the guy some lunch because his mother wasn't going to lol, it feels weird once again to have like, a little girl eating crazy amounts of food but hey when was the last time you saw those though? I like an unrealistic slice-of-life series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Even so, literally only Raidou who sits beside her thinks it's weird. Like, yeah, the others don't even care. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Lastly, how much they actually paid Minase Inori who voiced Aharen in this very episode. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm pretty sure she wasn't in the recording studio. Haha jokes aside, she did talk this first episode just in case people be complaining "where my Inorin at?" lol, since technically speaking one can hear Reina-chan here, just that, in order to hear her, you gotta have good ears which I think mine's a little screwed thanks to my sinus, and then you gotta be sticking on to her, or vice versa, to hear the magic. I wish this is a fever dream where it applies to IRL idols too lmao, but yeah, that just makes of a good joke considering Raidou went through everything to try to not make that closeness happen. Gotta say though, maybe you need to brush up on your not sciences lol since she be just throwing notes at you all the time. As you can see, this is just a straight out funny and ridiculous series and that isn't bad, but will this beat the likes of other romance series though? We will have to see. I liked the theme songs they are okay they dumped in TrySail anyways haha, the story so far is just flat out awkward funny, and don't ask me why it's produced by China. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, if you are finding a romance series where you get the cute girl to stick to you and that is still called being classmates only, you've come to the right place. Like really, if others don't want to be friends with her I'll do it. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Yeah, I saw that friend I assume lurking around the corner we shall see if someone else can provide a different perspective to this next episode</div><div>[TL:DR; Let's get this going, because Raidou's <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> for MVP!!

Procrastination, I might say, but then again it's probably also it's so hard to give anything I don't want to just jump away thinking that the likes of these regulars can't even get me anymore, so I'll need more time I guess. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%93%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9-single/1612434843?l=en" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new collaboration song</a></b> with Frederic did get in first though, so that's just totally me because I had to survive two days to the release schedule of Wednesdays in Japan's music industry. Other than that, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/honey-darling/1610121561?l=en" target=_blank>KANA-BOON's new album</a></b> is quite a disappointment as I ponder how to even give at least two songs to put them in the Collection Artists list. This, I may just hold back because of their real subpar songs. I can promise you that it's not because of their missing bassist, I'll tell you that much. Even the topic song didn't get me. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%83%8D%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9/1614579395?l=en" target=_blank>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new album</a></b> is clearly the winner because apart from the fact that I would have to review their single from last year even when I initially did not give that B-side which eventually I did, the rest of the album is too much nostalgia feels I gave half of them even with much deliberation. Goddamn, like, didn't realize I needed that much Ajikan until I listened to this album. As expected of a 25th year album release, eh? They got me real good.</div><br>I guess we have more news on Twitter we can talk about that is relevant to my music listening experience. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1509108175282180102?s=20&amp;t=KO3rGNlXWIrFKgxebJFsSQ" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's new song for fanclub release will have a music video premiere</a></b> on YouTube so I guess it might be released digitally too but who knows why put that gate there anyways, and apart from that <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1510232788620169217?s=20&amp;t=KO3rGNlXWIrFKgxebJFsSQ" target=_blank>Kitou Akari also announced her 2nd album</a></b> in her recent fanclub live event, so that's good news. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1509737723547959299?s=20&amp;t=KO3rGNlXWIrFKgxebJFsSQ" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song</a></b> (not the one in collaboration with Frederic we covered that last week) is for a commercial it seems Mia-san be taking on this popularity, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1509863156083875849?s=20&amp;t=KO3rGNlXWIrFKgxebJFsSQ" target=_blank>Scenarioart announced their 4th album</a></b> releasing in June and it's their new full release since I gave them money a year plus ago AND their <a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1509863397701083139?s=20&amp;t=KO3rGNlXWIrFKgxebJFsSQ" target=_blank>topic song's music video</a> is not bad tbh, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1510603563390873607?s=20&amp;t=KO3rGNlXWIrFKgxebJFsSQ" target=_blank>ClariS new album preview</a></b> on YouTube gives me hope that whatever is half the instrumental shorts is just making some of the songs good enough for me to give them a couple, and <a href="https://twitter.com/SPYAIRSTAFF/status/1509455648345714690?s=20&amp;t=KO3rGNlXWIrFKgxebJFsSQ" target=_blank><b>SPYAIR is currently on hiatus</b></a> with their upcoming lives cancelled due to vocalist IKE getting a relapse of his colon disease, it seems. Oh well, wish him a speedy recovery, to be honest; We just got you guys into Collection Artists list here we can't find another vocalist haha no really<br><br> Looks like it's Anime week next week again so what the heck, if <b>ClariS new album</b> and/or <b>TrySail's new single</b> for Anime series "Madoka Magica" are so bad I can't even give like, two songs, then I might just dig back into <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/prom/1612010684?l=en" target=_blank>Cocco's new album</a></b> I know we have listened to her also last year so don't ask me how this happened and when I will actually give this, and maybe <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/a-daze-in-a-haze/1568995661?l=en" target=_blank>DYGL's 3rd album</a></b> which I heard the one song from a live performance video. Like really, if I can get Anime songs to cheer me up I'm going for emo songs. We'll see how that goes by next week's post haha<br><br><br><br><br>Oh yeah, April Fool's Day jokes. Yeah, they had them this year too. Of course almost all of them are related to Anime so I didn't mention in the Klassic Note segment of this post, but let's see... Anime "Takagi-san" actually re-created <a href="https://twitter.com/takagi3_anime/status/1509546143675740170?s=20&amp;t=vviBDs8JenwG9bHOpgpeqA" target=_blank>Nishikata Quest</a> from the final episode of the recently aired third season and I did not play it lol, <a href="https://twitter.com/idolypride/status/1509549830292467719?s=20&amp;t=vviBDs8JenwG9bHOpgpeqA" target=_blank>IDOLY PRIDE mobile game</a> suddenly changed their talent to the manager lmao wtf, Anime "Uzaki-chan" announced <a href="https://twitter.com/uzakichan_asobi/status/1509547314733457410?s=20&amp;t=vviBDs8JenwG9bHOpgpeqA" target=_blank>two spin-off series</a> where Uzaki's mom and new character (goddamn haven't even see her yet) Yanagi-san become the main characters lol, Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" announced another <a href="https://twitter.com/bungosd_anime/status/1509546067955617797?s=20&amp;t=vviBDs8JenwG9bHOpgpeqA" target=_blank>high school spin-off</a> lol getting bored already isn't it, Anime "Kaguya-sama" new poster revealed <a href="https://twitter.com/anime_kaguya/status/1509546065518895113?s=20&amp;t=vviBDs8JenwG9bHOpgpeqA" target=_blank>the ramen kings as main characters</a> if you could recall the one episode where the guy professionally ate a bowl of ramen like a boss and lost to Fujiwara. What was NOT a joke though, is <a href="https://twitter.com/tonikawa_anime/status/1510543208983392260?s=20&amp;t=vviBDs8JenwG9bHOpgpeqA" target=_blank>Anime "ToniKawa" announced a special episode</a> to lead up to season two which looks from it is an episode about cosplay. Yeah. I rather Akarin cosplay but hey, this is as close as it gets. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Cya guys then, this is quite a long paragraph just talking about jokes, and until next time... I am enjoying my life without work (technically) until I have to resume later this Thursday so we shall see how depressed I get by then.
