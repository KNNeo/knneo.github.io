Five shows in a season, huh. Last time I did that it was like, 4 years ago.
Thanks, sequels. You helped out a lot on this lol
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Thought of writing a new post for Klassic Note for this long weekend but then
  again I got lazy and just want to play with my phone so screw me I guess. I
  still hope, me, that you are still planning for KN15YEARS with all your ideas
  in your brain though. I hope so haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Someday I'll do it, right? SOMEDAY!!??? lol <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, back to Anime and music but more of the former just because I think
  Anime and work are my life now. I don't know why, which isn't a bad thing to
  be honest, but maybe I need to brush up my gaming skills (if there are any)
  before I really don't know how to play video games anymore lol is that a
  problem? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well that Transport Fever 2 update drops by next month so
  maybe I'll play for a couple of days
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Let's go to the whatever below! I know you be asking where the package is but
  I can tell you, it's coming. It's coming. Hopefully it'll coincide with the
  holidays early next month which will make it even better hehe

      "Today, my eyes open once again in the depths of darkness" Did we talk
      about how dark this series is? lol
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Wow, this is real dark, Ibarada. Hey, the bravest goes to those who dare to
  talk about their problems, alright? Yukimura can't even convince himself to
  like Himuro, man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where apparently there's a kid
  around lol (#RikeKoiS203), seriously though somebody save this girl. I know
  Torasuke wouldn't but seriously, someone. Anyways, we talk about the one
  secondary character no one got interested in, so yeah not Kanade-chan I guess
  we should find out more of... whoever is in your dark house? Okay okay one
  thing at a time. Firstly, we talk a bit about Ibarada. Yeah, in case you may
  not have realized this after a season and a bit, she is kind of a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chuunibyou" target="_blank">chuunibyou</a>.
  Under her lab coat is literal gothic clothing probably born from her desires
  to be living in the dark, as with her abode with whoever that is, her mom?
  Yeah, that. From that, to how she treats the people around her including
  Torasuke her childhood friend to Ikeda-sensei who will flex on anything
  besides flexing his due efforts in front of this girl lol, it would seem like
  she is matured enough to get a hang of herself in life. Sadly, this is
  partially true, but the chances that she is enjoying herself at home is
  probably lower than Torasuke's chances of getting the new SSR character in the
  gacha lmao, but as you can see, this is what we call character development.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I like it though, some of this. Next up, Himuro falling sick. Yep, I
  don't expect to see this too, but hey, someone's gotta fall sick and I can't
  expect ripped Ikeda-sensei to be. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, thanks to Ibarada shoving
  Yukimura up again, he rushed to see if his girl is fine and likely not because
  the mom (shout out to her btw) is not there to pat her head, is probably
  exemplified by the after arrival of Kanade-chan who took the liberty of
  actually getting some food and medicine for the girl, at least is not cooped
  up in someone's blanket thinking about <strike>Himuro pussy</strike> the
  universe and how nice it smells. (But seriously, how nice did it smell? Haha
  asking for a friend) Yukimura didn't catch her cold too; He just, uh, caught a
  whiff of something else, hopefully something nice I would hope. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> You
  see, you won't get their cold if you are at their crotch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;Last
  but not least, also a consequence of the first from Ibarada, is Torasuke
  finding out his chances of liking his childhood friend. Bear in mind, that
  like, I was just expecting this stuff from season one even, so yeah, glad it
  took this long to come up. Because seriously, they have made so many
  references to how Aika in the game is similar to Ibarada, so shouldn't be
  surprising that they are drawing the parallel to this idiot now... Haha I say
  we give him a break the chances of him dating his childhood friend who is a
  jerk is even lower now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But serious question though, how can one not
  like Ibarada this episode? She's dressed cute all the time and you don't have
  to pick her up on the streets lol it's so (Anime) real, she's kinda sadist
  haha, and gets
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a> over
  exercising. Just like me but without the cuteness so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all,
  great episode to be honest I really got jebaited at Episode 1 and I'm glad
  that isn't the dealbreaker, and yeah more Ibarada action please just don't
  tell me who she is living with lol I have a feeling we might know that soon,
  and you know, sometimes Yukimura you need to use your EQ more. Very lacking of
  a boyfriend, to be honest- Well, not boyfriend we aren't sure they are dating
  yet. What are the odds of that happening, can we get a calculation going,
  Ibarada? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I'm not an exercise advocate so don't expect me to quote ANYTHING
  Ikeda-sensei has said haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>]

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Bedhead, huh. Remind me to comb my bald hair every morning. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this
  new episode (#AharenSan03), yeah in case you haven't thought about it yet, yes
  you are the straight guy, by the way. Well, because no one else is in this
  series to be honest. Even the dude sitting in front of Aharen is a joke.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So firstly, gravity's acting weird recently. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Previous
  episodes it's just screwing with eyedrops or something haha, but now we have
  hair? Okay, whatever scientist name, stop bringing in that thing that makes
  your hair stand up. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Sorry, not science enough to remember what that
  is) Well not a surprise that Raidou also cannot do much of it considering his
  own hair is also growing long, they decided to ask for help. You know, from
  the other person who has been spying on them since who knows when,
  Ooshima-san. Apparently she is super skilled at being a woman lol that is a
  compliment I promise you, and she can cut peoples' hair since she worked at a
  salon, so yeah, no problem Raidou, even if we shave their heads off we can
  just stitch it back lol it's Anime hair dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And maybe it's just
  because Reina-chan here doesn't know how to take care of herself to be honest,
  but it seems like all this time we do have Ooshima here who can help her with
  putting on lip balm for her cracked lips, put some moisturizer for her face,
  cut off her long eyebrows, stretch her back a bit, give her a bit of a massage
  of the feet while we're at it... You know, they do these at salons what are
  you laughing about. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, we have the farewell. I know right, we are
  only three episodes in, is this how they are going to get you to continue
  watching? It has been the pivotal point where people like me decide whether to
  continue. So yeah, which is probably why they are throwing all the baseball
  and I have no idea how Aharen won lol, and the cooking lessons so we can see
  Raidou suck a** at cooking lmao that was expected tbh, and the dancing so they
  can be YouTubers haha yes they can't really put that word in I guess the
  subtitles can't spell it out though... Yes all of those, for the remaining
  memories before we... change seats? Hey, changing seats used to be the most
  fun thing in class. But if you are the tallest in your bunch, you only get to
  sit at the back... with the shortest girl in class- OKAY HOW THE HECK DID THIS
  HAPPEN AGAIN. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, we know this new ending theme song is not
  going to blow up as much as whatever Anime "Kaguya-sama" did for that
  Chika-Chika dance lol, but hey, I'm just glad the budget is even there to be
  honest. Other than that, the pace is real slow and I'm just itching to see the
  drop for the jokes so fast, I'm just not used to this, just like how Raidou
  probably is still not used to having Aharen-san around, but that is just me I
  guess. But yeah, gotta say though? It's getting a bit dry on me, the humour. I
  don't know if it's just me, but I think I need a bucket load of lip balm on my
  face so I can stretch it out and laugh more on this... weird series that
  continues to serve out jokes without anyone laughing. So once again, you are
  the straight guy, so you better laugh, get it? It's like Inorin having to be
  funny and I laugh... which doesn't happen by the way she doesn't make jokes
  and this is the closest she will get to one haha
</div>
[TL:DR; I like to believe Aharen-san is just into memes. Like, when she had her
hair stand up, she thought of death metal too and you know, thought it'll be
good to headbang or something. Or to just dance like what she saw how content
creators do it online. Haha I get it girl, you funny]

    </blockquote>
    "Justice seeks nothing in return", huh, Miko-chan. Wait till you see how
    politics gets added into the fuel. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where shit
    on the stupidity that is Fujiwara Chika lol no offense girl
    (#KaguyaSamaS302), I guess we should continue doing so since we have
    technically dropped her IQ to be the lowest in the bunch, yes? You know,
    dumb enough to be called out to sing karaoke? Haha let's talk about what
    happened. In an alternate universe where Ishigami and Miko-chan go along
    with each other... well let's just say we haven't seen that yet, but some
    other timeline out there, it exists. Trust me, I'm the Einstein in this
    universe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, even with Shirogane coming up with ideas to get
    them to break the ice lol yeah Fujiwara probably can do better but that's
    the joke, I think even through "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu" target="_blank">skinskip</a>" which is technically not until the last resort will we ever see them
    bond... in any way possible, honestly. So never. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So unsurprisingly,
    Ishigami has nothing to compliment about because frankly Miko-chan doesn't
    know how much he did for her and also vice versa, and Miko-chan I understand
    you don't want them weebs to touch you in any way, or maybe just guys in
    general. I know, right, only those manly dudes who whisper sweet nothings
    can princess hug you- That's why I say just tear through the 2D image and
    bring in the voice actor
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/45025/Ryouta_Suzuki" target="_blank">Suzuki Ryouta</a>
    out. THAT is how you bring them together. (Haha what) And then, this must be
    the highlight of this episode to be honest the relations on everything from
    season two is just coming back and stuck somewhere because I don't recall
    everything, it's a trip to the karaoke. Okay, this is as nice as I can put
    it, but Shirogane you be popular dude, you gotta hang out with people dumber
    than you so you can actually get someone who isn't such a b*tch at
    confessing to you or heck, even just returning your feelings, you know.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey Kaguya no offense but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Somehow Hayasaka got concerned
    over this or maybe not depending on how much you believe in her lies lol,
    she got ordered to go join in the group date as it would look like, and make
    sure that Shirogane... make sure what again? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because apart from
    bringing up the breakup stuff lmao I really don't recall, that's enough to
    keep the guy at bay, and then more than that, I guess it's more for Hayasaka
    in disguise now to learn more of this guy so she can intel the master to be
    honest she does get a paycheck from the Shinomiya family lol, but yeah,
    great job at making it sound like a porno, appreciate it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And the
    author gave us a last second draw of the magnum on this one, because besides
    talking how big it is lmao, my guess when the two walk into a karaoke room
    alone probably went along the lines of this: Hayasaka wanted Shirogane to
    show his true self, the guy says ok and picked up the mic to say he's good
    at singing he has been trained before but you know maybe getting rusty, and
    the girl is ruined by his vocal chords. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Adequate, and I like how
    Kaguya had to call for help so why not call for the singing instructor who
    raised his skills to where he is at the first place. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This is such a
    plot line I can't even <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, what is with that ending theme
    song animation and how do they still have SO MUCH DOSH to do all these??
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like, we have new character songs, dude! Uh, not the one Shirogane
    was singing we can't figure that out to make it a song. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah,
    props to the tight storytelling on this to be honest, and the constant
    reminders that this is not just a pit of wits to confess each other's love,
    because there is no love. Not even close. I'm not lying that bookmark got
    more love than any of them lol cya guys for more not love stories

    Yes, Komi-san, I will talk to you a little longer in this typhoon-ridden
    morning. Well, in Tadano's defence, anyone would. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new
    episode where wow how can you put more character development on developed
    characters (#KomiSan14), let's sit down like a bunch of dudes with that
    samurai and talk about them girls in class, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We can talk all
    day about this class of girls to be honest: How Komi-san is just afraid of a
    lot of things in general so just one typhoon and blackout is enough to freak
    her out even her mom who is also kinda afraid has to console the dear
    daughter but thanks to Tadano's phone call he saved the day hehe, how
    Yamai-san is just filled with nothing but weird stuff to do to her
    <strike>love</strike> target Komi-san apparently something to do with
    panties in tights so shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/y_o_m_y_o_m" target="_blank">Yomu-sensei</a> I guess I found your BFF here
    lmao, so how does one even need to find girls who are literal cat magnets
    like that r-word Kaede so you won't have to get the most senior cat to sleep
    on your lap? But you know, those aren't that much of a thing besides adding
    to the friends list apparently lol the black cat stamped on Komi's friend
    list notepad, which is why I'd like to be a gentleman and bring all them
    guys in class to sit in a round robin and talk about what it feels like to
    date all the other girls in class. Tadano, you too, don't make us believe
    you don't want to get involved in this sitting on your own desk haha.
    Gentlemen, we are all in this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, now that we talked about all the
    other cr*p this episode haha just joking they are all great especially when
    the mom was so happy seeing Shouko holding up her phone and talking like
    she's normal lol. But seriously, "let's deliberate on this". (Haha shout out
    to one and only&nbsp;<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/165420/Goi" target="_blank">Goi</a>
    in Anime "Tsukumogami" this is how he starts his wisely thoughts) For if you
    can't imagine how great it will be to date any of them besides Komi-san, you
    should start thinking how great it will be to NOT date Najimi because- Okay,
    so why is dating Najimi a thing? We don't even know their gender- Well I
    guess unless it is identified they are just a friend to hang out with haha,
    Agari-chan is obviously NOT just chest but hey I guess it is then lol ma
    chest-loving bro can relate to this, Yamai-san if you're a masochist and are
    into her less than ideal shame and you'll only get that probably after 90%
    of your life ridiculed anyways haha I see this as a marriage problem,
    Nakanaka if you really are into games to be honest and that's about all
    you'll get out of her in my opinion which also means you gotta be kind of a
    gamer yourself tbh, Inaka-san if you have great desires to go back to the
    countryside lmao, Makeru-chan has a fanclub already as we know so that's not
    surprising to be honest we can make another "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san" target="_blank">Takagi-san</a>" if we wanted too haha says Anime producers, and... I think Tadano nailed
    it on the imagination of Komi-san as A LITERAL WIFE hahahahahahaha Tadano be
    like <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> All in all, don't ask Najimi to go to a cat café with you
    because the cats will reveal Najimi's gender lmao, don't ask Katai to do the
    "I love you" game with Tadano because... because... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>, and me
    watching every episode in this series is basically Yamai-san asking for
    panties and not getting them and still happy she liked Komi-san. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Cya guys for more random character jokes action because seriously with this
    much context we can only sink in to more of them isn't it?

      </div>
    </blockquote>
    Okay, so how is Shikimori going to protect you from the soccer ball if she
    has to play volley with the girls? Let's find out together. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this
    new episode where Shikimori will likely show her real self with some
    teleportation powers lmao (#ShikimoriSan02), Izumi can I make a special
    order for you, a riot shield? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, those that cover the whole
    body- Make it two, front and back. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, about the sports festival
    and tournament. Well, I guess it's just tournament we cannot afford to let
    Izumi run even one round around the stadium. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, good thing
    this series can still deliver on the misfortunes that will happen to Izumi
    bring rather unpredictable, but I think you guys may have noticed a pattern
    emerging, from him just standing on the field getting hit by a soccer ball
    to when Inuzuka blocked a volleyball in his place being in the classroom
    some floors up, is that Izumi doesn't care about his surroundings. Like,
    really. Even just walking down the steps he doesn't even look down like
    anyone normal probably would if not engaged in conversation. Heck, I would
    look too if I weren't by the railings. But you know, that's the charm of the
    series I guess? Also is the charm of the series is the highlight of a
    volleyball match after how Shikimori doesn't want to hide under the sheets
    with Izumi in the doctor's room lmao (haha ah hey, they be doin' it), going
    against what might be Izumi's acquaintance but we can probably figure out it
    has to be something to do with his past which I think I rather let the Anime
    tell me about <span style="font-size: xx-small;">that's his ex</span> haha,
    but Kamiya-san looks like the cool girl in school from another class
    apparently, similar to Shikimori here. But you know, this one here has
    boyfriend support so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, we don't know if Kamiya here has a
    boyfriend but CLEARLY she doesn't lol, as her class is ruined by Shikimori
    and Nekozaki's efforts in turning back the tides with you know, not
    Hachimitsu's cheering lol she is better off being the coordinator for
    handshake events these girls are getting AFTER they won the tournament lol
    but yeah, we only have one Hachimitsu so she can only cater to one talent
    unlike all them idol games where you take care of two dozen girls lol,
    cannot help Shikimori in keeping the fangirls away so Izumi can actually go
    home together with his girl. Emphasis on the "his girl", by the way,
    remember these two are dating? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because damn, in the time where
    Shikimori isn't by his side, the buddy Inuzuka has to take the hits for the
    dude, from buckets to vice principals lol, and now I rather we have a
    strong, protective girl to be by his side so we don't have to offer more
    sacrifices to the God of Misfortune. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also Izumi and that dude
    friend just kiss already stop creating j-j-j-jealousy- <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all,
    I am getting accustomed to the pace of story I hope, I still think it's not
    fast enough compared to the others I watch this season, ironically I am
    looking forward to more Shikimori cuteness or action whichever comes first
    lol, but hey, I have a feeling just like Shikimori having Izumi as fuel,
    with Oonishi Saori as fuel I can finish watching this lovely series. Just,
    just tell me Izumi will try to protect himself when he has to. Just, even if
    it's the one time, please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; You see, a very big caveat of this series is every episode has to
    have some physical action even if it's not between the couple. If they just
    hang out at each other's place and play video games all day no one will be
    into this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

    Yeah, I think this week I only listened to the one new album. Literally half
    the week is me listening to songs from video games whether it's licensed
    songs so
    <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1513896467143950336?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto series</a>
    or game soundtracks so The Sims, I think I'm just taking some time off to be
    in my comfort zone as much as I did take this long weekend to be in too.
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Though, I did give
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E4%B8%83%E5%8F%B7%E7%B7%9A%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BA/1614421250?l=en" target="_blank">amazarashi's new album</a></b>
    a listen and it isn't bad, it did remind me of how much I didn't like giving
    the melodies which is why I stopped listening to him back in 2017, but I
    guess I can give something here and there just because I have the mood for
    it which is hopelessness lmao the title is literally "lost boy" what else
    can you use to describe me at work now. And I didn't care about UNISON
    SQUARE GARDEN their music isn't even on Apple Music on day one.<br />
    <br />
    On music news on Twitter and why are we getting more sad news,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_Floor_/status/1515261384887762946?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">The Floor lost their drummer in action</a></b>
    (he's still alive FYI) so going forward on their live tour they are
    replacing their retired drummer due to his leg condition getting worse-
    Jesus Christ why,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1514891927363387392?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</a></b>
    is a meh so I hope the single next week won't suck lol,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1514540648418131970?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana did a dance video of her debut single song</a></b>
    to celebrate her 10th anniversary as a solo artist but also
    <a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1513519654672957445?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">there are livestreams</a>
    which talk about her direction going forward mainly releasing music videos
    and more live archives on their YouTube channel so check those out,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1514171759297437696?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's new single cover reveal</a></b>
    is not surprising it's even better with glasses lol I promise I'll not talk
    about crap like these again,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/martin40_staff/status/1514166507860725768?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">Suzuki Masayuki's new single will be released in June</a></b>
    for Anime "Kaguya-sama" unlike the last time which was part of his 35th
    anniversary album haha "Anime artist newbie" by the way, to celebrate her
    new live Blu-Ray release
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1513811939188948994?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">Kitou Akari released live videos of her recent live</a></b>
    on YouTube but I didn't care because I didn't like those songs selected- why
    is she touching the chair lol, and I think I need to listen back the archive
    on
    <a href="https://twitter.com/nanoripe_info/status/1514018738906951681?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank"><b>nano.RIPE's recent livestream</b></a>. Well, it isn't much and I don't know a good chunk of their songs to be
    called a fan, but you know, if you like some emotional tunes sung by a high
    pitched voice, they are pretty damn good. Yeah, so not for me anymore
    haha<br />
    <br />So for next week, I gave up giving Tomita Miyu's new single so don't
    ask me if I want to give her another chance the answer is no haha,
    <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</b> isn't very impressive despite the
    Anime movie credit so we shall see the B-sides, and of course the highlight
    must be <b>PHONO TONES' new album</b> which damn this took a long time to
    appear but I'm excited to see what is in store. Not getting my hopes too
    high up though the digital singles released in the past few months aren't
    exactly impressive.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Oh yeah happy birthday Suguta Hina, by the way. Thanks for bringing us the
    legendary acting that is Kitagawa Marin she literally sounds like you
    somehow lol I mean just look at
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JO5S29oH3A" target="_blank">her birthday livestream</a>
    and you'll get the idea. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Cya guys next week then, and considering
    the upcoming package will likely only appear after next week which is just
    more waiting, I need to find things to get away from the fact that I have to
    quit Futon-chan's fanclub by myself because it's ending soon. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Haha I
    guess
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hu_ton_/status/1515656979783438338?s=20&amp;t=sVLu2nALwfqi6WeOLmhq4w" target="_blank">she be sponsored by gaming accessories</a>

    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CccqO2zvVrK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">marupi-chan's chest is better</a>
