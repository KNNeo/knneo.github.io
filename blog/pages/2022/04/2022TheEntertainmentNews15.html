Hey, guys.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Serious stuff first on this blog, for once I am going to review within a post,
  SIX SHOWS but thank goodness Attack on Titan is once again delayed to next
  year so whatever haha, we might have more shows to watch on our hands than I
  might have thought. I hope the upside to starting earlier means I'll actually
  have more time to watch more shows that is still Anime but you know, I just
  don't have the time to catch them all.

  Maybe it's time to quit my day job lmao I won't be doing anything then haha so
  maybe not okay I need the paper lol let's go through these now I'm using
  Saturday to craft this post too which totally is just a way to make me happy
  reading my own thoughts-

  Dude, ever thought a car was a cow and you want to feed it carrots? Guess I'm
  not that much of a bumpkin to not know of that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this... <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>
  final episode of what is not the final of final season because it's been
  delayed to next year (#AttackOnTitan87), we see the whole Paradis crew dressed
  in suits. Like, how do we even pass that much time to have Levi recover,
  everyone had their tailored suits made, and Eren not flatten the rest of the
  planet by now? Last time we said the cruise was what, one week? Man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Okay, in case you haven't realized, this is a flashback. So firstly, in what
  should have happened between the 3rd season and this final season which
  refuses to end haha, the gang arrived at Marley. They enjoyed whatever they
  saw in just the port itself where they landed by the way oh also Eren is with
  them lol, they ate ice cream, saw cars whizzing by as fast as they can get
  their 3D gear going, and got pickpocketed by war refugee kids. Hey, every day
  life in a city I guess haha, but hey, jokes aside, we are more than focused on
  the thoughts of Eren. As he recognized that icy dessert Mikasa passed to him,
  we need to remember that he saw everything already, even though he has not
  experienced it, he knew of all of this, so maybe stop thinking why he isn't as
  high as the others especially Sasha (RIP) who just eats on everything and gets
  sloshed with the guys in the refugee camp even after some kid tried to steal
  their money... which I don't know is universal currency lol. (Well the Marley
  guys probably gave them some dosh) But yeah, all in fun and games and puking
  (haha) until we noticed Eren just doesn't feel like normal. Well, is he
  though? In his mind, even at this time, he was already thinking of getting rid
  of everyone outside of the island, so what else is new? Even telling to
  Historia and Floch and Yelena about his plans did not change his opinion about
  using Zeke as a way to invoke the Founder Titan powers and trigger The
  Rumbling, which will be his supposed way to flatten the rest of the planet.
  Gotta say though, really keen on the Protection Group that Hange was talking
  about, but I guess it doesn't matter now, huh. Anyways, to end this part
  before the actual final confrontation to Eren, we learn that Eren has already
  seen the world like this so far. Instead of going for diplomacy in which most
  of us would do if we were in his socks, he rather chose to "unify" the world
  altogether by eliminating enemies and setting up the final empire by himself
  so that you know, it won't come and bite his race of people in the future. You
  know, why do diplomacy if everyone else is dead? *taps brain* Shout out to the
  Titan who ate Eren's mom, by the way, worst decision-making ever. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But
  he did at the end mention about what he is intending to do, and despite the...
  not confession from Mikasa because we keep thinking she has that Ackerman
  instinct, is to protect the people of the island. His friends and maybe lovers
  and everything. I mean, base instinct I would argue, there are probably better
  ways to settle this, but then again you have that father and when you have all
  the power to summon a bunch of Titans which can swim underwater and be shot by
  literal torpedoes and still survive walking down the land crushing enemies
  along the way? You wouldn't think too deep on this either. Haha so yeah, looks
  like the cannons are not doing anything to these walls just as how they
  protected the island for centuries until Reiner came in and blew a hole back
  in season one lol that was so long ago, we are in the precipice of watching
  the world burn as the gang continue to reach Eren with their abilities to, I
  don't know, stop him? Can this even be stopped? Probably, who knows. What I
  know is I won't know of this and have to suffer from people wanting to spoil
  me on the original work until next year. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Maybe I'm better off being
  tramped by one of those Titans advancing to the other lands haha cya guys then

  [TL:DR; "The only way to end the cycle of revenge fuelled by hate is to bury
  our hate-filled history with civilization itself" Won't say that is right, but

  Yeah, these lover powers are so pathetic, dude. Maybe you guys should just
  have sex or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where they be still stuck
  at porno land haha (#RikeKoiS202), trust me, the most entertaining part about
  the fight of oxytocin is the afterword with Kanade-chan lmao let's talk about
  what happened I guess. But seriously, what is with this action series level
  Anime context or analogy? I don't get it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, let's talk about what
  new stuff were brought to the table. Firstly, love attacks apparently.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, apparently Chris and their couple power can do fireballs now.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, because I guess Chris is just flexing at their supposed lover
  power (which we will elaborate again later) which is so much more powerful
  than whatever the main couple here can do and I doubt it will get any higher
  at this rate, but you know, dude's gotta flex. I mean, I would if I was dating
  someone for four years haha <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on, I didn't realize there's a
  lesbian subplot here. Okay, remind me to never watch this series again.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because besides being a woman who likes Kanade-chan because she's
  cute and why not because I would too, I like how all of them play some role in
  creating sexual arousal for each other, as the three female cast is basically
  so far exhibiting three degrees of love from the scale of cute to sexy. Don't
  you think so? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Last but not least, Yukimura has proven the power of
  love. Yeah, season two episode two, ladies and gentlemen. He has proven it. HE
  HAS PROVEN IT!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Didn't know this season was so short, this felt like
  an OVA series instead. Thanks everyone, one less show to watch this season-
  Yeah right. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For Yukimura was just so far challenged by Chris who was
  just unhappy with how Yukimura can't get a grip on his relationship with his
  girl because he just is I guess, he kept using science to prove the shortie
  otherwise. But that's the whole point I guess, and in Yukimura's search for
  evidence to show why their results differ with a matured couple's, he came
  across research of theories proving that people emit different chemicals from
  their bodies as their relationship progresses. Hey, maybe that's why some
  couples just break up after three years, did you think about that? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyways, this is the episode I probably expected more out of than what was
  like a half porno in the first episode, so thanks Yukimura and Himuro for
  turning things around, literally. But yeah, don't really have to prove it and
  we know the guy likes Himuro, for real. We know, really, you don't have to
  prove anything, we know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So next episode... please tell me we have
  secondary character development. I mean, I'm not expecting it but if you
  skewer them together like a stick of those
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/dango" target="_blank">dango</a>&nbsp;I WILL
  TAKE IT haha cya guys then for more planetary orbit theories I guess ah hey I
  studied a semester of astrology in university I know my shit
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "Do you even possess the ability to respond to the feelings of such a
  woman like (Himuro)?" That's what I'm saying to him, dude! Haha Yukimura just
  do it man, I can't even]

  </blockquote>
  Yeah, Raidou, if anyone watching never ever doubted what happened to
  Aharen-san at every corner, you gotta start doing so man because this series
  will train you to do so! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So anyways, about this Reina-chan girl being
  weird haha in this new episode (#AharenSan02), she can sit on a chair normally
  though. Imagine if she sat on the floor every time as if someone pulled the
  chair on her? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Firstly, the eye drops. Goddamn, did I enjoy seeing
  this as I read the manga for just a bit to see what's up, so yes this is a
  good example of how screwed up estimation can be if you are Aharen Reina. So
  yeah, sorry if my sense of comedy is literally Aharen missing the heck out of
  her own eye using eye drops because something got in her eye, and Raidou had
  to do it for her. And then the reverse happened, and... Raidou had to do it
  for himself. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, I wouldn't even bother asking for help if I
  were him haha. And then, we talk about the bad things Raidou has done so far.
  From ruining flowers while playing soccer as a kid, to stealing the stuff from
  the fridge meant for his sister, to I hope that bread under that middle
  school's desk hasn't grown a mould garden yet lmao, Raidou hasn't been the
  nicest dude around. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Raidou has been such a bad person in general, he
  has garnered the presence of a professional <strike>stalker</strike> hitman to
  spy on him until he gets psychological breakdown. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't know how to
  put this nicely or shorter but you get the idea. Introducing new character
  Ooshima, and forget all the stealth characters you know in video games like
  Splinter Cell because she is better than all of them. Despite being bigger
  than the average female in build, this girl can hide in regular sized street
  dustbins (haha anyone know of Majima Everywhere?), climb between walls of
  buildings in alleys (lol Chio-chan reference), and stay totally covert in
  pursuit of just... looking at her prey, she never loses sight of them.
  Thankfully, it was all a misunderstanding, Ooshima here is Aharen's childhood
  friend until Raidou took her classroom seat in high school lmao, so uh... we
  good now? Haha I don't think so. Next up, why maybe we should all stop wearing
  masks in this pandemic. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not an advocate or whatever, but suffice it
  to say that without it we can barely hear Aharen unless she is in your face,
  so it doesn't really help when the mask also filters out her voice. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  So it might be a bit hard to tell Raidou that his fly is down... unless she
  does everything to protect his friend her from being found out by others I
  guess. Then again, Aharen-san, you could've just pointed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> did it
  anyways so that's honestly better in my opinion haha Rikachmalu~!! (haha sorry
  for being simp) Last but not least, just another day in Ooshima stalking her
  Reina-chan, and thoughts of why her friend is still sitting in class after
  it's over, looking at the rain. One would've thought of HANDING THEM AN
  UMBRELLA to know if she does have one at the same time, but no, this girl, she
  does things differently. But really, how do you even let someone use your
  umbrella if you DO NOT TELL THEM OF IT??? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, I mean, I can be the
  straight guy for days since Raidou isn't around so... Aharen stalking back the
  heck out of her childhood friend really reminds me of some
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HINYhLtaaxc" target="_blank"
    >hypothetical assassin snail</a
  >
  lol, but yeah, this Ooshima be the most timid friend I know of in Anime
  running away from what, your childhood friend? Like, weird. I guess they two
  make of a good pair, eh? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> But yeah, I can even talk about references for
  days where Ooshima literally wants to "walk home together" with Aharen-san but
  I think I will hold back for now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, it's crazy rare when
  we see straight colour boards in Reversi because you've ever played with the
  masters before lmao and that will hardly ever happen since to do that it takes
  skill from the loser too, but goddamn the jokes in this series are what keeps
  it going. I mean, what more can you take from this series where you get
  stalked all the time by some big girl (lol) and have a super nice classmate
  sitting beside you who can barely speak up? It's entertainment by the day,
  dude, the only problem is that we set the main guy to be someone who can't
  laugh. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Haha cya guys for more jokes next time

  Okay, that was an opening. You know how they continue from the prequel but
  slapped an undo button so they can place the school buildings back where they
  are at? I don't know that reference either. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new season of
  whatever is between these people because can they hold hands already haha
  (#KaguyaSamaS301), thanks once again for this blessing I could use more of...
  what was this series about again? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So firstly, I guess we start with
  cute Miko-chan and not USB type-C audio on smartphones. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Because
  seriously, not saying that I'm a fab for smartphones nor am I well-versed in
  3.5mm audio jacks haha okay, but saying that can happen might be an over
  exaggeration. Because really, if you can't hear your
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a>
  motivation speech right beside your earhole I'm PRETTY DAMN SURE you didn't
  pluck your audio jack all the way in. Like, thanks&nbsp; Ishigami for the
  unnecessary assist but Miko-chan is what I would call A F**KING IDIOT- Come
  on, she just wants some Ishigami voice actor Suzuki Ryouta level love, let's
  spare her the shame. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Sorry for the reference, joke is he is also
  ikemen) I know Ishigami, it's hard being cool listening to whatever Anime
  budget went into making that Anime song lmao- How do you even manage that
  Aniplex I can't even <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, also why you always check if your phone
  speaker is off; The volume down button on all my phones so far have been my
  favourite part. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And even then I screw up- MOVING ON!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next
  up, let's not talk about LINE, but messaging in general. What was shown on the
  episode is specific to the messaging platform, but I'm sure whatever you are
  using now will have a similar feature whether it's in a form of text or
  checkbox icons <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, but yeah, I would say though Hayasaka? Thanks for being
  MVP for (1) not telling your Kaguya-sama how to understand read receipts as
  apparently they were called so we can see some Shirogane reactions and call
  back through voice haha she should be thankful, and (2) then coming up with an
  excuse to make sure no one wants to message Kaguya anymore because they
  supposedly will be screened by old dudes not like you. Like, just the thought
  of that makes me want to delete that student council group chat, really.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We only use emails now, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not least, and
  I wonder how it took this long to get there, we have an arm-wrestling
  competition. So yeah, let's not let the lore from the narrator (lol hey bro)
  and/or the people themselves get in the way of telling a good story lmao, but
  let's just say even if all of them put in their best effort on this, ranking
  from last place it will still be Miko-chan the Intern because who bullies on
  cute first-year juniors hehe <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, Fujiwara the Secretary because she is
  only maintaining a healthy lifestyle not a strength training one, Ishigami the
  Treasurer because sorry for being sexist but he's a dude who will get his
  aches only hours after he tried too much (been there done that haha ah),
  Shirogane the President even if he tried not to show off too much since he's
  enjoying the finals match with his girl regardless, and Kaguya the Vice
  President because she rather win than let her sweat touch the skin of the guy
  she likes even if their hands are already held together by, you guessed it,
  that pink stuff we can't talk about that blew up the school at the end of
  season two. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> All in all, I think I know what I missed from this series.
  Its weird, wacky form of engagement. Looking back at the empty sections from
  this written review where I normally fill up the postscripts and starting
  quote before writing this, it's not like I don't have anything to write, but
  it's more like I won't stop to do it since, literally, at every turn, we have
  something else to look at and think about. And that, must be the essence of
  this series. You know, doing that storytelling so detailed, it's just funny to
  even think of all the possibilities before we get the answers. Like really, if
  you haven't thought how an arm-wrestling match finals will definitely feature
  the main couple even though they didn't start first or against each together
  at first you need to think again haha cya guys next week for more of these I
  guess
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Yeah, I know, Shirogane, I also like the idea of girls reading my
  texts and not replying because they be enjoying them haha oh well try again in
  your next life I guess lol I feel better not having anyone to text to tbh]

  P.S. Yes I hope you realized how much they wanted to replay that second season
  opening theme if I didn't remember wrongly where they showed Kaguya drawing a
  bow SO THAT THEY CAN CUT ON BUDGET SINCE IT IS THE SAME DAMN SCENE??? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  No really, stop saving money you guys we have the budget lmao
</div>
<div>
  P.P.S. From the new opening theme animation though and I guess the song was
  okay it can never win first season tbh, we are reminded of stupid couple I
  forgot the name give me a moment- Nagisa-chan and her boy, Miko's friend who
  apparently had her own club and mates to be with so more cute girls I guess,
  and Shirogane's sister Kei's schoolmates it seems. Is this season even enough?
  Haha just don't tell me it's two cour I don't have time for this

  </blockquote>
  I would say the start of this new... cour? Is very well summarized at the
  intro of this new episode (#KomiSan13) because goddamn Komi-san is just cute-
  Excuse me. Because goddess Komi-san is just cute. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this series
  where they took a break before continuing the next part considering how this
  is just so relatable to everyone including me lol not true I don't have
  friends haha, as summarized by Najimi apparently telling Komi-san to note down
  what she did with her newly found friends over the past few months since the
  beginning of her high school life, she has made a total of (and I applaud this
  to be a great way to recap all the characters in the first cour) 13 friends.
  So yeah, not much to be honest. Well, according to
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/osananajimi" target="_blank"
    >Osana Najimi</a
  >
  THE childhood friend of course because <strike>he</strike>
  <strike>she</strike> they have so many friends math can't calculate it so we
  just collectively say all are their friends. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But hey straight to it,
  we introduce the new character who is about to be her friend. Well sort of,
  because with
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/katai" target="_blank">Katai</a>-kun here,
  he is pretty much the same as Komi-san but is like, six months late due to him
  falling sick on day one and then hesitating to come to school until I guess
  the school had to prod him to. Having an image change did not help much too
  because now tall build him looks like a menace and every move he makes is an
  offense so everyone is afraid of him... until we get Komi's iconic stare haha.
  So yeah, Tadano the nice/normal guy saw through the new guy and showed him
  around the school, considering I'm pretty sure everyone knew he missed school
  for a while but didn't realize that's the problem in the first place. Because
  you know, everyone in Itan High School <strike>is just weird</strike> has
  personality including Komi-san herself, and they can only admit ONE normal
  person per class so... Haha this just brings back the feels isn't it? And then
  I guess studying at Nakanaka's place where she had to deal with
  <strike>yandere Hidaka Rina</strike> Yamai-san (lol) is just flair now because
  we be talking which is the better friend so we can make Komi-san even more
  scared of these two haha, and just a pencil dropping scene in the tests so we
  can be reminded how this is a romance series end to end. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Did I miss
  this series? Very much so, I would say. The character personalities are
  literally the author's draw to make content for this story anyways apart from
  the potential romance plot between the main two so yeah, this is a lot of fun
  to watch as it is probably to write. But yeah Nakanaka and Yamai, stop
  thinking Komi-san will deal with all of your shit because she is not
  interested in video games OR in girls talk because she can NOT possibly talk
  about her love for Tadano not because he's in the same room but because she
  will be killed for it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, the jokes are solid classics you
  will remember watching comedy series all this while if you haven't, the theme
  songs are fine I guess and yes I know I have to give Itou Miku a song now
  that's the biggest problem here lmao, and yeah, looks like Komi-san has to
  pick up her pace in making friends before her three years of high school is
  over if she wants to hit her goal of 100 friends. Can the author print out
  more characters to introduce than Komi-san can befriend? We shall see how far
  this takes in the awkward series you won't stop to come back and watch even if
  it's still priority licensed by Netflix. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Netflix why haha

    P.S. Komi-san gets handed over a notepad to get all the signatures from her
    friends and I'm like "Hey Tadano can you sign this for me real quick?" lol
    and even that took a while<br />P.P.S. Yamai-san in Nakanaka's defence? I
    don't mind a gamer girlfriend who doesn't look as fancy as you than having
    you stare into my life like a freak- *gets strangled by Yamai* (But
    seriously, how dare you make Ookubo Rumi offended and less cute than she was
    last year- *ack*)

  Sometimes I just wonder how some of these guys can be not as manly as they
  should at 15 don't you go through puberty or something? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey them bois
  exist okay? Don't scoff at them, me. In this series where I think the guy
  needs a walking stick compared to the old woman who crossed the street without
  his help haha (#ShikimoriSan01), yes guys, this is the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a>
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kanojo" target="_blank">kanojo</a> Anime. In
  case you aren't familiar with these series which I only know little of, it's
  just someone who is way cooler than the other, and it doesn't have to be the
  girl. It can be the guy too and it's already going to be a pain to watch.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, and I think I know how much I may want to continue watching
  this to be honest. Because so far, the plot has been REALLY convenient in
  placing them in second year of high school with all the secondary characters
  in the same class lol no shit dude, and of course, along with the main couple.
  THAT is how you write a story, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Besides that though, we are also
  conveniently set with a plot where the guy just lost his luck for three
  lifetimes and is paying for his sins now with stuff flying towards him at the
  worst of times- Izumi, you need to see a priest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And of course, we
  have a girl who can protect him... well as long as she is around I guess. I
  wonder what happens in a day without Shikimori, like, if she takes medical
  leave? Will Izumi just straight off die in a car accident? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We haven't
  tested that much yet, but maybe saying that the world revolves around Izumi
  might not be an exaggeration after all. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That, and I guess Shikimori
  keeps getting egged by her female friends to be cute so that means you need to
  suck, could not resist being cool because that is also a kind of cute I guess,
  clear strikes at the bowling alley which makes you wonder why isn't she in the
  Olympics bowling team for Japan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You see, too many conveniences I
  can't even explain myself even if people ask me about this series to be
  honest. And we aren't even into the lore of their past and how they came
  together, or how Izumi may have a curse similar to a
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/155895/Bocchan" target="_blank"
    >Death Duke</a
  >&nbsp;<span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, and this is just that transition state where the dude just
  trips on shit every time. It's either that or trips seeing his cool girlfriend
  protecting him I guess. Haha I can't wait for the day she gets protected by
  him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I feel like Shikimori here has like some "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/41389/Tonikaku_Kawaii"
    target="_blank"
    >ToniKawa</a
  >" lore where she's like (spoilers) an assassin from the Edo period and is
  here to save this dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But I may be just imagining things because
  this is a slice-of-life with a slower pace to be honest more than an actual
  romance build-up story which was what I expected. Because it really feels like
  it's not Izumi who doesn't do his role as boyfriend, but Shikimori who doesn't
  do her role as girlfriend enough. Like, if she said her feet hurt from kicking
  that falling shop sign (lol) I'm pretty sure your guy can piggyback you home.
  <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> So, so much potential locked behind that coolness, it hurts. Which
  brings back to my question: will I watch this? I don't know man, maybe I
  should give the three episode rule to see if I can even stand Shikimori being
  so cool as opposed to Izumi NOT being cool because the former is more
  concerning than the latter at this point. I mean, it's in the title, man,
  probably so much so the focus is on the girl, isn't it? I just can't help
  thinking how screwed up the gravitational forces are in this world though...
  IS THIS ISEKAI??? HAVE I BEEN BAITED???

  [TL:DR; I look at the ending animation and I wonder if there is a video game
  out there or in planning where I can play as Shikimori protecting Izumi.

  is even more of a disappointment as I continue down the dreads of not wanting
  to give more of their dated pop style and melodies with really extra notes
  which I really hate, so I'm not giving anything this time around. Maybe that's
  why they thought of redoing their classics, huh. Nice try, girls. (No really,
  their top song on Apple Music as of this post is the song I mentioned above
  but only their voices lmao) I did listen to

  for her 25th anniversary (Jesus Christ) released last month though, and hmm...
  not as impressive as the previous one to be honest, and I only caught ear of a

  YouTube video as Suga Shikao, a composer who I knew through YUI from a cover

  Next week looks like a good break until I see that I don't have much new
  releases to give this month so... I might just find something to listen to, to
  be honest. Anything on, Skream? Hmm <b>amazarashi new album</b> no thanks
  haha, maybe I can listen to <b>UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's new single</b> for
  change of pace, there's a <b>new song from FINLANDS</b> so maybe I can get
  into that too... we shall see how much I want to listen to songs even. I have
  been on so many nostalgia trips I'm already tripping just thinking about them
  haha KN15YEARS everybody<br />

  artists, we get to be blessed from looking at classics which goddamn if Anime

  P.P.S. I should really spend more time to write blog posts talking about my
  interests so that I may one day, share it with people around me. Or maybe just
  to myself. It has been 15 years for a lot of things, you know, since I knew of
  the subculture that is Anime.
