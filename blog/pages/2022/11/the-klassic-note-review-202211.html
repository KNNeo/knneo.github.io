  And just nice we are a week after between release and review! Hey, it could've
  been yesterday but I was out that evening and there's the DOAXVV game
  livestream so this just came in earlier than planned which is good but still.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yes, we're back with another Klassic Note Review and boy have I mentioned
  how much this year mattered in reviews too many times, I'm already breaking
  records of the past 4 years in reviews already to be honest. This time around,
  similar to 2 years ago though, we are reviewing another one of Nan-chan's
  singles which man, if you still do not know her relationship to me at this
  point... we have no relation anyways haha she is most definitely not the most
  capable
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneechan" target="_blank">onee-chan</a> who
  I wish could be my
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Idol talk aside, let's talk about what impact this has on even just this year
  me. Shall we?

  Origin: This year didn't have enough emotional songs, so I guess TrySail
  youngest member Natsukawa Shiina decided to sing a sad song which was first
  released on her birthday and single releasing on end September... until it was
  delayed till November. Things may not have gone well out there, but what is
  inside this new single feels somewhat like a repeat of what we have
  experienced time and again, with impact and with emotion, and maybe sometimes
  a little cheeky, which might be her best single yet. With her on the lyrics,
  she expresses a different or perhaps real self to show us the true form of her
  solo music career.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Sasakure [Splinter]</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"If (I) pretend to touch your core</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Can you escape your boring existence from yesterday?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    I won't say anything, just that maybe I'm wrong
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    That's a ridiculous statement, isn't it? (Just) laugh"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>
  Wow, how should I start... It all started with her birthday present to us
  fans, which means this song has been released in full about 4 months ago, and
  bearing similarities to her 3rd single topic song, this song is as real as is
  impactful in melody. Maybe it's me being weak to songs with huge contrast in
  emotion, and this one carries the can. From the drop of the melody into the
  chorus, to her own lyrics composition about feeling unsatisfied just going
  along with life... It might have said a lot to some of us right here and now.
  All this only makes my impression of her with all the more respectful, and
  really sheds a light on how little I can complain about even the melody she
  was not in charge of. For this, the impression of this song might get stuck in
  me, for better or for worse.
</div>
<div>Rating: Impressively Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) passable :(</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "There's nothing wrong in (us) the contents
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Then why is there no growth?</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    There's nothing wrong in (us) the contents
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Being "average" is like this</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    There's nothing wrong in (us) the contents
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">When the feels are "fair"</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Being so hollow (inside, we) feel balance
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    In other words, until then (there is no growth); I know I know"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  <div>
    As always, it's the B-side which made this a review to talk about, and
    contrary to the topic song, this is a simple melody from when I first heard
    of it on the archive of her late night Monday radio show, and then realized
    this is too good of a Rock tune and so chill of a tempo I don't have much to
    talk about. Even the bridge is reasonably short and concise, it's good. The
    lyrics written by yours truly talk about, as the title would let you think,
    about just being average and while that doesn't just mean being childish, it
    can say true for the many of us youngsters and how we think today. And I
    think that's just a plus sign for what she speaks out of her mind when
    writing the words for this song. Add in a little quirky cuteness throughout
    the songs, "I know", this is already a song to remember, "I know".
  </div>
  <div>Rating: Chill Average</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    Conclusion: I can't say better things about this single. This was also how I
    felt walking into these two songs in this release. And I feel like my
    respect for dear Natsukawa Shiina only deepens the more I understand her
    from writing lyrics, and it is only hitting deeper into the soul. Overall
    though, I feel like these two songs easily represent her solo music career,
    where they allow her to sing emotional songs with impact while still being
    able to sing standard fare Rock songs and still excel at them. To this, I
    can only appreciate more of what is shown to me more than whatever ended the
    B-side with her jovial laugh put into this. That, I think this deserves more
    attention even for mainstream, to hear what she has to say through music.

  (Maybe it's hard to talk about how well she did on this single without being
  biased so I'm sorry for that, but that doesn't make it bad though; If I need a
  reason to support my not real younger sister this is one of the reasons I'll
  proudly talk about)

  I won't elaborate how much I had to spend on this, but maybe because I didn't
  spend enough for this to appear last weekend instead and had to let the
  application slip INSIDE this physical release expire because they don't
  recognize people like me living overseas to have time to register so that I
  can just get a digital gift or some sort (we have done that once so far with
  MusicRay'n, and that is Toyosaki Aki's best album back in 2017 where I shipped
  directly from HMV Japan) even though I would much like the top tier gifts
  including the DIY planters for 10 lucky winners haha
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhZWVeLu8zQ" target="_blank"
    >she showed us how she made it</a
  >
  too, but regardless, the shipping fee doesn't go to their profits so I might
  as well save some money. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And as this was the only thing I am likely
  giving for the month, I let it come in earlier so I can just love this... this
  accidental masterpiece more lmao okay me

And if you haven't guessed it, I pre-ordered this single for this to appear this
fast, because both songs in the single were revealed with two months left before
release, it wasn't hard to make the decision apart from aligning with other
things I have in line which is none. I always start from

with very little exception because apart from the photo gift being the best
among the bunch as you would see for yourself, I would have not bothered to get
the one from

>&nbsp;gifts are also fine if they provided direct international shipping just
like HMV Japan used to before the fire. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> And NO WAY am I giving those
landscape photos because I got a couple of those in my previous package run so
<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm still really quite keen on the... gardening theme of this release
though? Haha it's fresh, I will tell you that much.

    I think this is enough of a tribute to whatever is left of this wonderful
    single. Man, this year's gonna be a tough choice between all the ones we
    have reviewed just this year alone, dude. But good, it has been a while
    since we have done this many reviews, with this being (I've counted) the
    13th release, well single they are only singles haha, for 2022. Trust me,
    even I'm impressed at my way of spending this much money. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
    see you guys soon then, we are halfway through the week so let Nan-chan lead
    you all the way through the rest of it, meanwhile I shall go imagine how
    great she will be as my sister in real life- Can I send her a trophy too
    just like
