Wow, how am I still feeling the same as last week haha but hey, I was in pain
and on work leave last week so maybe that's the difference...?
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay me you gotta stop putting real life shit on the opening here every week
  this is already going to get depressing even before we get to the real
  depressing stuff. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, to top this depression, looks like Kouno
  Marika is facing some trauma in which we don't know the reason but probably
  family, so her regular schedule will be adjusted in compassion to her current
  emotional situation, per se. So yeah, and that's why we didn't get our end of
  the month monthly fanclub livestream, I guess.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  But hey, I'm also depressed because of what I said just now so who's better
  off now lol. Also, we got Anime to cheer us up since she was in one of them I
  watch! So yeah, let's make all of us happy and talk about this week on Anime
  and music!!<br />
  <br />

  </blockquote>
  Okay what did we mention about flashbacks? KEPT TO A MINIMUM, bro. We went so
  well for three weeks without it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, these are just to make sure
  this new episode will be great (#BLEACHTYBW04) for many reasons than other.
  Let's talk about what they are, and how they fared. Man, if I have to still be
  critical on this even now. Okay okay, let's. Firstly, about the opponents.
  Boy, was it a joy to listen to the voices since I've never played the current
  official video game Bleach Brave Souls, and have never heard the actual
  reveals of the character voices, which yes, they are the same here as they are
  from the game. So yes, Bambietta is the best so far haha despite not talking
  much, and everyone else is still really cool, from As Nodt who hasn't talked
  but just has already made&nbsp;<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami"
    target="_blank"
    >shinigami</a
  >
  walk away in fear haha we will talk about him a little later and yes I always
  thought they are female also me when I approach women, that China thing
  fighting Hitsugaya with a touch skin, we caught superhero guy for a moment
  that fight will be wonderful to watch much later, but for now, we are only
  having a taste of what's to happen. Of course also, having a taste of that
  Bankai medallion they were holding. We don't know if it's because someone
  leaked the info from the Zero Squad on the zanpakuto <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> or some Quincy has
  been accessing the Central 46 library to know how these work (or history,
  yeah, history), but yes, the opponent has devised a cunning device which will
  effectively remove (not really erase, Sasakibe was known to be attacked by his
  own power) the powers from their owners. Yep, that's bad. Urahara-sensei (hehe
  I gotta) and Mayuri won't have enough time to analyze the opponents to not let
  the others fight against them, so some of the captains took it into their own
  hands (because old geezer still crying over spilled milk lmao not true) to let
  the opponent do what they intended to. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Next, before the steal. Yep.
  How many fights have you watched in a mere 15 minutes? From Byakuya tag team
  with Renji, to Soifon trying to stab someone to no avail lol, we have so much
  action going on I'm literally screaming half the time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Downside
  though is, they skipped some of the Bankai animations as I demand haha, so
  only Byakuya had all the airtime to himself just because, and also would've
  been better to let Renji's Bankai be stolen so the captain's can be used but
  you know, Renji's wasn't that cool. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We got to see some Bankai in a
  while almost a decade a while, thank goodness Rose didn't release his sword
  yet, and four captains got their taste of their powers taken away from them.
  Yeah, it's worse than a Mario Party star steal using King Boo; It's living
  Hell now. (Sorry for video game joke) Last but not least, informing Ichigo.
  What we thought would be a fair fight to Kirge turned out to be just a
  trashing by Ichigo who ironically hasn't released his Hollow powers so this
  guy's weaker than Grimmjow now by the way lmao, then Kirge got shot by Urahara
  and Ichigo sent to Soul Society in hopes that his Bankai not being able to be
  sealed would help much in combat, but seriously though we know he's just the
  one just because, and Kirge... is not intending to let him leave by any means.
  And so the <u>jail</u> arc begins haha, where Kirge activates his shrift power
  "J" to make sure this orange-haired superpower wouldn't interfere in the
  taking over of the Gotei 13. All in all, I find something lacking. Whether
  it's the other captains' infamous sword releases (Like, Hitsugaya's though??
  Female fans be crying right now) or one would say the stupidity of the
  captains giving away their powers, we also can't just sit here and watch
  thousands of spirits donned in shihakusho evaporate in seconds so yeah, gotta
  do something first I guess. And as much as the opponents aren't doing much
  yet, we got a glimpse of their powers (and panties haha just, Bambietta dude)
  which will show how irritating it will be to fight them moving on. Yep, the
  depression arc is upon us, I hope you're ready for a losing fight from here
  on. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hopefully we will find a solution to this power imbalance soon
  hehe see you then<br />

        P.P.S. Man, for seeing Suzumebachi ie. Soifon's shikai, not work on
        someone is such a joke haha ah hey they don't know the Blut thing on
        these guys yet
      </div>
      <div>
        [So, in difference to the Anime, sadly, they tweaked a lot of facts in
        here, with reveals of how Blut works without confirmation (in the
        animation Urahara said "maybe" it can't be used together, attack and
        defence) to subtle stuff said by the shinigami and even old man not
        walking out of his broken barracks... This is going to be hard to not
        read back the canon material again haha I'm glad I didn't read it before
        watching too]

        Really, those guys should just keep their mouths shut. We don't need to
        reveal that the gym guy is someone Sakurai might know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this
        new episode where we're still at the gym because someone called my mom's
        given name lmao (#UzakiChanS206), turns out the dad also has problems
        confronting with his problems. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So let's talk about what those
        problems are. Firstly, Fujio-san's daughter is cute. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay about
        Uzaki's dad b*tching about his daughter meeting up with the guy to...
        the guy himself lmao yes Anime I get it stop drawing arrows on the poor
        guy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, essentially, it's just some crude advice from
        the other two dads at the gym and Sakurai's honest opinion, and then you
        realize it doesn't matter because he just wants that son-in-law and
        THINKS he's getting it. Sadly, he doesn't understand that his daughter
        THINKS she's getting it without doing anything. You with me so far?
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, that's just going to stay on his mind for now. Also
        confused this episode is the mother, because man, do they never just sit
        down and be honest with each other. So instead of meeting up with
        Sakurai to talk things out, Tsuki-san (lmao hey I can say it I'm not the
        senpai) chose to be busy at the time of the cooking learning session and
        left the recipe and her daughter at the guy's hands... and boy, he be
        touching them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, he's talking about cats, the mom's talking
        about women, and I'm talking about boobs. It's already all screwed up
        now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But hey, I guess the mom now can tell the husband the
        daughter IS cute, right?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Right?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, can
        we even say all of this out? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Last but not least, Uzaki (Hana)
        thought of celebrating the senpai's birthday. Yeah, like, we're two
        seasons into this and she wants to do this now. Heck, even Sakaki who is
        into their relationship wants to hang... himself (lol title hint I meant
        hang out) after finding this out from the girl... friend haha we can't
        join those words, but also knows that nothing much will get Sakurai
        going in terms of birthday celebrations, but we know, WE KNOW, that
        Uzaki will make the best of it for his special day, and it really turned
        out well I wish someone celebrated my birthday this much on my day lol
        it's February by the way <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, but yeah, Sakurai be having a good
        time. Not cats, not your daughter's boobs, <em>mom</em>. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then
        Uzaki realized her SENPAI will be graduating soon. Considering his
        results are great and he's no
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rounin" target="_blank">ronin</a>,
        it's no wonder the girl then realized the words of what Sakaki meant
        thus far. That her play time is up. In before to wait for any romance to
        blossom. All in all... uh, you need some advice, b*tch?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No
        really though, so I guess this is where we are heading now, Uzaki
        dealing with Sakurai not giving a damn. Because lol Sakurai is going to
        graduate and leave Uzaki alone and he's not going to do a damn thing
        about it!!! Haha what a chad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, it's not his fault,
        introverts are like this, rather emotionless and not having initiative
        lol I speak from experience, so it's not much to tell us what she wants
        out of this relationship, yes? Hey, we dealing with another problem girl
        again, what else is new. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Let's see how this plays out in&nbsp;
        future episodes, I guess, can't be any worse than ambivalence which is
        this series in a nutshell with the two of them to be honest.
      </div>
      <div>
        [TL:DR; See, even Sakaki knows you not making much progress Uzaki-chan.

        you don't get this joke you are too young to be here, get out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
        Also too old for you might be this new episode from a timeline centuries
        ago lol (#KoukyuuNoKarasu06) is the drama that is literally happening
        within the premises, and boy, do we have a lot to talk about here about
        that ghost and the origins of the Raven Consort. Firstly, what we know
        from the historians. On Jusetsu's side, we know that the ghost upon a
        tree is a princess who died in the previous dynasty, the Luan dynasty
        depicted by white hair by the way, and it's just lingering because of a
        certain something. We will get to that in a bit real soon, but let's
        also talk about what the emperor found out from the other historian ie.
        the Ministry of Works, who serves to keep all remaining records (because
        you know, war) present for access of high authority but also, to keep
        all the <em>secrets</em> of the dynasties by word of mouth. Yep, we are
        halfway there into the creepy forest already. Of course he cannot defy
        orders of the emperor, so he revealed something that will make sure
        Jusetsu will bury that old man in the ground tomorrow. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
        she chose to reveal all because the emperor thinks he's doing the right
        thing by freeing a Consort off her solitude, but her duty is precisely
        the reason she cannot do anything the emperor says and must stay alone.
        Why though, we have to talk about history. History goes that dynasties
        have stayed in peace because of two kings, one of summer and one of
        winter, and if you don't know how that works go look at the
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/taihi" target="_blank">taihi</a>
        symbol. I am Chinese so I know such things such as <em>Taoism</em> and
        <em>balance</em>. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What I don't know though, is that a romance
        sprout out of the fact that the summer king is a male human, and welp,
        the winter king is female. Yeah, feminism in the BCs, by the way. But
        yeah, in rejection to the 5th wave though lol I'm sorry your brother
        boned your girl, one of the kings was killed by the other (guess which
        was which lmao), and thus started war. Why so though resides from the
        idea that let's not say one entity God, but a certain god chooses the
        winter king just as how Jusetsu was "chosen" on a moonless night when
        her mother was killed and she was left alone while other kids are safe
        at home, and the summer king... well thou can choose to sit on the
        throne, whomever they are. No really, remember some time ago when a
        DOWAGER was king? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, as passed down for centuries, it
        has been so, and violating it will not appease that particular god on
        the island and war will ensue. The peace thus far has been achieved by
        some white hair dude by changing the rules of the two kings, basically,
        to suppress one of them so they may never come into retaliation. So
        yeah, the overall story basically means Jusetsu is protecting your
        dynasty, bro. You can't start picking her up for a date and start war.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We know she cute but (hehe) (that's also the problem though tbh
        it's history repeating itself but) such is fate. Also, that the god
        chose a girl from the previous dynasty though?? Haha LITERALLY asking
        for trouble- Hey what do they know, they are just a god. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in
        all... wow okay NOW we are kicking off. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, with the
        previous dynasty being a holder of balance of kings in the current
        dynasty means that it's not that hard to start conflict again... Right?
        Haha oh yeah white haired sorcerer Bingyue, I see where you coming from
        now. Oh well, I guess things aren't meant to be nice anyways, huh.
        *ahem* No really, that's just sad now that I think of what will happen
        soon while listening to the ending song. But yeah, it's all fate, half
        of this ancient Chinese universe on an island is controlled by God
        essentially, and the emperor wants to invoke war by finding out the
        truth? That sounds like a GREAT drama incoming haha uh oh this might be
        a problem real soon Jiu-Jiu might die- I can't wait to see the things
        from here on haha you think the God will come in and save this impending
        crisis? I guess not huh lol hey they might, if it's within reason.

        [TL:DR; Niao Lian is the real feminist advocate, ladies and gentlemen.
        She punished dynasties who forget about women in power, and kept them
        alive if women are treated well in place. And we say we discriminate
        women for centuries, tsk. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Okay for all jokes aside, I'm not
        trying to provoke anything, I just liked the idea of this lore in this

        This week has been dull, trust me, for music in Klassic Note, so I just
        went back to listen to my music library, don't mind me. And even then we
        didn't get anything new I guess. Hey, they only slap old rock bands and
        young idol groups so what else am I going to listen to? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then

        isn't terrible but I am definitely not in the mood to give them that's
        for sure. Every time I review the single I'm trying to give each of the
        3 tracks to be honest, so I just settled on one of the B-sides, don't
        mind me there. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />
        <br />Okay this week's news on music on Twitter definitely slowed down

        is getting me pumped up for next week's single release. But yeah as you
        can see they ran out of ideas for music videos already hehe I'm not
        going to comment on my years of experience haha<br />
        <br />
        So next week is going to be fun but not like I'll be in better condition
        to listen to them, but rest assured that I've already given
        <b>Natsukawa Shiina's new single</b> (lol review within the week if my
        pre-order goes through?) and <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</b> is
        just flair right now because remember how I listen to Ikimonogakari
        singles day and night like their my comfort zone? This is my new comfort
        zone already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, next week on comfort zone Klassic Note!!
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And if we have time we will take some time to listen to *looks
        at Skream* <b>wacci's new album</b> and maybe maybe
        <b>Humbreader's new album</b> if I really am very bored and don't mind
        listening to these guys print out music like it's free haha remember we
        just listened to their previous album released last year about three
        months ago? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But damn does the album trailer for the latter
        sound better haha oops<br />

        look not great I told myself, so I changed it a bit to be more
        standardized and used some of the web hosting platform's new features to
        unify as one site all the stuff I'll need to keep this maintainable in
        the long run. Also yes, #KN15YEARS but I've not gone around to that yet
        so maybe when I'm done I'll post the link here. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Cya guys next
        time then, and until next time... maybe I should go see the doctor lol I
        have been, just not Western. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, I can only take MCs for that
        long haha I'll go rest my head or something just like I did it all day
        lol bye
