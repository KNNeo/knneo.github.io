So yeah, and that's why we didn't get our end of the month monthly fanclub livestream, I guess.</div><div><br></div><div>But hey, I'm also depressed because of what I said just now so who's better off now lol. Also, we got Anime to cheer us up since she was in one of them I watch! So yeah, let's make all of us happy and talk about this week on Anime and music!!<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BLEACHTYBW04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Conflict is such an unpleasant affair." Yeah, ya think? Words from God, by the way.</div></blockquote>Okay what did we mention about flashbacks? KEPT TO A MINIMUM, bro. We went so well for three weeks without it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, these are just to make sure this new episode will be great (#BLEACHTYBW04) for many reasons than other. Let's talk about what they are, and how they fared. Man, if I have to still be critical on this even now. Okay okay, let's. Firstly, about the opponents. Boy, was it a joy to listen to the voices since I've never played the current official video game Bleach Brave Souls, and have never heard the actual reveals of the character voices, which yes, they are the same here as they are from the game. So yes, Bambietta is the best so far haha despite not talking much, and everyone else is still really cool, from As Nodt who hasn't talked but just has already made <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> walk away in fear haha we will talk about him a little later and yes I always thought they are female also me when I approach women, that China thing fighting Hitsugaya with a touch skin, we caught superhero guy for a moment that fight will be wonderful to watch much later, but for now, we are only having a taste of what's to happen. Of course also, having a taste of that Bankai medallion they were holding. We don't know if it's because someone leaked the info from the Zero Squad on the zanpakuto <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> or some Quincy has been accessing the Central 46 library to know how these work (or history, yeah, history), but yes, the opponent has devised a cunning device which will effectively remove (not really erase, Sasakibe was known to be attacked by his own power) the powers from their owners. Yep, that's bad. Urahara-sensei (hehe I gotta) and Mayuri won't have enough time to analyze the opponents to not let the others fight against them, so some of the captains took it into their own hands (because old geezer still crying over spilled milk lmao not true) to let the opponent do what they intended to. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Next, before the steal. Yep. How many fights have you watched in a mere 15 minutes? From Byakuya tag team with Renji, to Soifon trying to stab someone to no avail lol, we have so much action going on I'm literally screaming half the time. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Downside though is, they skipped some of the Bankai animations as I demand haha, so only Byakuya had all the airtime to himself just because, and also would've been better to let Renji's Bankai be stolen so the captain's can be used but you know, Renji's wasn't that cool. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We got to see some Bankai in a while almost a decade a while, thank goodness Rose didn't release his sword yet, and four captains got their taste of their powers taken away from them. Yeah, it's worse than a Mario Party star steal using King Boo; It's living Hell now. (Sorry for video game joke) Last but not least, informing Ichigo. What we thought would be a fair fight to Kirge turned out to be just a trashing by Ichigo who ironically hasn't released his Hollow powers so this guy's weaker than Grimmjow now by the way lmao, then Kirge got shot by Urahara and Ichigo sent to Soul Society in hopes that his Bankai not being able to be sealed would help much in combat, but seriously though we know he's just the one just because, and Kirge... is not intending to let him leave by any means. And so the <u>jail</u> arc begins haha, where Kirge activates his shrift power "J" to make sure this orange-haired superpower wouldn't interfere in the taking over of the Gotei 13. All in all, I find something lacking. Whether it's the other captains' infamous sword releases (Like, Hitsugaya's though?? Female fans be crying right now) or one would say the stupidity of the captains giving away their powers, we also can't just sit here and watch thousands of spirits donned in shihakusho evaporate in seconds so yeah, gotta do something first I guess. And as much as the opponents aren't doing much yet, we got a glimpse of their powers (and panties haha just, Bambietta dude) which will show how irritating it will be to fight them moving on. Yep, the depression arc is upon us, I hope you're ready for a losing fight from here on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hopefully we will find a solution to this power imbalance soon hehe see you then<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMLVAsvnelpoVnBraZzraaH4tXbRh55AgqVNF15rEpZdOOh02iRg7HT4nnBrLoQyM990j-94cSsHI9OqtxG9mjn7aOHsIyGxZo734CVhJjWUV9ry9rTxdxaFrpGZCqa6FvQIib1zSvf39ubjqmDkSMTKRurJaNCA_M2Rn9WjxIrC-gNXoD_bgKLF4c/s320/bleachTYBW04_bankai3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Bankai as a sex analogy:<br>Me when my girl says she is horny lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoJPWxVf2R-H8qCAktMcxT0HkVcRh4uti16VvvmXdpNHUIqzfF2ujD6V7DEEeksFPZV7C7wG-N6HHZR32JUvB7pchEuEMMM0d8C1E5HfMrKPifO3y7ooZ5odle3LV0-53B48FSJ3w2Qv-61Zwgun6D5SJB6XLDnAVxsavEFaTKtUuAvvwFoFWULKe7/s320/bleachTYBW04_bankai2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Bankai as a sex analogy:<br>Me storming into the room to f**k my b*tch haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhq-qlQKGYSgBHP7pA-04U9vUQQFlQoLHssm3NDZP5ei7YZixZy--Ibt2tHHm2PeNazfX-kCjqnTeuw0A_xOnKhxJKrKa1f42KGjsN1q0c1fOrXpW0kvC8V0gJ_RgRji7G0qvl80rQ0RZpj5Ydk7m88DCCIGuOY-AqRkEMVyaB0QT3jFPMavX965_Fg/s320/bleachTYBW04_bankai1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Bankai as a sex analogy:<br>What my balls feel like just after being shaved lol</table></div></div><div><div><div>P.S.

We don't need to reveal that the gym guy is someone Sakurai might know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where we're still at the gym because someone called my mom's given name lmao (#UzakiChanS206), turns out the dad also has problems confronting with his problems. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So let's talk about what those problems are. Firstly, Fujio-san's daughter is cute. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay about Uzaki's dad b*tching about his daughter meeting up with the guy to... the guy himself lmao yes Anime I get it stop drawing arrows on the poor guy. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, essentially, it's just some crude advice from the other two dads at the gym and Sakurai's honest opinion, and then you realize it doesn't matter because he just wants that son-in-law and THINKS he's getting it. Sadly, he doesn't understand that his daughter THINKS she's getting it without doing anything. You with me so far? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, that's just going to stay on his mind for now. Also confused this episode is the mother, because man, do they never just sit down and be honest with each other. So instead of meeting up with Sakurai to talk things out, Tsuki-san (lmao hey I can say it I'm not the senpai) chose to be busy at the time of the cooking learning session and left the recipe and her daughter at the guy's hands... and boy, he be touching them. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, he's talking about cats, the mom's talking about women, and I'm talking about boobs. It's already all screwed up now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But hey, I guess the mom now can tell the husband the daughter IS cute, right?? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Right?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, can we even say all of this out? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Last but not least, Uzaki (Hana) thought of celebrating the senpai's birthday. Yeah, like, we're two seasons into this and she wants to do this now. Heck, even Sakaki who is into their relationship wants to hang... himself (lol title hint I meant hang out) after finding this out from the girl... friend haha we can't join those words, but also knows that nothing much will get Sakurai going in terms of birthday celebrations, but we know, WE KNOW, that Uzaki will make the best of it for his special day, and it really turned out well I wish someone celebrated my birthday this much on my day lol it's February by the way <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but yeah, Sakurai be having a good time. Not cats, not your daughter's boobs, <em>mom</em>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then Uzaki realized her SENPAI will be graduating soon. Considering his results are great and he's no <a href=https://jisho.org/search/rounin target=_blank>ronin</a>, it's no wonder the girl then realized the words of what Sakaki meant thus far. That her play time is up. In before to wait for any romance to blossom. All in all... uh, you need some advice, b*tch?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really though, so I guess this is where we are heading now, Uzaki dealing with Sakurai not giving a damn. Because lol Sakurai is going to graduate and leave Uzaki alone and he's not going to do a damn thing about it!!! Haha what a chad. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, it's not his fault, introverts are like this, rather emotionless and not having initiative lol I speak from experience, so it's not much to tell us what she wants out of this relationship, yes? Hey, we dealing with another problem girl again, what else is new. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Let's see how this plays out in  future episodes, I guess, can't be any worse than ambivalence which is this series in a nutshell with the two of them to be honest.</div><div>[TL:DR; See, even Sakaki knows you not making much progress Uzaki-chan.

Firstly, what we know from the historians. On Jusetsu's side, we know that the ghost upon a tree is a princess who died in the previous dynasty, the Luan dynasty depicted by white hair by the way, and it's just lingering because of a certain something. We will get to that in a bit real soon, but let's also talk about what the emperor found out from the other historian ie. the Ministry of Works, who serves to keep all remaining records (because you know, war) present for access of high authority but also, to keep all the <em>secrets</em> of the dynasties by word of mouth. Yep, we are halfway there into the creepy forest already. Of course he cannot defy orders of the emperor, so he revealed something that will make sure Jusetsu will bury that old man in the ground tomorrow. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, she chose to reveal all because the emperor thinks he's doing the right thing by freeing a Consort off her solitude, but her duty is precisely the reason she cannot do anything the emperor says and must stay alone. Why though, we have to talk about history. History goes that dynasties have stayed in peace because of two kings, one of summer and one of winter, and if you don't know how that works go look at the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/taihi target=_blank>taihi</a> symbol. I am Chinese so I know such things such as <em>Taoism</em> and <em>balance</em>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What I don't know though, is that a romance sprout out of the fact that the summer king is a male human, and welp, the winter king is female. Yeah, feminism in the BCs, by the way. But yeah, in rejection to the 5th wave though lol I'm sorry your brother boned your girl, one of the kings was killed by the other (guess which was which lmao), and thus started war. Why so though resides from the idea that let's not say one entity God, but a certain god chooses the winter king just as how Jusetsu was "chosen" on a moonless night when her mother was killed and she was left alone while other kids are safe at home, and the summer king... well thou can choose to sit on the throne, whomever they are. No really, remember some time ago when a DOWAGER was king? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, as passed down for centuries, it has been so, and violating it will not appease that particular god on the island and war will ensue. The peace thus far has been achieved by some white hair dude by changing the rules of the two kings, basically, to suppress one of them so they may never come into retaliation. So yeah, the overall story basically means Jusetsu is protecting your dynasty, bro. You can't start picking her up for a date and start war. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We know she cute but (hehe) (that's also the problem though tbh it's history repeating itself but) such is fate. Also, that the god chose a girl from the previous dynasty though?? Haha LITERALLY asking for trouble- Hey what do they know, they are just a god. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... wow okay NOW we are kicking off. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, with the previous dynasty being a holder of balance of kings in the current dynasty means that it's not that hard to start conflict again... Right? Haha oh yeah white haired sorcerer Bingyue, I see where you coming from now. Oh well, I guess things aren't meant to be nice anyways, huh. *ahem* No really, that's just sad now that I think of what will happen soon while listening to the ending song. But yeah, it's all fate, half of this ancient Chinese universe on an island is controlled by God essentially, and the emperor wants to invoke war by finding out the truth? That sounds like a GREAT drama incoming haha uh oh this might be a problem real soon Jiu-Jiu might die- I can't wait to see the things from here on haha you think the God will come in and save this impending crisis? I guess not huh lol hey they might, if it's within reason.</div><div>[TL:DR; Niao Lian is the real feminist advocate, ladies and gentlemen. She punished dynasties who forget about women in power, and kept them alive if women are treated well in place.
