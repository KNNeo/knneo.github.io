<div>
  (CHiCO-san doesn't show her real face so you tell me which cover I liked-
  Artist cover by the way)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: I have been listening to this Anime artist for a while now, and
  similar to artists like Sangatsu no Phantasia and ClariS, they have been in
  cover of their physical image in order to deliver the audio image which they
  potentially possess, and I must say CHiCO-san here is fine by me. Though for
  being with Anime producer group HoneyWorks is what made her shine, singing
  great Anime theme songs one after another, as where I knew of them about 5
  years ago. Fast forward to this season where they gave me the most hyped
  single I can expect from an Anime without such hype, it's still
  science-related, which really made you wonder how they pulled this off. Let's
  talk about why.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Bibitto Love [Vivid Love]</div>
<div>From the intro:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Vivid Love</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Receiving (heart) flutters</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Knowing about affection, about love</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">At the genetic level</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    The 'like' (we) can't unravel with (our) heads
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Life's quest</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Let's take it as a challenge"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  This is another collaboration song for the Anime's 2nd season coming, which
  similar to the first ending song, but this time around we have a slightly
  different combination, but containing the best of what music production had to
  offer back then. The bass slaps, the melody is catchy, the lyrics bring in so
  much meaning into the theme of research of love... everything is wonderful
  about this song. With guest vocalist Mafumafu on the helm, he helped create
  balance in this duet, and made it sound better than ever. The lyrics speak
  about vividly being in love while still figuring out everything else... with
  science but we won't touch it any further. Now you know why this might be just
  by new favourite Anime theme song; It's just so good! Okay maybe the bridge
  part is too long but relevance definitely made it forgiving for the most part.

</div>
<div>Rating: Vividly Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Soreike! Salaryman [Go go! Salaryman]</div>
<div>From the intro:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Hooray Hooray!</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Take it easy</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Hooray Hooray!</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Aren't you doing your best?</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Hooray Hooray!</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Tomorrow should be better than today"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  I can't believe I got baited into giving this song considering this is a
  motivational song and it's this girl keeping me going on my working days. We
  all know the perks and troubles of working a day job, and CHiCO-san is here to
  cheer us up, is what I meant. That is all you need to know from the lyrics, by
  the way, and she did a good job of it maybe even more then idol groups out
  there because as real as this is, it also had a catchy melody I can dance to.
  Now somehow making her dance in a cheerleader outfit would be even better, but
  considering such a song is a rarity in theme, I would only thank HoneyWorks
  for making this viable in the first place, and I think that is what we should
  be happy for.
</div>
<div>Rating: Cheerfully Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This single might be the new best for Klassic Note Review this
  year so far, mind my words. HoneyWorks, you have once again proven to me the
  prowess of your compositions, and I cannot ask for more now that I have
  listened to this for myself. CHiCO-san is just icing on the delicious cake. If
  you know of her, then this is just another impressive work to add into your
  library. But if you haven't, this might change your impression of how much you
  think this singer sounds cute, way more than you can imagine. And to that, I'm
  glad this single existed to prove my point.
</div>
<div><br /></div>

<div>
  (Okay maybe too much praise but serious talk though this is really good you
  should give a listen if you haven't. Also, she did show her face to the camera
  before because search "<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbQISRBENayjKSXBqgT84aNCMRSen1q4jlypFvLWdpSZqMtosjotjk5bLA1yjMAfN5-j9L6HEvCNWM5VT1bTCwWZmzulHM-Z8WVYSxS70Yy0LC866SXIdC6xEZEQCCqAH-db7pfT3n3bU9UW9b6VRuLpEs3U4hnZZJ2TiBPVpR9mKwCGdRs3ZTjzlS/s320/hq720.jpg" target="_blank">the first take chico</a>" and you will be impressed by not her voice)

<div>
  (Four editions, by the way. I'm just glad that the Regular Edition exists and
  it's not an Anime cover...?)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: I have only known nasuo-san here from Anime, but I did find out a
  little more about her peculiar style of music from her indie days to her now
  being under an Anime major label, her track record isn't exactly what everyone
  would like. That said though, thanks to Anime manipulating this behind the
  scenes do we get such a unique blend worth talking about. How did this happen
  though, I think we should talk about it at length to know if this was worth
  the ride.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Honey Jetcoaster</div>
<div>From the first verse:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"(A) Want to be loved</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(I) No excuses</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(Shi) Want to know, wish to know</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(Te) Embarrassed, just being mean</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(Ru) Looping around</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(?) Like a question mark"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  (Brackets spell "Aishiteru?" ie. "Do you love (me)?"; The lyrics are also
  loosely joined in a&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shiritori" target="_blank">shiritori</a>
  word chain, where final Hiragana character in every line repeats on the first
  character in brackets on the next besides on "te", and "?" starts with "ku")
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So, from the start the lyrics are already portraying the scenes from the Anime
  series for the opening song, talking about her being better than the
  boyfriend, and ironically also the variations of Anime plots apart from
  original Manga works... the lyrics had everything. Since it was written by
  yours truly, I would not be surprised how much this mattered as it really
  helped create an otherwise different landscape of what this might have sounded
  like if it weren't her. Add in her singing with occasional misses in melody,
  along with a catchy and heavily transitioning style, it's no wonder this will
  get the kids in as much as I did. And isn't that what Anime songs are about?
  So yeah, they actually nailed the formula, and getting nasuo-san in this isn't
  a bad idea after all. Just, this is not close enough to her usual style at any
  length. You have been warned.
</div>

</div>
<div>Rating: Jetcoaster Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This single has its ups and downs including different versions and
  mixes in the Regular Edition and I won't bore you with it, but nasuo-san here
  is brilliant in making Anime songs in this single, so I implore you to find
  them out since she wrote the bulk of character songs for the Anime itself I
  can't even. Coming back to this though, this song is probably enough reason
  for me to talk about listening to something different once in a while, and I
  very welcome such a change. It's refreshingly different and will leave an
  impression on me for years to come.
</div>

<div>
  (Hey I thank whoever did not gauge this properly and give me close-ups on the
  Regular Edition because I liked that)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: We are back with Anime world's beloved idol group TrySail, where voice
  actresses (refer to Limited Edition, from left to right) Amamiya Sora, Asakura
  Momo and Natsukawa Shiina sing for the world of Anime. It's their 14th single
  coming since their debut in 2015, and despite it feeling like a haphazard
  attempt at filling the role of opening song artist, it has also nailed it in
  execution and delivery, making this a more of a fresh take reminiscent release
  I have expected of them from the beginning. It was always what was slightly
  different that made them stand out more than ever from their usual.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Hanarenai Kyori [Inseparable Distance]</div>
<div>From intro:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Sure to have no result, with this far in distance
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Enough to bury it up</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Breathing in, tightly, choking</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    All of what (I) missed, I'll feed them (to you)"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  For being the Anime's opening song, the producers totally nailed it in song
  design I would say by firstly making sure the lyrics and singing deliver a
  subtle whisper similar to ASMR feels, as can be heard from most of the song
  here and there. And that is probably what was attractive with this song,
  especially due to the fact that there are three vocalists, their whisper and
  singing can be fluently interchanged between all of them, and that makes if
  even more interesting then ever. The melody is simple, maybe too Anime in
  style, but it isn't bad, and adding in the whispers to break out of the song
  itself, depending who you ask, is probably for the better overall. Its
  uniqueness in style plus the usual Anime theme song feels makes it a
  compelling yet good song in my opinion.

<div>Rating: Underestimated Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Etoile [Trans.: Star]</div>
<div>From end of first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"To the ever-changing future</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Let's keep walking as usual</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Let's move on, to where (it is) exciting"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  When I listened to the intro I was immediately reminded of independent band
  SHE'S and their grand yet warm style of writing songs with impact, but turns
  out, this is a more reminiscent style of music I would have liked if you asked
  me about TrySail in their early days, and I'm just glad to have given the
  chance to them before giving it a pass. The melody is traditional yet
  different, the lyrics are motivating yet encouraging which again makes this
  more appealing on an idol group perspective than ever, and it doesn't have a
  bridge with vocals? What more can I nitpick about this song? Overall though,
  it does not stand out from the stars in the universe, but it was one that
  shone, and I took notice of it. That, to me, is good enough.
</div>
<div>Rating: Beautifully Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: It has been a while since I reviewed a TrySail single, so I'm just
  happy it turned out better than what was in my first impression, just singing
  for a comedy romance Anime. Breaking out of the action Anime series they sang
  for is so different a world, it made me appreciate their early days singing
  such songs a lot more. This is also an easy entry for people who have never
  listened to these girls before, and is in my opinion a once in a blue moon
  rare treasure to pick up nowadays, so I won't ask for more.

  get a wider audience to buy them *points at self* and even if I'm at Regular
  Edition territory there is still a lot to talk about.&nbsp;

  Firstly, about CHiCO-san's single. Goddamn it was a large package, and it's no
  wonder it's the most expensive single among the three, because apart from the
  special photo bromide from
  <a href="https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70007000/70007966/images/202204291452067.jpg" target="_blank">Tower Records</a>
  which I specifically chose the Anime one because I am buying the Artist cover
  already so balancing it out, is that it comes with a special artist keychain!
  A nice touch, but I'm not exactly into her music career or even herself don't
  even say animated self so... yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  Then we have nasuo-san's single. It's boring, so we can skip it now haha okay
  the booklet had more of her I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> nasuo-san, anyone? No? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  So this just came in along with the above release so I can save on shipping
  fees haha they did give a music label 30th anniversary serial code though so
  maybe I'll just register it

  Anyways, back to the good stuff, TrySail's new single is a real big welcome
  since I lost count when I gave them their singles a Review, but this is also
  why I had to rush this purchase from Animate just in case it got taken away,
  because goddamn the Animate bonus photo bromide with them close-ups is so
  good, I wouldn't really have considered anything else like

  which I can't even get my hands on so whatever. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Happy birthday
  anyway, Mocho. Slapped you right in the middle. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

  Apart from that, in classic Animate fashion we have THREE serial codes to give
  out apart from the CD-exclusive gacha we can register if we had the CD... 2
  weeks ago so impossible if we don't pre-order from CDJapan with direct
  shipping lol, but they were for:
</div>
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      An online event due in July so we will know the details closer to that
      date,
    </li>
    <li>
      The single's panel show where they showcase the outfits of the girls in
      the release at Animate stores, they are giving out posters to 3 lucky
      winners, and
    </li>
    <li>
      The above online event's gacha where we have 10 lucky winners who will get
      a signed poster or printout
    </li>
  </ul>
  And that is IF we get it. Considering my luck with Ueda Reina's single 2 years
  ago and Ito Miku's single 2 months ago... maybe not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> "Unlimited
  chances... but no chances" Haha sorry for a reference no one will get
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I think we are done. Doing this in a Saturday afternoon does not have its
  perks considering I'm just playing Fall Guys all week since it's free and out
  this week and I should really take more naps for the weekend but uh... I guess
  not! We got more Anime to talk about tomorrow too so stay tuned for that,
  would you? Alright, see you then.
