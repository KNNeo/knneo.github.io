Wow, what a week outside work it has been! I missed a package and had to go
collect it at the post office yesterday morning, I reviewed three singles in one
afternoon which was yesterday so check it out, and Koko-chan's photobook almost
did not ship on time because I forgot to add payment. Sorry Gamers! I will
remember to do that when I pre-order next time haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So that's where it'll definitely appear next month instead so that sucks haha,
  but on the upside we aren't spoiled yet besides herself and the many friends
  she gave her book to so... we are good? I hope so. At least lesser spoilers
  than Anime "Kaguya-sama" lol hey do you know a sequel is confirmed?? I'm sorry
  I'm toxic you can cancel me if you want just leave this blog alone this is all
  I've got
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah, let's Anime and music! Only the best sh*ttalks about stuff I like as
  entertainment today only on this blog haha ok if you want another opinion
  unforeseen on the Internet you're welcome lol is this better of a pitch? Sorry
  if any newcomers have already left before this sentence lol<br />

  Welcome back to the quarterly series where I talk about Anime I've ever seen
  before and telling myself what I like. Yeah, that's all, totally won't shit on
  Anime I don't watch or anything haha
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    In order of first episode premiere date in Japan, here are my comments:
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        Literally next week we are kicking off with "<b
          ><a
            href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202022%20Preview/Kanojo,%20Okarishimasu_22.png"
            target="_blank"
            >Kanojo, Okarishimasu 2nd Season</a
          ></b
        >" [Premieres 1st July 2022] because why not I miss
        loser-who-gets-laid-all-around Kazuya with stellar female cast which
        include Ten-chan as
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a>
        beauty, Yuuki Aoi as jealous ex, Naobou as everyone's ideal girlfriend
        lol, and Sumi-chan because I like Rieri more than any of them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
        Anyways, more shenanigans hopefully giving the latter girls more due air
        time to be honest, and yeah, can't wait for the first b*tch slap of the
        series if there is any haha
      </li>
      <li>
        Okay "Teppen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" has like, WAY too many exclamation marks
        lol I copied this out so I didn't count- Is this how they get our
        attention nowadays?
      </li>
      <li>
        Wow I don't think know I should give "<b
          ><a
            href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202022%20Preview/Lycoris%20Recoil.png"
            target="_blank"
            >Lycoris Recoil</a
          ></b
        >" [Premieres 2nd July 2022] a chance or not. Because I thought this
        will be a nice comedy slice-of-life with ironically Anime "KONOBI"
        author as character design in this original Anime series, but why did it
        have guns? Man, now I don't even want to watch it anymore lol maybe I'll
        try one episode since Anzai Chika as main girl won't set me in here- Did
        they just put her as a cute girl with weapons again? Shout out to
        "Hitsugi no Chaika" by the way and her photobook cosplaying it hehe
      </li>
      <li>
        Okay okay "<a
          href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202022%20Preview/Engage%20Kiss.png"
          target="_blank"
          ><b>Engage Kiss</b></a
        >" [Premieres 2nd July 2022] you got me, you got me! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't
        think the action scenes are any appealing to me anyways, but considering
        it's an original series (yep) and they do close up the romance plot to a
        triangle relationship instead of boiling it over like make the female
        antagonist into him too lol (voiced by Ookubo Rumi btw), but it looks
        more like it'll have way more action to deal with than the romance as
        the backend which looks like the trend these few years which is a minus
        in my opinion. I'll take a look, no promises though. Anime originals are
        known to impress only at the start haha also Ayano-chan is my new waifu
        lol you may not want your ex bro but I want her <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Yeah long title warning but "Renmei Kuugun Koukuu Mahou Ongakutai
        Luminous Witches" is NOT in my list of Anime I want to watch lol
      </li>
      <li>
        Eh and no RWBY please I know too much of Rooster Teeth's past to not
        want to watch this anymore lol oh it's a Japanese original by the way it
        got this popular from being made in a subpar animation tool to this a
        decade later- Yang is the coolest haha
      </li>
      <li>
        Why are there so many sci-fi themed series? Can we just have cute girls
        without guns and/or robots? Please? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      </li>
      <li>*looks at "Prima Doll"* See?? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span></li>
      <li>
        Oh yeah this mess haha I only know "Tensei Kenja no Isekai Life: Daini
        no Shokugyou o Ete, Sekai Saikyou ni Narimashita" which has an even
        longer name than the one before, has Kanno Mai voicing as one of many
        (newbie voice actresses) slimes (lol) and they are just lighting up the
        official Tiktok page so don't ask me what the plot is because it's
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a> and
        I don't give a f-
      </li>
      <li>
        Goddamn why is "Kinsou no Vermeil" title even longer someone give me
        some pills to curb my long-title reading headache
      </li>
      <li>
        Oh yeah this one popped up a lot on my Twitter feed because "<a
          href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202022%20Preview/Mamahaha%20no%20Tsurego%20ga%20Motokano%20Datta.png"
          target="_blank"
          ><b>Mamahaha no Tsurego ga Motokano Datta</b></a
        >" [Premieres July 6th 2022] will have Hidaka Rina as main girl being
        the stepsister but also your ex in middle school. Welp. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The
        upside seems like the story is lighter than "Kaguya-sama" because they
        can't technically be together now but- I can't wait for the hentai
        scenes on this lmao ah hey tell me this is not a stereotypical porno
        plot haha I don't know though <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> And yes I'll give this a look
        there's a lot to offer like the perfect sidekick voicing by the one and
        only Okamoto-san (lmao) and Tomita Miyu as prospective girlfriend?
        Hmm...
      </li>
      <li>
        "Isekai Ojisan" I can't believe they placed two of my most hatred words
        together I WILL NOT WATCH THIS EVEN IF I DIE AND REINCARNATE AS AN OLD
        MAN IN AN ALTERNATE WORLD lol
      </li>
      <li>
        A harem in an isekai? Sorry "Isekai Meikyuu de Harem wo" but- What is
        wrong with this list haha you are making my bro go wild lol
      </li>
      <li>
        I mean come on, "Kumichou Musume to Sewagakari" is basically "Bungou
        Stray Dogs" and you're Oda-kun taking care of his boss' daughter
        Elise-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that was funnier since it had dressing up
        scenes so no. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Seeing that I already can give many other series above already, maybe I
        should not even watch&nbsp; "Dagashi Kashi" author Kotoyama-sensei's
        newest series "<a
          href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202022%20Preview/Yofukashi%20no%20Uta.png"
          target="_blank"
          ><b>Yofukashi no Uta</b></a
        >" [Premieres 7th July 2022] because despite me going meh seeing the
        first chapter of the girl sucking some blood and getting high over some
        middle schooler's... I don't even wanna talk about it haha and we have
        more than one of these vampires as the kid goes out at night so... stay
        at home kids. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again that'll be a great way to go, better
        than donating blood <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> And it's Ten-chan sucking you off so what's
        wrong with- I'm going to get banned. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        And if you're bored of Anime "Takagi-san" bullsh*t and wanted something
        else the author has something else for you, since one of his (yep, many)
        newer series "Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru" is already getting Anime
        adaptation! Then again I like Takagi-san and this is
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shougi" target="_blank">shougi</a> and
        reminds me of the nightmare that is "<a
          href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31646/3-gatsu_no_Lion"
          target="_blank"
          >Sangatsu no Lion</a
        >" so unless they can get me with something I'll pass- Like, is it
        because the "Kaguya-sama" lore is ending that they are putting other
        series to take its place? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Yeah I've heard this and all its lore because "<b
          ><a
            href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202022%20Preview/Isekai%20Yakkyoku.png"
            target="_blank"
            >Isekai Yakkyoku</a
          ></b
        >" [Premieres July 10 2022] really sounds less like a isekai survival
        cr*p but actually just survival because you save lives! So that's
        actually intruiging for me even if ISEKAI is slapped on the damn title
        lol plus I can live with Aki-chan as a dude and Ede-chan as main girl
        (hehe) because the plot is actually travelling back in time where, and I
        can't believe I'm saying this, the guy is using his special doctor eye
        to treat people using "alchemy". Yes, before it was called Western
        medicine. So yeah, more than enough reason to give this even one chance,
        to be honest. I might just break the isekai self-ban this season lmao
        then again isn't "<a
          href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/33341/Time_Travel_Shoujo__Mari_Waka_to_8-nin_no_Kagakusha-tachi"
          target="_blank"
          >MariWaka</a
        >" also isekai if you think about it<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        I've also heard of this from Rieri in the past couple of weeks but I
        think I will skip on "Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii" because there is
        too much mystery in this to pass out on despite it being attractively
        enticing as a series itself in my opinion, but the authors in RC (first
        time quoting them in a long time by the way) do note about the age gap
        love comedy thing which authors in recent years are trying to brainwash
        us for some reason *ugh, "<a
          href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/40938/Hige_wo_Soru_Soshite_Joshikousei_wo_Hirou"
          target="_blank"
          >HigeHiro</a
        >", ugh* so maybe I'll pass. Compared to the competition it doesn't have
        solid lore to get me to be frank.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      So yeah, can't get out of the romance comedy scope. Please, romance comedy
      is ending according to "Kaguya-sama" so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I am risking myself to
      watch some Anime originals though so let's hope they are good. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
      Man, when was the last time I liked an Anime original? "<a
        href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/36470/Tada-kun_wa_Koi_wo_Shinai"
        target="_blank"
        >Tada-kun</a
      >"? Yeah probably. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> And if we miss all of them I'll pull out "Heike
      Monogatari" from the archives since I've been wanting to watch that for
      some time so might as well take a down season to do it.

    </blockquote>
    What, she just walked away from the drop? The calm before the storm,
    everyone. We need to see Kaguya LIT!! Haha as in not the campfire by the
    way, like, see her rage. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode of this awesome
    series we are still getting budget on (#KaguyaSamaS312), oh we are talking
    about BOTH episodes by the way, I have no idea what happened but I was
    promised a full-hour special so let's put two of them as one. (Haha see what
    I did there?) Anyways, story. Sorry for the potential long write-up but
    capitalism caused this to happen lol fourth wall break? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Firstly, we
    deal with the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank"
      >tsundere</a
    >
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onna" target="_blank">onna</a>" Kaguya and
    her surprise at knowing about Shirogane's impending future. (No really,
    Hayasaka said that, subtitles are misleading) (Also Hayasaka I like that
    shit, tsundere onna, they are my fuel to watch Anime lol) Because seeing how
    we are at the precipice of someone doing a confession, Kaguya seems like she
    had to do it already, right? RIGHT?? Because if not, then it'll be over
    within a year. Just as Hayasaka mentioned as she's dragged out of her class
    lol, if Kaguya decides to have one last year with the guy dating and stuff,
    this is it. So yeah, they had some rehearsals, but don't expect it to go
    well just because. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But in Kaguya's defence the butler may have gone
    too far to expect her to do it, because you know, ultimately she is still a
    maiden at heart and asking her to do it is kinda lacklustre to be honest
    also not entertaining haha Hayasaka disguised as Akasaki-sensei the author I
    see you lmao, so we have to leave it to Shirogane then. Meanwhile though,
    everyone else's affairs first. It would seem that Ishigami did not know that
    the giving-hearts thing in this festival means a confession and he
    technically did it TWICE like seriously bro why you two-timing on your
    senpai with Miko-chan, but Tsubame thought she could give this some thought.
    Like, three months more thought, thanks to Ishigami's stupidity. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Like, you think girls aren't into legends, especially in a school festival?
    You are NOT suitable for this woman. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But that's that, best way to
    make sure they don't interfere with the main couple, I guess. Wait, main not
    yet couple. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, the campfire lit up thanks to our resident ace
    archer Kaguya, and we come back to that phantom thief dropping scares on the
    field again. I mean, at this point you would've known even without me
    putting spoilers up front that Shirogane Miyuki is that thief. No really,
    this whole thing is literally his shtick, or else how could one steal the
    ball at the roof which he made and dump a bunch of fire-resistant papers
    into a campfire where the thief knew paper will burn so he could prevent
    this to become an accident or else there will be no school festival? Think
    about it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay we don't know about the paper part, but Kaguya
    knows. So yeah, intended for her to find him out and everyone else to be
    amazed by how big this mystery is lol Fujiwara you idiot you fell for it,
    Kaguya heads for the clock tower, which hints again, only the Student
    Council has access to the keys. So yep, as one of the reporters mentioned
    and Hayasaka then realizing and quivering at the corner lmao, someone
    planned well in advance. This one Miyuki, from the moment he knew his life
    in Shuchi'in is about to end, has planned all this for a moment with his
    beloved: Shinomiya Kaguya. I would say that it was the girl who fell for him
    but you know, about a year and a half ago the guy started it first. But at
    the top of the tower... we are STILL stuck with that problem, by the way. A
    friendly reminder how that the title was directly translated (I'm so sorry
    if the appendix in your body is stuck with English localization) to
    "Kaguya-sama wants to be confessed" because oh boy, did Shirogane not do it
    at all. After setting all this up, we finally find out why both of them will
    never confess to each other, making this an eternal stalemate so we can make
    more Anime seasons of it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The guy won't do it as his status is weak
    and will need to be recognized by the other, while the girl will never do it
    because it's against her ego, to say the least- Hey, she's a woman, guys
    confess to girls, ok?? Get that one straight dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, the
    guy still needs to be recognized. He did it by releasing all the balloons in
    the big golden ball he made for the festival thanks to the other club member
    shout out to her, he asked the principal to apply for Stanford with the
    other application left for his girl, and he set up the best mood value for
    whatever is about to happen up front as evaluated by Yukimura from "RikeKoi"
    lol sorry for Anime reference. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I would argue though? That a
    confession should NOT be your answer despite the slogan for this final
    episode to be "goodbye romance comedy" because no one said that a confession
    should be the answer to this. You can kiss, for example, and that'll prove
    the comedy part is over. Yep. And so she did it alright. So much so the
    butler wants to kill herself because single her is just going to be sh*t on
    by the master because she did the... not kiss by the way she learnt the
    wrong stuff from Nagisa and her boy so I would like to believe it's French
    kiss lmao that just makes it better haha what's wrong Hayasaka, but I'm just
    glad there is a conclusion to this whole lore we have so far. Because
    really, how far can we go on with this without people holding hands?
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay summary because this should be long enough, all in all I can
    only say this conclusion this season is enough. I cannot expect the real
    confession to happen anytime soon just because, and I cannot accept nothing
    to happen here also just because we are three seasons in. And because the
    confession has not yet happened - remember it's Shirogane to Shinomiya
    specifically for the title to hold - we are still in limbo for anything to
    roll such that this can happen. So yeah, pure genius play right here I must
    say totally not filler content by the way someone broke the fourth wall to
    say that lol I don't think so too it's just a good joke, but damn I wish I
    can go out with someone without having to confess my love for them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    No really, you should try that out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But I would argue again, that
    if Shirogane you set this all up, then maybe you should do the manly thing
    by confessing. But what do I know, we need a way to make sure this DOES NOT
    happen so... Oh

    So yeah, it has been a year, huh. Guess what happened the same day a year
    ago. There weren't chocolates passed around, that's for sure. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    Anyways, in this final episode of the series (#KomiSan24) we have some White
    Day to conclude the season. Tadano did the genius play by NOT doing it on
    the day where everyone did it where it was a school day and a day before the
    actual so one can give back the gifts easier unlike everyone else including
    Katai to Katou-san so good for you bro I know you don't care but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>,
    so he gets to do it at her place on a weekend, this guy. Yeah, real smart,
    right? Also evil, it's like he knows to do that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, he got
    interrogated by the father somehow lmao well this is how it works in
    interrogation rooms by the way they put Komi-san's dad in who doesn't talk,
    and then Shouko came back so that was a mess haha I meant her room, and the
    guy gave the gift. Hand cream is a surprise for what was chocolates because
    I swear the prices are different lol one is priceless it was handmade
    anyways how will the return gift be better <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>, and included is also
    just one candy. Yeah, so he likes the girl that much. Just a bit. Cheeky
    boy, this dude. Marvellous play there I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm taking
    notes, by the way, very important strats. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, we top up with some
    eraser wars. If you don't know what that is you are too old please leave
    lol, for back then when we used papers and had pencils to draw on them
    instead of iPads and Apple Pencils lmao, we have erasers to replace that
    Undo button. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So that for its rubbery texture is perfect for bumping
    into other ones, and that's how the joy of bumping each other happened, long
    before romance novels. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course, we don't really have to elaborate
    how
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/makeru" target="_blank">Makeru</a>-chan
    lost it's in her name, Najimi's eraser is a phoenix so they don't die lol
    they also don't have gender too what a coincidence haha, Tadano is normal so
    normal people suck at this lol same, Nakanaka obviously knows pro tactics
    here and her experience is real unlike Makeru's lol, Yamai's job is just to
    defend Komi-san's eraser what a surprise haha, Katai-kun's eraser with the
    bear icon on it destroyed Naruse's in a second lmao, and I guess everyone
    else is in this tournament because why not probably last day of school
    already and the teacher isn't here so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, just a great summary
    of everyone including the final reminiscence of the couple (they already
    are, what are you talking about they aren't) by the window on how great the
    first-year class was that set up to be the foundation of Komi-san and her
    high school life. Ironically I wondered why Tadano didn't mention about
    Komi-san opening up to this weird class will give her confidence for the new
    year, but considering that thanks to the outro they are in the same class
    again, this will no doubt just bring us more people who may or may not be in
    the class but are weird because why not we can hire 50 more voice actors
    into this series so everyone gets a cut since it's earning so much in views
    on Netflix. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, jokes everywhere, everyone. All in all, decent
    ending to otherwise a super entertaining series, I have mentioned before
    this has late 90s Anime vibes which is all the raze of Anime comedy series
    anyways so shout out to the author for making the timings and everything
    better along with the production here, and this was as easy as a series to
    watch and enjoy as it is to see the lore going forward. Don't expect anyone
    to date anytime soon by the way, but do expect all the jokes and moments
    that'll make Tadano scream harder than he was playing eraser wars. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    That, I think this series has done its job for conveying the mood. Heck, it
    might not even be enough I might as well go back to watch the episodes again
    now that they did the recap I want to see swimsuit Komi-san again haha ah

      >this is a Hachimitsu MVP episode</a
    >
    so LETS GOOOOO <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we are doing the sports
    festival and in Anime they always make it look good lol (#ShikimoriSan10),
    yeah guess who will be in the relay race that no one wants to join? We've
    got 5 slots though to let's make sure it's not anyone from the gang- Dammit.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, the gang ended up carrying the class to win the sports
    festival with the final event no one wants to contribute lol same dude, but
    let's talk about how we got there. As Hachimitsu said, it's different doing
    it for others, to see them smile, and that's what matters. But seriously
    though Hachimitsu can we guest you in "Slow Start" and intro you to
    Hana-chan? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I think you two will make great running buddies lmao.
    Anyways, the guys practiced for their relay race for a bit, well, maybe more
    than a bit considering the other 3 hardly need any practice lol they have
    other events to participate too, but Izumi and Hachimitsu have to. Hey, I
    wish people around me are my motivation to work harder, but in her case, I
    would too if I had such encouraging friends who will not give up despite
    their nightmare-level luck lol yes I'm talking about Izumi here. Because
    turns out we have Izumi who can run but is prone to disaster even that one
    rock on the ground could've sent him to the nearest hospital lol, versus
    Hachimitsu which is basically me who can't run&nbsp;but won't fall... sorry
    I jinxed it haha, each of their average speed checks out, so we good.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then we just let the other 3 do the hard work and we win. Easy.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, Hachimitsu daring the others by saying that seems like a chad
    move, because on the day itself where she puts in her best for the class in
    the ball toss event to help the girls recover some points because why isn't
    everyone helping her pick up the ball for her to toss them since she did the
    latter so well, is already burnt out after that and had to run for the final
    event? Man, I wouldn't want that too no wonder no one volunteered for the
    race. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, since we are all in it already, Hachimitsu thought
    why not put in her best, and she did. Despite running slow and still not as
    slow as me haha and I'm a male btw and falling after kind of losing
    conscious lol (yeah that's a thing everybody it can happen when you exert
    too much energy and want to puke I once puked on a run sprinting to the
    finish line in middle school and that wasn't great to do by the drain in
    front of the girls lol legit embarrassment there), dear petit girl here
    still managed to recover with her bruised knee and run close enough to reach
    Izumi as the next guy and pass the baton. So yeah Izumi can screw this up
    which is THE MAIN EVENT ladies and gentlemen lmao, for the unforeseen has
    happened which was his shoe fell off because who needs shoelaces they don't
    work, and Izumi kept his pace behind 5th place all the way until he reached
    Shikimori, and guess who helped to catch up. Yes, this girl and her fear of
    losing and her rage against Inuzuka is her motivation for jumping up 4
    places during her turn. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Now you know why we have this arrangement
    for the race, eh? Nekozaki doesn't have much motivation to offer. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    But yeah success story spoiler alert, they did win it for the class overall
    too, so all is well. All in all, I must keep emphasizing on the fantastic
    storytelling in this series. I don't know if the source material is like
    this adaptation, but damn did the Anime do it good. From whenever that is to
    do with Izumi to Kamiya to Hachimitsu... I cannot ask for more tears down my
    cheeks. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, that's also precisely why I can recommend
    this to others I know, for this is how much coolness and everything else
    within that exists, that made this great. It's not condescending, not that
    cynical, and just enough for you to feel. And that is probably what will
    make it stand out this season. We still have two more episodes to go, so I
    really wonder what will be the deal breaker here. I mean, we can't break up
    Izumi and Shikimori... or can we? Haha just joking I have no idea we shall
    see about it next week
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; Hachimitsu may be MVP but pissed off Shikimori is such a treat I
    can't even- Inuzuka I will protect you forever to witness this spectacle
    haha]

    YES. The time has come. For me to talk about my journey of listening to
    <b>Scenarioart's new album</b> this week. I mean, you saw my Twitter account
    and how the members simp for every Tweet I make? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Apart from that, I
    only picked up a handful more of their songs along with the topic song with
    that music video from two months ago but I noticed I went for more
    familiarity which really makes me think I'm listening to VELTPUNCH for some
    reason, that song with the same name as the album title? Yeah, I don't know
    how to describe it. To them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But hey, I like both of them so I
    won't even mind one over the other. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Wait, I DO mind one over the
    other VELTPUNCH is better! <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways haha, with this they are also
    initiated into the Klassic Note Collection which is my pride and commitment
    to showing the world hopefully them the songs I liked from them so... well,
    just for me I guess it's just easier to sink in to their songs now I don't
    have to search for it lmao<br />

    On news regarding music that is on Twitter lol why am I using the same
    paragraph intro again,

    so if you do not know of their solo music careers since their disbandment
    you should go listen to what they each have to offer (adequate title too,
    dark because of yucat and light because of the softer tunes of Neat's), glad
    that

    in 4 years after their recent live tour and goddamn it's about time we get
    more of these guys singing songs I can put on the rankings. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey,
    we lost a lot of Collection Artists recently, okay? We need more good stuff
    to cement this year's image.<br />
    <br />So for next week, marking the end of the month we have
    <b>The Floor's mini-album</b> which will be their 2nd after losing their
    bassist and composer so I can't wait for more songs to be impressed, and
    <b>Anime "Aharen-san" soundtrack</b> because I wanted the insert song in one
    episode, so let's hope we can get our hands on it on digital. Unlikely so we
    will see how to talk about this even next week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> After seeing a
    Facebook post too I followed these guys there, I will also take a listen to
    <b>Murder by Death's 1st album</b> back in 2002 (20 years ago btw) and
    listen to how much they take their style from folklore than exert their
    creativity in their variety of music instruments. So far I've heard a bit
    and, uh, don't mind the song titles okay? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;<br />

    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Cya guys then, and until next time... Coming up with a new website
    for Klassic Note is hard. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That's... all I can give you haha at some
    point I'll just use Github Pages to cheese all of this stuff I made on the
    left sidebar so don't worry about that lol I just like to play around the
    customization myself but website builders have gotten better over the years
    so (Bye haha)
