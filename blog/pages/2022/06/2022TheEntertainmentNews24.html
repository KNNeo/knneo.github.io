Hey in this new episode of a series I call "I want to do stuff but I'm too lazy
to do it"... I don't think seeing the sinseh for this week has helped much.
<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, maybe just get MC next week, eh? *sips on coffee* Haha yeah,
decaf by the way
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, let's talk Anime and music! Really needed that Saturday off to sleep
  more so we cramming all the stuff on Sunday now! Okay now I really want to
  review that Koko-chan photobook lol thank goodness I didn't get the signed
  copy to wait for another month right?? <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> It's out within two weeks but we
  see if that or the CDs come by first the exchange rate is LOW DUDE haha okay
  not really but I have plenty of review to go through starting <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> next week
  so that's going to fuel my sad, pathetic life for now haha ah-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I should stop writing sad intros like this at this rate people are going to
  leave- As if I'll read this again haha...<br />

  Oh boy can we not talk about how ironically sad Kanade-chan is now? She cute
  man cute girls can be forgiven of their sad lives or maybe just turn into a
  s*x slave or whatever. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#RikeKoiS211) we talk
  about company, it seems, because Kanade-chan and I are pretty much the same
  but she has a boyfriend now so <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Anyways for my single loner a** haha,
  everyone's having a great time in the festival we are not exactly done yet
  apparently, and I think we had some decent conclusion to the secondary
  couple... of not Kanade-chan haha yes I'm referring to Ibarada and Torasuke.
  For if not for the meddling of Yamamoto throughout I gotta say she's 2nd MVP
  after that kid (voiced by Kanno Mai apparently; Don't take my word for
  it,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://twitter.com/_m_aaii/status/1535554369462370305?s=20&amp;t=oDILgf5BPfRC3nUVxsdkIw"
    target="_blank"
    >she mentioned about it on Twitter</a
  >) who loves marriage (haha get married to me then <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>) and loved anyone
  who dressed up in wedding outfits which was a rarity among the public as it
  supposedly makes your marriage shorter (I mean, so everyone at
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wedding_ainaka/" target="_blank">Ainaka</a>
  is screwed? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's a series hosted by Nanoka Ai where they cosplay
  wedding outfits and talk about marriage) to actually make Torasuke think that
  he has a double&nbsp;<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/hanayome"
    target="_blank"
    >hanayome</a
  >
  scenario right now lmao not with
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38101/5-toubun_no_Hanayome"
    target="_blank"
    >five siblings</a
  >
  though <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> then considers the reality that marrying ANY of them would be a
  nightmare as shown by how they have to scientifically prove that their age
  don't matter yet on why they can be in wedding dresses and NOT married *OOF*
  but also that Yamamoto is too desperate lmao, and Ibarada... let's just say if
  you can jebait her into getting married to you Torasuke you would've succeeded
  in life. Or so we think haha, because besides not ruining the future that is
  the kid who loves seeing people get married lol the brass band though, they
  also, again with the help of a push from Yamamoto but to them is out of
  nowhere or maybe Ibarada is behind this lmao, they... uh... yeah, brushed
  their lips upon each other. That's called a kiss though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Torasuke
  looks as confused as ever which only made me realize he might be better off
  marrying Yamamoto instead lmao, and Ibarada... let's just say we might be a
  couple more kisses more into breaking this woman. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, fun times
  are over lol, so let's talk about what will likely conclude this season, so
  yes normal dating-a-dude Kanade-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Apart from the fact that
  Yukimura got the data he wanted from Chris which from the final episode
  preview is likely going to prove Kanade being normal is fine or not who knows,
  is also approaching her in the worst way possible ie. directly, so what a
  surprise, he gotta try another time. I mean, you gotta think about it though:
  If Yukimura were the Prophet or something who has come to save you or
  something, and you keep running away from it... does that ironically make you
  an idiot? Haha that's all the lore I can give you Kanade-chan. For if you were
  to be confessed by Shikijou and you DARE to say no to such a nice guy or
  probably the only nice guy in your life... I'm pretty sure your future will be
  even more bleak than you would have otherwise behaved "normal"... or will it?
  Hey, it's all down spiral now so you tell me. All in all... I think the final
  episode next week will tell us about what will happen to Kanade-chan's life
  going ahead. Yeah, this is getting too real I need this to end now- Thank
  goodness I (fourth wall break) watched this first to avoid getting ruined by
  this plot, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, strategic planning by the way it has been
  calculated that I can compensate the sadness of this series with all the other
  comedy series I'm watching down the line this season haha see you all then
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; If you think the dreads of Kanade's problems will be an issue for this
  great series fear not because everyone besides the main characters are doing
  their job keeping the comedy part of this series alive haha]

  Valentine's Day? Haha uh oh did I just spoil the content on the final episode?

  *ah* Hmm maybe, but we can talk about the recent
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hatsuyuki" target="_blank">snowfall</a>
  first. From snow... structure building lol to sipping them tea in the snow lol
  that's called free air conditioning haha, our dear couple is having a great
  time in the winter. But you know, great times do not last as FYI snow melts,
  and they had to build it up again after school. Yes, I know, I saw the
  hand-warming part it's totally normal anyways just like going back home
  together clinging on to each other type of normal- Speaking of normal though,
  apparently Satou-san is thinking normal, you know, how normal couples should
  behave, and thought that Aharen and Raidou are kind of in that case which she
  isn't exactly wrong and looks like only the girl has woken up to see that
  reality to her normal life- OKAY STOP HERE STOP HERE. CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT
  NORMAL?? RIKEKOI IS GETTING TRIGGERED lol why can't we have nice things?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking about nice things though, we do have a nice thing coming up
  on their day off, which is basically a mall date until you realize Raidou's
  imagination isn't entirely a joke because somehow Aharen IS there to
  participate in the... blade spinner tournament haha I know, this series can
  air 20 years ago and kids will still get that reference lol f**king Beyblades
  man, but thought they had so much time coming in they literally are having a
  date before that which is real efficient I gotta say, but yeah, also because
  it's a good time for Aharen to plan for a family dinner in due time which I
  assume for New Year's, and Raidou is invited. No bringing in of his sister
  though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, before that, Aharen had to do a test run so maybe
  we'll get the real deal squeezed in next week who knows there are so much lore
  going just this episode alone I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of lore,
  Futaba-chan is here too going on date with Akkun- Yeah, right. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But
  yeah, looks like everyone's here for the tournament lol and Futaba is only
  proving herself to be the best girlfriend around apart from King Aharen lmao,
  so I won't even bother saying who's better, the tournament just ranked all of
  them so you can go figure. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I think Raidou might be in
  trouble soon. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, from the outro at least, as looks like from Oshiro
  missing in action it looks like instead of going to school (lol why) she is
  training in the dojo? Okay Assassin's Creed, why are you even here <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So
  we shall see if in this lovely and happy and romantic series will we get our
  first character death. Haha see you all at the other side then lol get it
  because Raidou will be dead? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "Do you think they are going steady yet? Or not?" "Honestly saying,
  it's hard to say" IS IT THOUGH?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey]

  Oh yeah, we at the haunted house lol I'm like "what is with this ear-cutting
  lore" haha anyone scared yet? In this new episode of this Honshin Festival Arc
  haha boy am I hyped (#KaguyaSamaS310), there's nothing that can go wrong with
  all of their romance advances... right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, Shinomiya's might be
  ruined for now so let's get spooked by the haunted house and move on...?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, starting with this sounds like a mistake, but I think it's
  even more of a mistake when you slap binaural ASMR things into this and of
  course, doing it budget because instead of getting a dummy head which is all
  the craze for online creators right now... we used a real person haha poor
  Miko-chan who had to also do multiple retakes of this because apart from the
  obvious screaming she had to experience herself before getting duct-taped in
  the mouth lol what is with this BDSM lore haha, we also had to reveal pretty
  much all of Miko-chan lore from her obsession to listening to dudes in her
  ears and classmates knowing all of it, then putting her on the seat to do all
  the scary stuff that was supposed to be for the haunted house where I don't
  know if it's legal to lock any two people inside a locker and experience all
  those that Maki-chan and Kaguya has went through <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> but surprisingly
  thanks to that one couple just furiously making out in the closet instead,
  they (yes Nagisa and her dude) TOTALLY ruined Ishigami's plans for going to
  this with Tsubame-senpai which of course would be awesome to watch haha I like
  how this ties together, then had to come up with another plan which is
  interestingly right around the corner, in Tsubame's class project for the
  festival. For some reason someone made a huge heart-shaped cookie to put
  inside the prizes for a shooting gallery and Ishigami nailed the game
  immediately so... guess what he chose as the prize. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And yeah, if
  that is not obvious enough, he gave a heart-shaped thing to Tsubame and... you
  know, she had to take it, right? RIGHT?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I call this a
  success, by the way. At least his plan has come to fruition, really depends on
  if the senpai will take it or not, and I don't mean literally. So yeah, claps
  all around, he did it, unlike Shirogane who is still stuck at giving anything
  to his girl or vice versa, and apparently Moeha too who is Chika-chan's sister
  (I gotta say it that way since they both Fujiwara) and is surprisingly into
  the President for some reason. I really liked how Chika had to explain to her
  sister that it wasn't the part that he made the effort to overcome all his
  weaknesses, but that PROCESS that will be your current life AND next life's
  nightmare lol yeah we have to go that far. Or else how would you be able to
  explain that Shirogane is a literal clown because he has no skills whatsoever
  but can do everything from juggling to playing with toys as taught by his
  grandmother who of course, died probably at some point due to overcoming with
  illness so she can stop teaching her grandson to any capacity. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah
  hey, all is done behind the scenes, you can't prove me wrong. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What
  you can prove me right is probably the feels that Moeha has with Kaguya as
  they both share consent in their affections for Shirogane which at this point,
  we know someone is likely closer to him than the other so let's see if Chika
  here will lose a sister in a week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, the heart-shaped
  balloons which went missing probably was because people are trying to find
  stuff to gift their prospective partners which also meant stealing is NOT a
  crime here lmao, Miko-chan is already MVP for screaming and tied up in a
  closed environment hehe I won't say I hated that at all, and Chika-chan is
  probably right we can only hope that Tsubame will accept Ishigami's feelings
  but not because he lacks in confidence. I mean, this confession is confidence,
  right? What else do you even need? That's what will fuel you the rest of your
  life- I don't have a girlfriend I wouldn't know. Haha we shall see how this
  pans out for the rest of them I'll take this midpoint confession first from
  Ishigami though

  Wow okay Onemine asking Komi-san what she's going to do for Valentine's Day,
  huh? Uh... uh... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we are still
  <i>not too sure </i>about her feelings towards Tadano haha YEAH RIGHT
  (#KomiSan22), looks like this week's theme is just giving chocolates, huh.
  Well, that's going to be fun... or so we think, because you gotta remember
  Tadano is a normal person so NO ONE gives chocolates to him lol, and Komi-san
  doesn't make them since she has no friends before this don't even say boy
  friends haha see what I did there that spacing is the romance gap lmao, so I
  guess Onemine asked people to help her out since she is making it for like, 20
  people in her family or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, dealing with Onemine or
  even Ootori is fine until you realize we're going to Onemine's place with the
  three younger siblings who are the bane of the reality of this series since
  the very first episode, will learn that Komi-san is actually scary and not
  cute and can't speak up for sh*t so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Also how dare you spank her
  butt, the guys in class don't even get to-) so hopefully that reality check
  will make Komi-san remember that she can open her mouth... at the times that
  matter. Speaking about times that matter, we have the day itself. Everyone
  made chocolates. Or you just buy them I guess lol Najimi. But you know, all of
  them girls have something to give out including Katai lmao, and damn are the
  reactions a blast! Ignoring the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tomochoko" target="_blank"
    >friendly chocolates</a
  >
  Komi-san had to give to the others literally for being friends with her
  because what is thankfulness in this time and age especially when you don't
  have friends lol (hey me haha), the ones given to guys by the girls were of
  course the chocolate dressing on the chocolate lol, from Yamai-san who wants
  three times back of her
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/girichoko" target="_blank"
    >obligatory chocolates</a
  >
  on White Day haha I hope you don't mind store-bought ones I think yours were
  handmade, Nakanaka definitely nailed on the delivery here and I wish RumiRumi
  would give me chocolates ("the real deal" hehe I can't even <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>), to Sasaki
  just dumping on her friends for not giving to their crushes lmao, and Inaka
  not knowing about chocolates at all let alone Valentine's... it seems like
  everyone was having a fun time including Katai. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, he gave
  chocolates but also he GOT chocolates, dude! Can't even compare... to...
  Tadano. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah we know the sister is also dumping on him when he
  reached home and the mom gave him his consolation prize for the year lol my
  mom don't even make chocolates haha (I like the narrator shitting on him "he's
  been reduced to this state" lmao), but that was when Hitomi noticed the
  hesitation crawling at their front porch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I wouldn't call this
  present anywhere close to
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/honmei" target="_blank">honmei</a> and it's
  not because of their relationship at this point I would argue Komi-san
  could've done it any earlier and said (oh) it was friendly chocolate and it
  would've been fine but you know, what do I know, right? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all,
  I wonder why did I not die during any Valentine's Day considering I got
  nothing for about a decade and a half since entering school lmao *ack*, and we
  all know Onemine's youngest sister at 3 years old is the MVP this episode.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, can't wait for more not romance action in this series amirite???
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Why is life so harsh to Hito-chan haha I know right Komi-san should
  call him that hehe

  has hit a new low. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Why would I say that though? Apart from already
  knowing a couple of digital singles from last year which I did not give off
  the bat (I recall the days in 2010 where I just give the one thing before the
  album), I also am not entirely impressed by the topic song which is real not
  memorable where everything else is your usual good stuff from this
  instrumental group. So... compared to the 2020 album though? This pales in
  comparison, I will tell you that. Maybe more next time, I guess.<br />

  which only reminds me of why I knew of the latter in the first place (through
  NANO-MUGEN FES and its compilation),

  the TrySail members

  Tomatsu Haruka's which by the way also explains why her audition song was also
  from her titled "Baby Baby Love". Not the best song from Tomacchan but as an
  interviewer I think that will make Nan-chan sound cute back then in 2011.

  So for next week we have a free week available which means thanks to the
  recent live performance compilation I saw (METROCK 2022 by the way) I think we
  can dive into a couple of artists and their long albums to see if we can like
  any more of them, and in no order that will be
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/event-horizon/1610443842?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >Kami wa Saikoro wo Furanai's major 1st album</a
    ></b
  >
  (yep, you bet that's the artist title) of 20 tracks somehow and is pops heavy
  who took long time to get to major label by the way more than 5 years,
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%AE%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC/1592471021?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >Humbreader's new album</a

  from last year which I did not give back then,
  <b

      >Penthouse's new song</a

  because I don't know whether they would sound good in love songs so here's a
  first look I guess, and
  <b

      target="_blank"
      >Creepy Nuts' new album</a

  from last year and let's take this as a trial run for what might be me giving
  Anime "Yofukashi no Uta" theme songs because they are all about that and I
  might not be for the plot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We shall see, guys. Seriously though,
  when's the last time I even just gave Hip Hop music, ignoring the rap? Anime
  "BLEACH" theme songs with Takacha? Yeah haha<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  And as I watch the final episode of Anime "Hatena Illusion" and not bothered
  to write a review of it especially when I missed it nearly two years later
  haha, and that's why I watch Anime, isn't it. For all the fun we can have
  every week no matter how life goes. It's like drama, but waaay more
  imaginative. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Gotta say I think I only missed the conclusion to the
  fight with the aunt...? Yeah the grandma lore we can do without. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Okay who cares I'm done with that shitshow. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you guys next week
  then, and until next time I'll play some Moonlighter video game now before I
  sleep since I've never given them money and some of the new games announced
  this week remind me of this game so might as well give them 5 bucks (USD)
  after all this time lol bye<br />
