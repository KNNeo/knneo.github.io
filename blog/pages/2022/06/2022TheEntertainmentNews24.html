I don't think seeing the sinseh for this week has helped much. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, maybe just get MC next week, eh? *sips on coffee* Haha yeah, decaf by the way<div><br></div><div>Anyways, let's talk Anime and music! Really needed that Saturday off to sleep more so we cramming all the stuff on Sunday now! Okay now I really want to review that Koko-chan photobook lol thank goodness I didn't get the signed copy to wait for another month right?? <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> It's out within two weeks but we see if that or the CDs come by first the exchange rate is LOW DUDE haha okay not really but I have plenty of review to go through starting <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> next week so that's going to fuel my sad, pathetic life for now haha ah-</div><div><br></div><div>I should stop writing sad intros like this at this rate people are going to leave- As if I'll read this again haha...<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=RikeKoiS211><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita. Heart</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Just like he said, I'm an empty person" SAME haha</div></blockquote>Oh boy can we not talk about how ironically sad Kanade-chan is now? She cute man cute girls can be forgiven of their sad lives or maybe just turn into a s*x slave or whatever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#RikeKoiS211) we talk about company, it seems, because Kanade-chan and I are pretty much the same but she has a boyfriend now so <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Anyways for my single loner a** haha, everyone's having a great time in the festival we are not exactly done yet apparently, and I think we had some decent conclusion to the secondary couple... of not Kanade-chan haha yes I'm referring to Ibarada and Torasuke. For if not for the meddling of Yamamoto throughout I gotta say she's 2nd MVP after that kid (voiced by Kanno Mai apparently; Don't take my word for it, <a href="https://twitter.com/_m_aaii/status/1535554369462370305?s=20&amp;t=oDILgf5BPfRC3nUVxsdkIw" target=_blank>she mentioned about it on Twitter</a>) who loves marriage (haha get married to me then <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>) and loved anyone who dressed up in wedding outfits which was a rarity among the public as it supposedly makes your marriage shorter (I mean, so everyone at <a href=https://www.instagram.com/wedding_ainaka/ target=_blank>Ainaka</a> is screwed? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's a series hosted by Nanoka Ai where they cosplay wedding outfits and talk about marriage) to actually make Torasuke think that he has a double <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hanayome target=_blank>hanayome</a> scenario right now lmao not with <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/38101/5-toubun_no_Hanayome target=_blank>five siblings</a> though <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> then considers the reality that marrying ANY of them would be a nightmare as shown by how they have to scientifically prove that their age don't matter yet on why they can be in wedding dresses and NOT married *OOF* but also that Yamamoto is too desperate lmao, and Ibarada... let's just say if you can jebait her into getting married to you Torasuke you would've succeeded in life. Or so we think haha, because besides not ruining the future that is the kid who loves seeing people get married lol the brass band though, they also, again with the help of a push from Yamamoto but to them is out of nowhere or maybe Ibarada is behind this lmao, they... uh... yeah, brushed their lips upon each other. That's called a kiss though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Torasuke looks as confused as ever which only made me realize he might be better off marrying Yamamoto instead lmao, and Ibarada... let's just say we might be a couple more kisses more into breaking this woman. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, fun times are over lol, so let's talk about what will likely conclude this season, so yes normal dating-a-dude Kanade-chan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Apart from the fact that Yukimura got the data he wanted from Chris which from the final episode preview is likely going to prove Kanade being normal is fine or not who knows, is also approaching her in the worst way possible ie. directly, so what a surprise, he gotta try another time. I mean, you gotta think about it though: If Yukimura were the Prophet or something who has come to save you or something, and you keep running away from it... does that ironically make you an idiot? Haha that's all the lore I can give you Kanade-chan. For if you were to be confessed by Shikijou and you DARE to say no to such a nice guy or probably the only nice guy in your life... I'm pretty sure your future will be even more bleak than you would have otherwise behaved "normal"... or will it? Hey, it's all down spiral now so you tell me. All in all... I think the final episode next week will tell us about what will happen to Kanade-chan's life going ahead. Yeah, this is getting too real I need this to end now- Thank goodness I (fourth wall break) watched this first to avoid getting ruined by this plot, yes? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, strategic planning by the way it has been calculated that I can compensate the sadness of this series with all the other comedy series I'm watching down the line this season haha see you all then</div><div>[TL:DR; If you think the dreads of Kanade's problems will be an issue for this great series fear not because everyone besides the main characters are doing their job keeping the comedy part of this series alive haha]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhraa4kU2KtpJPkHce9OBFyO6D2oQtaY-38zWHyQsSUel7joGboAbWUDVtBqlUJBBqZdsm7jGp06BtDL-5pFmcBbITjNhRr_LPKd6ZQ1hPerZ-jYUl2RB9zf3IYo38gm1ZeayJIyHvIoTqhHL_WrJgWulIDfsco1eL-d3FcbDWk6X-_gFtwAcUal9Fq/s1600/rikekoiS211_hit.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When you say to call off the wedding as you walk down the aisle haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzLfKY3ot0l5-3Vs10SVKqM8kHg5FOcUNntqgMfrNakjZ4lTawfoo95qLWhWhIGFCtKoPT83uzWAMMbrcrVH84fm8Ugdhh1UO18jqwoduW41Tb8JLOYRR-bQgnCdAk6IiE2aUGgUNPgmqXLOsWKMxAKsXJvmxjTtbS89iHvbW3gqyvh_rU2BUPGqy4/s320/rikekoiS211_yamamoto6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Legit surprised when I saw this beauty that is not Yukimura cross-dressed lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqx8IyxD4Oqn1gDtwIdfx-5OdsgRuMZ0M_49X8VmJtTjLEm9TFkys1ebJXnFvc-3i2cukYAPP8S268aiNvBT_S7KBqjw98_2fs1eRMHLG0uYhNQeDPsfVWtzFYsRaa0cpNuODyoE2_dq3CSLxZZOyUZ5rCe0vAaVjUiDM-pTgSa4zNg-0vKXz0Q1r4/s320/rikekoiS211_yamamoto9.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>NOT THIS <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br>(Hey here's a worldwide appeal to all girls turning 30, I'm available so we can date haha)</table></div></div>P.S.

Haha even countries up north wouldn't have thought of that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#AharenSan11) hey it's winter season what do you think will happen in Valentine's Day? Haha uh oh did I just spoil the content on the final episode? Ah hey, it's kinda standard in these, right? Then again where's Christmas? *ah* Hmm maybe, but we can talk about the recent <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hatsuyuki target=_blank>snowfall</a> first. From snow... structure building lol to sipping them tea in the snow lol that's called free air conditioning haha, our dear couple is having a great time in the winter. But you know, great times do not last as FYI snow melts, and they had to build it up again after school. Yes, I know, I saw the hand-warming part it's totally normal anyways just like going back home together clinging on to each other type of normal- Speaking of normal though, apparently Satou-san is thinking normal, you know, how normal couples should behave, and thought that Aharen and Raidou are kind of in that case which she isn't exactly wrong and looks like only the girl has woken up to see that reality to her normal life- OKAY STOP HERE STOP HERE. CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT NORMAL?? RIKEKOI IS GETTING TRIGGERED lol why can't we have nice things? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking about nice things though, we do have a nice thing coming up on their day off, which is basically a mall date until you realize Raidou's imagination isn't entirely a joke because somehow Aharen IS there to participate in the... blade spinner tournament haha I know, this series can air 20 years ago and kids will still get that reference lol f**king Beyblades man, but thought they had so much time coming in they literally are having a date before that which is real efficient I gotta say, but yeah, also because it's a good time for Aharen to plan for a family dinner in due time which I assume for New Year's, and Raidou is invited. No bringing in of his sister though? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, before that, Aharen had to do a test run so maybe we'll get the real deal squeezed in next week who knows there are so much lore going just this episode alone I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking of lore, Futaba-chan is here too going on date with Akkun- Yeah, right. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, looks like everyone's here for the tournament lol and Futaba is only proving herself to be the best girlfriend around apart from King Aharen lmao, so I won't even bother saying who's better, the tournament just ranked all of them so you can go figure. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... I think Raidou might be in trouble soon. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, from the outro at least, as looks like from Oshiro missing in action it looks like instead of going to school (lol why) she is training in the dojo? Okay Assassin's Creed, why are you even here <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So we shall see if in this lovely and happy and romantic series will we get our first character death. Haha see you all at the other side then lol get it because Raidou will be dead? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "Do you think they are going steady yet? Or not?"

In this new episode of this Honshin Festival Arc haha boy am I hyped (#KaguyaSamaS310), there's nothing that can go wrong with all of their romance advances... right? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, Shinomiya's might be ruined for now so let's get spooked by the haunted house and move on...? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, starting with this sounds like a mistake, but I think it's even more of a mistake when you slap binaural ASMR things into this and of course, doing it budget because instead of getting a dummy head which is all the craze for online creators right now... we used a real person haha poor Miko-chan who had to also do multiple retakes of this because apart from the obvious screaming she had to experience herself before getting duct-taped in the mouth lol what is with this BDSM lore haha, we also had to reveal pretty much all of Miko-chan lore from her obsession to listening to dudes in her ears and classmates knowing all of it, then putting her on the seat to do all the scary stuff that was supposed to be for the haunted house where I don't know if it's legal to lock any two people inside a locker and experience all those that Maki-chan and Kaguya has went through <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> but surprisingly thanks to that one couple just furiously making out in the closet instead, they (yes Nagisa and her dude) TOTALLY ruined Ishigami's plans for going to this with Tsubame-senpai which of course would be awesome to watch haha I like how this ties together, then had to come up with another plan which is interestingly right around the corner, in Tsubame's class project for the festival. For some reason someone made a huge heart-shaped cookie to put inside the prizes for a shooting gallery and Ishigami nailed the game immediately so... guess what he chose as the prize. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And yeah, if that is not obvious enough, he gave a heart-shaped thing to Tsubame and... you know, she had to take it, right? RIGHT?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I call this a success, by the way. At least his plan has come to fruition, really depends on if the senpai will take it or not, and I don't mean literally. So yeah, claps all around, he did it, unlike Shirogane who is still stuck at giving anything to his girl or vice versa, and apparently Moeha too who is Chika-chan's sister (I gotta say it that way since they both Fujiwara) and is surprisingly into the President for some reason. I really liked how Chika had to explain to her sister that it wasn't the part that he made the effort to overcome all his weaknesses, but that PROCESS that will be your current life AND next life's nightmare lol yeah we have to go that far. Or else how would you be able to explain that Shirogane is a literal clown because he has no skills whatsoever but can do everything from juggling to playing with toys as taught by his grandmother who of course, died probably at some point due to overcoming with illness so she can stop teaching her grandson to any capacity. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, all is done behind the scenes, you can't prove me wrong. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What you can prove me right is probably the feels that Moeha has with Kaguya as they both share consent in their affections for Shirogane which at this point, we know someone is likely closer to him than the other so let's see if Chika here will lose a sister in a week. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, the heart-shaped balloons which went missing probably was because people are trying to find stuff to gift their prospective partners which also meant stealing is NOT a crime here lmao, Miko-chan is already MVP for screaming and tied up in a closed environment hehe I won't say I hated that at all, and Chika-chan is probably right we can only hope that Tsubame will accept Ishigami's feelings but not because he lacks in confidence. I mean, this confession is confidence, right? What else do you even need? That's what will fuel you the rest of your life- I don't have a girlfriend I wouldn't know. Haha we shall see how this pans out for the rest of them I'll take this midpoint confession first from Ishigami though</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnela41QFbWgUbCuoMuvBUcxPyu8sWEnC8aZ1wnc3r8_BuaXloS2hwq748HhQC650v1azrB5EvM5VWwtn1ZweQt7ZCD_eVECodJQ7ggcr4-SRwK0cLCa5roOrqqKP1bZ9E_E8D1At86eLtIiXHDh53c9OysnhlpofwEhA_PSe2ByohqxV40lIuvWTu/s320/kaguyasamaS310_bois.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Photoshop this into a porno I want to see shit happen haha<br>(Like, everyone knows by now, Miko-chan)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyzjmmLMp27HNgCsKfl7hsPnl1B0h3rxrMfngLmmVMigW8E7O5bESq-d7lvPnL4u0ywWWvVH4hxcWJAe6XZ3KFZanbgpDioqcTxFXI8JZEZ1-ESwWyPCMn2kyuXHCid0bzYm1UtohVLMs8jl3j9tWzcVEgpzbDZDhq3HhZFgk38flofZHJZdllWyWP/s320/kaguyasamaS310_fear5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Photoshop this into a porno I want to see shit happen haha<br>(Love the screams in this episode haha ah)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOAsHh06CVKWGnts3MfdXQiscFjlwZXEE-SI2qidLPWdiWTcczzLifEMAfupJG2vDaUEUDvAiWm9Mqyyb-Cw-G7WldqwSLX29iBrgGDPVJ18FN6hjhmbKTDE4j3J1HmjRcI0FBHx9biTfFqF6wTzSla_WQqbE1VDSxm_WpABY6V2S35xlfZYDQngOb/s320/kaguyasamaS310_tied.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Photoshop this into a porno I want to see shit happen haha<br>(Seriously though HOW WRONG IS THIS lol)</table></div></div>P.S.
