Or maybe I'll just do it and it's half full and I'll just watch the others another time? We shall see, I can just live on with Panadol anyways unless it's... that... virus lol I checked and I don't think so hahahaha...</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, Anime and music! Not much on the music part but we can Anime<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=RikeKoiS210><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita. Heart</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"It's time to go for my part-time job" Oh we gonna see Haru-chan again? lol <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gyaru target=_blank>GYARU</a> HYPE haha</div></blockquote>Oh come on Himuro, Yukimura didn't eye on his students. They don't align with the list of factors of beauty for him to be cheating on you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#RikeKoiS210) where we still ignore the stuff that is Kanade-chan and Yukimura's conflict or tensions or whatever, we talk about Haru-chan, that girl who got taught by Yukimura as a part-time tutor. Problem of course is not he didn't tell the girlfriend he was tutoring a gyaru of all people lol, but more that he's doing it for a respected professor ie. Haru's father, but of course unlike the father, did not associate the daughter's image to her learning abilities, and especially after teaching the damn girl he had a conversation with the father, in which Yukimura "kindly" reminded the father about a couple of experiments which talk about discrimination and encouragement to be done right in people's childhood. And that is primarily true, for honestly speaking, teaching parents to encourage their children is sadly, not in their curriculum. So no surprises there, that the father rather just sh*t on the kid and not do more research as a professor himself to know that, apart from the fashionable image change which takes a lot of effort to prove she is not lazy, also does not change one's character for this is very aesthetic-based, and Haru-chan here is still an innocent, demotivated JK running away from the reality of her father's high expectations. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> What DID motivate her and possibly all of us here including them female fans of this series haha I have a feeling when you do this stuff you will get more females to watch, is cross-dressing Yukimura, I mean, the cosplay experiment love thing during Saitama University's school festival! So yeah blah blah Yukimura dressed up as a woman is more attractive than the average woman on the streets lmao, Torasuke is horny about Ibarada's high school friends popular in social media AND Yukimura haha, and I don't know if police Himuro or maid outfit Kanade-chan wins. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Let Ibarada also cosplay so we can actually compare all of them together. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Haru-chan dropped by the festival out of curiosity which I would say is not totally an attribute of gyarus by the way, bumped into Himuro and finding out the wonders of being in university. Particularly, this one her sensei is attending. Somehow around there and Yukimura telling her father off, I think it's more than enough to convince Haru herself to work towards better grades and hopefully, coming into Saitama if she can. Why not, right? We have maybe less than three years left, we can work out something. And it looks like next episode we're getting Himuro and Yukimura married? HELL YEAH haha about time lol normally people get married by 20 so they are already late. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... wait, no Haru-chan cosplay? That lab coat was it?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh welp, I really thought of ogling into some JK action and we got nothing. Damn. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, we can only get this excited without them aphrodisiacs okay? Haha don't buy anything from Sui-chan please don't lol now I really wonder what the ending of this season will be about if it's not Yamamoto vs Ibarada lmao yeah I'm still into that I want that shit show now haha</div><div>[TL:DR; Shout out again to all parents out there, because TEACH YOUR DAMN KIDS dude haha why are we always reminded of bad parenting in Anime]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiXFtOhBIcL8Va9Clb6lOD_sFZnIvQq0GgHm6E4Ko_ZOP5-uQAQo_UdWGN6ostNBOI3asv4wSkQw0QIQnkR3SUEuTeNvzORIa6NflD12d2RexmgNbP-n3T9iictgWI7Zq0nmNsIhYcqarOQqEeh13OsuSmKZRdQckf_gzZQ6qm70-B5bIMClmle7Il/s320/rikekoiS210_kanade1.jpg width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0mBTgkMEeqRN--XR6OFW54MSJLatQjuUMBFjHD7S_ITdPhM6FA7QO34-8xk3R2GhUeeeOnGbQwJNa5u9Yg5QSvydLyEtl-Yo3fIKhIIS36lfapwJ5B0d0nrdXekQk0-WxQV075s8nSil_CISWZHt7MKzG6mBCjhqV3nM4rotuK1GvdBzp52c7d3jb/s320/rikekoiS210_himuro3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption colspan=2 style=text-align:center>Seriously who do you think won the cosplay contest?

The sensei was nice enough to drive the kids up to the mountains (not Tobaru, by the way, she cannot drive under such circumstances lol yeah literal safety advisory) despite her busy schedule because I swear if she doesn't drift up that mountain on time before the sun sets I'm afraid Aharen also can't carry her luggage up there by the next morning either. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Even then, Aharen did NOT bring the ingredients so we can have some sweet BBQ or whatever people cook at the mountains or by the river, so Raidou thought of being the wild approach (oh yeah this is not even close to wild, we talk about that later hehe <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> ah my dry eyes) of sourcing for ingredients in the woods, so you know, mushrooms which are edible paired with fish... speared by Oshima because there is no way Raidou can do it himself despite him bragging as such since the other had experience doing this anyways, brought enough stuff together to ensure they can have a great dinner. The true camping experience, by the way. You will still need supervision on this though don't want to be eating poisonous fungi and drop dead we still got lore to talk about. Speaking of which, it was late at night, the other two decide to leave our main couple alone to watch the stars apparently Raidou legit thought they were lost lol, and it somehow got Aharen thinking. Goddamn I don't even want to describe it, but thanks to Oshima later in the tent consoling her dear friend about a potential confession to the guy she likes ie. Raidou, Aharen really went out and had some cup noodles lol but also, she said the thing. Can't really hear it not that the gust of wind is making it worse either because also recall she can't speak up anyways, we LITERALLY got jebaited into a confession accented by the background music I guess, but what was more surprising was that (spoiler alert) kiss. Yep, Aharen did it too. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> YOU MADE HER CRY TOO RAIDOU HOW DARE YOU- At this point I would like to remind all of us that we are not even close to the ending, so if this is the shtick that'll carry us till the end I would like to know how much more of these will be happen- Ah, Tobaru-sensei fainted for some reason. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Worse case is, of course, that Oshima knows. She saw it, unlike the other two who went with them. Yep. Not like she can't hold a secret, but why would you bother holding wholesomeness as a secret- I, I just can't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... I can't unsee that, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's THAT good. But we did it guys, Episode 10, claps all around. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, really makes you wonder what else is left now, we still got two episodes by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hmm... is this too fast? Is if Raidou can comment on this as usual. But hey, what do you know about romance? Dear author Mizu Asato just dropped us on this lore faster than falling stars I can't even. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We shall see what happens till the end, yes? Sure got me good there though tbh</div><div>[TL:DR; Do you even know why, Tobaru-sensei at the outro, was wearing a blood red scarf to cover the bottom half of her face?

In this new episode of narrator could you please just get out already haha (#KaguyaSamaS309), we finally kickstart the school festival of rich, arrogant students. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, okay, that was a farce, but speaking of that, we got to find out how all this time, Shirogane has already lost. Uh huh, you heard that right, and even without this flashback I would argue it's so, that his first year in school is filled with people who are arrogant, a student council chairperson who didn't really sh*t on him to be honest, and 1x Shinomiya Kaguya who saved a girl who fell into the Singapore River when it was 1955. No really, go take a look yourself haha anyways, and that's why. But yeah, not hard to believe, and yes Kaguya did do that as a diplomatic gesture it was all worth it for the dad I guess lmao (again, like, who gives a fuck about that piece of shit-), but more importantly, was also the motivation for him to be who he is today. I know right, this series baiting you with the slogan "whoever confesses loses" but they were already in it so long ago I can't even. Hey, this is the action arc, okay? Speaking of action, Kaguya did NOT get that action in which was supposed to be a confession to who she likes, but I guess it did indirectly happen with - goddamn I wish I don't have to mention these guys as an April Fool's Day joke lol - two of the four Ramen Kings patronizing the class cosplay café. Besides shitting on Kaguya for not knowing how to make coffee considering we have Hayasaka cosplaying as a maid which is literally her job doing better than her however you see it lol can't cosplay better as a maid than Hayasaka if you are a maid! *taps brain* Haha so Kaguya did retort out of spite (not the Aharen-san way where you fail but) by showing off her tea preparation skills but also sort of revealing her "love" in preparing them as it was also probably intended for Shirogane who just dropped in as she was in the thick of teaching these old men a lesson- AND DON'T YOU DARE BRING IN THE OTHER TWO GUYS IN haha no really, please don't. *looks at eyecatch* I hate you all- Oh hey Shirogane dad. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Apart from Kaguya though, we have Ishigami also taking action against his <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> Tsubame, if you would recall, after he heard of the wonderful news that the closest person beside her crush in school is surprisingly attached (to Osaragi of all people lol I'll make this joke as long as I can remember) which means the other three nerd fans of her won't strike so Ishigami is definitely in the best position to get her out during the festival... alone, together. Yep. And thanks to the love triangle of this series lmao I really feel bad for Maki-chan shitting on herself while trying not to kill herself over whatever friends were making out in her face haha, but I guess Nagisa was right in helping the guy out by saying "just ask her out already" would be the move and it was considering his position as stated above, but also you have Maki-chan to go out with as backup if you fail so I guess... why not right? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What's the worst that can happen? Oh yeah Ishigami dying in the haunted house, right. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... it's kicking off alright, next episode will undoubtedly hear Ishigami scream at the top of his voice, the only chances Nagisa will scream though is probably if Maki-chan starts making out to her guy in front of her lmao, and I will scream if we don't get a proper confession out of Shirogane and/or Kaguya. Like really, I will go to Japan and burn down television stations lmao please don't sue me haha let's see if I have to get prepared for that next week lol</div><div>[TL:DR; I don't think I have to emphasize this again, frantic and/or embarrassed Shinomiya Kaguya is the best haha yes the power of love part is too good I can forgive them slotting the Ramen Kings for this bit lol what]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQ4N6hZ-xK8Qusk6vIJgb2PKitzagXvZGJS7rpCLT-WLw7KUqtl_ISvkdjJNKLAxYBPtUH9CHbcBi3uXh2jTIGLqtpib2v_Gv97xH-sR0fEVsB7Gprl0KUmoU6BnO7kjL3jSc1HfOnB_KhjIKvhbnwOeFSRz6yaBPkfbge9YVPQZwLkFYjdzDMPpQo/s1600/kaguyasamaS309_smile.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I smile lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1OCNdVFemnOuUi4x7XqhdjtlH-37Aqw2xjG62NTDfHyao8geiSCkJXfUetu8dVwuYO0R1ijjLi1n6sQIanyxezPksmEw4vqGx0xrwuh8AhzO2D0laYFihQrHqV0dH21AJUrY1An2wqxXOF587Q-pS755Y6jc88jUdElvaHsG7oa60-Krg_FZ2exnX/s320/kaguyasamaS309_cat.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't even know who she is but I'm grateful for this fanservice haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbn5FlZJN1wCJyAGb-nR9jGCJNmBzTSA-7mRRg4IuanR-dZ3Nf-9ND7Xz2NMxvThkhkoXHt6nO4I5gVd8mEPzAxhYiIlGROCC6BvEgTT4ZdoszMvR_SJtCmxSLUGd4N8XWmum_SLL3TljXlbjorz5DXvJrdK16J_G6EPjgatoknAkYJju4efgHFaOW/s320/kaguyasamaS309_outfit1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>And...

I see this blank of a page I don't know what to do with it. Hey, more friends made amirite?? In this new episode of the continuation of the Kyoto school trip (#KomiSan21), looks like this time around we are focusing on Katou and Sasaki-san over here who are in the same team as Komi-san instead of dealing with whatever is with Tadano's group lmao. Thanks to Katou-san's planned schedule in way too much detail, the girls get to go to... theme park rides I'm not going to do references here I swear haha, fed some deer <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senbei target=_blank>crackers</a> to actual deers, and even dressed up in outifts and had <a href=https://jisho.org/search/takoyaki target=_blank>takoyaki</a>... It was a fun time. But of course, this wouldn't be an episode of "Komi-san" if we do not talk about all of their personalities and weakness, so here we go. Katou-san might seem serious and is strict with time so much so she can devour food down in expense of moving on to other attractions she has planned, but I gotta say that is then poor planning even though Komi-san eventually went along and pressed on it since everything to her is pretty much first try even getting ambushed by a fake crowd of assassins lol, but you know, still fun times. Tiring, but still fun. The thing with Sasaki-san is probably the same as Katou who wants to be a professional shougi player which is impossible lol, but with her is probably even more impossible because apart from the kids in her childhood mocking her playing on stuff that probably is overdue in trend, but also, she dismissed her own identity on enjoying such a hobby even though it doesn't gain much general popularity. Hey, girl, I write this blog post every week you think people will mock at me when I do this? Yeah, I delisted this from search engines and disabled comments, what of it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, hobbies aren't something to be ashamed about to be honest, and even going professional isn't a joke at this time and era to be frank. That really made you wonder how Sasaki went so far as to think that Komi-san is in real trouble and "saved" her with her real yo-yo skills lmao the actors over there were probably really thrown off by this haha, so that works I guess. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> More importantly though haha I dismissed this stuff real quick lol it's a comedy romance series dude, we gotta talk more romance! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Katou is into Katai so let's assume the girl is a masochist lmao, and we all know who Komi-san likes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, we are this many episodes in we should know by now haha. And of course the trip back via train is the highlight of this episode because who cares about side characters with personality lmao, is that Komi-san gets to lie her head on Tadano's shoulder. Yeah, pretty good, right? Haha this is all, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I think I'm already jebaited into a series where "full of personalities" also means that Nakanaka will miss her newly-made friend which is a wooden katana lmao, but also means we have to deal with their quirks and/or problems when they arise. Well, some of them have lesser problems than others so there's that haha I don't know how to describe this series though every episode is just overall good</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg187g-w9RfLo9cfS1HH6mLKhsbuLeTHHRATZ0hIXS-ugU8e5aolo8uL788kzlFV2zTMbrYffgrS4kBaKODvHfR6WAz62Ge7QdD7ZfoqwKMe5MtduxQYYMEhPsh-86OolL1avCJrdgda9pfYaxz6FLXaLxtX7VfiRZjcR8dn662RlVqpt5di65omxle/s320/komisan21_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center><span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEim3Y95KdKyzspDE2ZWaMoAA8lwu92TAZzmQkyRYJPB0K7ZR6SQ2dRWcfnQlYYBd1Hu2-kP0I98sCwUeXf3NLABkZkoF5WuWgPDiEiRRByExWOxy5x2TZLX06rMUmBxYd0Srwgbfo4syS6moJPudQgtRW21hKvIWjZg9pGCNXRIlpyXpycGbq03rov8/s320/komisan21_girls2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Komi-san here you go this is what it feels like to have friends haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhp0EGmh3OnmLpCbrtE5I0GEjH2ebbjfyTw6n_Cr-_9enHGr9RhDZCvyMUKj3cD_fQ8qRf6bytSy6NHJjCKkoPiV8F6ptZ-YGnItKyM4WKqMuBxDMgzuZDO4OyOdAS3KImbvn-baVK-MNIbFYWVZgs9vX-03rK3TuQDVfRyJQRXi3JlCjmv157nEwAM/s320/komisan21_USJ.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yes they changed "Universal" to "Utopia" haha what's the difference<br></table></div></div>P.S.

OH??? Haha ah hey</div></blockquote>I'm watching the right Anime, right? This intro... oh Kamiya's here ok ok <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where Kamiya-san is the Cinderella of this series question mark? Haha I guess in this episode (#ShikimoriSan08) then we might have some fighting going. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Wait, THAT IS IT??? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay we gotta start from the top right now. So, about Kamiya. Surprisingly, I think I was wrong. Kamiya was NOT into Shikimori- Okay jokes over haha, Kamiya was into Izumi, so yes technically she was a love rival. Is she though? Because here's the big BUT here, but it was never meant to be. Yep, you got it now; This is technically worse than the first part of Cinderella. Actually, this is the part of Cinderella where no glass heels were found by the prince, and it's over. Yep, I have a feeling I have watched a series about sacrifice of love such that the main couple can get together, and I can only feel sadder on this. For because even Shikimori-san knows not to exchange the Love Couple numbers with Kamiya as much as she was willing to do so, then realized that this might also be the best opportunity for the outsider to ruin their relationship- What am I even saying haha. Okay, Shikimori definitely did NOT think of that, as her conversation with Kamiya tells us that people who like Izumi probably just want to be as nice as he is, and in turn, will lose the chance as long as the first chance was obtained. No trades or exchanges, by the way. And because Shikimori is so stuck up as much as she knows it might just have been her fault in triggering this, but I would also say Kamiya has come a long time to hide her own image even in front of her class so that's kinda on her. I really wonder what will happen if she did try to get Izumi from his girl though; We might actually have a season two. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Jokes aside, this is kinda sad to be honest, not that I have such an experience before unless you count the times I confessed and got rejected are so that I'm being nice to their future partners lmao, this wouldn't have been sadder. So yeah, Kamiya, find someone who can like you and let you be your true self. As cool as you are, you are struggling with finding your own identity, which is potentially bad for mental health. Maybe Shikimori should let you date him too- MONOGAMY SUCKS haha okay don't mind me I'm just ranting about this really. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Moving on haha I just can't dude, we can talk about the end of the school festival but who cares about that fortune teller he probably says Kamiya can't get laid with Izumi lmao <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, Shikimori knowing the truth about Kamiya or just anyone having a fancy on his boyfriend is getting her worried. (So Shikimori is getting possessive here? Haha Izumi no~) And I guess Izumi had to do the boyfriend thing by assuring his love for her, yes? And gifts because anniversary's around the corner and birthday and she just got struck with potential love rival problems so yeah Izumi, give it to her. Haha hey I meant a kiss but when is that going to happen? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... I didn't expect this series to get this emotional. But I did anticipate that considering the drop they gave you the previous episode, one would've expected something from this, but man, I rather see them fight over it than see one admit defeat. Not that it's not enough drama but the latter makes me sad too so... all is fair in love and war, eh? <em>That's not true at all</em> haha cya guys next week while I try to get over Kamiya's loss lol I feel bad for her okay can I be the replacement lover if you don't mind though? lol</div><div>[TL:DR; Yeah considering both of the girls got into luck with unlucky Izumi really makes you wonder <strike>why Kamiya was basically a year late</strike> why I haven't gotten laid yet <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfhysS5UDx661E3gOhDjUhiebtqocBFSl13Ja2eGaHEpWiUYlYXbb_to8DjQfDTpL_kfzSqjHWuGVQqZw45LA6VPyz-IojiqkBOeYWnKu61f8zsMCSyU_1JdIgqX49XqRvxtJaKT-KrsO7wmgn398_sj5WbzVYF5p-Sis14D4zshm1RFpArduBELV1/s320/shikimorisan08_love.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Kamiya vs Shikimori in a nutshell</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgI_gi4XNO3a097QC6LlAym3mJcVmbsDWmR85tkSX0zwHn_J6PuPIxnhKBXo26kJafVvPep8WJDx6R_lGQaMCA7oSiIS38kTPGCjR6BletktIH_4bjMATSY7J7B8SW7kyI4AgP_9fOPU7D9EHwxDpQGjJqeBMsfmK0cmatNEiAtkLAoLwwmuikHaSkk/s320/shikimorisan08_kamiya6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Okay I'm into ponytails but I much prefer your hair let down tbh</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibDc4uEdT50rdGLGX2LZvcRpSe78HXhY2B0IGl0SmRNjgtIY3G0tli6_dRyr7xBOat9A-mYr07EVtsSuttGOSQ9jWxUbM2vAsJwg8YZ60v5DLw-YVd7-uMJrAOjtv2akCF54IJd8P7gcjdMwjVB6TQxgeRdF20ZoQqgX649xR-fX0Ios5Fi3zffif6/s320/shikimorisan08_tale5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>SOMEONE TELL ME DEEP INSIDE KAMIYA SHE WANTS VENGEANCE lol okay me</table></div></div>P.S.

Well, maybe we should get rid of the easy one as <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%AF%E3%81%8A%E6%89%8B%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%92-ep/1621237657?l=en" target=_blank>Suzuki Airi's new single</a></b> is already in Klassic Note Review due to (1) it being a single-track release so her major debut is just her ripping my money off lol and (2) it's written by Ikimonogakari's Mizuno so unless I bitch about the bridge I have no reason to reject... so let's ignore that and talk about <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%83%AA%E6%84%9F-special-edition/1624888009?l=en" target=_blank>Hakoniwalily's new single</a></b>! Yep, if you thought nasuo's single from last week was bad, may I introduce you to this release where we have an Anime Edition (not even Regular so I'm glad I won't be doing reviews of this) and member editions of the two girls Hanon and Kotoha so three total, each with TOTALLY DIFFERENT B-SIDES- Just kill me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I did listen to them all though as they are all in music streaming too so I don't know how they make money lol, and I did end up with specifically <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/love-in-bloom/1624888009?i=1624888016&amp;l=en" target=_blank>one song from Hanon-chan</a> right here because I liked her cute voice and the song is about her being a cute JK. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, heard about greying the lines between Anime and real life? Yeah, this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, just that song because <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1531800961634557952?s=20&amp;t=MRzRrkWZ2vw6Lg2qcou-YA" target=_blank>I really don't care about being Masaki-san</a> lmao<br><br> On music news on Twitter it's not a lot this week apparently, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/HZshizuku/status/1530521248056283136?s=20&amp;t=ZpRZIdKiCePldZbLgpnUwg" target=_blank>Polkadot Stingray announced an album due August</a></b> which will include that song they wrote for Hanazawa Kana which I did NOT give lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1531621204292866048?s=20&amp;t=ZpRZIdKiCePldZbLgpnUwg" target=_blank>miwa wrote a collaboration song</a></b> with I'm not interested in what it is since the song isn't that good either haha, ironically <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1532030461584736258?s=20&amp;t=ZpRZIdKiCePldZbLgpnUwg" target=_blank>Aimer's new song</a></b> is a meh and it didn't get me so I will skip it I guess, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_Floor_/status/1532285913208094721?s=20&amp;t=ZpRZIdKiCePldZbLgpnUwg" target=_blank>The Floor announced a new mini-album</a></b> due end of the month which is super fast considering we just knew of the new song last month, Anison world's newbie veteran <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1532708993222660096?s=20&amp;t=ZpRZIdKiCePldZbLgpnUwg" target=_blank>Suzuki Masayuki appeared on THE FIRST TAKE again</a></b> of course singing the new Anime theme song he was credited with, the <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1532376506378252290?s=20&amp;t=ZpRZIdKiCePldZbLgpnUwg" target=_blank>new SPECIAL OTHERS YouTube live video</a></b> is one of the few I've not given yet, and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/VictorMusic/status/1533055977519468547?s=20&amp;t=ZpRZIdKiCePldZbLgpnUwg" target=_blank>SPECIAL OTHERS announced a slew of YouTube premiers</a></b> leading up to their new album next week which includes the music video of the topic song on release date and more importantly, streaming the live from 2013 in which specifically has sold live DVD and CD WHICH I bought back then just because I love them so much and will never buy any of their studio albums with Klassic Note criteria. So yeah, so many feels I can't even<br><br>So for next week in Klassic Note, we have the conclusion to all the Anime theme songs for this season so that's good I'm done with you guys FantasticYouth stop sounding so good already lmao, including <b>TrySail's new single</b> in which if the B-side is good that'll make this a real good single, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/giri-giri-feat-%E3%81%99%E3%81%85-ep/1623739857?l=en" target=_blank>Suzuki Masayuki's new single</a></b> in which I might as well add to the cart already it's the same thing as Suzuki Airi they knew to squeeze me out of my wallet lol, and of course <b>SPECIAL OTHER's new album</b> since two years ago and I can only look forward to this every single day since they announced it. Really, we need to get this album out of the way so others have a chance of getting into the list even though they are just an instrumental band. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br><br><br><br>Yeah, this weekend did feel like a fever dream. I was having headaches without a fever for some reason, confirmed negative but maybe I'll just do again tomorrow so I can NOT spend this weekend in a hotel room or locked up somewhere against my will lol quarantine problems, and... I haven't hit my fitness quota yet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, I think I can refer to that Army thing as "fitness quota" with 10 bring my goal and I cancelled the first one on earlier Thursday. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Maybe I should cancel for upcoming Tuesday too I gotta watch that evening SPECIAL OTHERS YouTube live premiere dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Cya guys then, and until next time I can only tell you to hydrate yourself and prevent yourself from getting into whatever fever I'm into which is making me think I have contracted a virus. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Bye haha<br></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
