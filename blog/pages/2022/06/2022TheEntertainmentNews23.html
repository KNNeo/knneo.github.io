  Also, if you don't see this posted on a Sunday, good chances I didn't watch
  the newest shows on Sunday and didn't post this on time. Or maybe I'll just do
  it and it's half full and I'll just watch the others another time? We shall
  see, I can just live on with Panadol anyways unless it's... that... virus lol
  I checked and I don't think so hahahaha...

  Oh come on Himuro, Yukimura didn't eye on his students. They don't align with
  the list of factors of beauty for him to be cheating on you. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this
  new episode (#RikeKoiS210) where we still ignore the stuff that is Kanade-chan
  and Yukimura's conflict or tensions or whatever, we talk about Haru-chan, that
  girl who got taught by Yukimura as a part-time tutor. Problem of course is not
  he didn't tell the girlfriend he was tutoring a gyaru of all people lol, but
  more that he's doing it for a respected professor ie. Haru's father, but of
  course unlike the father, did not associate the daughter's image to her
  learning abilities, and especially after teaching the damn girl he had a
  conversation with the father, in which Yukimura "kindly" reminded the father
  about a couple of experiments which talk about discrimination and
  encouragement to be done right in people's childhood. And that is primarily
  true, for honestly speaking, teaching parents to encourage their children is
  sadly, not in their curriculum. So no surprises there, that the father rather
  just sh*t on the kid and not do more research as a professor himself to know
  that, apart from the fashionable image change which takes a lot of effort to
  prove she is not lazy, also does not change one's character for this is very
  aesthetic-based, and Haru-chan here is still an innocent, demotivated JK
  running away from the reality of her father's high expectations. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> What
  DID motivate her and possibly all of us here including them female fans of
  this series haha I have a feeling when you do this stuff you will get more
  females to watch, is cross-dressing Yukimura, I mean, the cosplay experiment
  love thing during Saitama University's school festival! So yeah blah blah
  Yukimura dressed up as a woman is more attractive than the average woman on
  the streets lmao, Torasuke is horny about Ibarada's high school friends
  popular in social media AND Yukimura haha, and I don't know if police Himuro
  or maid outfit Kanade-chan wins. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Let Ibarada also cosplay so we can
  actually compare all of them together. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Haru-chan dropped by the
  festival out of curiosity which I would say is not totally an attribute of
  gyarus by the way, bumped into Himuro and finding out the wonders of being in
  university. Particularly, this one her sensei is attending. Somehow around
  there and Yukimura telling her father off, I think it's more than enough to
  convince Haru herself to work towards better grades and hopefully, coming into
  Saitama if she can. Why not, right? We have maybe less than three years left,
  we can work out something. And it looks like next episode we're getting Himuro
  and Yukimura married? HELL YEAH haha about time lol normally people get
  married by 20 so they are already late. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... wait, no
  Haru-chan cosplay? That lab coat was it?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh welp, I really thought
  of ogling into some JK action and we got nothing. Damn. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, we can
  only get this excited without them aphrodisiacs okay? Haha don't buy anything
  from Sui-chan please don't lol now I really wonder what the ending of this
  season will be about if it's not Yamamoto vs Ibarada lmao yeah I'm still into
  that I want that shit show now haha

  [TL:DR; Shout out again to all parents out there, because TEACH YOUR DAMN KIDS

  "We've got rice, so that's fine" Is it though? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode
  where all is fine as long as we have rice... or Aharen's dog which is on its
  way to the mountains just as we speak here lmao this is not even a joke
  (#AharenSan10), I think I ran out of teardrops just winking at this episode
  until my eyes dried out <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, about the camping trip. The sensei was
  nice enough to drive the kids up to the mountains (not Tobaru, by the way, she
  cannot drive under such circumstances lol yeah literal safety advisory)
  despite her busy schedule because I swear if she doesn't drift up that
  mountain on time before the sun sets I'm afraid Aharen also can't carry her
  luggage up there by the next morning either. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Even then, Aharen did
  NOT bring the ingredients so we can have some sweet BBQ or whatever people
  cook at the mountains or by the river, so Raidou thought of being the wild
  approach (oh yeah this is not even close to wild, we talk about that later
  hehe <span title="*wink*">😉</span> ah my dry eyes) of sourcing for ingredients in the woods, so you
  know, mushrooms which are edible paired with fish... speared by Oshima because
  there is no way Raidou can do it himself despite him bragging as such since
  the other had experience doing this anyways, brought enough stuff together to
  ensure they can have a great dinner. The true camping experience, by the way.
  You will still need supervision on this though don't want to be eating
  poisonous fungi and drop dead we still got lore to talk about. Speaking of
  which, it was late at night, the other two decide to leave our main couple
  alone to watch the stars apparently Raidou legit thought they were lost lol,
  and it somehow got Aharen thinking. Goddamn I don't even want to describe it,
  but thanks to Oshima later in the tent consoling her dear friend about a
  potential confession to the guy she likes ie. Raidou, Aharen really went out
  and had some cup noodles lol but also, she said the thing. Can't really hear
  it not that the gust of wind is making it worse either because also recall she
  can't speak up anyways, we LITERALLY got jebaited into a confession accented
  by the background music I guess, but what was more surprising was that
  (spoiler alert) kiss. Yep, Aharen did it too. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> YOU MADE HER CRY TOO
  RAIDOU HOW DARE YOU- At this point I would like to remind all of us that we
  are not even close to the ending, so if this is the shtick that'll carry us
  till the end I would like to know how much more of these will be happen- Ah,
  Tobaru-sensei fainted for some reason. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Worse case is, of course, that
  Oshima knows. She saw it, unlike the other two who went with them. Yep. Not
  like she can't hold a secret, but why would you bother holding wholesomeness
  as a secret- I, I just can't. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... I can't unsee that, dude.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> It's THAT good. But we did it guys, Episode 10, claps all around.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, really makes you wonder what else is left now, we still got two
  episodes by the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hmm... is this too fast? Is if Raidou can
  comment on this as usual. But hey, what do you know about romance? Dear author
  Mizu Asato just dropped us on this lore faster than falling stars I can't
  even. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> We shall see what happens till the end, yes? Sure got me good
  there though tbh
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Do you even know why, Tobaru-sensei at the outro, was wearing a blood
  red scarf to cover the bottom half of her face? Do you even know? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>]

  I know I can make all the sl*t jokes here but I think again and wonder how far
  we have come to see this phenomenon happen and I'm glad we got to it, really.
  In this new episode of narrator could you please just get out already haha
  (#KaguyaSamaS309), we finally kickstart the school festival of rich, arrogant
  students. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, okay, that was a farce, but speaking of that, we got
  to find out how all this time, Shirogane has already lost. Uh huh, you heard
  that right, and even without this flashback I would argue it's so, that his
  first year in school is filled with people who are arrogant, a student council
  chairperson who didn't really sh*t on him to be honest, and 1x Shinomiya
  Kaguya who saved a girl who fell into the Singapore River when it was 1955. No
  really, go take a look yourself haha anyways, and that's why. But yeah, not
  hard to believe, and yes Kaguya did do that as a diplomatic gesture it was all
  worth it for the dad I guess lmao (again, like, who gives a fuck about that
  piece of shit-), but more importantly, was also the motivation for him to be
  who he is today. I know right, this series baiting you with the slogan
  "whoever confesses loses" but they were already in it so long ago I can't
  even. Hey, this is the action arc, okay? Speaking of action, Kaguya did NOT
  get that action in which was supposed to be a confession to who she likes, but
  I guess it did indirectly happen with - goddamn I wish I don't have to mention
  these guys as an April Fool's Day joke lol - two of the four Ramen Kings
  patronizing the class cosplay café. Besides shitting on Kaguya for not knowing
  how to make coffee considering we have Hayasaka cosplaying as a maid which is
  literally her job doing better than her however you see it lol can't cosplay
  better as a maid than Hayasaka if you are a maid! *taps brain* Haha so Kaguya
  did retort out of spite (not the Aharen-san way where you fail but) by showing
  off her tea preparation skills but also sort of revealing her "love" in
  preparing them as it was also probably intended for Shirogane who just dropped
  in as she was in the thick of teaching these old men a lesson- AND DON'T YOU
  DARE BRING IN THE OTHER TWO GUYS IN haha no really, please don't. *looks at
  eyecatch* I hate you all- Oh hey Shirogane dad. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Apart from Kaguya
  though, we have Ishigami also taking action against his
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> Tsubame,
  if you would recall, after he heard of the wonderful news that the closest
  person beside her crush in school is surprisingly attached (to Osaragi of all
  people lol I'll make this joke as long as I can remember) which means the
  other three nerd fans of her won't strike so Ishigami is definitely in the
  best position to get her out during the festival... alone, together. Yep. And
  thanks to the love triangle of this series lmao I really feel bad for
  Maki-chan shitting on herself while trying not to kill herself over whatever
  friends were making out in her face haha, but I guess Nagisa was right in
  helping the guy out by saying "just ask her out already" would be the move and
  it was considering his position as stated above, but also you have Maki-chan
  to go out with as backup if you fail so I guess... why not right? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  What's the worst that can happen? Oh yeah Ishigami dying in the haunted house,
  right. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... it's kicking off alright, next episode will
  undoubtedly hear Ishigami scream at the top of his voice, the only chances
  Nagisa will scream though is probably if Maki-chan starts making out to her
  guy in front of her lmao, and I will scream if we don't get a proper
  confession out of Shirogane and/or Kaguya. Like really, I will go to Japan and
  burn down television stations lmao please don't sue me haha let's see if I
  have to get prepared for that next week lol
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I don't think I have to emphasize this again, frantic and/or
  embarrassed Shinomiya Kaguya is the best haha yes the power of love part is
  too good I can forgive them slotting the Ramen Kings for this bit lol what]

  Hmm I do not know what to make of this episode. I see this blank of a page I
  don't know what to do with it. Hey, more friends made amirite?? In this new
  episode of the continuation of the Kyoto school trip (#KomiSan21), looks like
  this time around we are focusing on Katou and Sasaki-san over here who are in
  the same team as Komi-san instead of dealing with whatever is with Tadano's
  group lmao. Thanks to Katou-san's planned schedule in way too much detail, the
  girls get to go to... theme park rides I'm not going to do references here I
  swear haha, fed some deer
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senbei" target="_blank">crackers</a> to
  actual deers, and even dressed up in outifts and had
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/takoyaki" target="_blank">takoyaki</a>... It
  was a fun time. But of course, this wouldn't be an episode of "Komi-san" if we
  do not talk about all of their personalities and weakness, so here we go.
  Katou-san might seem serious and is strict with time so much so she can devour
  food down in expense of moving on to other attractions she has planned, but I
  gotta say that is then poor planning even though Komi-san eventually went
  along and pressed on it since everything to her is pretty much first try even
  getting ambushed by a fake crowd of assassins lol, but you know, still fun
  times. Tiring, but still fun. The thing with Sasaki-san is probably the same
  as Katou who wants to be a professional shougi player which is impossible lol,
  but with her is probably even more impossible because apart from the kids in
  her childhood mocking her playing on stuff that probably is overdue in trend,
  but also, she dismissed her own identity on enjoying such a hobby even though
  it doesn't gain much general popularity. Hey, girl, I write this blog post
  every week you think people will mock at me when I do this? Yeah, I delisted
  this from search engines and disabled comments, what of it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah,
  hobbies aren't something to be ashamed about to be honest, and even going
  professional isn't a joke at this time and era to be frank. That really made
  you wonder how Sasaki went so far as to think that Komi-san is in real trouble
  and "saved" her with her real yo-yo skills lmao the actors over there were
  probably really thrown off by this haha, so that works I guess. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> More
  importantly though haha I dismissed this stuff real quick lol it's a comedy
  romance series dude, we gotta talk more romance! <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Katou is into Katai
  so let's assume the girl is a masochist lmao, and we all know who Komi-san
  likes. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah hey, we are this many episodes in we should know by now
  haha. And of course the trip back via train is the highlight of this episode
  because who cares about side characters with personality lmao, is that
  Komi-san gets to lie her head on Tadano's shoulder. Yeah, pretty good, right?
  Haha this is all, huh. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, I think I'm already jebaited into
  a series where "full of personalities" also means that Nakanaka will miss her
  newly-made friend which is a wooden katana lmao, but also means we have to
  deal with their quirks and/or problems when they arise. Well, some of them
  have lesser problems than others so there's that haha I don't know how to
  describe this series though every episode is just overall good

  I'm watching the right Anime, right? This intro... oh Kamiya's here ok ok
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where Kamiya-san is the Cinderella of this series
  question mark? Haha I guess in this episode (#ShikimoriSan08) then we might
  have some fighting going. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Wait, THAT IS IT??? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay we gotta
  start from the top right now. So, about Kamiya. Surprisingly, I think I was
  wrong. Kamiya was NOT into Shikimori- Okay jokes over haha, Kamiya was into
  Izumi, so yes technically she was a love rival. Is she though? Because here's
  the big BUT here, but it was never meant to be. Yep, you got it now; This is
  technically worse than the first part of Cinderella. Actually, this is the
  part of Cinderella where no glass heels were found by the prince, and it's
  over. Yep, I have a feeling I have watched a series about sacrifice of love
  such that the main couple can get together, and I can only feel sadder on
  this. For because even Shikimori-san knows not to exchange the Love Couple
  numbers with Kamiya as much as she was willing to do so, then realized that
  this might also be the best opportunity for the outsider to ruin their
  relationship- What am I even saying haha. Okay, Shikimori definitely did NOT
  think of that, as her conversation with Kamiya tells us that people who like
  Izumi probably just want to be as nice as he is, and in turn, will lose the
  chance as long as the first chance was obtained. No trades or exchanges, by
  the way. And because Shikimori is so stuck up as much as she knows it might
  just have been her fault in triggering this, but I would also say Kamiya has
  come a long time to hide her own image even in front of her class so that's
  kinda on her. I really wonder what will happen if she did try to get Izumi
  from his girl though; We might actually have a season two. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Jokes
  aside, this is kinda sad to be honest, not that I have such an experience
  before unless you count the times I confessed and got rejected are so that I'm
  being nice to their future partners lmao, this wouldn't have been sadder. So
  yeah, Kamiya, find someone who can like you and let you be your true self. As
  cool as you are, you are struggling with finding your own identity, which is
  potentially bad for mental health. Maybe Shikimori should let you date him
  too- MONOGAMY SUCKS haha okay don't mind me I'm just ranting about this
  really. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> Moving on haha I just can't dude, we can talk about
  the end of the school festival but who cares about that fortune teller he
  probably says Kamiya can't get laid with Izumi lmao <span title="*sob*">😢</span>, Shikimori knowing
  the truth about Kamiya or just anyone having a fancy on his boyfriend is
  getting her worried. (So Shikimori is getting possessive here? Haha Izumi no~)
  And I guess Izumi had to do the boyfriend thing by assuring his love for her,
  yes? And gifts because anniversary's around the corner and birthday and she
  just got struck with potential love rival problems so yeah Izumi, give it to
  her. Haha hey I meant a kiss but when is that going to happen? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All
  in all... I didn't expect this series to get this emotional. But I did
  anticipate that considering the drop they gave you the previous episode, one
  would've expected something from this, but man, I rather see them fight over
  it than see one admit defeat. Not that it's not enough drama but the latter
  makes me sad too so... all is fair in love and war, eh?
  <i>That's not true at all</i> haha cya guys next week while I try to get over
  Kamiya's loss lol I feel bad for her okay can I be the replacement lover if
  you don't mind though? lol
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Yeah considering both of the girls got into luck with unlucky Izumi
  really makes you wonder
  <strike>why Kamiya was basically a year late</strike> why I haven't gotten
  laid yet <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>]

  is already in Klassic Note Review due to (1) it being a single-track release
  so her major debut is just her ripping my money off lol and (2) it's written
  by Ikimonogakari's Mizuno so unless I bitch about the bridge I have no reason
  to reject... so let's ignore that and talk about

  you to this release where we have an Anime Edition (not even Regular so I'm
  glad I won't be doing reviews of this) and member editions of the two girls
  Hanon and Kotoha so three total, each with TOTALLY DIFFERENT B-SIDES- Just
  kill me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I did listen to them all though as they are all in music
  streaming too so I don't know how they make money lol, and I did end up with

  leading up to their new album next week which includes the music video of the
  topic song on release date and more importantly, streaming the live from 2013
  in which specifically has sold live DVD and CD WHICH I bought back then just
  because I love them so much and will never buy any of their studio albums with
  Klassic Note criteria. So yeah, so many feels I can't even<br />
  <br />So for next week in Klassic Note, we have the conclusion to all the
  Anime theme songs for this season so that's good I'm done with you guys
  FantasticYouth stop sounding so good already lmao, including
  <b>TrySail's new single</b> in which if the B-side is good that'll make this a
  real good single,

      >Suzuki Masayuki's new single</a
    ></b

  in which I might as well add to the cart already it's the same thing as Suzuki
  Airi they knew to squeeze me out of my wallet lol, and of course
  <b>SPECIAL OTHER's new album</b> since two years ago and I can only look
  forward to this every single day since they announced it. Really, we need to
  get this album out of the way so others have a chance of getting into the list
  even though they are just an instrumental band. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>

  Yeah, this weekend did feel like a fever dream. I was having headaches without
  a fever for some reason, confirmed negative but maybe I'll just do again
  tomorrow so I can NOT spend this weekend in a hotel room or locked up
  somewhere against my will lol quarantine problems, and... I haven't hit my
  fitness quota yet. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, I think I can refer to that Army thing as
  "fitness quota" with 10 bring my goal and I cancelled the first one on earlier
  Thursday. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Maybe I should cancel for upcoming Tuesday too I gotta
  watch that evening SPECIAL OTHERS YouTube live premiere dude. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cya
  guys then, and until next time I can only tell you to hydrate yourself and
  prevent yourself from getting into whatever fever I'm into which is making me
  think I have contracted a virus. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Bye haha<br />
