Okay I'm not watching this in order because RUKA-CHAN!!! Haha I think I'm in
love with her lol so are the thousands of people who pushed her into Twitter
Trending that night the show aired two days ago lol I'm so behind already
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Hey, welcome back. That package... still not here yet. The "August Otaku
  Package"? Sounds like a great name too I'm going to be doing this more often
  anyways considering I just clicked on Kitou Akari's live tour goods online as
  soon as I saw them dammit they selling their CDs again but with special signed
  bromides and they are all SO GOOD!!! Okay, my inner idolism fan is showing.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, I'm not really an Anime fan but when people say you watch Anime
  they think you watch everything haha what idiots

  Now that I think about it: Do we even have air races in Singapore? Haha that
  fly by from the plane is so fake I can't even. Firstly, you think you'll get
  permit to fly through ALL the bridges in Marina Bay and through Gardens By The
  Bay AND the towers?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, in this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER07)
  where if you give our government enough money they will actually allow an air
  race to happen in city central lol, the crew's in Singapore. Yes, the crew
  meaning the super not real crew meant to ruin lives and earn a shitload of
  money from rich oil dudes in this second arc of the season. First things first
  though, it's still very unreal I'm having to talk about my own country in an
  Anime. We've done that many times before, actually for the first time back in
  2014 in "Plastic Memories" in certain scenes (in fictional Japan lol I wish)
  and even in 2011 in "C" (where Singapore literally disappeared haha), but not
  quite a much as this series, to be honest. So, story. Firstly, about the
  actual race, and what is in disguise. From what we have learnt last week after
  Makoto subjected himself into Laurent's scheme again (more on that later), we
  know that Sam and his brother (I'm not bothered to learn of that guy's name
  anyways lol so I'll just refer to the one) were abandoned princes of oil
  tycoons, have then picked up the air race tournament which retired to now, use
  it as a way to promote sports entertainment where every race is rigged and
  those who defy against the current winner ie. the brother, will get
  eliminated. Like really, wheelchair forever type of eliminated. So just
  saying, be careful out there Abbie. Even then, this is how they made the races
  exciting every time, but after the one "rival" "backed out" in the previous
  race due to "accidental injuries" haha (ikr), the races sort of gotten "less
  exciting", as the races could use a new "rival" to spice up- Okay this part
  was all Laurent haha or should I say, Makoto after he spammed the heck out of
  social media on the brother's easy win every time. But still, after hearing
  the backstory... you feel bad now? We can do them some justice now, right,
  Makoto? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, let's do it, Abbie. And that's why they are here to
  teach them a lesson, I suppose. Then, we talk about the plan where we will see
  to win. So, the objective here is obviously, take them down. Winning the race
  might not be that important, but we shall see how that takes a factor once
  Abbie gets over her past lol more on that soon, but yeah, their motive here is
  to try to ramp up excitement for the race, and to suck up to Sam so they can,
  in turn be "controlled" so to be able to take down those guys who have been
  enjoying this too much it's killing people who do charity like that Lewis who
  ended up in a wheelchair. Cynthia is hot, she tries to talk some sense into
  Sam, and... I guess it doesn't work on him, huh. Still, Abbie does have some
  talent with her, they are booming over social media as the only female
  participants in the face (In your face, feminism! And Sam haha), so she wins
  her opponent in qualifying even if Sam does not have the intentions to let
  them through. But now, I guess we shall see what happens in the finals, if all
  their plans go well, or if whoever rigged each other's engines first lol. Hey,
  that's a last resort, people; Remember we are here for money, not taking over
  their empire which may or may not fall after this lol.&nbsp;Lastly, about
  Abbie. Abigail (but Abbie sounds cuter and I know she'll point the middle
  finger on me but) Jones here, has a backstory. Not very obvious yet, but it's
  rather dark. We see she has been noticing the audience on two people, maybe
  people who look like her parents, who also may have been lost some time ago,
  appearing in front of her. Probably a ruse for Sam's side but maybe a
  coincidence, but this is more than enough to affect the pilot. We also saw
  glimpses of her terrible past maybe being hunted by terrorists(?), as a kid
  and even in a period of time where she's one of them too? Wow, I really can't
  piece this together Anime thanks to making this so confusing I have to be
  tempted to find out next episode on Netflix lol. (Hey, guess who else is the
  promoter here haha) So yeah, you get the idea, we'll only know the seriousness
  of this factor on Laurent's plan soon enough, but suffice it to say it's
  rather complicated. Adding in what Laurent mentioned at the end that she did
  all this just so she can die... we may have quite a story to tell after all
  this is over or even before, if it's not just like her thoughts align with
  these guys so she's putting forth her efforts to help deal with bad guys
  around the world lol did I nail that? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We shall see then, who will be
  the winner of this round. My bet is on Laurent's team, but the odds are so low
  here I rather not bet haha cya guys in the finals

  </blockquote>
  Is she kicking him because he likes cats more than her? Haha this Anime is
  great. In this new episode of (#UzakiChan07) whatever this porno is about
  lmao, we... go outdoors. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, it's already not normal for the indoor
  nerd Sakurai, but you know, cats aren't at his place so he gotta go to them.
  So yeah, that's what happened. So firstly, to the cat cafe. Because Sakurai
  wants to. You know, because previously we let him touch a cat and it got him
  high, so now he wants more. Why do we sound like drug dealers lol anyways,
  that's what Uzaki-chan is here for. To teach him to get around cats with his
  scary face and... well, everything about him that is creepy so that the staff
  won't get the wrong idea haha. Still, Sakurai had a good time with a cat on
  his lap until his feet got numb, and... they got kicked out because Uzaki was
  bullying him too much lmao. Then, it's the payback. Well, in money, at the
  pub, it seems, for Uzaki's 20th birthday. As you would have remembered in
  Episode 1, it was only until Uzaki was in university for 2 years later ie. on
  her 3rd year, that she decided to her senpai's indoor life so yeah, on average
  you graduate from Japan high school at 17 and enter college at 18, so that
  makes perfect sense. But instead of worrying about how this happened, Sakurai
  was stuck with the supposed hint of what he has to give her for a birthday. I
  mean, the obvious thing would be "a good time" lmao since she asked for it,
  but I guess he did think too much and thought of buying a present for her or
  something. Which of course, the staff in the cafe found out real quick that
  Uzaki will take anything for a present anyways lol that's actually true right
  there. But, in spite of all this, Uzaki still wants to get drunk, on her 20th
  birthday because who doesn't do that amirite?? *raises hand* Haha anyways,
  (then again I didn't expect to <strike>get laid</strike> hang out with a
  female coursemate more than ever half a year after my 3rd year in college
  so...) (that is not my 20th birthday lol) Uzaki learnt first hand from the
  senpai on how to drink, but you know, as a first time, you gotta learn how to
  (1) enjoy alcohol with good food so Sakurai's wallet is empty by the time they
  get out, (2) drink so much alcohol you just keep drinking even if they left
  the place and she just continues at his place with convenience store beer lol,
  and (3) learn of the consequences as you go and puke in the toilet for the
  20th time this morning hey happy 20th birthday Uzaki. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Again, if that
  is what getting drunk is like, I just hope the only reason I will be drinking
  it someday (yes alcohol virgin right here) is that it'll cure of my current
  ailments, like say, alcohol boosts my immune system so I can stand the cold or
  something lmao. But yeah, other than that reality check, drunk-sounding Oozora
  Naomi is the best haha I wonder if she sounds like this in real life or if she
  ever gets drunk lol. I suppose if you're in Japan you cannot not drink alcohol
  because of the sheer cold weather and alcohol's power to warm up our bodies.
  Next week's summer festival, I suppose, and those two pairs of glasses are
  already prepared to observe what's going to happen on that special day
  normally only reserved for couples if you give a damn haha it's on season too
  so why not

  </blockquote>
  Hey, they say the Anime couples that got accidents touching each other always
  end up together, right? I base that on my decade of Anime watching experience
  haha but like seriously though. Also, what did I tell you? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this
  new but all fake episode (#KanoKari07) where we already know Kuri-san can't
  get himself such a great girlfriend without coming up with the origin story
  just like Kazuya (haha), yeah SPOILER ALERT BUT Ruka-chan's a rental. So yeah,
  touching up her so far... Kazuya I think you have to pay her for her services
  or else she can sue you for sexual harassment. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yes, even the
  recording of confession to not leak your current situation haha. This week's
  quite the progression so let's go straight to it. Firstly, the accidents. I
  mean, Kazuya, if you don't want to get yourself into more trouble then just go
  home, but yeah, he had made Ruka-chan confirm that his relationship with
  Chizuru is more or less, fake. Well, we'll get to how fake that is later, but
  suffice it to say Ruka-chan has something planned. And for anyone who has eyes
  even but even for the blind, should know that the girl wants something. And
  it's not Kuri-san. Talking about him... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, that for later, but
  yeah now we know why she knows Chizuru's a rental. Because obviously, coming
  from someone on the same line of work. And yes, Kuri, we know you have been
  lying since last week. The double date is great though, don't get me wrong,
  but it's just not real. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Moving on, the confrontation (sort of) with
  his buddy. Yeah, they killed him good. Well, Ruka-chan did. The girl was
  aggressive on meeting him as the guy was trying to meet up with his friend to
  you know, monitor them so they won't spill the beans about these two (man,
  this complication haha), ended up in a situation where Kuri got hurt real
  good. Well, he got found out, thanks to Ruka-chan who can't keep her mouth
  shut unlike the other one lol. Hey, that's what happens when you didn't bring
  the rental to see your grandmother. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Kuri is the loser in
  this, Ruka-chan found out she's high in front of Kazuya, and Kazuya... knows
  someone likes him. I guess that's pretty obvious, but not until she has to
  appear in front of his place where his neighbour is listening to their
  conversation, so yeah. it's real drama right now haha. In Ruka's confession to
  Kazuya, she blackmails them for their secret of being together in the face of
  everyone else, in exchange for, you guessed it, Kazuya going out wit her.
  Also, Ruka-chan is right: if Kazuya cares so much for a "rental girlfriend"
  (lol) then he'll care for a real one more. I mean, just ask Mami-chan.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay Ruka-chan if you don't know how much of a perv he is... haha.
  Other than that though, I can see why Ruka-chan is so desperate now (at this
  stage lol) to go out with him. The... ending theme animation kind of gave it
  away but still. (I doubt they can fit this into the actual roll which is why,
  but hey, special ending) The desperation went so far as to maybe not concerned
  about the blackmail too, as the main two discuss on how to deal with her, with
  Kazuya even suggesting so far as to tell his buddy about his secret so to
  settle things out and not have to go out with his buddy's... "girl", if you
  get the idea. But no, she found out, she really wants to go out with him, and
  she got rejected real good. But really, being found out your girlfriend is
  fake and then going out with her? Kuri will be crying for the whole of next
  episode lmao. But yeah, that also broke Ruka though. Man, what to
  do?Seriously,&nbsp;when's the last time we saw some guy make a girl cry? Ah
  yes, it was NakiNeko with Miyo-chan. Kazuya, you jerk. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, as a final
  discussion, since Chizuru can't live with the reputation tarnishing anyways,
  and Kuri's better off not knowing the truth that he's been betrayed by two
  people lol, Kazuya agrees to go on a trial date with her. Free of charge
  anyways haha. Also, Ruka-chan, can you quit your part-time job now? Kazuya
  doesn't want his parents to know he's been spending all his allowance on girls
  haha Chizuru not you too? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The ending animation also revealed a little
  about Ruka-chan's past, seeing how she has been disciplined to not be excited
  over everything as a kid possibly due to a heart condition or maybe asthma (as
  seen by the mother confiscating her portable game console) (mommy why) (ikr
  she would've been a great gamer at this rate lol), to how she literally became
  emotionless even sitting on a roller coaster and of course, as a rental
  girlfriend dating all those old dudes Ruka-chan why are you doing that though.
  I suppose, in search of the one who will make her heart flutter again. I mean,
  physical contact is what you're lacking, Ruka-chan. Just let everyone you date
  touch your boobs. Yes, even Kuri-san. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (You're welcome, Kuri) So next
  episode is Christmas? "As for your Christmas present, would I suffice?" Yes,
  Ruka-chan, you and everything. You want a Christmas sex party? Let's do it
  haha okay cya next week
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Is it just me or is Chizuru's appeal dropping because she's being more
  serious and not cute now or is it because Ruka-chan is here?? Haha I don't
  know]

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  This week was quite the week in Klassic Note, unlike last week which I thought
  was this week lmao. Okay, about new songs.
  <b>vivid undress' new mini-album</b> surprisingly was good for rest of the
  album even though the topic song didn't hit me immediately but that doesn't
  mean I didn't give that either. May have a little more pop elements on it
  because you're major and they don't like Rock bands who stay in that one genre
  forever so they gotta explore a little more I guess.
  <b>FLOWER FLOWER's new single</b>... I guess I'll just give the one I was here
  for anyways. Really, the music video isn't a factor in that decision because
  the song itself is very summer-like. I could use one of those for this year
  since there aren't technically any yet haha
</div>
<div>
  <br />
  On Twitter music news from beyond and now (I, uh, re-arranged the words lol),
  in case you missed
  <b>Suzuki Masayuki's live performance on YouTube</b> channel THE FIRST TAKE
  (you'll get it when you reach there), don't ask me how Kotoyama-sensei (author
  of Dagashi Kashi and now) for
  <b>"Yofukashi no Uta" collaborated with yorushika</b> (yes we talked about the
  album a month ago) for a music video which is somewhat animated since manga,
  <b
    >Ikimonogakari is slowly releasing all their music videos in full on
    YouTube</b
  >
  so yay, <b>nano.RIPE is collaborating with voice actress Itou Kanae</b> for
  their upcoming best album music video (we'll get to their album when we have
  to), and finally <b>GLIM SPANKY is releasing a new album</b> due October.
  Let's hope it's good lol<br />
  <br />
  So for next week, the highly anticipated (not by me)
  <b>the peggies' new single</b> for Anime "KanoKari" is... well if you heard
  the music video, we might be safe for now, so let's see if the rest of the
  single would be good.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</div>
<div>
  Yeah I'm good for the week. Accidentally stumbled upon a manga series which
  released 2 volumes called "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/oshite"
    target="_blank"
    >Oshite</a
  >
  Dame Nara Oshite Miro!" (If You Can't Force It, Just Force It!) and read like
  a couple of chapters of it and I must say I'm enjoying it haha definitely not
  shoujo manga genre because this wouldn't happen lol very similar in
  circumstances to "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/yofukashi" target="_blank"
    >Yofukashi</a
  >
  no Uta" (Song of the Late Night) though from Kotoyama-sensei, I would argue.
  One is a snake and one is a vampire, for starters. I SWEAR if I'm Japanese in
  an alternate life now I would be reading manga all damn day instead of...
  playing stupid mobile games haha no seriously. Which also explains why I read
  that haphazardly and didn't bother to write anything above this paragraph
  haha. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... I'm thinking of
  pre-ordering Natsukawa Shiina's new single PURELY because of special gift
  bromides hehe, but then again I bought a lot for Kito Akari's live tour goods
  so I think I'm good for now lol bye
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Those two singles (and that one magazine) still stuck in Japan somehow.
  Well, I just hope it'll make it by the end of the week so I don't have to do
  it next month not like my work life is any more busier that month but
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Now I see why Japan puts their magazine editions a month later than
  actual because of people like me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
