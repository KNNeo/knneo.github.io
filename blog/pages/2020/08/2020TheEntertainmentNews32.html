Hey, see the fixed thumbnail and post description on Blogger already? Good, 'cos
I was already going mad when I had to fix this up myself thank goodness there is
still some salvation on this. The code, uh, was back when I started learning and
couldn't figure out how to create elements so I was writing raw HTML lol
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Ask me if I left the house today on my nation's birthday. Really, not for my
  mom (because it's a hassle with the mask and all and I've got Anime to watch
  b*tch) (lol), and not even for the planes flying by ahead of me and the rest
  of my family who went out to take photos. Because you know, they like to see
  that stuff and I rather watch animation. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah, such is life, people.
  Still REALLY glad to live at this age me born like 50 years ago will never be
  able to execute on selfish freedom hehe let's start<br />

  Man, how do you think Makoto is going to pull this off? Haha in this new
  episode (#GREATPRETENDER05) and also the conclusion to the first story arc, is
  Anime going to introduce us to drug addictions by showing us how it's done? I
  doubt they have the recipe too including the author but I don't know lol.
  Anyways, story. Firstly, the conclusion. Well, Makoto ended up having to make
  the drug in front of Cassano anyways, this time, not backed up by Laurent, but
  backed up by the FBI and Dickens herself. Well, gotta fake it to make it
  right? And of course, everything went to plan, Laurent and the Cassano family
  got swiped hard on the transaction by the FBI, and they all surrendered.
  Makoto was revealed to help the police, and the guys are in line for a jail
  sentence. That is, until, beware though, the plan took a turn. Firstly, Abbie
  retaliated by grabbing a gun. Then, Laurent defended her on the shooting, so
  they both got shot dead real good. Makoto, again, measuring his lengths for
  emotional confrontation, then decided that whatever the FBI did to harm his...
  friends? Yeah, friends. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It was horrible, and he decided to take
  Dickens hostage to leave the factory. With Salazar, of course, for the sake of
  his son because Makoto. In a wretched attempt to escape, Cassano did the evil
  thing by pressurising one of the cookers in the drug factory and letting the
  place blow up into pieces, probably taking down the local police (remember
  Anderson?) in the process lol. And then comes the fun part: the interrogation.
  Yes, if you have anywhere suspected this already, then good for you because I
  did not. Please, I'm trying not to reveal the mystery. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
  Cassano did get caught, along with Salazar and Makoto who betrayed the lot of
  them lol, and got taken under Dickens. Surprisingly, Cassano did manage to
  bribe the police for his escape of this capture, amounting to a total of 100
  million (USD of course) (from his Swiss account), and Pola Dickens walked away
  being a millionaire- Wait. Not the REAL Pola Dickens though; that bitch is
  like 60. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, I guess I can tell the truth now, considering how far we
  have come. So turns out, even the FBI is fake. Remember we mentioned about how
  Laurent just uses one lie to cover for another? Yes, so the FBI thing is also
  part of his plan. Why? Probably because he knows of Anderson who works for
  Cassano, and that will make this "deal" work too well for them since they may
  not even leave the place alive, thought to cover his own butt by covering up
  Anderson's job, letting him follow the orders of&nbsp; the "FBI" (lol) in
  order to control the outer situation that Cassano may have connections on.
  Checkmate, brother. So yes, the so-called "Pola Dickens" is a fake, going by
  the name of Cynthia (and boy she is HOT haha), and of course, is part of the
  board of... "confidence men" (which I will refer to as con artists from here,
  as in English subs) that Laurent is under. Assuming he is one of the top
  brass, and that he got away from this deal a lot more than what Makoto has
  gotten (though 5 to 10 million is impressive, but 5 to 105 is better haha yes
  even without Makoto jabbing in), so yeah, he has to work under him now. Man,
  is this rollercoaster ride exciting in every turn. I swear I only thought that
  Dickens might be a scam only when Makoto woke up at the beach, and thought
  those must be fake guns and blood. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Guess I'm as dumb as him then
  haha. Then, we talk about redemption. On Makoto's side of course; all the
  others don't give two shits lmao. So, ignoring the awesome heck of lives of
  Laurent's group (apparently comprising of many people around the world, which
  makes them real strong as an organisation), Makoto decided to tidy up his
  screwed up life before joining the ranks of the... screwed up people lmao, but
  yeah, he still has a mother, mind you. So yeah, he told Laurent he'll be back
  after a couple of years. In jail, if you didn't realise as he went to the
  nearest police station... in Japan to surrender for his (local) crimes. Why
  though? I guess it was for a clean slate. Also, for his own redemption, to be
  honest. I don't know. Makoto is such an emotional person in this world of
  scammers, he's so suited to be the main role because all main roles are
  PUSSIES!!! Haha cue the ending animation would you? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, man,
  fantastic series so far, and I think with this we can believe strongly that
  there is no other turns in the future plots, because Laurent's side is always
  going to emerge victorious. I just can't believe how that can work out in this
  arc until we know the FBI is faked lmao. Man, love this series now, and I
  can't wait to see what's up next after Makoto pays for his sins in a couple
  more years onto the next story arc. Yes, happy birthday Singapore, because
  you're next. Haha cya guys next week man if that arc started this week how
  great would that be
  <div>
    <div>
      [Bear in mind that the lot are prepared to give up Salazar if not for
      Makoto wanting him alive because of his kid. Think about it.]

        </div>
      </blockquote>
      When I hear Sakurai say "summer" I would expect Uzaki sweating like heck
      (lol) but I'll settle with a sleeveless shirt hey Mikakoshi set me up with
      this fetish now I'm loving it haha. In this new episode of (#UzakiChan05)
      whatever this summer game is that is not Uzaki Hills (lmao), wow f**k you
      Sakurai that cat just sent you off the building- Yeah he was dreaming.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And yes, can confirm Sakurai's voice is perfect for psycho-ing
      the heck out of Uzaki if necessary. Hey, we got a new guy in town! Man,
      that's quite some content for just a slice-of-life show. But first, let's
      talk about dreams. Well, coincidentally the two are taking a lecture about
      dreams (I assume this is some cr*p course people take about psychology
      haha that's how you can see women in your school), and well, Sakurai dosed
      off I guess. And guess what, Uzaki caught him doing it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, the
      rest of the stuff you can guess what happened, but suffice it to say...
      Uzaki is irritating. Again, alternate title for this series be "Uchi no
      Kanojo ga Uzasugiru!" lol okay she's not his
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kanojo" target="_blank">girlfriend</a>
      yet let's not get too hasty about that hehe. Then, it's new character
      time! It's Sakurai's friend (yes, he has one lol) Sakaki (*gets serious
      Acchi Koacchi flashbacks*) who is a dude (lol) and is his buddy in
      college/university. But yeah, he doesn't know of his relationship with
      Uzaki-chan. Well, not yet anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He'll know soon enough haha.
      But yeah, they all did sit down a bit of a talk, and unlike the two in the
      cafe that want the couple to be purely doing sparks on themselves, Sakaki
      wants to help his buddy get laid. I guess so, right? Or else why the
      obvious boy-girl relationship here the author has to come up with
      something lmao. So yeah, just like Sakurai's parents probably, Sakaki asks
      on their relationship progress so bad they decided to leave. Really man,
      and guess who came in with the interjection haha Ami-chan. So yeah I hope
      you realised it already Sakaki, but stop ruining sh*t for those two they
      need to maintain a pure relationship so we can see through it to the end
      haha Ami-chan "<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0UV0mdJLRw"
        target="_blank"
        >She knows</a
      >" lmao. (sorry gotta make that VELTPUNCH reference) Yeah, we don't need
      ideas too just leave them alone and the magic will happen. Really, gotta
      see it to believe it, those two. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> *raises new glasses* (Man, they
      keep falling off lol, my glasses) (Also, isn't sadist Ayachi actually
      <em>really good</em> hehe I feel bad[?] for
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuki_Kaji" target="_blank"
        >the husband</a
      >
      lmao) Lastly, they are talking about my life goals here, so I guess I
      should talk about it too. No, not about choco-mint; that shit tastes like
      toothpaste. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Best joke of the episode btw) Okay jokes aside
      before Uzaki-chan beats me up, but she is mostly right about that flavour
      anyways, and that of course, toothpaste mint came from mint flavoured
      food. Really, actual toothpaste tastes like... well I've never tasted that
      before I brush my teeth with it I don't eat it <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yes, the main
      point, is to not mock on other people's interests even if it doesn't
      interest you. Sadly this is part and parcel of living with a plethora of
      options now to choose from unlike our ancestors who probably can only read
      books all day if they can even read it or watch the same TV channel, but
      now as we speak I'm doing something that NO ONE will do as an interest
      so... <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Yeah, so Sakurai, hurry up and say sorry so Uzaki doesn't have
      to start a speech about choco-mint's history lmao what is with the
      applause. To make things worse, she got Sakurai to try it. Uzaki is
      basically digging a grave for yourself, because that's not how you protect
      stuff you like, by the way. Oh well, all's well in the days of these two,
      isn't it? Sakurai didn't say he hated it though despite hating it as a
      kid, but hey, I assume he doesn't want to hear another speech so to not
      offend her? Man, people can be so nice sometimes. And also dumb, because I
      think they just did an indirect kiss... well it's just the one stick it's
      not even close lol. Anyways, great episode by the way, I can see the
      complications on the perspectives upon the relationship on the main two,
      so that's going to be fun to... watch haha I'm like Ami-chan now

      Well, it's to save her, right? After all that she's done for us? Besides
      whatever is charged for as rental girlfriend? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Again, Kazuya can
      be a man sometimes; I personally won't jump to save Chizuru though...? Ask
      me again if I would if Ten-chan <em>was</em>&nbsp;mine haha no really. Also,
      Kazuya's dead. We're only at (#KanoKari05) this far by the way we're done
      already? lol of course not he can't die yet. And because everyone learnt
      CPR in school... okay I did but I'll never use it in any emergency besides
      my country is filled with AEDs but I still have to do the air intake I
      guess... anyways, yeah, the two are fine. Kazuya managed to scoop from the
      deaths of the sea to save Chizuru, and
      <strike>in return for the gratefulness she kissed him</strike> seeing
      Kazuya unconscious Chizuru put her life-saving skills to use. That's all.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I guess what both of them are doing are unsafe to some extent
      (not the kissing part though) so they got scolded by the adults (even
      though they are already) (FYI that is jumping off a ship, and man
      overboard when ill) and the guy's friends for some reason (Kibe-san just
      shut up haha) and I would argue it was kind of hard to watch how this
      went, but at least all of them are fine. What's hardest to watch has yet
      to come, because after Kazuya went home and saw so many swimsuit photos of
      his beloved (ex) Mami-chan (haha) I guess he gotta do it immediately? Like
      seriously, besides on the largest load (cum joke) of ecchi scenes
      (screenshots) we've gotten so far, it's probably done also to show
      Kazuya's conflict of liking women at this point, I suppose. Yes, straight
      on perv level haha. It's more crude than just thinking about it (he did
      afterwards but not much as his load lol), but hey, someone placed tissues
      by the side so why not? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Again, a reminder that Kazuya is not your
      usual horny boy he's above that haha. Probably also the reason why he'll
      eventually find another rental girlfriend to forget about this one-
      ANYWAYS!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (But seriously though where is Ruka-chan haha we're
      almost halfway through this series and I want her NOW lol) (ooo next
      episode preview though!!) Then, there's another trip. Yeah, you thought
      summer vacation was over. Cue part 2, starring the grandmothers because
      they have discharged from hospital as heard from last episode, with Kazuya
      still NOT having told her gramps about the breakup, ended up in the same
      room with her because you know, the two elders set them up on it. Hey,
      normally I would be glad about this (I mean, Kazuya did become happy after
      seeing yukata Chizuru YOU SICK FUCK haha) considering it's just
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/futarikiri" target="_blank"
        >futarikiri</a
      >
      situation here, but Kazuya still sort of did the manly thing by behaving
      himself... for as long as his dong can hold on lol. Chizuru's enjoying the
      heck out of this though so whatever haha. Ignoring the real two alone time
      of Chiruzu and Kazuya's grandmother, and the fact that the breakup hasn't
      been mentioned not even remotely close, I guess we'll only get to see that
      next week, for hopefully, we'll get an "ending" to this relationship
      thing... we shall see. And then we go to Ruka-chan haha why does Kazuya
      never learn his lesson you know this shit's not cheap right? But then
      again it's him being a normie so whatever haha I'm not even close to his
      level thank goodness lol.&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div>
      [TL:DR; Chizuru will do anything for money (including CPR) because she
      never has enough of it haha like really if it's me I let Kazuya die and
      kick him out of the room lol]

        There's this <b>Light Palette music video</b> lying around waiting for
        me to review their album from two years ago which is not in digital...
        should I just ditch it? Haha I'm about to for
        <b>VELTPUNCH's new album</b>!!! Like seriously, man. So much hype.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the album. Eh... it wasn't perfect. The whole
        impression like four years ago is still them trying to be more
        mainstream while not losing their own style, and I really need to listen
        more to give more songs, but they did throw us

        for the album before it released so... I think they are pretty
        representative of their style now so be sure to listen to them on
        YouTube. Other than that I think I did give one new song from the list
        which is just reminding me of how I like song titles that are so long I
        need to increase the length limit on my Klassic Note database so I can
        store those values lol you don't need to understand that tbh haha
      </div>
      <br />
      On news concerning music that is on Twitter because where else you go to
      get news now, thanks to NakiNeko theme song artist yorushika's retweet I
      now know
      <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new album is releasing end of September</b>
      which is pretty hype I can't wait to give Mia-san songs again,
      <b>VELTPUNCH liked 3 out of 3 tweets I mentioned about their album</b>
      this week though I'm pretty sure they don't English lol, and
      <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</b> is... I mean, if you like the
      animation and not like the song that much I can understand haha it's not
      that bad though<br />
      <br />So for next week and I think we are picking up momentum because of
      all the announcements over the past month, we're giving
      <b>Anime "Uzaki-chan" ending theme song</b> single because there isn't a
      slated physical release date so I'll give the one first, and
      <b>vivid undress' new mini-album</b> since they went major last year
      December. The latter though... I didn't give the topic song though so
      first impressions aren't great so we shall see for the rest of the release
      then dear guys don't disappoint me. Oh, and
      <b>FLOWER FLOWER's new single</b> if I have the time haha okay I need to
      give yui more credit she has been an undying veteran in Klassic Note
      already despite the image change
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      <br />
      Okay I'm done. It's like that every Sunday where you know you're done
      watching Anime for the week and writing my thoughts all on this post, and
      then you're tired of doing the music part of this post already haha or
      maybe it's because of the fireworks festival in Animal Crossing: New
      Horizons now lol. Cya guys next time then, I'm going to enjoy another
      public holiday tomorrow before going back to work so I can get over the OT
      I burned yesterday haha sadded. Anyways, until next time... I hope the
      next package is arriving soon. Yes, talking about the magazine and
      Inorin's single... and Earphones' single. Yes, I think I talked about
      that, so I ended up giving it. The physical edition has like radio show
      elements though? So I'm giving an exception to that for Klassic Note
      Review I'm not going to review a bunch of girls talking at double speed
      anyways lol and I can't even understand half of it. And with the recent
      shipping... result analysis, I've managed to get the "pre-order bonus"
      bromide even though the single has been released almost a year ago so...
      yay Marinka!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So good, totally worth buying it from a different
      store and actually missing it like, two days after I confirmed the other
      one. Yes, it was that close. Yes, I found out I can review the Earphones
      one when I checked the lyrics and it pointed me to the single and not the
      album. Ok, too much talk that I should've put it above we'll talk more on
      actual review haha bye
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      P.S. I'll just give the one Light Palette album topic song ie. the music
      video and pray I'll get to hear it in the near (or far) future in full
      this is the best song in the list from the album preview anyways lol
