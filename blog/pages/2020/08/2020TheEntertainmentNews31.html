Hey, long weekend!! You come and pass by so quickly, I wish every weekend is a
long weekend haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah, it was a long weekend. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, you think I have much to say
  while I spent every moment of daylight doing everything I can from catching up
  on mobile game storylines (because you can save it until you want to watch it
  so I just watched 4 hours worth of it last night) to watch someone play
  Yazkusa Kiwami 2 which I has watched otherwise at home when working from home
  which would be great? You know how many hours I've burned apart from going to
  see the doctor? Oh yeah, and of course, receiving a package every day for like
  3 days this week. Wow, those were the days.&nbsp; Man, you think I have the
  mood to do this now? lol I'll still do it though but I've not been resting all
  day so now the headache's getting me in...<br />
  <br />I may not be in a mood to watch Anime, but good thing is always, my mood
  will be better after watching it. Beats working tomorrow already, amirite??
  Haha let's start<br /><br />
  <br />
  <br /><br />

  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "Well, what's more important than studying is morals" Well dad look what
      your son became now, that Makoto haha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Oh yeah, still forgot they had to sh*t out a Sakura Magic here, huh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
  I guess we are making it then, lol Laurent with the drug making videos haha
  where you get them from? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode probably prelude to the
  end of this first arc still (#GREATPRETENDER04), Doctor Makoto has to make it.
  Yeah, Cassano be building the factory for him to work on his creation, of
  course. I mean, after asking for like 10 million (USD btw) I suppose you have
  to do it already, huh. Again, even if you are real and make it out and it
  works as expected, you think you going to leave the place alive? It's entering
  the lion's den with the rocks falling at the entrance as you walk in, guys.
  Hey, maybe this Anime will prove me wrong. Firstly, story. Since it takes
  about a week to get it done and for Makoto to die probably, the bodyguard
  Salazar has to keep him company so, you know, he doesn't try to leg it with
  Laurent or even by himself as we have seen him pussy out many times in this
  series so far haha. Not that Makoto will want to attack on Salazar, but as
  someone who has gone through similar stuff as him, seeing him sacrifice for
  his (broken) family is probably not worth it, so since it's a Sunday Makoto
  decides to let him bring his son (who is in social services, mind you) for a
  ride at the theme park even though Salazar is technically at work still,
  protecting this... treasure haha. Anyways, the FBI managed to snag him at the
  (male) toilet lol (Lola how did you get in that place haha) and ask him to be
  the spy in this operation so they can get rid of the lot of them when they are
  doing the exchange. I mean, isn't the exchange practically Makoto himself?
  Well, good luck trying whichever way you go haha. Besides that, Makoto is also
  struggling to see if he can save as many people from this disaster considering
  we know more of his family background to be as, yes the father was a criminal.
  The father used to be with the law as lawyer, but I guess he turned for a
  second and all is lost. Probably also bad breed for the kid too, as Salazar
  with his kid, but you know, we don't ask too much. Good thing though, Salazar
  isn't that far helping Cassano, since his job as a bodyguard is to protect his
  life, so everything else he's into (including making movies) he won't care,
  even if he doesn't get the awards lol. Anyways, Makoto eventually agreed since
  I guess he can't really get away with this now considering Abbie is right in
  saying that he jacked up the price in the first place haha. But, on one
  condition. To spare Salazar. I mean, everyone else could be spared if they
  have a similar story to this guy, but you know, they didn't get assigned to
  protect the ninja haha. So, what will actually happen in the exchange? I don't
  know, I don't even know the camera in the bear just to spy on Makoto on his
  sleep making everything they talk about in the room practically known to thank
  goodness, Salazar himself. I guess he put it to see if he escapes, but
  otherwise... yeah. Since I'm dumb enough to not know the plot twists, my usual
  approach to watch these types of shows is just to not think too much and let
  the show take me on an adventure. We shall see how this plays out; hopefully
  it's as good as the animation level is as of now tbh I'm still impressed by it
  so far<br />

      </div>
    </blockquote>
    Uzaki-chan lol why you even have a special rhythm when you knock on doors
    with the doorbell haha kawaii. In this new episode (#UzakiChan04) we... have
    to bring Sakurai out on holidays? Yeah, I feel you bro, I rather stay at
    home considering it's a good day to do WHATEVER I WANT TO GO AWAY BITCH haha
    okay that's as far as my joke will go. Also, if you have a buddy like Uzaki
    hanging out (get it? her rack? haha) with you on holidays I'll ditch my
    video game playing life haha. No really, girls, try me. Also, don't ask me
    out to play Pakemun GO, okay? I don't like those animals. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, let's
    so play around with these two so we can see more drama again because you
    know, there's at least two people who are happy watching these two flirt
    with each other haha. So yeah. Firstly, the holidays. Normally I would just
    catch up on the video game stuff specifically mobile games now because I
    play three of them and I have no life lol, but yeah, you should've seen me
    catch up to all sorts of stories in that one game I've played for 4 years...
    for 4 hours straight. Yes, I almost slept through it haha. Anyways, Uzaki is
    way more interesting than that, so Sakurai put down your console, and let's
    go out to... catch virtual gorillas? lol must they remind us how ripped
    Sakurai is haha. Also, without protective glasses from the screen, staring
    at those for long hours has taken quite a toll on the guy, so the couple
    decide to go shop for glasses and guess who's there. I mean, I thought the
    dad would appear but you know, he only needs a pair for Ami-chan's in the
    shop! Yay! (Ayachi! Ayachi!! Haha ikr rival material) And... we have the
    mocking session of the week, featuring Sakurai within nothing other than
    without glasses. So yeah, I don't get the "Ayyyy-oh" reference if someone
    could tell me I would appreciate it lol maybe I'll read the manga to see if
    anyone mentioned this. Then, the two took the train home. You know, in a
    super crowded train and Sakurai pushing Uzaki against the train door... you
    know what I mean. Yes, and thus comes in the weekly ecchi stuff of the week.
    Again, I'm not that sick, and then again Sakurai is trying really hard to
    imagine a verdant field so... good job on keeping that up, senpai. But yeah,
    once you've done it (pressed against a rack, that is) you'll know how great
    it feels haha I had my first when I was 11 lmao shut up. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> ANYWAYS,
    Sakurai felt bad about literally dropping her off on the station alone, and
    went to apologise to her on Ami's suggestion, and initiated a hanging out at
    his place because you know, it's raining all damn week and Uzaki's rack is
    going to go mouldy- Okay, I'm sorry, I was referring to her favourite "SUGOI
    DEKAI" shirt haha well it ate the rain up so whatever lmao. So yeah, with so
    many game references to gain a lawsuit, the guys played Meowcraft (lol) all
    day ruining Sakurai's streak of probably finishing up a Yakuza game (lol I
    was watching the Twitch streamer earlier sorry), ate Uzaki-chan's cooking
    which is just curry rice, and... ruined his next day even further by letting
    her drop by again at his place lol. Well, again, if I met someone else (a
    girl preferably) (lol) in college that didn't ask me out just to study... it
    didn't happen so sorry, me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I would say again, story pace a little
    slow, but it's fine, it's kinda slice-of-life anyways, but if dear author
    you want to spice up the jealousy from Uzaki on Sakurai talking to Ami-chan
    as his workplace all damn day please do I'll eat that pot of spicy curry all
    up haha no seriously I want to see it happen

    I guess we have to find out more about these two, so thanks for filling us

    Kazuya) I feel you, on why you'll like Mami-chan so much. (Then again she
    did go out with two guys before so...) Too bad I don't get to live that life

    story we got a lot to go through. Story goes, uh, what happened behind those
    rocks? I don't know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Whatever that is a kiss or something that get
    someone's boner up lol, Mami-chan said in reply that that was in impulse,
    and don't ask him to mention this again. Well, you know, the fanning thign
    where we've seen last week on her ranting to want them to break up, so...
    yeah, you got it though, Mami. As the group keep asking for the two about
    their details especially the girl, things get real awkward considering the
    lies Kazuya keep putting out like seriously, so after fetching a call from
    the granny and remembering that he should end this lie as soon as possible,
    he declared to the group that he was about to break up with her already, so
    to make the awkward stuff justifiable, I guess. The best friend Kibe beat
    him up to tell him to wake up and not ditch the perfect (rental) girlfriend,
    while also reminding Mami-chan that she's been found out lol. Well the
    latter is more important, and suffice it to say we can take it from Chizuru
    in a nutshell, and since all of them don't know the reality that she's
    getting paid to do this, Kazuya's decision to end this (which will probably
    reach the grandmother in a week as she gets discharged from hospital) was a
    wise choice. No really, it's burning a lot of holes in his pocket he can
    penetrate them all day already so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (sorry, I promise, only sex
    joke in this paragraph) However, this is where it gets a little more
    complicated, as we speak. Firstly, Kibe wants to apologise. To the girl, and
    to his friend. The girl first though, and the friend gets to eavesdrop on
    them lol. In Kibe's speech though, he knew Kazuya had the life, but it
    normally doesn't get to what he wants now considering his position, and he
    still cannot believe his buddy got a girlfriend (again), so in summary it's
    more like the "can you give him another chance whatever the reason you guys
    are breaking up are" but we can't do it because it's because of money lol,
    so... Kibe-san eat your tickets up haha he gave two ferry tickets for them
    to make it up with each other. Of course this wouldn't work, and Chizuru is
    kinda off a little and yeah kudos to most guys probably including me for not
    being able to notice what is wrong with someone when they feel unwell, as
    Kazuya just left her alone and you know, think of ways to get back into the
    trap (literally) with Mami-chan (the trap, literally) (haha) who is waiting
    for him at the hotel. It's going to be a long wait though, as Chizuru
    somehow went overboard on the ferry and Kazuya did the manly thing (the
    second in this episode since the declaration of break up to the friends) by
    jumping down to save her. It's no Titanic, but yeah, you bet I won't do that
    for Ten-chan- Ah. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ask me again when I ACTUALLY get her as my
    girlfriend hehe. All in all, I thought I would see Ruka-chan this week but
    guess not even for next week, so let's see how this breakup goes. You know,
    still gotta act their part till the end, isn't it? And beyond, as a
    schoolmate and neighbour, to some extent I KNEW this wasn't going to end
    this easily lmao cya guys next week

    [As a side note if you don't read my post intro and outro, let's see if we
    can slot in those KanoKari special interviews for the Anime on magazine
    "Seiyuu Grand Prix" of this month, if it arrives by next month. No promises
    on doing that yet but I did click on the order button hehe]<br />

      </div>
    </blockquote>
    This week on Klassic Note was kind of short due to work, but also means we
    had some time to listen to more, and I did end up giving the one Klassic
    Note Review the go, so anticipate that soon I guess. Meanwhile,
    <b>yorushika's new album</b> blew my mind for probably being the best last
    month (lol), ending July with a set of great tunes to remember. Maybe it's
    because of the composer changing to more direct styles and melodies over
    time, but since I heard a cover of an old song from them in the new album, I
    also decided to give <b>their debut album</b> a listen and... didn't go as
    well haha I didn't have the mood to give indie stuff now tbh. I mean, after
    hearing whatever is in the new one? Man, you'll know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also, as
    mentioned earlier, I told myself to listen to her one song she made a music
    video in as I think I mentioned before, so now
    <b>Minase Inori's newest single</b> which released about half a year ago
    will be under review as soon as it arrives. Don't know when since Japanese
    shipping is not great now (eg. HMV Japan has prohibited international
    shipping temporarily) so we shall see.<br />
    <br />On news on Twitter and beyond that concerns music because if they are
    not you'll see in the outro lol,
    <b>Amamiya Sora's new music video preview</b> is uh, not exactly what I
    expected so I hope the rest of her album is going to be good when it comes
    out in September (also sorry your upcoming tour is cancelled),
    <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song</b> is out in digital and of course,
    slated for physical release where they release their album officially end
    August, and <b>MOSHIMO's studio live videos</b> must be the best stuff I've
    seen online. No really, they do the hype up thing, create sort of sound
    effects for the audience to cheer along, it almost feels like a real live
    performance. Except it's not. Hey, kudos for them making the effort to make
    it real. Not like I'll appear in Japan to listen to them so this is as
    awkward as it's cool lol<br />
    <br />
    So for next week, finally, FINALLY (haha I know I said this last week but
    hear me out), AFTER FOUR YEARS, we can finally welcome the legend in Klassic
    Note back with <b>VELTPUNCH's new album</b>, and yes, Ive been hearing those
    new music video songs end on end every day, I tell you. Can't wait to see
    what they will give me this time I really am reminiscing this style of
    theirs - emo or not emo&nbsp; 2000s Alternative Rock - really hard here. My
    age may have something to do with it but<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Okay I'm done for the week haha. Going back to catch up on more Yakuza
    Kiwami 2 gameplay because I'm tired of playing games myself and I spend much
    of my free time watching people play- ANIMAL CROSSING FIREWORKS FESTIVAL!!
    Oh yeah, I enjoyed that too just now it was a lot of fun. SCREW YOU NATIONAL
    DAY FIREWORKS!!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Which is why I say I need to catch up on the
    watching, since I spent time playing. New villager incoming too, hope my
    ripped bro likes this new buddy so I can get off his abs lol. Also, if you
    haven't gotten a hint from any of the segments above, yes the next package
    is probably part of the "What Do Otakus Buy From Japan" series (lol)
    (WDOBFJ?? haha I'll think of something else) ("Phase 4"? lmao)&nbsp;and
    mostly because new bromides so why not pre-order a voice actress-based
    magazine so I can show you guys what it looks like. I mean, you can just
    search online for it when it comes out, but it doesn't beat the physical,
    excuse me, beat the special gifts that come with it HAHA HYPE lol cya guys
    next week
  </div>
  <div></div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. I should stop wasting money lmao also reason why I haven't pre-ordered
  "Douki-chan" volume 2 btw it was a hard decision making this change when I saw
  the out of stock notice when I placed the magazine with this one in another
  store where it sold the doujin, but I switched to Minase Inori instead.
  Inorin, this one's for you. No special gifts already though; it's a been half
  a year since release too haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Okay now my home page doesn't work as expected now? (If you've read
  this far) SCREW YOU BLOGGER STOP RUINING SHIT WITH YOUR NEW INTERFACE UPDATE
  haiz I'm changing to WordPress haha
