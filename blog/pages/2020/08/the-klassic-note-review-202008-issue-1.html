  Thank goodness, as I've probably said 6 years ago, that this doesn't cross to
  the next month because I'll... be... talking about Nan-chan's single then NO I
  HAVEN'T PRE-ORDERED YET Klassic Note rule is unless we heard a preview for all
  the songs I'll see if there is any on TrySail's radio for this week later haha<br />

  Welcome back. If you have arrived from the one "August Otaku Package" (aka
  AOP) (it's an idol group's name btw I gave two songs already) from the
  previous post which I didn't put this on so tagging will be fun lol, we talk
  about music now. Surprisingly, everything here is idol stuff. Sorry,
  mainstream. You guys didn't release great singles to put on my shelf haha
</div>

<div>Shall we start then?</div>

Minase Inori - Kokoro Somari [Single]</div>

</div>
<div>
  (Close-ups are great, especially when it's Inorin, I promise you. Very
  deceptive cover too; more on that later)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: Minase Inori-chan, I have done it. On your 8th single. So, about her.
  You might have known of voice actress Minase Inori, for she is famous of her
  roles in Anime, but also, of her powerful singing voice since she started in
  2015, but it was not until 2016 and her 2nd single that I heard of her power
  in songs from record label (now) KING AMUSEMENT CREATIVE, and along with any
  song that was given to her, her powerful voice still shines through the
  horizon, making her one of many power singers in the Anime music industry. Of
  her share of powerful songs and cute songs because she is, she also sings a
  good portion of motivational and emotional songs, and with her single in 2020
  and her second time writing lyrics (her first composition and lyrics were on
  her 3rd album), she shows us how well she can present herself in music in many
  ways than other, even without writing lyrics. Let's see if this can represent
  her as a music artist, or even more.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Kokoro Somari [Coloring Hearts]</div>
<div>
  <div>From first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"With the warmth on (our) overlapping hands, (I'll) give you love anytime</div><div style="text-align: center;">Overflowing thoughts (that I have), (I'll) continue to convey (those thoughts) to you"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>Okay, topic song and my first impression of this single. How can I describe
  this... I've not listened to good emotional songs for a while, and I think the
  whole package in this song makes it so good, I'm agreeing with the many people
  out there who might have been more impressed by the music video (not starring
  her, sadly), but honestly, this melody is as soft as it is of impact. Pair it
  with dear Inorin's lyrics which say about love and being together, it sure
  colours the hearts of her listeners, for it is sure to touch the hearts of
  many. For being an Anime theme song, this might be way too good and different
  from usual theme songs which ask for impact, but this one tells a totally
  different story. A story, even I would be touched singing into the last
  chorus. If you want a song with lyrics of impact, you need not look any
  further.</div></div>
<div>
  Rating: 4 stars (Heart-Touching Above Average)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Bokura wa Ima [We Are Now]</div>
<div>From last chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Every single one (of us) are not alone, every single one (of us) is not determined as (we were) born</div><div style="text-align: center;">Tonight on this place, to the future (we) will create (a) legend that will pass down"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>As the B-side which changed my mind, this is not only just a long melody
    probably the longest she has ever sung, but also it has a different
    background which will explain why it took this long for me to review this.
    Firstly, this was coincidentally or not, used as the theme song for her live
    tour after her 3rd album from last year, and of course, due to unforeseen
    circumstances, all of them had to be cancelled, sadly, but she held an
    online event to celebrate how far they have come, and give a proper
    conclusion to this... tragedy. By singing to be together in the present, the
    lyrics remind us about not being alone, that we can go through this
    together, for the future and beyond, and preserving till the end. If this
    doesn't make you like this song which might have lesser impact in the
    beginning, nothing will. Not even the subpar English used in the end as an
    emblem. Add on the usual Rock style in melody often used on this artist, it
    is enough to make me like the song as long as I have the mood. And you know,
    I happen to have it, which is why we are here now.</div><div>
  <div>Rating: 4 stars (Motivational Average)</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(3) Well Wishing Word</div>
<div>From first verse:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">""(We'll) be together forever" (you) say</div><div style="text-align: center;">(I) won't promise, (I) can't promise; Miracles aren't forever (either)</div><div style="text-align: center;">"(I'll) be sure to meet (you)" (you) say</div><div style="text-align: center;">(It's) my intuition, (acting up) for some reason, so how about (I choose) you instead?"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>
</div>
<div>
  Cute song alert! Cute song alert!! This is my first impression of this song.
  And I tell you, I can use more of these songs because they don't come often.
  So it already wins in style points, literally, because they made Inorin sing a
  cute song. Kawaii style: checked. Then, the lyrics. One would argue all one
  would hear is "bye bye" in its contradictory lyrics which talk about being
  together but not really because of the times to be apart, it's kind of an
  awkward situation in love one would rather not get into, but in a positive
  sense. This is what I felt from it, and it might to you if you understand
  where this is getting from. Ignoring that, the melody is great even with the
  off-beat bridge part of the song which I tend to criticise, but overall it's a
  lovely song. The next time you hear the intro again, tell me if you will make
  an impression of this or not. That's how much it has gotten into me already,
  to be honest.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Lovingly Above Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This particular release was not expected mainly because of lack of
  mood to give one song, but now that I have given it I think this truly
  represents what music artist Minase Inori is today. From emotional, to cute,
  to happy and inspirational... she has everything covered. And with such a
  versatile yet powerful voice, it's hard to not give her a listen. As an Anime
  fan, as a music listener... she presents herself so well in music, you will
  give her any number of chances to impress.

  (Okay, I know it's Radio Version, so hear me out below. The covers though...)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: We have come full circle, girls. Cue to their recent anniversary in
  June, celebrating five years of this unique voice actress group together. They
  had humble beginnings, stemmed out from Anime "Sora ga Seiyuu!", and as newbie
  actresses, took their first step into the music industry. Style-wise, they are
  one of the few who would go for a sensual experience instead of just releasing
  new songs, making them very unique in perspective in the growing industry of
  idols. Personally, I've heard of the three of them - namely from covers left
  to right: Takahashi Rie, Kouno Marika, Nagaku Yuki - since the beginning from
  the Anime, and of course more importantly, from their Limited Edition debut
  single which totally does not define them after their first album in the same
  year, then took over in singing songs in a variety of styles instead of
  following the Anison norm. Calling on their 3rd album here, they continue to
  amaze with music, maybe just words and chatter, but emphasis on what is close
  to the ear: earphones are recommended for best experience. With this one
  representing their music well, I think we can talk about it to our heart's
  content.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) churata churaha</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Jumping into (my) dream world</div><div style="text-align: center;">(I) want you to be in happiness</div><div style="text-align: center;">But somehow staying around and rolling like (a) fool, (I) wonder why?"</div></blockquote><div></div><div><div>
    <div>
      As you can hear from the beginning till the end, besides the obvious
      never-ending vocals, it also presents a very rare style heard even in the
      Anime music industry: smooth jazz. Truly unique though, and coming from
      production of yet another derived band of producers, have I must say, come
      up with a masterpiece ever since I heard of it in 2019. Just purely for
      the melody and music, it's already enough to catch your attention. Of
      course, being Earphones, the focus on their marketing is actually, on the
      words used in their singing, or sometimes, speech. Such as kisses and
      whispers which are ASMR-like, it presents a different experience on a
      whole new level, literally. Overall, there's not a moment to relax on this
      lovely song, it's loads of awesome, and I can't compliment much. If you
      are okay with the occasional lack of singing, this is a wonderful melody,
      to say the least. The lyrics talk to space, as per credit to the Anime
      movie starring the three of them as the theme song.

    <div>Rating: 4 stars (Above Atmosphere Average)</div>
    <div><br /></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (2) Wagamama na Allegory [(The) Selfish Allegory]
</div>
<div>From second chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Walking hastily (along)</div><div style="text-align: center;">(The) scenery (is) going to go away</div><div style="text-align: center;">Slowly (our) bodies move by instinct in (this) parade, connecting while (marching) along"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>
  <div>
    Ah, this of course, was the deal breaker. And surprisingly, listening to this
    from the single I know why I liked the remaster from the album a year later
    already. Firstly, remember the producers of this single? Yes, they wrote
    this too, and interestingly, I did not take interest in it until I heard of
    this... re-produced by the same people, in gospel style. Yes, there is a
    much softer, quirkier version of this melody. Peeling off the shell that is
    the parade theme as can be heard from this release, the album version
    totally changed my mind of this song, and I came in to appreciate the melody
    more as I listened to it more, and is of course, how I ended up giving it.
    But yeah, initial impressions were way different, and I think it is indeed a
    good lesson to many producers out there as to how it'll change the song
    entirely if wrapped in a different package. The lyrics speak to a... play on
    the usual marching theme, and if you didn't find it familiar because it's
    meant as a credit for Christmas, you are not alone. But to be frank? I
    really prefer the album version, but this isn't too bad.
  </div>
  <div>Rating: 4 stars (Album-Better-Than-Single Average)</div>
  <div><br /></div>
</div>
<div>
  Conclusion: It ended up to be a good single, since in Klassic Note we give
  melody, and with production changes, impressions change with time, and I'm
  glad to have given this a second chance with a different mindset. Other than
  that, Earphones is truly a piece of art in the saturated Anime music industry,
  so take some time to hear them out if you can, whenever they are not singing
  Anime theme songs, of course. Production made them so powerful, it challenges
  the way we think about music even as an Anime fan. Even if you are not a
  connoisseur, the first (topic) song should also leave an impression, if it
  hasn't already, for me.

<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE PACKAGE</div>
<div>
  Let's talk about <strike>regrets</strike> <strike>surprises</strike> the
  origin for this package first. Man, storytelling is tough haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So, because I bought both of these with a certain magazine <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, and totally
  missed the wave on a certain store (Gamers, by the way) by I think two days?
  Yeah, those guys were quick. So I ended up with HMV Japan which, even in the
  pandemic period, is prohibiting international shipping from its store which
  usually offers them, but yes, to pad the order, I then thought of giving
  Inorin's single with it to cover for local shipping because it's higher than
  if I bought it two days ago haha sadded
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="1536" data-original-width="2048" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sI7c-wz5Gqg/X0km8tIhyxI/AAAAAAAA94w/QgiyZaLwGSAbFT7HNK6rl2zi2lqszyEogCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h240/IMG_20200828_212632.jpg" width="320" />
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Problem is, that because I didn't think twice like what I did after it shipped
  off, is that I could've just went for <a href="https://kinkurido.jp/shop/g/gKICM-2029/" target="_blank">the official store</a> to get a chance of
  getting a <div class="popup">
<span class="normal">
free bromide gift
</span>
<span class="pop">
<img loading="lazy" border="0" src="https://kinkurido.jp/img/tokuten/KICM-2029_t.jpg" />
</span></div> which... I actually have with Earphones. Yeah,
  that single is one year old, by the way. I thought I would try my luck on
  getting it from their official store, and man, did I have a wide grin when I
  saw two items registered in the forwarding service hehe it's Marinka too so
  even better haha okay Rieri would be good too but it differs on store
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  BUT! I think the only consolation here for not buying it from the original
  store for Inorin's single is that, with every purchase of her CDs you already
  get a trading card in it. Yeah, so that's a relief. So, about her single
  though...
</div>
<div><br /></div>

</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I was surprised to, besides seeing this small freebie hehe, also how
  differently the jacket (booklet) is done for this release. It might be the
  most unique one I've seen so far, using translucent material for the cover
  (and back too btw) and overlapping with white to show the "colouring" of the
  background with of course, yours truly. This truly is a wonderful physical
  release I can tell you despite the lack of bromide and inlet image DAMMIT now
  I really regret this even more now <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>

  For Earphones, eh.. it's a normal package, to be frank. Again, if you don't
  think their style is already unique while of course, trying to fit in with
  that airline Anime they were starred on last year, you have not seen enough of
  life haha. But really, if you saw the making video of this you'll understand
  how hard it is to do a photo shoot with the three of them technically glued

  That's it for tonight *yawn* I need coffee or sleep whichever hits me first

  touch up on the rest of the stuff when I have the time over this weekend if
  I'm not going to be too busy working or just watching after that work part
  settles down and then me having to go to work on Monday super early to act as
