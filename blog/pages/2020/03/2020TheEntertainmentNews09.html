Welcome back. New month, huh. Feels the same as last month lol okay never mind I spent money on that leap day haha<br><br> Seems like I have to come up with something for introductions every week here, but I'm just looking forward to that one Animal Crossing game so I can play that forever and forget about life- Oh we're not there yet? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I guess I should start applying for that time off work on Friday haha it's just going to be a long weekend of me playing that town-building game but I promise I'll still watch Anime. But it's going to be fast game unlike today which kind of took all day because I took my time. You know those GIFs and long image cutouts? Yah you won't see it three weeks from now lol<br><br> I should spend less time writing these haha let's start<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=HatenaIllusion07><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Hatena Illusion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Yumemi's excuses for going to school is the Bible for us to not go to school haha I wish I knew of her when I was a kid lol</div></blockquote>The Master of Master? We call that one the Grand Master, by the way. Oh also? Telling Maeve's kids to return their Artifacts is more than just one lie, you f**king b*tch. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In the new episode after we took a break (#HatenaIllusion07) it really looks like Mariah is here to run the mansion. Even after all she did to the girls at this point? I know, a rotten reputation already, but not like their parents knew about it, I guess. But that might be what is changing. Remember this series is a show about family issues? We will come back to that later. Meanwhile, the guys need to do more training. And as Mariah pointed in which she is not lying (lol I gotta lie detector here now), Hatena doesn't have good control over her Artifact. Well, mainly because it's not trained by her but given to her to protect her by the mother, so Muff-kun not knowing how to listen to the user (besides its basic instinct) is kind of natural. This can be seen when Hatena tries to teach it commands like how I do programming at work lol just that mine works and Muff-kun is an idiot lmao. But still, even if she gets flung into the air, Muff-kun instinctively protects the user, because Maeve made it such that it will do its basic job. Also, Yumemi is not making progress in meditation after learning that she can instinctively make Artifacts just like the mother. So, Ema-san suggested other ways of meditation. I mean, if this is how they compensate us with the lack of a bikini episode... I don't care they are underage haha. Next, we have guests in the house. Introducing Gregory, master of magic, but also technically Grand Master of Mamoru because it was Hatena's father who brought in Makoto as apprentice, is not impressed by his skills as magician mainly because we also know that Mamoru himself isn't that skilled anyways lol. It's like me if I start tuition classes for students and they meet <em>real</em> tutors haha. That one sidekick Dina also literally sh*tted on Makoto by doing the same card trick but with more impression, teaching Makoto a lesson he will never forget. Gregory, however, is giving him another chance to show him his skills before he leaves in a couple of weeks mainly because Maeve has also asked for him to teach the kid, who - obviously having a better reputation than the husband - has convinced the Master to teach this newbie something hopefully. Personally? Makoto may be better learning how to deal with Artifacts than learn magic even if he's not within the family of users, which is what we will talk about next. In an absolute plot twist, Mariah told the kids that they are literally not fit to be within these walls, and are to move out immediately due to the lack of powers to control their Artifacts. Problem is, Jeeves gave the nod. I don't think it's conspiracy considering people that old don't lie anymore (lol), but yeah, seems like the house issue has escalated quite a lot over the past decade since those two parents left for Japan. Also, unless any Artifact made from the members of the family belongs to the family (unstated rule?), why can't Hatena and Yumemi still keep their own Artifacts which their mother literally made for them? Is it just because it's made by the same blood? Why not start with getting back that fat b*tch from last episode lol. Many questions unanswered, but then again the father can't do much, and the mother is stuck somewhere probably not hunting down Artifacts because I think family issues will plague this Anime for the following weeks I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THIS!! Haha cya guys next week I feel like I'm watching your local rich family drama series now<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjl4yY23q7eP1ztMfognuOLWtmNGMLLUzkYUXUNBSVWPJ8HjW4SNKdB5H_yG4rrJjRfJ4NdhT0gQainULwR5sgD1msY2R5afRzMEM5QPIBZIWbtsbkw2mNiEyip38krXnH5BLmXmnW9xqA/s320/hatenaillusion07_gregory2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How I think people look at me when I'm in a job interview</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGfmolw8SVcrx4hInQK4V_2ELuU5qRXEk2wl0QmZGWQZcQHjHYGtXYXVdPRlI25w-xqH6DJF_eqTnyI6ZXJsgyip7IcqPnHjJAETR-4zwmgLBn4iKvtVaIBbYNK6VUZZ_gwbz4DlYRWyE/s320/hatenaillusion07_water.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>WTF is with this water physics?

Haha you can guess whatever you're only thinking of porno anyways. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Oh, in this new episode (#HanakoKun08) where Mitsuba is a guy, we continue on the one story where Minamoto (Kou) decided not to exorcise the one youkai immediately and hear <strike>her</strike> his story, we talk about death. Hey, welcome to Anime "Babylon" OVA, I guess. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, that sh*tshow aside, we talk about Mitsuba, that one... boy who died just recently, apparently. Mitsuba is a male, as mentioned by him, and his dying regret is... vague. In his description to Kou, it's more like he just wants to take pictures. That's it though, you might say, but maybe that is why he hasn't departed yet, as a ghost. Firstly, his story. It was the start of the high school semester. Kou was in the same year and class with Mitsuba. Yeah. Mitsuba Sousuke. The one student no one remembered even if he died in a car accident. Although I would argue Mitsuba's approach in high school as a "cute" introvert is a lot better than before which is nothing that will also in the end make him look like an idiot, this time it just made him a loner. Well, kids be kids, right? Not like anyone liked me in school haha. No really, think about it. People liked you probably because you were interesting. That's it. Curiosity drives social circles as a kid in school. Obligation and respect towards fellow humans that you get in a workplace does not even exist. So if you're average and boring, no one will remember you. Which will justify Mitsuba's death in the first place. Then, we know of his true wish. Which is a problem because that is not enough? Haha, enter evil Hanako, and in this episode we finally learn a lot more about his purpose in being here. Firstly, Hanako and him are different entities which grant wishes to people. Hanako serving the living, and evil Hanako serving the dead. And that's the issue it seems, since as vague as someone's wish is being dead, it got exaggerated real quick with evil Hanako talking down his neck, and we got a live demo of what it looks like to strengthen a youkai with a radio broadcast from Sakura. So yeah, with mention about it the youkai gets stronger, until you know, Hanako comes in for the kill. Secondly, the truth behind Hanako's story. As you may remember, Hanako as Amane being alive, killed someone. That guy turned out to look exactly like him by the name of Tsukasa (not going to use these names again because Hanako and evil Hanako are easier to refer to), but that's as far as we knew what happened. Because remember in the previous episodes we talked about how Hanako died because of this murder. I mean, a murder is when you kill someone. Doesn't say if you're dead because of it OR if you are already dead because of it too, by the way. Then again, that sensei was there - alive or dead - back then so it can be any number of causes. Lastly, their motives of being in existence. Hanako believes in keeping the balance of Seven Wonders in school, and thus enlisted Yashiro to help him control the rumours in school, to some extent. Sadly, it's not as strong as evil Hanako believing that youkai should be as free as they should be, which is being fulfilled of their wishes then and forever?? Hey, that sounds like a terrible idea already. And with Mitsuba, which is why I said evil Hanako may have exaggerated things too much even with this one. Remember, Mitsuba only wanted to have friends and not be isolated out. So one would do, to be honest. <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinyuu target=_blank>BFF</a>, we call it here. If you misinterpreted as "I want to be the next idol and defeat Arashi" I don't care haha. Which is why we come back to the actual question of death. Does death mean what Hanako has mentioned, that it doesn't have continuation? I mean, if it's a joke to how all of them are still around I won't bother thinking about it, but still. The afterlife sounds like fun (lol), but that's where you don't cross the line between having regrets and when or how it ended. So yeah Minamoto, get over it, yes? Oh also, Hanako, can you just remove that seal for Kou? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> He can't even fight at this state haha I know you can save him but. Good chances we will see the next few episodes be confrontation now that the premises are set to whatever is between good and evil which is a question in itself as usual, over Amane's murder of Tsukasa. Oooo this will be interesting. Kinda took a while to get to this part, but I'm looking forward to it. Oh also bring back Yashiro please Mitsuba may be cute but I'm not gay lmao also Yashiro is waaaay cuter hahahaha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5-0inDlsSwRz9j0CqjJOPXk7qKhPf0RH0s0uEOqcFdXfjDuFX_9IknbrOD6FxDHIvaV_BGAsWnlyRjBXrezifuI-RLQKrTt6JrNl0E7xrMqLrM3brX5TzZQY4fXOyjYf_M2MZyaCg4ZU/s320/hanakokun08_minamoto1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you feel sad by looking at this, I mean, I don't, so... haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikAbQIf4iLhPRdY0ymQKAzwApDSLSDJF-UIcUiJsVaBEM_JyqrKN5zhlYSTxiD_ro3IzglCvbhuS9JSXlweO8X6INEhxU1WtMK3dY80jbGh1_ngQnnyYJpwX5eqgb3raEizYTrEieq74M/s320/hanakokun08_threat2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me inside when that food delivery guy is late and makes up excuses lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Japan is indeed a free country haha. In this new episode (#Rikekoi08) where we ONLY show ripped naked men touching each other (ugh), we help find a research topic for Kousuke to do in this lab before he spends the rest of his life playing soccer lol. Well, that's part of whatever will happen next week which is the training camp so let's talk more about this guy first. Firstly, Kousuke and his research project. It's null at this point just like me when I go back to school on my final year of university (lol), so the professor suggested using his interests in coming up with experimental theories, many of which have been discussed in real life, whether if it's video games or soccer. His fuel for these are probably going to dry up real quick imo as I would lol, but hey, someone's trying to keep him back. No seriously, Ibarada, you're lying to yourself. Or not why do you think this jock is here to talk science with you guys? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Next, the original work's author paid a visit to Ikeda Lab. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I mean, am I wrong in describing Yamamoto, Ikeda's former student who graduated from this lab? Prove me wrong with a research paper haha. This is also probably a large setup to whatever is happening in later episodes, so we better get into it as far as this woman will. Yamamoto Arika is already a graduate, and don't ask how she ended up in a science lab for being a manga artist (but then again she isn't doing well so I guess she is science-type), but suffice it to say she came here for inspiration haha. I mean, prove me wrong with a properly done presentation haha Kanade-chan you are me before I reached high school and learnt of project work standards. Besides searching for inspiration and of course, her finding the main couple's research interesting, she is also doing the producer role inside of the show itself by acting as a promoter for their story to the world in an effort to create more research data for their love research on the basis of love. Sadly, we quickly found out that by sharing their research they are also selling out their data so now Yamamoto can write whatever she wants to make this spicy haha we don't even know if she's writing erotic fiction or not lmao. Hey, you guys signed the wrong contact bro lol how is this even worse than that devil contract with the kid in Kuroshitsuji? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Oh, and Ibarada just dropped rank in making things interesting in this show already tbh poor girl. Besides this, we are also hinted in the awesomeness that is next episode by literally referring it to as "the swimsuit episode you get once a season" Hey you breaking the fourth wall there? lol please someone stop that woman she is literally replacing Kanade AND Ibarada even just this episode haha dear author you've made a wrong choice in introducing yourself into the series<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0h28iJ2SnJK1MPjMbKeKeSFf3IZ-le8J8Pf-pdmzFqKPJ0o3ftLj0UBJIlHbw7Xmdb45YJPWf-_n2OXqnjWsQTaMLSWGLfhuw-yRJPp08gUutLcle833ee6EcBZxeSkoi-JiL_vndJvU/s320/rikekoi08_couple1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When she realises he has a big d**k and he realises she has a beautiful va-</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizJL38VDjIBYB8t7McCMm3s3ei_fikVMjgzcNJjCUSCfUJ5doy7fQIA34L087nYrPC77O54oT6nBQX0EdxSK_XH9Q1jLgoxz6r2XIsQo4rl489k1FepKrMPbPfpl2skodhFHfLsnszAa0/s320/rikekoi08_gaming.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>#FamilyGoals because somday I'm going to buy two more controllers for that Nintendo Switch at home</table></div></div>P.S.

No one. Not even Kuro-san. Saw that plot twist from a mile away, I tell you. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri08) where we fill in the blanks of this supposed accident of a powerful youkai, because obviously it's not, since there might be another person involved which will turn the future around at where it is now, regarding Steel Lady Nanase's elimination. Sadly to say though, guys? We still have this episode to go before the real action starts, so let's clarify on everything we know of now. Last week we talked about <u>Sakuranogawa</u> Rikka, Kuro's cousin who was hospitalised and supposedly died recently. Obviously all of these is not true, and in the discussion of Saki and Kuro in the lift, she found out that Rikka-san might just be alive. That she is not hospitalised the last time she saw her, that she is from the Sakuranogawa family. Which also means, if you need a hint, that she participated in the experiments from the family for generations of having a wonderful last supper of kudan and mermaid meat, and of course, as a survivor, possesses the same foretelling powers as Kuro-san. So yes, we have an antagonist, guys. It's not Nanase, it's not the Internet or just that wiki page, but whoever runs it, and surprise surprise, it's the cousin. Which will explain why she has left out of contact from Kuro and Kotoko even though as she left the hospital one day with Kuro and stayed in Kotoko's mansion for a year, chose to live on her own just because she picked up a skill in painting during her hospitalisation which is also in itself a joke for experimentation by the doctors about her miraculous survival just like Kuro. Hey, bringing back any memories yet of Kuro's story? It seems like someone here took a different path. Sadly, that path is not righteous in any way. So hey, I guess Rikka is the dark side now. We do not need to know, just like Kotoko said, and we do not even need to find her out. She can't be killed anyways, mind you. We don't even need to know what her intentions were for doing this even though Kotoko probably described it well as she wanted to test the limits of her powers, considering Rikka-san doing such a strong build up within months. So, not that we know how to take her down because the four solutions suggested by Kotoko have not been revealed yet, but you get the idea of how this goes now even from last week. All it takes is for someone to get attacked and the forums will continue to grow along with the youkai, which will make this only worse as the only youkai in existence (as far as this series goes) which can kill. Such a youkai of this scale does not exist, so we know it's made up. Rikka-san went through all the lengths to make one herself (including registering a website domain I suppose, lol) (man, this girl can IT haha) (lol I mean, how hard is it though), and indirectly she is going to see the world burn due to her course of action. The thing is, it's killing people. Like Tereda-san, and he was such a nice guy too. But hey, not like that b*tch gives a damn haha, so we have to fight her. Good thing is firstly, she cannot fight back. Not Nanase, I meant the admin of the forums. Because if she did as Kotoko is in the forums weaving the new truth, people will suspect the admin is covering for something, just like how some governments may be covering up stuff so we don't suspect there's a new virus spreading. *looks at China* So, she can only watch. Next, is her abilities. Remember I said she possesses the same powers as Kuro-san, who is as of right now, fighting Nanase for as long as he can? Yeah, this part though, we don't know what she might be doing, but even so, I suppose Kotoko-chan has something planned such that even if Rikka grabs the determinate future ahead of her, she will run out of choices and not be able to choose stuff that will continue her cause. And that's a good thing, which brings us to our last point. So now, how to do the weaving. This much we don't know, which is why next week we shall see how it goes. Kotoko described it as being in a freely decisive committee meeting where anything goes, and our God of Wisdom is going to change all the tides here with just one hand. How can she do that though? I hope she has enough backup plans to do this though. In early stages Rikka-san can still die often enough to grab futures that are beneficial to her intentions. We have up till Plan D, and I hope we are using them all, so next episode is going to be exciting, to say the least. What, you want to watch the fighting? Come on, didn't we see huge rack fight the undertaker weeks ago? This is not WWE though haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAYgBNvfbq52W-9krbd-gSa_lHI_4rZiA5EVkk3VJ4yMaMldCh-U8HrORkFpOBHhTVY16ac4wd9Ttx1mnz46QUrETb4FMVZ1ON1d2M3oWJSphmXBbK_TjAx3XZM0BirygJbIc05lQX010/s320/kyokousuiri08_kotoko2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW that Grab driver says she doesn't know where to go lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKemZ3z5e0_oO0H-_qLYaS-yiQfmczBuXfyWMaqrl6t1pczz7nlWgG1xdgSh2WZKiYojnsvPzVjloFCnrWnxXuOZpUQulnG7d5Rr4MWAwGF-A3ljcF-JiGim21Mjvaj39X1yeYE_B_Tz0/s320/kyokousuiri08_kill.gif style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>DM me on Twitter if I have freaked the shit out of you on this one haha</table></div></div>P.S.

Thought I say that, for <b>Kitou Akari's 2nd single</b> I didn't even give the Anime ending song for the same show, so that falls well behind. On the other hand, I am giving the 2 other songs in the single though because I'm a nerd and am obsessed on the girl that is Akarin go read my review of her 1st photobook haha. On listening to <b>COUNTDOWN JAPAN</b> from over the new year's from last year, I picked up a couple of songs which I deemed would be a good listen. <b>anewhite</b> as in indie band did fascinate me with their performance so I'm giving one song from them, but surprisingly they disappeared in social media presence soon after the broadcast of this ended. Did something happen or...? Man, I thought I got a good catch this time around reminded me of 2012 tbh. <b>Base Ball Bear</b> threw me an oldie of theirs when I was enjoying Aqua Timez back then in 2008 lol, and I gave another song from <b>Friends</b>Â (yes, it's a band name) because I like songs of that style and sung by just the female vocalist. Stringent requirements, but I'll give them once in a while. I reviewed the very single last year btw and rejected it, just so you know. I did decide to give other indie bands but that'll be for next week, if I can remember them.<br><br> Next week brings us <b>SID's new single</b> since their album last year, and it isn't bad, so I'm expecting more from the release. <b>ClariS new single</b> is also due next week so let's hope there's something good lol, and we finally hit another release bomb from <b>KANA-BOON's new single and best album</b>. That... I mean, I'm still not over the fact that their bassist just gave up did you even see their band composition in COUNTDOWN JAPAN footage they had to replace a bassist! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> I don't even want to know what happened and hopefully with the best album it'll give them a clean slate to continue as a three-piece. Fingers crossed, I'm losing momentum from them already.<br><br> On news concerning music from Twitter and beyond if necessary, <b>Scenarioart revealed their new album details releasing in April</b> which I'm quite hyped for to be honest, <b>Earphones is releasing a new album</b> since their single from last year so I might just give a listen I guess, and... is there really nothing else to give for the rest of the month? We just started March man we can't only have one week with songs (no joke, I saw the Excel sheet) this will make me bored all month! Hmm, time to come up with something I guess.<br><br><br><br><br> I think I'm done for the week. Hey, the leap year weekend has been great to me. New game events for the three games I'm actively playing (in new event order that is ) and getting new stuff from all of them?? My luck is going to be trash next week haha I better be careful when walking above a drain cover. I'm just now only organising my stuff and seriously asking myself what part of my digital life I can remove because I technically don't have enough storage already and I REFUSE (if you can't do self control this is a good method) to buy more storage just because I don't have storage. That's not how it works, and I strive to make things work for myself. I should remove all those gravure videos for porno haha we are less than three weeks left to Animal Crossing please let me survive until then hehe<br><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
