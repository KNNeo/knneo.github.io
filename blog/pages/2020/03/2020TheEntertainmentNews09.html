Welcome back. New month, huh. Feels the same as last month lolokay never mind I spent money on that leap day haha<br /><br />Seems like I have to come up with something for introductions every week here,but I'm just looking forward to that one Animal Crossing game so I can play thatforever and forget about life- Oh we're not there yet? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I guess I shouldstart applying for that time off work on Friday haha it's just going to be along weekend of me playing that town-building game but I promise I'll stillwatch Anime. But it's going to be fast game unlike today which kind of took allday because I took my time. You know those GIFs and long image cutouts? Yah youwon't see it three weeks from now lol<br /><br />I should spend less time writing these haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Yumemi's excuses for going to school is the Bible for us to not go to school    haha I wish I knew of her when I was a kid lol  </div></blockquote>The Master of Master? We call that one the Grand Master, by the way. Oh also?Telling Maeve's kids to return their Artifacts is more than just one lie, youf**king b*tch. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In the new episode after we took a break(#HatenaIllusion07) it really looks like Mariah is here to run the mansion. Evenafter all she did to the girls at this point? I know, a rotten reputationalready, but not like their parents knew about it, I guess. But that might bewhat is changing. Remember this series is a show about family issues? We willcome back to that later. Meanwhile, the guys need to do more training. And asMariah pointed in which she is not lying (lol I gotta lie detector here now),Hatena doesn't have good control over her Artifact. Well, mainly because it'snot trained by her but given to her to protect her by the mother, so Muff-kunnot knowing how to listen to the user (besides its basic instinct) is kind ofnatural. This can be seen when Hatena tries to teach it commands like how I doprogramming at work lol just that mine works and Muff-kun is an idiot lmao. Butstill, even if she gets flung into the air, Muff-kun instinctively protects theuser, because Maeve made it such that it will do its basic job. Also, Yumemi isnot making progress in meditation after learning that she can instinctively makeArtifacts just like the mother. So, Ema-san suggested other ways of meditation.I mean, if this is how they compensate us with the lack of a bikini episode... Idon't care they are underage haha. Next, we have guests in the house.Introducing Gregory, master of magic, but also technically Grand Master ofMamoru because it was Hatena's father who brought in Makoto as apprentice, isnot impressed by his skills as magician mainly because we also know that Mamoruhimself isn't that skilled anyways lol. It's like me if I start tuition classesfor students and they meet <i>real</i> tutors haha. That one sidekick Dina alsoliterally sh*tted on Makoto by doing the same card trick but with moreimpression, teaching Makoto a lesson he will never forget. Gregory, however, isgiving him another chance to show him his skills before he leaves in a couple ofweeks mainly because Maeve has also asked for him to teach the kid, who -obviously having a better reputation than the husband - has convinced the Masterto teach this newbie something hopefully. Personally? Makoto may be betterlearning how to deal with Artifacts than learn magic even if he's not within thefamily of users, which is what we will talk about next. In an absolute plottwist, Mariah told the kids that they are literally not fit to be within thesewalls, and are to move out immediately due to the lack of powers to controltheir Artifacts. Problem is, Jeeves gave the nod. I don't think it's conspiracyconsidering people that old don't lie anymore (lol), but yeah, seems like thehouse issue has escalated quite a lot over the past decade since those twoparents left for Japan. Also, unless any Artifact made from the members of thefamily belongs to the family (unstated rule?), why can't Hatena and Yumemi stillkeep their own Artifacts which their mother literally made for them? Is it justbecause it's made by the same blood? Why not start with getting back that fatb*tch from last episode lol. Many questions unanswered, but then again thefather can't do much, and the mother is stuck somewhere probably not huntingdown Artifacts because I think family issues will plague this Anime for thefollowing weeks I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THIS!! Haha cya guys next week I feel likeI'm watching your local rich family drama series now<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nd7OS-ZFWDc/XlsvWZsdDHI/AAAAAAAA5eI/MEx4gHjW0rIgWxrGR0pXnZ_RvADgQW3YQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion07_gregory2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How I think people look at me when I'm in a job interview          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kqw8PKMIZyM/XlsvWkUYsCI/AAAAAAAA5eM/tPgHCd_TiVks3hwVCVt87c1kwVx00UICgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion07_water.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            WTF is with this water physics?

Haha you can guess whatever you're onlythinking of porno anyways. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh, in this new episode (#HanakoKun08) whereMitsuba is a guy, we continue on the one story where Minamoto (Kou) decided notto exorcise the one youkai immediately and hear <strike>her</strike> his story,we talk about death. Hey, welcome to Anime "Babylon" OVA, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Okay, that sh*tshow aside, we talk about Mitsuba, that one... boy who died justrecently, apparently. Mitsuba is a male, as mentioned by him, and his dyingregret is... vague. In his description to Kou, it's more like he just wants totake pictures. That's it though, you might say, but maybe that is why he hasn'tdeparted yet, as a ghost. Firstly, his story. It was the start of the highschool semester. Kou was in the same year and class with Mitsuba. Yeah. MitsubaSousuke. The one student no one remembered even if he died in a car accident.Although I would argue Mitsuba's approach in high school as a "cute" introvertis a lot better than before which is nothing that will also in the end make himlook like an idiot, this time it just made him a loner. Well, kids be kids,right? Not like anyone liked me in school haha. No really, think about it.People liked you probably because you were interesting. That's it. Curiositydrives social circles as a kid in school. Obligation and respect towards fellowhumans that you get in a workplace does not even exist. So if you're average andboring, no one will remember you. Which will justify Mitsuba's death in thefirst place. Then, we know of his true wish. Which is a problem because that isnot enough? Haha, enter evil Hanako, and in this episode we finally learn a lotmore about his purpose in being here. Firstly, Hanako and him are differententities which grant wishes to people. Hanako serving the living, and evilHanako serving the dead. And that's the issue it seems, since as vague assomeone's wish is being dead, it got exaggerated real quick with evil Hanakotalking down his neck, and we got a live demo of what it looks like tostrengthen a youkai with a radio broadcast from Sakura. So yeah, with mentionabout it the youkai gets stronger, until you know, Hanako comes in for the kill.Secondly, the truth behind Hanako's story. As you may remember, Hanako as Amanebeing alive, killed someone. That guy turned out to look exactly like him by thename of Tsukasa (not going to use these names again because Hanako and evilHanako are easier to refer to), but that's as far as we knew what happened.Because remember in the previous episodes we talked about how Hanako diedbecause of this murder. I mean, a murder is when you kill someone. Doesn't sayif you're dead because of it OR if you are already dead because of it too, bythe way. Then again, that sensei was there - alive or dead - back then so it canbe any number of causes. Lastly, their motives of being in existence. Hanakobelieves in keeping the balance of Seven Wonders in school, and thus enlistedYashiro to help him control the rumours in school, to some extent. Sadly, it'snot as strong as evil Hanako believing that youkai should be as free as theyshould be, which is being fulfilled of their wishes then and forever?? Hey, thatsounds like a terrible idea already. And with Mitsuba, which is why I said evilHanako may have exaggerated things too much even with this one. Remember,Mitsuba only wanted to have friends and not be isolated out. So one would do, tobe honest. <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinyuu" target="_blank">BFF</a>,we call it here. If you misinterpreted as "I want to be the next idol and defeatArashi" I don't care haha. Which is why we come back to the actual question ofdeath. Does death mean what Hanako has mentioned, that it doesn't havecontinuation? I mean, if it's a joke to how all of them are still around I won'tbother thinking about it, but still. The afterlife sounds like fun (lol), butthat's where you don't cross the line between having regrets and when or how itended. So yeah Minamoto, get over it, yes? Oh also, Hanako, can you just removethat seal for Kou? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> He can't even fight at this state haha I know youcan save him but. Good chances we will see the next few episodes beconfrontation now that the premises are set to whatever is between good and evilwhich is a question in itself as usual, over Amane's murder of Tsukasa. Oooothis will be interesting. Kinda took a while to get to this part, but I'mlooking forward to it. Oh also bring back Yashiro please Mitsuba may be cute butI'm not gay lmao also Yashiro is waaaay cuter hahahaha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NWr7WcBJyf4/Xls7s8beJ1I/AAAAAAAA5eg/PlQvd1OMTxIpiCwFDoGHcgLZk2k5H9mgwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun08_minamoto1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            If you feel sad by looking at this, I mean, I don't, so... haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7W2b333fUnY/Xls7sstqgmI/AAAAAAAA5ec/9MwUuWTjESk8Yavu18cgbbdduyF4xWLAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun08_threat2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me inside when that food delivery guy is late and makes up excuses            lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Japan is indeed afree country haha. In this new episode (#Rikekoi08) where we ONLY show rippednaked men touching each other (ugh), we help find a research topic for Kousuketo do in this lab before he spends the rest of his life playing soccer lol.Well, that's part of whatever will happen next week which is the training campso let's talk more about this guy first. Firstly, Kousuke and his researchproject. It's null at this point just like me when I go back to school on myfinal year of university (lol), so the professor suggested using his interestsin coming up with experimental theories, many of which have been discussed inreal life, whether if it's video games or soccer. His fuel for these areprobably going to dry up real quick imo as I would lol, but hey, someone'strying to keep him back. No seriously, Ibarada, you're lying to yourself. Or notwhy do you think this jock is here to talk science with you guys? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next,the original work's author paid a visit to Ikeda Lab. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I mean, am Iwrong in describing Yamamoto, Ikeda's former student who graduated from thislab? Prove me wrong with a research paper haha. This is also probably a largesetup to whatever is happening in later episodes, so we better get into it asfar as this woman will. Yamamoto Arika is already a graduate, and don't ask howshe ended up in a science lab for being a manga artist (but then again she isn'tdoing well so I guess she is science-type), but suffice it to say she came herefor inspiration haha. I mean, prove me wrong with a properly done presentationhaha Kanade-chan you are me before I reached high school and learnt of projectwork standards. Besides searching for inspiration and of course, her finding themain couple's research interesting, she is also doing the producer role insideof the show itself by acting as a promoter for their story to the world in aneffort to create more research data for their love research on the basis oflove. Sadly, we quickly found out that by sharing their research they are alsoselling out their data so now Yamamoto can write whatever she wants to make thisspicy haha we don't even know if she's writing erotic fiction or not lmao. Hey,you guys signed the wrong contact bro lol how is this even worse than that devilcontract with the kid in Kuroshitsuji? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh, and Ibarada just droppedrank in making things interesting in this show already tbh poor girl.

No one. Not even Kuro-san. Sawthat plot twist from a mile away, I tell you. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode(#KyokouSuiri08) where we fill in the blanks of this supposed accident of apowerful youkai, because obviously it's not, since there might be another personinvolved which will turn the future around at where it is now, regarding SteelLady Nanase's elimination. Sadly to say though, guys? We still have this episodeto go before the real action starts, so let's clarify on everything we know ofnow. Last week we talked about <u>Sakuranogawa</u> Rikka, Kuro's cousin who washospitalised and supposedly died recently. Obviously all of these is not true,and in the discussion of Saki and Kuro in the lift, she found out that Rikka-sanmight just be alive. That she is not hospitalised the last time she saw her,that she is from the Sakuranogawa family. Which also means, if you need a hint,that she participated in the experiments from the family for generations ofhaving a wonderful last supper of kudan and mermaid meat, and of course, as asurvivor, possesses the same foretelling powers as Kuro-san. So yes, we have anantagonist, guys. It's not Nanase, it's not the Internet or just that wiki page,but whoever runs it, and surprise surprise, it's the cousin. Which will explainwhy she has left out of contact from Kuro and Kotoko even though as she left thehospital one day with Kuro and stayed in Kotoko's mansion for a year, chose tolive on her own just because she picked up a skill in painting during herhospitalisation which is also in itself a joke for experimentation by thedoctors about her miraculous survival just like Kuro. Hey, bringing back anymemories yet of Kuro's story? It seems like someone here took a different path.Sadly, that path is not righteous in any way. So hey, I guess Rikka is the darkside now. We do not need to know, just like Kotoko said, and we do not even needto find her out. She can't be killed anyways, mind you. We don't even need toknow what her intentions were for doing this even though Kotoko probablydescribed it well as she wanted to test the limits of her powers, consideringRikka-san doing such a strong build up within months. So, not that we know howto take her down because the four solutions suggested by Kotoko have not beenrevealed yet, but you get the idea of how this goes now even from last week. Allit takes is for someone to get attacked and the forums will continue to growalong with the youkai, which will make this only worse as the only youkai inexistence (as far as this series goes) which can kill. Such a youkai of thisscale does not exist, so we know it's made up. Rikka-san went through all thelengths to make one herself (including registering a website domain I suppose,lol) (man, this girl can IT haha) (lol I mean, how hard is it though), andindirectly she is going to see the world burn due to her course of action. Thething is, it's killing people. Like Tereda-san, and he was such a nice guy too.But hey, not like that b*tch gives a damn haha, so we have to fight her. Goodthing is firstly, she cannot fight back. Not Nanase, I meant the admin of theforums. Because if she did as Kotoko is in the forums weaving the new truth,people will suspect the admin is covering for something, just like how somegovernments may be covering up stuff so we don't suspect there's a new virusspreading. *looks at China* So, she can only watch. Next, is her abilities.Remember I said she possesses the same powers as Kuro-san, who is as of rightnow, fighting Nanase for as long as he can? Yeah, this part though, we don'tknow what she might be doing, but even so, I suppose Kotoko-chan has somethingplanned such that even if Rikka grabs the determinate future ahead of her, shewill run out of choices and not be able to choose stuff that will continue hercause. And that's a good thing, which brings us to our last point. So now, howto do the weaving. This much we don't know, which is why next week we shall seehow it goes. Kotoko described it as being in a freely decisive committee meetingwhere anything goes, and our God of Wisdom is going to change all the tides herewith just one hand. How can she do that though? I hope she has enough backupplans to do this though. In early stages Rikka-san can still die often enough tograb futures that are beneficial to her intentions. We have up till Plan D, andI hope we are using them all, so next episode is going to be exciting, to saythe least. What, you want to watch the fighting? Come on, didn't we see hugerack fight the undertaker weeks ago? This is not WWE though haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YKwNlijlLYo/Xltnb55NjYI/AAAAAAAA5fY/PMD4c4tYrcwjub5ZJ51zn-4HbSyaQkwmACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri08_kotoko2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW that Grab driver says she doesn't know where to go lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="180"              data-original-width="320"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PocPGAcFmPA/Xltoz-V4xBI/AAAAAAAA5f0/bEm_htpBf04ah8pMtMn7afl87jLlXAkvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri08_kill.gif"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            DM me on Twitter if I have freaked the shit out of you on this one            haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Thought I saythat, for <b>Kitou Akari's 2nd single</b> I didn't even give the Anime endingsong for the same show, so that falls well behind. On the other hand, I amgiving the 2 other songs in the single though because I'm a nerd and am obsessedon the girl that is Akarin go read my review of her 1st photobook haha. Onlistening to <b>COUNTDOWN JAPAN</b> from over the new year's from last year, Ipicked up a couple of songs which I deemed would be a good listen.<b>anewhite</b> as in indie band did fascinate me with their performance so I'mgiving one song from them, but surprisingly they disappeared in social mediapresence soon after the broadcast of this ended. Did something happen or...?Man, I thought I got a good catch this time around reminded me of 2012 tbh.<b>Base Ball Bear</b> threw me an oldie of theirs when I was enjoying Aqua Timezback then in 2008 lol, and I gave another song from <b>Friends</b>&nbsp;(yes,it's a band name) because I like songs of that style and sung by just the femalevocalist. Stringent requirements, but I'll give them once in a while. I reviewedthe very single last year btw and rejected it, just so you know. I did decide togive other indie bands but that'll be for next week, if I can remember them.<br /><br />Next week brings us <b>SID's new single</b> since their album last year, and itisn't bad, so I'm expecting more from the release. <b>ClariS new single</b> isalso due next week so let's hope there's something good lol, and we finally hitanother release bomb from <b>KANA-BOON's new single and best album</b>. That...I mean, I'm still not over the fact that their bassist just gave up did you evensee their band composition in COUNTDOWN JAPAN footage they had to replace abassist! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> I don't even want to know what happened and hopefully with thebest album it'll give them a clean slate to continue as a three-piece. Fingerscrossed, I'm losing momentum from them already.<br /><br />On news concerning music from Twitter and beyond if necessary,<b>Scenarioart revealed their new album details releasing in April</b> which I'mquite hyped for to be honest, <b>Earphones is releasing a new album</b> sincetheir single from last year so I might just give a listen I guess, and... isthere really nothing else to give for the rest of the month? We just startedMarch man we can't only have one week with songs (no joke, I saw the Excelsheet) this will make me bored all month! Hmm, time to come up with something Iguess.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I think I'm done for the week. Hey, the leap year weekend has been great to me.New game events for the three games I'm actively playing (in new event orderthat is ) and getting new stuff from all of them?? My luck is going to be trashnext week haha I better be careful when walking above a drain cover. I'm justnow only organising my stuff and seriously asking myself what part of my digitallife I can remove because I technically don't have enough storage already and IREFUSE (if you can't do self control this is a good method) to buy more storagejust because I don't have storage. That's not how it works, and I strive to makethings work for myself. I should remove all those gravure videos for porno hahawe are less than three weeks left to Animal Crossing please let me survive untilthen hehe<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
