You're in love with Makoto!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey,    we all have that feeling before just ask elementary school Hatena haha  </div></blockquote>Okay, I guess they are using guns now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this somewhat exciting newepisode (#HatenaIllusion11) and then you realise we have one more episode to go,we are shooting kids now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No seriously, what did this show teach usagain? Haha jokes aside, it's the kids' turn to steal an Artifact. But really,it's all going too well. WHERE'S THE TRAP?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, there is one, don'tyou worry. Hey, no one said this show was that simple. Probably learnt thisthrough watching this many episodes and dealing with Mariah-san, but I would sayit's actually good training for this setup lmao. First, let's talk aboutsuccess. The kids got the last of the 3 Artifacts in order to get the motherback. That violin thing. I say that because we know it's nothing like one. Itwasn't hard to get it back though somehow. Even the owner was confused when theyIndiana Jones-d it with a fake. But we know, it'll be safer over there. Why? Cuethe actual issue. Bryan, the guy who hosted all of them and allowed Mamoru toperform in Australia in the first place, is not really in great financialcondition. So let me introduce the mistake I made and though that one lookedlike Mariah-san so now we know she is good, is this season's last (hopefully)antagonist Michelle Li. Remember her? She was the one who told off the otherguys about storming the Hoshisato mansion when they were out. Again, alreadybeing manipulated by them anyways, but still. This time though, she sneaked inreal good. Again, never thought I would see this much gun in this Anime, buthey, without magic most bad guys are still human, so what else can they use,apparitions? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, Michelle confronted the lot while in the bath (lolwhy), and took their Artifacts hostage in exchange of their lives, of course.Because, as innocent as the Artifact they stole would look, it's cleverlydisguised to protect the actual Artifact inside, which is literally just anullifier for Artifacts around itself, so yeah, which makes all their powersuseless. So too bad, the father had no choice but to give in. Well, almost. Asyou thought this would be done, remember that half of them including Gregory whogot brought into this mess, are magicians themselves. So this shouldn't be thattough. The Orb which is the supposed actual treasure was hurled far away(probably one of Michelle's guys caught it already), the bad guys got nothing,Makoto managed to protect innocent Dina who still doesn't know anything, butbarely escaped since Dina was injured. And... not going to troll you or anythingbut I did not have a knack of any sort when writing the opening quote, but yeah,someone was female. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, not Makoto, we already debunked that alreadyHatena found out in the first episode lmao. The vanishing magic from Makotothrew them far away, but they were quickly cornered by Michelle's men, probablylikely because she has some Artifact that can find them easily, I guess. Soyeah, ending this episode with the bad guys attacking the weakest link withinthe good guys while everyone else is in the "mansion" might sound a little bitof a stretch, but I can see where this is going. You think Dina and Makoto aregoing to date? Haha but what about Hatena-chan? And then she squeals? Haha lolwe shall see what happens then. Really, the setup till now thus far; This hasturned out to be more interesting than ever despite the real bad animationdrawings, really.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7S07-gaEs9A/XoAQuLifV3I/AAAAAAAA6Fc/7dbbkeWeU1s04Awu6utO1Aj5NL25Chq-gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion11_food.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Such is the life haha Yumemi MVP every episode lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y7eCuOA7ASc/XoAQuKpY5dI/AAAAAAAA6Fg/DqJ5PiZEjmoZnybm9sD83K7IB-DSw4VBgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion11_makoto.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is as cool as Mamoru will get, I promise you.          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "When we arrived it (luggage) fits everything in, but now it doesn't" Hahatravel problems amirite?? Oh yeah also, stop travelling and stay home, people.Do it for the people, please.<br />P.P.S. "My group has purchased this mansion and everyone in it" Wait, you canjust buy people like that? But these guys just stayed here for a couple of dayslol oh I think she meant the staff<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HanakoKun12">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Maybe different species can't understand each other after all" Haha Yashiro    yeah Hanako is a ghost and you're a fish lmao  </div></blockquote>Wow that puffer fish with the #RealityCheck and that's how you get relationshipissues haha really Hanako it's your fault. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But seriously, Hanako, it'sALL your fault. In this final episode (#HanakoKun12) I think we can be very surethere won't be a season two because this Anime... ended up being disappointing.Ask yourself what was the most exciting episode this series. If you said lastweek's, then ignore my opinions. Otherwise, I'm glad we stayed on the same page.So, how this series ended. Really, this is it? I understand why it has to endlike this, but thinking back from last week with all the Mitsuba stuff, thingsgoing on with Tsukasa and his goals of screwing the school up with apparitions,and Kou... this is literally going nowhere. All we have to remember from theprevious episode is literally leaving Kou alone so they can wrap up this Anime?Really? That's it?? I hope someone remembers what this is all about, by the way.Some might say it's from Episode 1 with Yashiro and the mermaid scales, but Ithink we know little about the murder of Tsukasa by Amane to NOT talked upon inthis whole series in general. That, I think will make this series fail for me,even if there is going to be a sequel. I know the original work hasn't endedyet, but for this kind of ending... sure, I can be satisfied, with them talkingabout the main couple's relationship, but really? This episode made me sad. Assad as Yashiro felt all episode. This aside, let's talk about Yashiro. She wasgoing to be a mermaid, she asked for happiness with a male, Hanako kind of didfulfill it for her, and that was a problem since she's a fish now, but ofcourse, it's because of this Seven Wonder that she's still human, I guess. Isshe though? Like Mitsuba, once you're dead, you're dead, girl. There istechnically no turning back. Okay, back to the plot. A bunch of fishes (yes yes)(lol that sidekick of a fish) introduced themselves to Yashiro, hoping to bringher back but not the violent way as we have seen episodes ago, so to you know,be part of the ocean. And yes, they did tackle all her weak points of wanting toGET LAID haha and not finding much love in the real world until... she realisedthat they were talking about her as a fish lol. Hey, everyone's gotta shit onher as a human with those daikon legs lmao. Jokes aside, this is prettyconvincing of an appeal for her to come to this side of their world, but yeahHanako stopped her at the last moment. Again, we know that this Hanako isn'tthat great at expressing himself, not even at talking about his past, but I'mstill not going to forgive him for treating Yashiro that way all the time. Butyeah, she is kind of a servant/assistant to Hanako I would argue just as howTsukasa has one too (poor Sakura-chan), so yeah, this is kind of cliche if youthink about it. Relationship problems aside, it seems like with the subtle hintsat the end of the episode, it will take a long time before the actualconfrontation happens just like how, say, Anime "Assassination Classroom" had to(spoiler free) do a season two to wrap things up and give us the actualbackstory. But with this series? I'm not holding my breath. (You know, fish?Hold breath? Haha) I was expecting this series, honestly speaking, to be more ofthe action, the drama between the Hanako(s), and how these two forces can end upwith Amane's victory in maintaining balance in the school, but, uh... I guessnot. So yeah, this might be the worst I've watched this season. There, I saidit. See, Hanako? It isn't that hard once you tell. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Haha if they everend this series with another season of Anime we shall see if this ending righthere will be justified, I guess.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TBSsNEnRXYM/XoAdujW6HTI/AAAAAAAA6Fw/QKKVG949AtsSWB4zKFMczWwkYKVJLNE6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun12_harem.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            She can dream about this for years on, this Yashiro haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vaYdxhGNUqk/XoAduwhQiKI/AAAAAAAA6F0/53GmdjvyPLwuS_FOXzU7GH5eKgUrQUgywCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun12_yashiro8.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Early stages of pyramid scheme clients be like<br />            (haha)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. If you enjoyed this series 50% because of Yashiro and the other 50% becauseof the little things the Mokke did (for example combing Yashiro's hair, see ifyou can spot it) it's worth watching haha <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't know man... lol<br />P.P.S. "I got a sudden urge to see you" Hey guys? Here's your next pick-up linehaha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoi12">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;">      Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita.</span    >  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "What happened?" Hey, you think Yukimura can answer that, Yamamoto? You    bitch? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay Yamamoto if you can come up with such plots why ruin their relationship andnot go write a proper manga already, you f**king loser- Hi and welcome to theseason finale of the series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode (#RikeKoi12) I knowwe shouldn't be investigating who did it because we have a victim to attend to,but instead Yukimura... I don't know what he's thinking, man. This guy. Sofirst, the plot. Firstly, they have to find Himuro. But in the process of doingthat, then did they realise someone was behind this. You know, the gift asapology but was shattered on the one fall down the steps. I mean, someone wouldhave known it to be wrong. However, instead of analysing and deducing it therational way, we're doing it the scientific way. Which probably explains howawkward this whole series still is to some extent considering Yukimura'sconfrontation of Yamamoto is literally asking for another scientific paper forher crimes or something lol. Anyways, everyone knows she did it, it's for hermanga or whatever because she's too dumb to think about the plot on her own andwants to implicate others on this (and not knowing how weak Himuro is in person,we'll talk about this later) so yeah, it's her fault. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As some form ofconsolation though, she did not destroy the real gift, but a replica she gotwhen they were out shopping together. So, not so bad after all. Just... Ibaradadid help by shaving some money off her already empty pocket to teach her alesson lol. And then, it's finding Himuro. I know it's time to run since whathappened last episode, but so far away until no one can find you? Yeah, this islikely an Anime filler plot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't ask why I know, I just feel thatfrom years of watching these stuff already haha. Anyways, ignoring origin, shefell again, this time breaking her heels and spraining her ankle, and in themost disabled condition known to humanity (lol), she crawls under the ledge ofthe bridge to cry. Hey, if you need an emotion build-up go ahead and watch theend of the previous episode again. Otherwise, you'll also be able to build youremotions up once the sun rises (How long has she been alone walking? All nighttoo?) and Yukimura finally found her if not for Yamamoto telling him where tosearch or else this might take a couple more days lol. Yukimura calls Himuro(aww) out for her mistakes in her apology report (lol), and Himuro got realdesperate. Hey, did I not mention that she's the weakest in this relationship?This girl needs some love, man. There ain't any time for scientificexplanations. And in some might say the best location and time with the bestmood value, they kissed a passionate kiss. Hey, if it makes them want to kissagain, I'll call that passionate haha. What a way to end the series though, andif not for Yamamoto (haha), this would have gone better. In the author'sdefence, I can't think of a better way to dump a shit load of scientific stuffinto a modern love story (*recalls the episode where they science-typetraditional stories*), but this will be as nerdy as it gets, I promise you. Andfor that, I'm still glad <strike>the author</strike> the Anime production couldsqueeze out such an ending without me feeling that it's not science nerd levelstorytelling anymore. It still is, by the way, till the end. And with this Imust say this is still the most I've enjoyed this season. From the laughs(basically Kanade-chan hehe), to the dumb nerdy stuff maybe, to the love, toHimuro being desperate and Yukimura trying to be clean (you're in it bro justadmit it haha) and everyone else that is ripped... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> you know, it's realgood, man. I mean, I wished I've watched such an Anime but without the science,but this series is not like this. Other than that, I'm going to miss somethingfrom this series, I can feel it. Not going to give you statistics to how much Iwould, its rewatch value, whatever theories and references they made that mademe feel like that... etc. No, I'm not that science-type. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wXlmn8mapoo/XoBHscUmXyI/AAAAAAAA6GQ/xOPwqbRcLustOXNoWoThwVAqRY1vpqNJwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi12_kiss.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is actually perfect so I'm leaving this here now          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HSkxwwR_P44/XoBHtMfD6pI/AAAAAAAA6GU/PQ9DMZk_Jf85kEenL1Bkqh2FVnqqniWVgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi12_kanade2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW the two quarrel because they can't admit they wanna            <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha" target="_blank"              >ichaicha</a            >            lol<br />            (Thanks for 12 episodes of torture I totally enjoyed it haha)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I say "again" because you should have since last week haha. Also, thisshow is a real comeback, and I'm still satisfied from last week. So in this lastepisode (#KyokouSuiri12), we wrap things up. Firstly, Steel Lady Nanase, theyoukai, is no more.<a href="https://jisho.org/search/otsukare" target="_blank">Otsukare-sama</a>,Kuro-san. Sure was hard on him, fighting that monster for hours on end. ButKotoko-chan too, cracking her brains to think and respond appropriately for thebuild-up of the century just to get rid of what might be the biggest threat tohumanity thus far (that we can see) (even with microscopes) (yes I meant thepandemic haha), but they did it. So to conclude this series, I know it's notmuch, but man, do some of the things be reminiscent of what this show is initself. The jokes are back, the romance burns are good, and we can see all iswell. The youkai case though, is as reasonable as you can expect. The site isshut down because Rikka-san obviously lost so might as well save on that domainmoney lol, the Internet is crazing over whether the one actually dead is NanaseKarin (which is, by the way), the police kind of got dragged into this newrumour but still safely concluded that Nanase did indeed die and it wasn't areplacement (I mean, how can you replace that huge rack? Haha), and Saki-sanwants to know the truth. Wait, I thought we were done here? Ah, but Saki-sandoesn't want to be left out of this conflict between the two and Rikka-san, soKuro-san gives a reasonable explanation. Rikka-san, like him, gained immortalityand future prediction by eating the same "last supper" (of kudan and mermaidmeat) and survived. Unlike him, however, who would like to die a normal death ofold age at some point and living life normally, this cousin here wants to returnback to normal as soon as possible. I mean, ignoring those powers and actuallyliving a normal life is easier, but you know, she can't live with that.(That's... an immortality joke right there lol) And to create probably such ayoukai or God which can make her go back to just a human, she will not stop inher own experimentation in using the power of rumour and imagination to makesomething to save herself. However, it really feels like Rikka-san doesn'tregret doing all this since these aren't technically not even criminal (as faras we went until she made a youkai which can kill) since the police can't eventrace this to her in any way. Oh well, which is why they are here to stop thatwench. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Really man, I'll just be Kuro-san if I have obtained suchpowers. Again, it's not like it isn't painful. I mean, if you tried this manytimes it probably is painless, but still. So yeah, this battle can go on foreveruntil Rikka-san gives up, which is never. Nonetheless, Kotoko-chan should beprotected now that she knows this brain crack midget is getting in her way (lol)of making whatever she wants come true now. So, Kuro-san has to protect her,which brings us to this filler of an end with no relation to the youkai: therelationship between them two. I know it's kind of not original content sincethey can write whatever they want, so yeah, I'm enjoying it anyways so whateverhaha. Hey, they be doing it on the bed already so whatever lmao. All in all,really a show that turned itself sunny side up after having a rough start, andI'm glad I got over the boring phase to give this a thumbs up at this point. Ifthey have a sequel can it not be about Rikka-san? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, she isprobably under youkai surveillance 24/7 now we know she's a wanted person in thespriitual world haha YOU BITC- ALRIGHT haha we're done<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pR-1I10EE4Q/XoBSwhs6i-I/AAAAAAAA6Go/qnqq0By3fNkz0AEEzQ58mhI0w58IWOudQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri12_youkai3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            That celebration she deserved, this God of Wisdom aka Iwanaga Kotoko          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ryK3vfSUSUk/XoBSwD3jclI/AAAAAAAA6Gk/zys5gUscbi05WUy-UZKoQvxnpVAOJfx8ACEwYBhgLKs4DAMBZVoBAyxsP9d6zm2mcFunYsf4SVYxc_UrMIBHFmlYmvTGrL0aUZ-k_vyWWMwNnqkCBhPIzavaBp1Sm7AZQUZS_OeFt6-b14Oou3boqgeqZBtVs-fauZQDjXaKjf0kr_XM9T4UxL7PBLoo5FxxGYHBdav7z_FAqDPCm8f1aucLqSd4lVVC_rBq8nNXqicxG7DVWCcCQ485KXDW_3nig_fsKTvoXaVnd6xbcAPI5pA0GiHjghbApSZqRqhWWkOGaSTbbRkVVtK-XiU4C7GnDhBobLxJUOpKdRZL5SFyRRpDSOlR_iixRNhnSyubRv1hbhQqLsqywSvbJOsM0gwaZa51fZu3dKekcucBA2gOZAxG46tJMML_oSf_3SQnXvlSgZsaMwMZdBFPjnYOJ1qbNGInsm--6tFLop6yU5oRdP5qZ5VqzYoVkuePMSRMmLhudfHyIMGPfUe-3emit0j6FXjxPofDDM48m-2Us3aQtp82H6vFF-3h_bIQEhEA0Yxgb121GX8TButjEXHo9m1gme8nC-kdL770WgSaUSxtioKlFkGi2VSFFCg3f_QVAd0cv2-AbPf2RfXfvDgOqRE_Q7c9MkdDe9hYCMRXcsfO1MKKqgfQF/s320/kyokousuiri12_car.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Meanwhile, in the car... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Let's talk about what I saw on firstimpression, shall we?<br /><ul>  <li>    <b>"Kakushigoto"</b> [premiers April 2nd 2020] looks like Anime "Ao-chan"    but when the girl is younger and the father tries NOT to tell her that he's    a hentai manga artist lmao I hope I can get over the age thing because this    kid isn't exactly of age haha  </li>  <li>Yu-Gi-Oh? Digimon?? "What year is this???" lol</li>  <li>    "Arte" sounds like a great 16th century coming-of-age show with female    empowerment since there isn't any at that time and Mikakoshi (Komatsu    Mikako) voices the main girl which is a plus (hehe) but I don't really want    to be reminded of work at this time of age so no thanks haha that voice    though  </li>  <li>    <b>"Yesterday wo Utatte"</b> [premiers April 4th 2020] looks interesting,    with an author who writes emotional stories for a living... I have a feeling    I don't want to cry every week haha. The plot sounds real good though. I'll    give a couple episodes a try, I guess.  </li>  <li>    There's literally an Anime about girls fishing haha this is how far we have    come in Anime production budget considerations by the way  </li>  <li>    Yes, Kaguya-sama meets her love rival Tomita Miyu (lol) in what seems to be    a conclusion to this series? Hey, all I want is to see two people get    together. Is it that hard? We shall see in the 2nd season of    <b>"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?"</b> [premiers April 11th 2020] Haha did I    do the promo right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  </li></ul>TL:DR; If we stick to love stories again this season we will be on the trendhaha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Hmm there is something to listen this week haha.<b>FLOWER FLOWER's new album</b> isn't exactly awesome, but I might need my<strike>YUI</strike> yui fix every once in a while so I'll try to give a couple.Not really in the mood to listen to this over the week mainly because I'm notdoing it too- Okay give me a break, me. But seriously, close this review alreadyhaha I sound like my boss lol<br /><br />About news on Twitter and beyond, <b>Asakura Momo's new song previews</b> forher upcoming album in two weeks is... sure, considering Mocho has so much toexplore in music style anyways. That's idolism for you, baby.<b>Kalafina's member Hikaru announced her solo debut</b> following Wakana underartist title "H-el-ical//" (no joke) which sounds like Kalafina anyways (FYIWakana is now under Victor where Kajiuira-sensei is, and Hikaru is under NBCUniversal which hosts artists like Miyawaki Shion), and<b>cinema staff created a song from scratch in a livestream</b> for about 12hours++ I think stating if they cannot finish the song they won't quit andaccepting donations as an effort to cut their losses from the cancelled upcominglive performances. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Everyone in Japan is having it rough out there, isn'tit? I mean, with the Olympics postponed for a year you would expect Mocho's newalbum to not have live performances. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Well... haha<br /><br />Next week? Hmm... FLOWER FLOWER follow-up probably, and I really need to findtime to listen to Nu-chan's best album again, as I've said week after week. Sohopefully this time, I'll actually do it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is all then. My life now every week is literally wake up, play AnimalCrossing, work, come back for Animal Crossing haha. Mobile games are when Itravel, and DOAXVV is whenever there is an event because I don't even care now.Then again, I think it's the mood affecting me now, from future work stress("anxiety" be my middle name) to whatever delivery- Ok I promise not to talkabout sad things already. It's so bad now I'd rather talk about good things,like Animal Crossing!! Haha cya guys next time then, and until then... hey atleast we have new Anime to look forward to lol what is Klassic Note now<br /><br />P.S. Yay for animating "BLEACH" final arc because we know it's not the sketchydrawings that matter (same production, by the way), but we need new people tovoice the bad guys. Hopefully. If they can get anyone I know to voice some ofthe bad girls I don't mind watching it haha still a long way till airtime thoughI just hope they spend more time making it LOOK better haha GOT THEM<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
