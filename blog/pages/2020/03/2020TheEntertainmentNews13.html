Can you imagine that one online order delivery can affect my mood for the whole
weekend? You can if it doesn't appear after a week and I have to contact them
physically on Saturday through customer service and talking to the delivery guy,
they still didn't get back to you over the weekend.<br />
<br />
<span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span><br />
<br />
Must be the pandemic haha okay let's talk Anime it's any amount of times better
than this but not close enough to Animal Crossing haha although I would argue my
mood over the weekend since yesterday has been greatly affected by the delivery
thing because I EXPECTED A CALLBACK EVEN IF THEY CAN'T TRACE THE DAMN THING okay
I don't rage nowadays liao let's not think about that now, yes?<br />

Okay, I guess they are using guns now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this somewhat exciting new
episode (#HatenaIllusion11) and then you realise we have one more episode to go,
we are shooting kids now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No seriously, what did this show teach us
again? Haha jokes aside, it's the kids' turn to steal an Artifact. But really,
it's all going too well. WHERE'S THE TRAP?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, there is one, don't
you worry. Hey, no one said this show was that simple. Probably learnt this
through watching this many episodes and dealing with Mariah-san, but I would say
it's actually good training for this setup lmao. First, let's talk about
success. The kids got the last of the 3 Artifacts in order to get the mother
back. That violin thing. I say that because we know it's nothing like one. It
wasn't hard to get it back though somehow. Even the owner was confused when they
Indiana Jones-d it with a fake. But we know, it'll be safer over there. Why? Cue
the actual issue. Bryan, the guy who hosted all of them and allowed Mamoru to
perform in Australia in the first place, is not really in great financial
condition. So let me introduce the mistake I made and though that one looked
like Mariah-san so now we know she is good, is this season's last (hopefully)
antagonist Michelle Li. Remember her? She was the one who told off the other
guys about storming the Hoshisato mansion when they were out. Again, already
being manipulated by them anyways, but still. This time though, she sneaked in
real good. Again, never thought I would see this much gun in this Anime, but
hey, without magic most bad guys are still human, so what else can they use,
apparitions? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, Michelle confronted the lot while in the bath (lol
why), and took their Artifacts hostage in exchange of their lives, of course.
Because, as innocent as the Artifact they stole would look, it's cleverly
disguised to protect the actual Artifact inside, which is literally just a
nullifier for Artifacts around itself, so yeah, which makes all their powers
useless. So too bad, the father had no choice but to give in. Well, almost. As
you thought this would be done, remember that half of them including Gregory who
got brought into this mess, are magicians themselves. So this shouldn't be that
tough. The Orb which is the supposed actual treasure was hurled far away
(probably one of Michelle's guys caught it already), the bad guys got nothing,
Makoto managed to protect innocent Dina who still doesn't know anything, but
barely escaped since Dina was injured. And... not going to troll you or anything
but I did not have a knack of any sort when writing the opening quote, but yeah,
someone was female. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, not Makoto, we already debunked that already
Hatena found out in the first episode lmao. The vanishing magic from Makoto
threw them far away, but they were quickly cornered by Michelle's men, probably
likely because she has some Artifact that can find them easily, I guess. So
yeah, ending this episode with the bad guys attacking the weakest link within
the good guys while everyone else is in the "mansion" might sound a little bit
of a stretch, but I can see where this is going. You think Dina and Makoto are
going to date? Haha but what about Hatena-chan? And then she squeals? Haha lol
we shall see what happens then. Really, the setup till now thus far; This has
turned out to be more interesting than ever despite the real bad animation
drawings, really.<br />

Wow that puffer fish with the #RealityCheck and that's how you get relationship
issues haha really Hanako it's your fault. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But seriously, Hanako, it's
ALL your fault. In this final episode (#HanakoKun12) I think we can be very sure
there won't be a season two because this Anime... ended up being disappointing.
Ask yourself what was the most exciting episode this series. If you said last
week's, then ignore my opinions. Otherwise, I'm glad we stayed on the same page.
So, how this series ended. Really, this is it? I understand why it has to end
like this, but thinking back from last week with all the Mitsuba stuff, things
going on with Tsukasa and his goals of screwing the school up with apparitions,
and Kou... this is literally going nowhere. All we have to remember from the
previous episode is literally leaving Kou alone so they can wrap up this Anime?
Really? That's it?? I hope someone remembers what this is all about, by the way.
Some might say it's from Episode 1 with Yashiro and the mermaid scales, but I
think we know little about the murder of Tsukasa by Amane to NOT talked upon in
this whole series in general. That, I think will make this series fail for me,
even if there is going to be a sequel. I know the original work hasn't ended
yet, but for this kind of ending... sure, I can be satisfied, with them talking
about the main couple's relationship, but really? This episode made me sad. As
sad as Yashiro felt all episode. This aside, let's talk about Yashiro. She was
going to be a mermaid, she asked for happiness with a male, Hanako kind of did
fulfill it for her, and that was a problem since she's a fish now, but of
course, it's because of this Seven Wonder that she's still human, I guess. Is
she though? Like Mitsuba, once you're dead, you're dead, girl. There is
technically no turning back. Okay, back to the plot. A bunch of fishes (yes yes)
(lol that sidekick of a fish) introduced themselves to Yashiro, hoping to bring
her back but not the violent way as we have seen episodes ago, so to you know,
be part of the ocean. And yes, they did tackle all her weak points of wanting to
GET LAID haha and not finding much love in the real world until... she realised
that they were talking about her as a fish lol. Hey, everyone's gotta shit on
her as a human with those daikon legs lmao. Jokes aside, this is pretty
convincing of an appeal for her to come to this side of their world, but yeah
Hanako stopped her at the last moment. Again, we know that this Hanako isn't
that great at expressing himself, not even at talking about his past, but I'm
still not going to forgive him for treating Yashiro that way all the time. But
yeah, she is kind of a servant/assistant to Hanako I would argue just as how
Tsukasa has one too (poor Sakura-chan), so yeah, this is kind of cliche if you
think about it. Relationship problems aside, it seems like with the subtle hints
at the end of the episode, it will take a long time before the actual
confrontation happens just like how, say, Anime "Assassination Classroom" had to
(spoiler free) do a season two to wrap things up and give us the actual
backstory. But with this series? I'm not holding my breath. (You know, fish?
Hold breath? Haha) I was expecting this series, honestly speaking, to be more of
the action, the drama between the Hanako(s), and how these two forces can end up
with Amane's victory in maintaining balance in the school, but, uh... I guess
not. So yeah, this might be the worst I've watched this season. There, I said
it. See, Hanako? It isn't that hard once you tell. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Haha if they ever
end this series with another season of Anime we shall see if this ending right
here will be justified, I guess.<br />

P.S. If you enjoyed this series 50% because of Yashiro and the other 50% because
of the little things the Mokke did (for example combing Yashiro's hair, see if
you can spot it) it's worth watching haha <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't know man... lol<br />

Okay Yamamoto if you can come up with such plots why ruin their relationship and
not go write a proper manga already, you f**king loser- Hi and welcome to the
season finale of the series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode (#RikeKoi12) I know
we shouldn't be investigating who did it because we have a victim to attend to,
but instead Yukimura... I don't know what he's thinking, man. This guy. So
first, the plot. Firstly, they have to find Himuro. But in the process of doing
that, then did they realise someone was behind this. You know, the gift as
apology but was shattered on the one fall down the steps. I mean, someone would
have known it to be wrong. However, instead of analysing and deducing it the
rational way, we're doing it the scientific way. Which probably explains how
awkward this whole series still is to some extent considering Yukimura's
confrontation of Yamamoto is literally asking for another scientific paper for
her crimes or something lol. Anyways, everyone knows she did it, it's for her
manga or whatever because she's too dumb to think about the plot on her own and
wants to implicate others on this (and not knowing how weak Himuro is in person,
we'll talk about this later) so yeah, it's her fault. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As some form of
consolation though, she did not destroy the real gift, but a replica she got
when they were out shopping together. So, not so bad after all. Just... Ibarada
did help by shaving some money off her already empty pocket to teach her a
lesson lol. And then, it's finding Himuro. I know it's time to run since what
happened last episode, but so far away until no one can find you? Yeah, this is
likely an Anime filler plot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't ask why I know, I just feel that
from years of watching these stuff already haha. Anyways, ignoring origin, she
fell again, this time breaking her heels and spraining her ankle, and in the
most disabled condition known to humanity (lol), she crawls under the ledge of
the bridge to cry. Hey, if you need an emotion build-up go ahead and watch the
end of the previous episode again. Otherwise, you'll also be able to build your
emotions up once the sun rises (How long has she been alone walking? All night
too?) and Yukimura finally found her if not for Yamamoto telling him where to
search or else this might take a couple more days lol. Yukimura calls Himuro
(aww) out for her mistakes in her apology report (lol), and Himuro got real
desperate. Hey, did I not mention that she's the weakest in this relationship?
This girl needs some love, man. There ain't any time for scientific
explanations. And in some might say the best location and time with the best
mood value, they kissed a passionate kiss. Hey, if it makes them want to kiss
again, I'll call that passionate haha. What a way to end the series though, and
if not for Yamamoto (haha), this would have gone better. In the author's
defence, I can't think of a better way to dump a shit load of scientific stuff
into a modern love story (*recalls the episode where they science-type
traditional stories*), but this will be as nerdy as it gets, I promise you. And
for that, I'm still glad <strike>the author</strike> the Anime production could
squeeze out such an ending without me feeling that it's not science nerd level
storytelling anymore. It still is, by the way, till the end. And with this I
must say this is still the most I've enjoyed this season. From the laughs
(basically Kanade-chan hehe), to the dumb nerdy stuff maybe, to the love, to
Himuro being desperate and Yukimura trying to be clean (you're in it bro just
admit it haha) and everyone else that is ripped... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> you know, it's real
good, man. I mean, I wished I've watched such an Anime but without the science,
but this series is not like this. Other than that, I'm going to miss something
from this series, I can feel it. Not going to give you statistics to how much I
would, its rewatch value, whatever theories and references they made that made
me feel like that... etc. No, I'm not that science-type. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />

May we once again give a resounding round of applause for Iwanaga Kotoko who
saved this series though it's through my most hated way which is nothing but
dialogue? I say "again" because you should have since last week haha. Also, this
show is a real comeback, and I'm still satisfied from last week. So in this last
episode (#KyokouSuiri12), we wrap things up. Firstly, Steel Lady Nanase, the
youkai, is no more.
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/otsukare" target="_blank">Otsukare-sama</a>,
Kuro-san. Sure was hard on him, fighting that monster for hours on end. But
Kotoko-chan too, cracking her brains to think and respond appropriately for the
build-up of the century just to get rid of what might be the biggest threat to
humanity thus far (that we can see) (even with microscopes) (yes I meant the
pandemic haha), but they did it. So to conclude this series, I know it's not
much, but man, do some of the things be reminiscent of what this show is in
itself. The jokes are back, the romance burns are good, and we can see all is
well. The youkai case though, is as reasonable as you can expect. The site is
shut down because Rikka-san obviously lost so might as well save on that domain
money lol, the Internet is crazing over whether the one actually dead is Nanase
Karin (which is, by the way), the police kind of got dragged into this new
rumour but still safely concluded that Nanase did indeed die and it wasn't a
replacement (I mean, how can you replace that huge rack? Haha), and Saki-san
wants to know the truth. Wait, I thought we were done here? Ah, but Saki-san
doesn't want to be left out of this conflict between the two and Rikka-san, so
Kuro-san gives a reasonable explanation. Rikka-san, like him, gained immortality
and future prediction by eating the same "last supper" (of kudan and mermaid
meat) and survived. Unlike him, however, who would like to die a normal death of
old age at some point and living life normally, this cousin here wants to return
back to normal as soon as possible. I mean, ignoring those powers and actually
living a normal life is easier, but you know, she can't live with that.
(That's... an immortality joke right there lol) And to create probably such a
youkai or God which can make her go back to just a human, she will not stop in
her own experimentation in using the power of rumour and imagination to make
something to save herself. However, it really feels like Rikka-san doesn't
regret doing all this since these aren't technically not even criminal (as far
as we went until she made a youkai which can kill) since the police can't even
trace this to her in any way. Oh well, which is why they are here to stop that
wench. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Really man, I'll just be Kuro-san if I have obtained such
powers. Again, it's not like it isn't painful. I mean, if you tried this many
times it probably is painless, but still. So yeah, this battle can go on forever
until Rikka-san gives up, which is never. Nonetheless, Kotoko-chan should be
protected now that she knows this brain crack midget is getting in her way (lol)
of making whatever she wants come true now. So, Kuro-san has to protect her,
which brings us to this filler of an end with no relation to the youkai: the
relationship between them two. I know it's kind of not original content since
they can write whatever they want, so yeah, I'm enjoying it anyways so whatever
haha. Hey, they be doing it on the bed already so whatever lmao. All in all,
really a show that turned itself sunny side up after having a rough start, and
I'm glad I got over the boring phase to give this a thumbs up at this point. If
they have a sequel can it not be about Rikka-san? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, she is
probably under youkai surveillance 24/7 now we know she's a wanted person in the
spriitual world haha YOU BITC- ALRIGHT haha we're done<br />

So it's that time of the year again. Let's talk about what I saw on first
impression, shall we?<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>"Kakushigoto"</b> [premiers April 2nd 2020] looks like Anime "Ao-chan"
    but when the girl is younger and the father tries NOT to tell her that he's
    a hentai manga artist lmao I hope I can get over the age thing because this
    kid isn't exactly of age haha
  </li>
  <li>Yu-Gi-Oh? Digimon?? "What year is this???" lol</li>
  <li>
    "Arte" sounds like a great 16th century coming-of-age show with female
    empowerment since there isn't any at that time and Mikakoshi (Komatsu
    Mikako) voices the main girl which is a plus (hehe) but I don't really want
    to be reminded of work at this time of age so no thanks haha that voice
    though
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>"Yesterday wo Utatte"</b> [premiers April 4th 2020] looks interesting,
    with an author who writes emotional stories for a living... I have a feeling
    I don't want to cry every week haha. The plot sounds real good though. I'll
    give a couple episodes a try, I guess.
  </li>
  <li>
    There's literally an Anime about girls fishing haha this is how far we have
    come in Anime production budget considerations by the way
  </li>
  <li>
    Yes, Kaguya-sama meets her love rival Tomita Miyu (lol) in what seems to be
    a conclusion to this series? Hey, all I want is to see two people get
    together. Is it that hard? We shall see in the 2nd season of
    <b>"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?"</b> [premiers April 11th 2020] Haha did I
    do the promo right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  </li>
</ul>
TL:DR; If we stick to love stories again this season we will be on the trend
haha
<br />

Hmm there is something to listen this week haha.
<b>FLOWER FLOWER's new album</b> isn't exactly awesome, but I might need my
<strike>YUI</strike> yui fix every once in a while so I'll try to give a couple.
Not really in the mood to listen to this over the week mainly because I'm not
doing it too- Okay give me a break, me. But seriously, close this review already
haha I sound like my boss lol<br />
<br />
About news on Twitter and beyond, <b>Asakura Momo's new song previews</b> for
her upcoming album in two weeks is... sure, considering Mocho has so much to
explore in music style anyways. That's idolism for you, baby.
<b>Kalafina's member Hikaru announced her solo debut</b> following Wakana under
artist title "H-el-ical//" (no joke) which sounds like Kalafina anyways (FYI
Wakana is now under Victor where Kajiuira-sensei is, and Hikaru is under NBC
Universal which hosts artists like Miyawaki Shion), and
<b>cinema staff created a song from scratch in a livestream</b> for about 12
hours++ I think stating if they cannot finish the song they won't quit and
accepting donations as an effort to cut their losses from the cancelled upcoming
live performances. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Everyone in Japan is having it rough out there, isn't
it? I mean, with the Olympics postponed for a year you would expect Mocho's new
album to not have live performances. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Well... haha<br />
<br />
Next week? Hmm... FLOWER FLOWER follow-up probably, and I really need to find
time to listen to Nu-chan's best album again, as I've said week after week. So
hopefully this time, I'll actually do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is all then. My life now every week is literally wake up, play Animal
Crossing, work, come back for Animal Crossing haha. Mobile games are when I
travel, and DOAXVV is whenever there is an event because I don't even care now.
Then again, I think it's the mood affecting me now, from future work stress
("anxiety" be my middle name) to whatever delivery- Ok I promise not to talk
about sad things already. It's so bad now I'd rather talk about good things,
like Animal Crossing!! Haha cya guys next time then, and until then... hey at
least we have new Anime to look forward to lol what is Klassic Note now<br />
<br />
P.S. Yay for animating "BLEACH" final arc because we know it's not the sketchy
drawings that matter (same production, by the way), but we need new people to
voice the bad guys. Hopefully. If they can get anyone I know to voice some of
the bad girls I don't mind watching it haha still a long way till airtime though
I just hope they spend more time making it LOOK better haha GOT THEM<br />
