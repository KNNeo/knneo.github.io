You can if it doesn't appear after a week and I have to contact them physically on Saturday through customer service and talking to the delivery guy, they still didn't get back to you over the weekend.<br><br> <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span><br><br> Must be the pandemic haha okay let's talk Anime it's any amount of times better than this but not close enough to Animal Crossing haha although I would argue my mood over the weekend since yesterday has been greatly affected by the delivery thing because I EXPECTED A CALLBACK EVEN IF THEY CAN'T TRACE THE DAMN THING okay I don't rage nowadays liao let's not think about that now, yes?<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=HatenaIllusion11><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Hatena Illusion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Why do I (Dina) feel like this?" You're in love with Makoto!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, we all have that feeling before just ask elementary school Hatena haha</div></blockquote>Okay, I guess they are using guns now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this somewhat exciting new episode (#HatenaIllusion11) and then you realise we have one more episode to go, we are shooting kids now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No seriously, what did this show teach us again? Haha jokes aside, it's the kids' turn to steal an Artifact. But really, it's all going too well. WHERE'S THE TRAP?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, there is one, don't you worry. Hey, no one said this show was that simple. Probably learnt this through watching this many episodes and dealing with Mariah-san, but I would say it's actually good training for this setup lmao. First, let's talk about success. The kids got the last of the 3 Artifacts in order to get the mother back. That violin thing. I say that because we know it's nothing like one. It wasn't hard to get it back though somehow. Even the owner was confused when they Indiana Jones-d it with a fake. But we know, it'll be safer over there. Why? Cue the actual issue. Bryan, the guy who hosted all of them and allowed Mamoru to perform in Australia in the first place, is not really in great financial condition. So let me introduce the mistake I made and though that one looked like Mariah-san so now we know she is good, is this season's last (hopefully) antagonist Michelle Li. Remember her? She was the one who told off the other guys about storming the Hoshisato mansion when they were out. Again, already being manipulated by them anyways, but still. This time though, she sneaked in real good. Again, never thought I would see this much gun in this Anime, but hey, without magic most bad guys are still human, so what else can they use, apparitions? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, Michelle confronted the lot while in the bath (lol why), and took their Artifacts hostage in exchange of their lives, of course. Because, as innocent as the Artifact they stole would look, it's cleverly disguised to protect the actual Artifact inside, which is literally just a nullifier for Artifacts around itself, so yeah, which makes all their powers useless. So too bad, the father had no choice but to give in. Well, almost. As you thought this would be done, remember that half of them including Gregory who got brought into this mess, are magicians themselves. So this shouldn't be that tough. The Orb which is the supposed actual treasure was hurled far away (probably one of Michelle's guys caught it already), the bad guys got nothing, Makoto managed to protect innocent Dina who still doesn't know anything, but barely escaped since Dina was injured. And... not going to troll you or anything but I did not have a knack of any sort when writing the opening quote, but yeah, someone was female. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No, not Makoto, we already debunked that already Hatena found out in the first episode lmao. The vanishing magic from Makoto threw them far away, but they were quickly cornered by Michelle's men, probably likely because she has some Artifact that can find them easily, I guess. So yeah, ending this episode with the bad guys attacking the weakest link within the good guys while everyone else is in the "mansion" might sound a little bit of a stretch, but I can see where this is going. You think Dina and Makoto are going to date? Haha but what about Hatena-chan? And then she squeals? Haha lol we shall see what happens then. Really, the setup till now thus far; This has turned out to be more interesting than ever despite the real bad animation drawings, really.<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTpktPAAvFD-S6BZU8zfqA89LPCuCFVBceqD6kHuxz4QPYkkGGOKCDVg2F8jntA1xVp9sFmL6Exgy_7nqFHtU8_oAjAPiRWyPF_jsbj7cjKitTNaSr8zPmzFlSapZzN7FfaR-js6fMjic/s320/hatenaillusion11_food.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Such is the life haha Yumemi MVP every episode lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWGX5DVuPkKR0V6v6H1xrybR3bKlUr6YoPTycluN4YCihKBum7CIVBGKmmtxyhuZr7vTC01pwjtvJw6lkfIeH53wvZcVvzMDagNqFoFV_2RHfh5pFgUlOUVZzgPAQVF55nlWSpeIPzwOM/s320/hatenaillusion11_makoto.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is as cool as Mamoru will get, I promise you.</table></div></div>P.S.

"My group has purchased this mansion and everyone in it" Wait, you can just buy people like that? But these guys just stayed here for a couple of days lol oh I think she meant the staff<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=HanakoKun12><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Maybe different species can't understand each other after all" Haha Yashiro yeah Hanako is a ghost and you're a fish lmao</div></blockquote>Wow that puffer fish with the #RealityCheck and that's how you get relationship issues haha really Hanako it's your fault. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But seriously, Hanako, it's ALL your fault. In this final episode (#HanakoKun12) I think we can be very sure there won't be a season two because this Anime... ended up being disappointing. Ask yourself what was the most exciting episode this series. If you said last week's, then ignore my opinions. Otherwise, I'm glad we stayed on the same page. So, how this series ended. Really, this is it? I understand why it has to end like this, but thinking back from last week with all the Mitsuba stuff, things going on with Tsukasa and his goals of screwing the school up with apparitions, and Kou... this is literally going nowhere. All we have to remember from the previous episode is literally leaving Kou alone so they can wrap up this Anime? Really? That's it?? I hope someone remembers what this is all about, by the way. Some might say it's from Episode 1 with Yashiro and the mermaid scales, but I think we know little about the murder of Tsukasa by Amane to NOT talked upon in this whole series in general. That, I think will make this series fail for me, even if there is going to be a sequel. I know the original work hasn't ended yet, but for this kind of ending... sure, I can be satisfied, with them talking about the main couple's relationship, but really? This episode made me sad. As sad as Yashiro felt all episode. This aside, let's talk about Yashiro. She was going to be a mermaid, she asked for happiness with a male, Hanako kind of did fulfill it for her, and that was a problem since she's a fish now, but of course, it's because of this Seven Wonder that she's still human, I guess. Is she though? Like Mitsuba, once you're dead, you're dead, girl. There is technically no turning back. Okay, back to the plot. A bunch of fishes (yes yes) (lol that sidekick of a fish) introduced themselves to Yashiro, hoping to bring her back but not the violent way as we have seen episodes ago, so to you know, be part of the ocean. And yes, they did tackle all her weak points of wanting to GET LAID haha and not finding much love in the real world until... she realised that they were talking about her as a fish lol. Hey, everyone's gotta shit on her as a human with those daikon legs lmao. Jokes aside, this is pretty convincing of an appeal for her to come to this side of their world, but yeah Hanako stopped her at the last moment. Again, we know that this Hanako isn't that great at expressing himself, not even at talking about his past, but I'm still not going to forgive him for treating Yashiro that way all the time. But yeah, she is kind of a servant/assistant to Hanako I would argue just as how Tsukasa has one too (poor Sakura-chan), so yeah, this is kind of cliche if you think about it. Relationship problems aside, it seems like with the subtle hints at the end of the episode, it will take a long time before the actual confrontation happens just like how, say, Anime "Assassination Classroom" had to (spoiler free) do a season two to wrap things up and give us the actual backstory. But with this series? I'm not holding my breath. (You know, fish? Hold breath? Haha) I was expecting this series, honestly speaking, to be more of the action, the drama between the Hanako(s), and how these two forces can end up with Amane's victory in maintaining balance in the school, but, uh... I guess not. So yeah, this might be the worst I've watched this season. There, I said it. See, Hanako? It isn't that hard once you tell. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Haha if they ever end this series with another season of Anime we shall see if this ending right here will be justified, I guess.<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiItmjZ9Gw1yssq_RaxIHTurrPdoaCaGYO4vN5zcedreRPf986kjLx2RVZzl6jta2W_53qjf6EFtxSV-Z5qNrqODK4ddU5Pk9D3zgq4WwH9mKcA1QrZ0tmFtqFeLmutxG9y0YiM-1deE1A/s320/hanakokun12_harem.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>She can dream about this for years on, this Yashiro haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRRmsx9qLMbOXUmFt0bGUV3kjajTXwfixHmoXFc5TZq8zMj2WAq7Lgm9TB4lnLveBS-vu78eXjqjh-x94mjKsph_w5gcciupbHG0m5KbU2ORq_3bkuSX9EDuFRuAz4LNZMDz5o6Rg0XT8/s320/hanakokun12_yashiro8.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Early stages of pyramid scheme clients be like<br> (haha)</table></div></div>P.S. If you enjoyed this series 50% because of Yashiro and the other 50% because of the little things the Mokke did (for example combing Yashiro's hair, see if you can spot it) it's worth watching haha <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I don't know man... lol<br> P.P.S. "I got a sudden urge to see you" Hey guys? Here's your next pick-up line haha<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=RikeKoi12><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"What happened?" Hey, you think Yukimura can answer that, Yamamoto? You bitch? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Okay Yamamoto if you can come up with such plots why ruin their relationship and not go write a proper manga already, you f**king loser- Hi and welcome to the season finale of the series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this final episode (#RikeKoi12) I know we shouldn't be investigating who did it because we have a victim to attend to, but instead Yukimura... I don't know what he's thinking, man. This guy. So first, the plot. Firstly, they have to find Himuro. But in the process of doing that, then did they realise someone was behind this. You know, the gift as apology but was shattered on the one fall down the steps. I mean, someone would have known it to be wrong. However, instead of analysing and deducing it the rational way, we're doing it the scientific way. Which probably explains how awkward this whole series still is to some extent considering Yukimura's confrontation of Yamamoto is literally asking for another scientific paper for her crimes or something lol. Anyways, everyone knows she did it, it's for her manga or whatever because she's too dumb to think about the plot on her own and wants to implicate others on this (and not knowing how weak Himuro is in person, we'll talk about this later) so yeah, it's her fault. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As some form of consolation though, she did not destroy the real gift, but a replica she got when they were out shopping together. So, not so bad after all. Just... Ibarada did help by shaving some money off her already empty pocket to teach her a lesson lol. And then, it's finding Himuro. I know it's time to run since what happened last episode, but so far away until no one can find you? Yeah, this is likely an Anime filler plot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Don't ask why I know, I just feel that from years of watching these stuff already haha. Anyways, ignoring origin, she fell again, this time breaking her heels and spraining her ankle, and in the most disabled condition known to humanity (lol), she crawls under the ledge of the bridge to cry. Hey, if you need an emotion build-up go ahead and watch the end of the previous episode again. Otherwise, you'll also be able to build your emotions up once the sun rises (How long has she been alone walking? All night too?) and Yukimura finally found her if not for Yamamoto telling him where to search or else this might take a couple more days lol. Yukimura calls Himuro (aww) out for her mistakes in her apology report (lol), and Himuro got real desperate. Hey, did I not mention that she's the weakest in this relationship? This girl needs some love, man. There ain't any time for scientific explanations. And in some might say the best location and time with the best mood value, they kissed a passionate kiss. Hey, if it makes them want to kiss again, I'll call that passionate haha. What a way to end the series though, and if not for Yamamoto (haha), this would have gone better. In the author's defence, I can't think of a better way to dump a shit load of scientific stuff into a modern love story (*recalls the episode where they science-type traditional stories*), but this will be as nerdy as it gets, I promise you. And for that, I'm still glad <strike>the author</strike> the Anime production could squeeze out such an ending without me feeling that it's not science nerd level storytelling anymore. It still is, by the way, till the end. And with this I must say this is still the most I've enjoyed this season. From the laughs (basically Kanade-chan hehe), to the dumb nerdy stuff maybe, to the love, to Himuro being desperate and Yukimura trying to be clean (you're in it bro just admit it haha) and everyone else that is ripped... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> you know, it's real good, man. I mean, I wished I've watched such an Anime but without the science, but this series is not like this. Other than that, I'm going to miss something from this series, I can feel it. Not going to give you statistics to how much I would, its rewatch value, whatever theories and references they made that made me feel like that... etc. No, I'm not that science-type. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi88wjuefoNBDEe3Lu1h7YiRVF3eaSWekNPR3pBAm4XeuxSGn8pdmcnoAGdBc7Nz0u-gvH43SgcOIOj35uGYC2I6zUzUzxjWRGSYiRHeZ-D90HtlFiB_79_Wggdeet3TDKfvY_tg03uLvk/s320/rikekoi12_kiss.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is actually perfect so I'm leaving this here now</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2CrJPjVSMm_ctJP6MvNkytKNdq03ikopU2guljnPomfqhZ6QNhCulQpVhGhpk8zfyKTev4Cg2dNeCQYcShj8_iu8hwXl-KkMBFTdbtYJDebmMmBmSHW8Ejotgd3g47rxXinKhLoZpZis/s320/rikekoi12_kanade2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW the two quarrel because they can't admit they wanna <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha target=_blank>ichaicha</a> lol<br> (Thanks for 12 episodes of torture I totally enjoyed it haha)</table></div></div>P.S.

I say "again" because you should have since last week haha. Also, this show is a real comeback, and I'm still satisfied from last week. So in this last episode (#KyokouSuiri12), we wrap things up. Firstly, Steel Lady Nanase, the youkai, is no more. <a href=https://jisho.org/search/otsukare target=_blank>Otsukare-sama</a>, Kuro-san. Sure was hard on him, fighting that monster for hours on end. But Kotoko-chan too, cracking her brains to think and respond appropriately for the build-up of the century just to get rid of what might be the biggest threat to humanity thus far (that we can see) (even with microscopes) (yes I meant the pandemic haha), but they did it. So to conclude this series, I know it's not much, but man, do some of the things be reminiscent of what this show is in itself. The jokes are back, the romance burns are good, and we can see all is well. The youkai case though, is as reasonable as you can expect. The site is shut down because Rikka-san obviously lost so might as well save on that domain money lol, the Internet is crazing over whether the one actually dead is Nanase Karin (which is, by the way), the police kind of got dragged into this new rumour but still safely concluded that Nanase did indeed die and it wasn't a replacement (I mean, how can you replace that huge rack? Haha), and Saki-san wants to know the truth. Wait, I thought we were done here? Ah, but Saki-san doesn't want to be left out of this conflict between the two and Rikka-san, so Kuro-san gives a reasonable explanation. Rikka-san, like him, gained immortality and future prediction by eating the same "last supper" (of kudan and mermaid meat) and survived. Unlike him, however, who would like to die a normal death of old age at some point and living life normally, this cousin here wants to return back to normal as soon as possible. I mean, ignoring those powers and actually living a normal life is easier, but you know, she can't live with that. (That's... an immortality joke right there lol) And to create probably such a youkai or God which can make her go back to just a human, she will not stop in her own experimentation in using the power of rumour and imagination to make something to save herself. However, it really feels like Rikka-san doesn't regret doing all this since these aren't technically not even criminal (as far as we went until she made a youkai which can kill) since the police can't even trace this to her in any way. Oh well, which is why they are here to stop that wench. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Really man, I'll just be Kuro-san if I have obtained such powers. Again, it's not like it isn't painful. I mean, if you tried this many times it probably is painless, but still. So yeah, this battle can go on forever until Rikka-san gives up, which is never. Nonetheless, Kotoko-chan should be protected now that she knows this brain crack midget is getting in her way (lol) of making whatever she wants come true now. So, Kuro-san has to protect her, which brings us to this filler of an end with no relation to the youkai: the relationship between them two. I know it's kind of not original content since they can write whatever they want, so yeah, I'm enjoying it anyways so whatever haha. Hey, they be doing it on the bed already so whatever lmao. All in all, really a show that turned itself sunny side up after having a rough start, and I'm glad I got over the boring phase to give this a thumbs up at this point. If they have a sequel can it not be about Rikka-san? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, she is probably under youkai surveillance 24/7 now we know she's a wanted person in the spriitual world haha YOU BITC- ALRIGHT haha we're done<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizvMD0ZKPAzH3okMExN2HvaUr2Se99udYaXEmsLe6HKXPA5BoGanHWpsBM3RSYM5jBfJlS5EdJCUsUrMyy13Du3Dt_81Njy7X-0zGZ5s5h_Yitm_BUfg_a0r0JExXKM5zAvvQQNVQRcm4/s320/kyokousuiri12_youkai3.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That celebration she deserved, this God of Wisdom aka Iwanaga Kotoko</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeV7vfzrqzrafQ8XCziBitZ-82X-2KpWNnPmAgrB_pHH4GZf42uGfe-I9Mbl4t4FsmQpS3aNb8m2p8Be-3KguJ4Yg5a7Jp5UdQ0zpkR1RnIaFSSvTVlfcX0xf7JGKfU84x8OOu8Klcj5M/s320/kyokousuiri12_car.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Meanwhile, in the car... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div></div>P.S.

Let's talk about what I saw on first impression, shall we?<br><ul><li> <b>"Kakushigoto"</b> [premiers April 2nd 2020] looks like Anime "Ao-chan" but when the girl is younger and the father tries NOT to tell her that he's a hentai manga artist lmao I hope I can get over the age thing because this kid isn't exactly of age haha<li>Yu-Gi-Oh? Digimon?? "What year is this???" lol<li>"Arte" sounds like a great 16th century coming-of-age show with female empowerment since there isn't any at that time and Mikakoshi (Komatsu Mikako) voices the main girl which is a plus (hehe) but I don't really want to be reminded of work at this time of age so no thanks haha that voice though<li><b>"Yesterday wo Utatte"</b> [premiers April 4th 2020] looks interesting, with an author who writes emotional stories for a living... I have a feeling I don't want to cry every week haha. The plot sounds real good though. I'll give a couple episodes a try, I guess.<li>There's literally an Anime about girls fishing haha this is how far we have come in Anime production budget considerations by the way<li>Yes, Kaguya-sama meets her love rival Tomita Miyu (lol) in what seems to be a conclusion to this series? Hey, all I want is to see two people get together. Is it that hard? We shall see in the 2nd season of <b>"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?"</b> [premiers April 11th 2020] Haha did I do the promo right? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></ul>TL:DR; If we stick to love stories again this season we will be on the trend haha<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hmm there is something to listen this week haha. <b>FLOWER FLOWER's new album</b> isn't exactly awesome, but I might need my <strike>YUI</strike> yui fix every once in a while so I'll try to give a couple. Not really in the mood to listen to this over the week mainly because I'm not doing it too- Okay give me a break, me. But seriously, close this review already haha I sound like my boss lol<br><br> About news on Twitter and beyond, <b>Asakura Momo's new song previews</b> for her upcoming album in two weeks is... sure, considering Mocho has so much to explore in music style anyways. That's idolism for you, baby. <b>Kalafina's member Hikaru announced her solo debut</b> following Wakana under artist title "H-el-ical//" (no joke) which sounds like Kalafina anyways (FYI Wakana is now under Victor where Kajiuira-sensei is, and Hikaru is under NBC Universal which hosts artists like Miyawaki Shion), and <b>cinema staff created a song from scratch in a livestream</b> for about 12 hours++ I think stating if they cannot finish the song they won't quit and accepting donations as an effort to cut their losses from the cancelled upcoming live performances. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Everyone in Japan is having it rough out there, isn't it? I mean, with the Olympics postponed for a year you would expect Mocho's new album to not have live performances. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well... haha<br><br> Next week? Hmm... FLOWER FLOWER follow-up probably, and I really need to find time to listen to Nu-chan's best album again, as I've said week after week. So hopefully this time, I'll actually do it.<br><br><br><br><br> This is all then. My life now every week is literally wake up, play Animal Crossing, work, come back for Animal Crossing haha. Mobile games are when I travel, and DOAXVV is whenever there is an event because I don't even care now. Then again, I think it's the mood affecting me now, from future work stress ("anxiety" be my middle name) to whatever delivery- Ok I promise not to talk about sad things already. It's so bad now I'd rather talk about good things, like Animal Crossing!! Haha cya guys next time then, and until then... hey at least we have new Anime to look forward to lol what is Klassic Note now<br><br> P.S. Yay for animating "BLEACH" final arc because we know it's not the sketchy drawings that matter (same production, by the way), but we need new people to voice the bad guys. Hopefully. If they can get anyone I know to voice some of the bad girls I don't mind watching it haha still a long way till airtime though I just hope they spend more time making it LOOK better haha GOT THEM<br><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
