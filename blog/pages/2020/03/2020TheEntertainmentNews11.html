I mean, there's Kaguya-sama and Attack on Titanalready, man. I don't need more shows to watch already tbh<br /><br />Let's start, shall we? We have a couple more episodes (from a couple moreseries) left so let's finish them all!! I'm getting tired haha must be work<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Even Gaugau is getting all friendly with (Makoto), that's not fair" Uh, I    mean, Hatena-chan if you want to be friendly with your childhood friend...    haha  </div></blockquote>Okay I'll forgive you if half your reason to watch this series is to hearHatena-chan moan lol Suzuki Aina I'm not interested in you at all haha yourdebut album is great though. In this new episode of the devil lol(#HatenaIllusion09), well this might just be the happiest episode in this seriesyet. Let's talk about it. Firsly, Ema-san sacrificed her Artifact for the kidsto stay in the mansion. Well, it's not that simple, but she did ask forMariah-san to retest the kids so that they can be fit to stay in the mansion.Why go through so much trouble though? I think by this episode we should haveknown the truth. Firstly, about Jeeves-san. He's an Artifact, as we know now.He's also something stolen from the village, so obviously it's an importantpiece of treasure even the parents had to protect in order for it to not landinto other peoples' hands. But here's the problem: If the parents aren't at homethen who's going to protect it? And seeing how powerful Jeeves himself is, onlysomeone better than him should then be allowed to stay within the walls, andthus the test from Mariah. I'll believe so far that the family story on the backend is true mainly because that is what the grandmother did to the couple whenthey escaped with Jeeves to Japan in the first place. The father didn't put upmuch of a struggle (lol of course, he has no powers), but the mother probablykept the peace aligned and thus allow the mansion to stay outside of thevillage. Magical power things, you know. Then, what it took to get this retest.Ema-san had to trade in her Artifact for this second chance, and so if the kidsmade it, she gets to take it back. She did not consider what happens otherwisethough, is the point. The test itself... let's just say it went way better thanexpected haha. Then again, it's technically three against one even though theopponent was informed of their visit, but the trio took care of the antagonistappropriately and took back the Artifact. Well, we know it's the fat bitc- Then,it's what it took for Mariah-san to even give a chance. Ema-san's Artifact...let's just say it's more than what is given to her by the mother Maeves. It'smore than just that, because of her back story. Story goes Ema was abandoned onthe streets and with money (hey, whatever man), Maeves paid off the bad guys andtook her into custody. I assume from the flashback it's also because whateverEma's lost parents left for her might have been Artifacts themselves, so theMaster Thief decided to take her in since... good chances she can protect theArtifacts (probably not made by her back then) herself. That will make of a goodassumption from what we saw when Yumemi managed to fix Ema's brooch after it gotdamaged during the test. So yeah, it's more than an Artifact to Ema. It'sliterally her second life at stake, which of course, thanks to the kid<b>s</b>(emphasising the plural form here just because), they got it back for her. Thatmight have been the most touching moment in this series yet as Hatena apologisedfor Ema's sacrifice to such an extent. I would argue it's a good one, and thankgoodness Mariah didn't go back on her promise like those other times lol.Lastly, why Mariah-san wouldn't even want to give the kids a chance AT ALL. Yes,call her the devil, but she has her reasons. Mainly, she doesn't want them to godown the path she has experienced before as a kid. What might it be though? Imean, we can safely guess that the family training on this is more than justrough, and considering the kids didn't even have any of that sort of trainingsince their parents left the village, they won't be recognised by the family.Literally, even the father knows. Which is why all this setup just to test ifthey can even act under duress, upon everything else. I mean, Hatena got seriousall of a sudden I don't even know how to react lol. Anyways, Hatena-chan haschosen her path, and probably for the other two, so there's no turning back now.Meanwhile, Makoto and Hatena manage to pull of a magic trick in front of Dinaeven he? Yes he, can't even do himself. Remember what he said as a challenge tobe accepted as apprentice by Gregory the Master? Yeah, they did it, I guess. ButDina is not pleased. So yeah, we might see some fighting again real soon, as badas the animation quality is- I mean, you can see it for yourself man that's theonly thing I can complain about right now that I know the backstory. WhetherDina will cross the boundary of standard magic tricks and touch on Artifacts, wedon't know. Hopefully Makoto won't think of him as a challenge haha bye<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M3ul5JlHKu0/Xm3XWBc3C6I/AAAAAAAA5yk/BXjR_Qke7l8Fc_ZhdTfSisGT2YFn6RSOwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion09_yumemi.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is so cute I can even forgive the sub-par drawing oooo kawaiiii          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IiHm8bCF-Ck/Xm3XWvm3onI/AAAAAAAA5yo/qr5_TUKnwKMhiorFb5Ebjtve0hJ8JaWTgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion09_tominozawa2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Literally, this fat b*tch is the evil villian that never dies lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Challenge them to armwrestling? What if you lose? Your hand joins them? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Come on, I justscarred by knee I don't want to lose an arm lmao. In this new episode(#HanakoKun10) we see the evil side of Aoi-chan. Yes, EVERYTHING. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Wait,isn't this about Yashiro? Okay, back to her first. Story goes that as Aoi-chan(<i>kawaii</i> Aoi-chan, please) (haha) clears up the books in the GardeningClub, she found out that all their photos have weird arms on them. Hmm... that'sweird. I don't think Hanako-kun doesn't know of it, but funny how it took solong, but yeah, he thought those were little than normal apparitions so justfulfilling their wishes will chase them away. I guess he's not wrong in sayingthat, since most of them disappeared after being in contact, but one of them...so, introducing one of the other Seven Wonders who haven't shown up yet, theHell of Mirrors. It's... just a bunch of mirrors, just like the one Yashiro wentthrough to get into its Boundary. The hands weren't at fault, no, but seeingMitsuba still inside the world, good chances he's at fault. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Moving on,the two walked around the world, and... man is this Seven Wonder a literala-hole. haha. According to Hanako (and evil Aoi-chan haha Aoi-chan no~) thisSeven Wonder reflects the weaknesses of living beings. So if you are...basically none of them because there aren't people without weaknesses, you'llleave in peace. But since everyone has their own weakness they are afraid toface (by the way mine is-), so it'll show up right in front of them. And asexpected, Hanako guessed Yashiro's is likely about her legs lol. I mean, evenMitsuba is sh*tting on her too, what can I say? (But seriously, when the endingtheme animation played I can't help but see her thick legs lol) However, Mitsubahere seems to have lost all of his memory (we'll get into that in a moment), andcan't get out of this world. Being experienced in this (lol), Yashiro took himto find this Boundary's Yorishiro, as she has learnt. Sadly, the mirror got inher away on her ascend towards the top, and... you can guess the rest. Yashiroisn't exactly depressed, but you know, that's where the Seven Wonder showedhimself. So basically his motive is to take over living beings (by technicallymaking them half dead I guess) (yeah nice try bro but Yashiro is tied to yourboss), so he asks his minions to do it. I'm not going to describe how gross itis since pretty much everything is to ensure you can puke without showing youmuch blood (I mean, I look at my scraped knee and I want to puke already lol),and with Hanako's(?) appearance it got worse. Real worse. Okay, not actualHanako by the name of Amane. The other one. Yes, Tsukasa, can't remember hisname. He breaks the shit out of the Seven Wonder in one hit, and confronts,wait, not Yashiro but Mitsuba, saying he was hopeless because he needed help.Okay, couple of things before we move on to next week with a conclusion for thisSeven Wonder. Firstly, Mitsuba's appearance once again. Remember the last timehe got... well, ripped off literally by Hanako after transforming into a beastfollowing his true motive being revealed by Kou-kun (that idiot, haha) andcontrolled by the broadcast room and Tsukasa, who technically died again afterhe died without anyone noticing him? Now with Tsukasa here it'll be no wonderhe's here since he probably is plotting on something under his orders. Then, isHanako's apprehensiveness in confronting one of his underlings ie. The Third ofSeven Wonders in this school. Probably not because he's a perv and once he stepsin the Seven Wonder will call him a freaking<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hentai" target="_blank">hentai</a> (lmao) (youdon't have to go in there and I can tell you that too haha), but more of that ifhe steps in it'll make the Seven Wonder stronger. Does that mean it'll amplifystrengths too on top of weaknesses? I guess we'll know by next week. Meanwhile,I just hope for all our sakes that Yashiro won't get crushed like a daikon again(ugh) and we might see another confrontation ahead of us real soon. Someone juststop Yashiro she is thinking too much into... whatever she is thinking about<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4PxHXAWL5f4/Xm3sSnYgXII/AAAAAAAA5y4/i3pU4v6xAeEZJ7B_y9otlosSZQzD3A9BQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun10_aoi4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is so ironic I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0Dovl3NQ9eQ/Xm3sS80ATlI/AAAAAAAA5y8/ac0tkI0D2Bc8aV-iSUXVfCzcKrz8V-PhgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun10_photo3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            These Photoshop skills are AMAZING I don't even know which is real            haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

And then I see Himuro and I'm like- Okay    okay Kanade-chan you're still best girl I promise haha  </div></blockquote>"My desire is... not because I like (Yukimura)" Okay you know it is so Himurostop lying to yourself you science nerd. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this rather serious episodeof presentations (#RikeKoi10) we... I hope you guys have attended universitybefore because I have. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span> And if you end up like Kanade-chan who can't evenget the presentations from their long titles... it's fine no one cares just do aquick Google most presentations are based on existing theories because we're toodumb to Einstein a new one haha that's why they are so long unless you'reYukimura. *looks at Yukimura* Ugh, unless you're him, apparently. Anyways, let'stalk. Not love, but science. Man, I really thought we left that a long wayalready, but I guess not. So, since I'm in engineering too, this will be easy tounderstand- No it's not! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, let's talk what is in this episode beforewe do some reality checks. In total, we're presented (literally) three types ofstudents in presentations, mainly people who don't prepare enough (I'm close tothat haha), people who succeed but it's totally different to whatever extent noone knows lol (not Yukimura presenting btw), and Kanade-chan. Focus here is ofcourse, on the last presentation mainly because Kanade-chan is scared. Notscared of being drilled by Yukimura, no, but scared of screwing things up.Surprisingly, she did really well. Compared to the first guy who can't say no ifhe really doesn't know (we'll talk about that later but suffice it to sayYukimura is right), and Torasuke which I must say from a last minute researchtopic based on his interests is so good he won't end up like the first guy, isprobably still better off because at least he got something to say, especiallywhen he's real knowledgeable at it. Adult games, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> ForKanade-chan though? Thus far we only know she is good at TSP (no RikeKuma goaway), and that is as far as she has done. For her presentation though? I mean,ignoring that emotional struggle which we'll cover later, it's literallyborrowing on the couple's experience (and experiments) at the amusement park andtalking about best paths to take when on a date with her own improvisation, andsomehow it sold real well to everyone present. I'm not going to Google now totell you if there is any sort of research as of this episode (good chances it'snot, since not everyone is Yukimura, so if you are at your final year inuniversity why not consider), but yeah, she did a really good job there. Isupposed the guys from Ikeba Lab probably scored way higher than most of thestudents who presented that day, so that's great. Okay, #RealityCheck, ladiesand gentlemen, to the best of my knowledge in case really no one knows aboutsuch stuff and I live in another world where presentations and Himuro existhaha. It was hard to hold back any jokes from the above, and here I shallpresent my experience in doing my final year thesis (project) during university.According to the lessons from where I am that also teach you how to communicateeffectively (hey I don't have a Yukimura to breathe down my throat, okay?),let's talk about what is close to reality. Well, basically most of themmentioned in the episode. The Torasuke calling someone baldie thing you canignore haha. So, to do an effective presentation about a research topic. Numberone: Come up with research that extends boundaries. Which basically means, takeon something existing in research, and come up with your ideas and prove itwell. So, taking Kanade's presentation, it's TSP plus something else, socreating a time-based TSP since (if you go read up yourself) TSP is a timelessresearch topic. Assuming all points are independent of time, you can draw a bestroute from Point A to Point B. That is, if reality doesn't exist. This isalready setup to point out a number of things one would do to prove a worthyresearch topic which include purpose (why would you do this) (for Torasuke it'sa little... but you know), interest in field (so past research, unless you'reEinstein and can think of Relativity yourself) (no one expects that level ofingenuity btw) and your contribution to this field of research. So Kanade didall of them: talk about how weak current TSP research is in solving complicatedissues (I know, dating amirite?? lol), proved that she only found one which wenta step further (likely that one Prof's research, I mean, look at his reactionman), and proposed a combination of theories which will bring this to adifferent area of research. Creating research possibilities, is the ultimategoal of such a thing in university. It's to encourage research into topics thatconcern. So, my experience. I would argue that mine is pretty close to the firstguy in reality (haha I chose the wrong Prof or topic, I don't know) (yes, Ichose him he didn't choose me), but in the end I pulled it off because I kind ofpulled everything else together and half-Kanade the presentation and... wellthere were only two people present in the presentation. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, all in all,this episode is a good reality check (besides the ripped Profs, and the baldiething lol) of how presentations work in university, so in case you haven'texperienced one yet... Don't, just don't; go work. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next episodethough... did you see me talk about Himuro being desperate about Yukimura at thestart of the episode? Yeah, it's confrontation time, bro. Especially when youhugged my beloved Kanade-chan too!!??

She's a real ghost" Wow Kotoko-chan, you    go extremes, huh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>So Solution 1 is lying, and Solution 2 is telling the truth? Well it's alsolying but now we gotta make people believe on the supernatural? Okay, that'sgoing to be tough either way to be honest. In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri10)where we are at Solution 2 out of 4 if you remember, and guess what we arecovering TWO solutions?? Man, this Anime knows its time is up lol we still gotat least two episodes, chill. So, the progress so far. It's not much. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Okay, we know that. But is Rikka-san just taking her time or is she gettingdesperate to stop Kotoko-chan from progressing further? So firstly, instead ofgoing for a more realistic standpoint to say ghost Nanase doesn't exist, weshall say she exists. So, for Kotoko's argument now, she says that Nanase isindeed alive, as a ghost, and found out about the truth in the afterlife fromthe father that it was a trap. Which means the father made her feel bad aboutherself all this time. Again, the amount of people who will believe it's a ghostwho did it is pretty much the same as the amount of people who will not.Especially when you have to explain how she beat up the Judo guy Terada with asteel beam, really. (Ugh, haha) But just as a reminder in which we were closerto this week from last week, we can't really say a certain someone created thisforum and wanted people to believe she's a ghost brought alive by rumour. Yeah,we can't say that. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But what we CAN say is that it's someone else.Someone in real life who did it. Probably someone who planned for this. I wouldargue that the father planning for his death and directly pointing it at his owndaughter sounds like a stretch (haha sorry Kotoko-chan I promise you I'm not onRikka-san's side), but it can happen, especially if you watched those serialdramas haha. Still, Kotoko makes a case that it's the father that did it, set itup for Nanase to feel bad, making her death worthwhile until she realises thetruth and "came back" to tell the living what's up. Well... sure. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Problem is, it cannot be definite. Steel Lady Nanase's actions right now are ofa barbarian, without much motive and intelligence of its own. That, and theviolence itself, is hard for people to believe that a ghost is back to tell usthe truth. I mean, you could've just told us. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Or you know, hauntsomeone's dreams or something. So, Solution 3. Kotoko now says that someone madeher up. Hey, not reality check but no, we're not talking about Rikka-san becauseI don't think we can since she will stop Kotoko almost immediately lol, butyeah, it's someone else. Nanase now therefore is back to haunt on her sister?Hey, remember the sister? Yeah, she seems suspicious. Let's interrogate the shitout of her haha. Okay, this one might not be tough, and technically works betterthan Solution 2 because we have a real human to blame now. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Problem is,we don't know who it is. It can be the sister, who might have set it up on herafter hearing about the father's death, and then feigning ignorance when shefound out that her sister committed suicide. I mean, which one is morebelievable, eh? So pretty much all the evidence available on the police might besent from her, that body might be just a double which seems unlikely unless youcan replicate those tits- But it seems more like (haha) someone around thesister wanted her to not get paranoid of Nanase's death and thus, created thisrumour known as Steel Lady Nanase. To be honest? This one seems unlikely too,but the people in the forums are buying it though. Like, someone else is behindhelping the sister? Maybe. Or maybe it's just some weird fan that doesn't wantNanase to die away, and is making her a serial killer, this might be more likelyhaha. Hey, I can make up fiction myself too lol. Again, bringing back toKotoko's overall strategy up till now with all these talk: it's not about whichdirection this discussion brings us, it's how far AND how fast we can run in anydirection. As long as we can run fast enough to not get Rikka-san grab anyreality that is different and beneficial to her, we will win. However, we mighthave a bigger problem coming. Remember when Kotoko said that Rikka won't step into influence in the forums? It might happen sooner than we think. So before theepisode ended, someone in the forums (in the form of Rikka-san maybe) rebuttedthat to calm someone down it's unlikely that revenge is the option to ease thesister off someone's death or fear of her own death, which makes sense and wouldlikely happen more in serial drama too lol. With Rikka-san's direct arrival tothe discussion also created a bigger problem for Kuro-san (remember this guy?lol) in which that... he can't grab a future close to him anymore. Uh oh. Idoubt this will kill him since (1) he's immortal he probably just can't changethe future and (2) he will be able to once Kotoko brings out another argument toturn things around. Hey, again, it's about who can run in any direction thefastest. And with the one solution from Kotoko left, let's hope this will sendher flying like a cheetah to somewhere out in the universe and beyond so thatpeople will stop thinking about this dead woman I CAN'T SHE'S GOT BIG BOOBS lolwe'll see how it goes next week.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p45Fi7gb_WU/Xm4bEGKFE0I/AAAAAAAA5z0/PtZjHnvvxuEWXHM4IPjSnX4ZZ3-2JgrLQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri10_saki1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW I realised Nanase's cup size got reduced because it got            flattened by the steel beam lol<br />            (Wouldn't the beam bounce back up though? lmao)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lJbnj9XKGVM/Xm4bEP5HWnI/AAAAAAAA5z4/U-_zZniT_fkSN62-HGriY4kNTSi_vDBsACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri10_nanase4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            And that's why you shouldn't die too early and/or not get a portrait            of you taken feeling sad lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. *Steel Lady Nanase shakes head* That's her telling Kotoko to stop lol<br />P.P.S. "This story might be true" Haha yeah Kotoko-chan I know right?? We don'teven have to fake it it's so real already lol<br />[The reality? If I had to guess it's likely Solution 2 where Kotoko says her daddid it, but she wouldn't have the vengeance to come back and haunt societymainly because considering her easy-going and rather laid back personality shewould desire death as punishment for her popularity instead. I mean, you knowher will to live is weak if she didn't dodge a falling steel beam]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Hmm, not much this week so let's talk about it.<b>TrySail's new single</b> is... well firstly it's double A-side which wereboth Anime "Madoka Magica" theme songs (ugh) so it <i>can't</i> be good haha (Ibetter take that back I remembered 2011 already so), so I gave one anyways. Bythe way, same guy who wrote the two songs here also wrote ClariS' new single'stopic song AND upcoming Asakura Momo's new album topic song which I said I likedthe preview. This is not going to go well haha. <b>Humbreader's 1st album</b> isfinally out on Apple Music so I took some time to give a listen to it and... boyam I disappointed considering like, anewhite and Band Harrassment did way betterthan them. Hmm... this might be hard to give just in general. Heck, I might justgive a couple by next week anyways.<br /><br />In news surrounding Twitter and only Twitter because if we go any furtherthere's the coronavirus lmao, <b>FLOWER FLOWER's topic song</b> for theirupcoming album end of the month is... interesting to say the least,<b>SHE's released a new music video</b> for their upcoming album which... meh(haha), <b>Gotch released a new song</b> after 3 years since his last work(other than his band Ajikan), <b>Sambomaster released a new song</b> for their20th anniversary and tribute album which isn't what I wanted to be honest,<b>TrySail is doing a livestream</b> two weeks from now for their new single(yay) (yes this one is just for me haha), <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia</b> aka"sanpan" (haha) released new songs from time to time which will no doubt becomean album soon in which then I will review, and<b>Kugimiya Rie is releasing a mini-album</b> in April. Yes, Shana-chan's voiceactor. The last time she did it was in 2011. I can prove that I've given two ofher songs right now with that music library I mentioned above just key in hername in the artist title field. *proud face*<br /><br />For next week... since <b>Numrakua Manami's best album</b> is out on Apple MusicI'll listen to the whole thing (hopefully not at work) again and try to give asmany songs I can before we forget about her forever haha. Otherwise... I guessI'll try to give Humbreaders a listen again- I did say I needed a break stopasking me for new songs to listen <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay, I'm done. I have to update the "music libray" later. (GitHub Page, getit?) (link on top, just click to the top button) WE ARE, FIVE MORE DAYS TOANIMAL CROSSING NEW HORIZONS thank goodness I've got my time off from work readyso I can- Then again I probably won't play the moment it's out like most peoplemainly because it'll look weird in time as I found out that after the first daywhich is tutorial you will start in a bad time. And 11PM Singapore time mightnot be a good time to start chopping down trees haha. So, according to onlinesources on start time, I'll just run the update the moment it's out and then NOTPLAY (I know, I'm a madman), go sleep, and start Friday refreshed and ready tofly to that unnamed island. Until next time... I'm regretting to name my island"Lion City" as a joke to my country and setting the island theme song thenational anthem (lol) so I'll think of something else by then haha bye<br /><br />P.S. Is it just me or is the weather so hot these days? Or maybe I'm recoveringfrom a weak immune system usually at this time of year I'll be snuggling into ablanket lol<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
