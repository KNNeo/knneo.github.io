And that's how a fall from the bicycle will ruinyour weekend. Well, I ruined it for myself so whatever haha<br /><br />As you can see above (I promise no injury gore shots so don't go mature ratingthis blog), I have a scraped knee so it hurts to walk, so I'm staying at homeall day to... not watch Anime apparently the mom brought her friends over to thehome. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I don't know. My family issues are difficult. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's dothis before they come back for Round 2 lol ah shit they're back haha<br /><br />[12 more days to Animal Crossing New Horizons HELL YEAH haha I need to come upwith a town name that is dumb but isn't lol FYI I named by first character inStardew Valley "Jerk" lmao. Oh don't worry I recently named my Japanese HarvestMoon remake farm "Grandpa's Farm Farm" haha they didn't warn me when theyappended the last word]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion08">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Doing so is also on consideration for you" Okay Jeeves-san, where do they    live now? They haven't even worked yet bro you making them rich kids    homeless now? lol  </div></blockquote>In this new episode of "Family Matters"... lol okay again, I didn't expect todrop into this fiasco where the mother only appears as an illusion or in aflashback haha. In this new episode though (#HatenaIllusion08), we have a bunchof people who just don't like how our main characters are living now. Hmm...dear author do you even have a backup plan for when they fail in life? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>Okay, hopefully so because things aren't looking that great on any of them now.But it would seem we have something to look forward to here, and it's all takingshape, unlike Yumemi-chan's skills in making Artifacts BOOM GOT HER haha. (AlsoTIL you can just destroy an Artifact by physically destroying it lol) Firstly,why Mariah-san can do whatever she wants with the Hoshisato family. Becauseeveryone knew what happened. How though? And why the big secret though? For notknowing the answer to any of those, it seems like we can't even progress becausewe really have no idea about why any of them can never tell the kids whatactually happened in the actual home. Maybe the mother was truly kidnapped atthe old home of the grandmother. We don't know. What we do know is, all of themaround the house, including Mamoru, Jeeves and Ema-san included, probably can'tdo anything about it. I mean, if they can save the woman this will all be over.Or if they did then someoene's gonna die so thank goodness for not that endinghaha. So, despite all these, the kids are kind of fooling around and findingways to overpower Mariah to no effect and almost destroying the house, whichcontinues to power her reasons for them not being able to stay in the mansiondue to their lack of power. Problem is again, even if they can't control, thenwhy chase them out? They not family? Or must people be skilled in order to livein such a mansion? (Maybe because it's the mother that has been protecting themthis whole time but you're actually supposed to be skilled to live inside amansion of the family?) Sometimes, this series don't make much sense, but Ithink we might have an idea in the second half. In a couple of flashbacks fromEma-san, we can see that she, along with Jeeves-san, have been around for thefamily serving the Hoshisato family for a while, and since the kids not beingskilled in their Artifacts is a problem, then I guess the solution is to teachthem. Kind of like how in "BLEACH" Ichigo doesn't know sh*t and he gets into acrash course and saved the world within a couple of months. So, Ema chose to askJeeves for help to train them, for now specifically Hatena. How though? Turnsout, Jeeves is part of the mansion, and being an Artifact himself, probablyfought more battles than most of the generals in recent history lol. But sadlyhaving embed the powers from the family, he can't really fight too long. Youknow, OP issues lol but hey, Hatena will be dead by the time he's done with herso whatever haha. Okay, how it all come to this, you may ask? But I would arguethat it's because everyone is hiding something. From Mariah about what happenedto the family specifically that made anyone have such an authority to influencethe mansion itself, to even Mamoru agreeing to the matter and technicallyavoiding the issue as he sees Gregory... everyone is hiding the truth from them.And us viewers too, in retrospect. Which is probably what is pissing me offright now; most action shows should've already dropped a hint episodes ago; justlook at "Hanako-kun" below. What is more irritating though, is how everyone isreacting to this. As of now or up till now, it has always been Mariah VS thekids, and that's just hard to watch. Which is why Hatena kept mentioning why isit just them and her, because it's as if the rest aren't involved. But I guesswith the end of this episode and some resolve of Ema-san wanting to endHatena-chan (lol) (I meant her suffering), we might see some progress. Hey, Iknow this series may not have an ending, but please tell me Maeves-san is okay,please. On top of all these of course, we hardly know about Artifacts. We knowthey can go berserk if handled badly, we know they can be used in basic functionby anyone which will probably explain how that fat b*tch be heating Hatena-chanup a couple of episodes ago lol, and it really seems like it's not that safe,but is it though? Why is this show making reality checks so real I need to stopthinking about magic girl Anime and not compare how great those are with respectto this haha. All in all, I want to see stuff happen, whether it's fighting orplot development with this shitty drawing because I'm getting bored. Even thatswimming pool part won't get me hard now. Come on Anime; I know you have a trickup your sleeve; Please use it sooner than later before I leave like Gregory didso wait Makoto did not show him anything?? Ugh this show man...<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nkw-nenGaWE/XmSuYaLzyYI/AAAAAAAA5og/Y68ACKz9Yrc5KHgkv-xKvLM2YYbdbx0hACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion08_jeeves5.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Okay combat Jeeves-san is cool, I'll give you that          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lMO_FVaKD6Q/XmSuYC1vv7I/AAAAAAAA5oc/CB0bJ25ow2cZ5fpCzeMN98uLgIoPLZ3jACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion08_yumemi5.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Yumemi-chan be MVP because she is so much cuter compared to Hatena I            mean JUST LOOK AT THIS hehe          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Hey she the same as us. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Imean, you know you are a daikon, right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay jokes about<a href="https://jisho.org/search/raburi-" target="_blank">lovely</a> Yashiroaside, let's talk about this new episode. In this new episode (#HanakoKun09)woah are we introduced to the bad guys real quick. I mean, if Yashiro isn't that<strike>dunb</strike> dumb enough (sorry, dumb typo) to get ambushed by theother two, who knows what worse things might happen to our girl haha. And we'reinvited to a tea party too? Come on, we girls know that in a tea party you NEVERstop eating and drinking and talking lol ask how Cinderella's stepsisters cameabout haha. So yeah, Yashiro got... kidnapped, is the intro to this episode.Hey, it's all well planned, what can I say? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Firstly, someone fromanother class is finding her. I mean, a male student?? What?? Is this analternate world of Yashiro Nene where she gets laid- Yeah, just saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>The guy is Natsuhiko, and as we have seen him from last episode... ignoring thefact that he might be an apparition himself, he's a senpai in the school. Heasks Yashiro out (yeah right), she follows him (yeah, no really) and... she getssplashed with a bucket of water. Yeah, what did I tell you? It may be tooelaborate a plot considering how the bad guys also didn't do much to her, butyeah, she got baited by them real fast here. Well, Sakura-chan didn't intendthis to happen, but hey, a climatic entry doesn't hurt right? *looks at author*So, she ended up becoming a fish, as we have known if half-human her comes intocontact with water. Well, a lot of water. It's easier to transport her this way,I guess? Sadly, it's destination is to a Boundary. A Boundary, where the badguys are at. Sakura-chan introduces herself to be a senpai in this school andcurrently in a contract of what seems to be evil Hanako and I'm still not wrong,because now we know it's a twin. So yes, Amane and Tsukasa are twins. Soaccording to this, we can already deduce from the stuff I said last week on whatmight happen. But instead, we get the long story drawn since Yashiro ended upenjoying the tea party and complaining the sh*t out of<strike>Hanako</strike> Amane which I'm sure Tsukasa already knows most of itbut we still don't know something. Don't be tricked too, everyone, for we stilldon't know the truth. Someone was murdered by another, remember. Still, half anhour later, Yashiro didn't really ask on it, and ended up trapped in the worldand being sent into another world between worlds, I guess? In her desperateeffort in praying Hanako to save her lol, I mean, it worked, to say the least.Hanako appears in a radio inside of that world between worlds, and instructs heron how to leave. Okay, this might be the episode already, so I hope you're readyfor some analysis. Firstly, acknowledgement of Hanako as Seven Wonder and howfast Yashiro came out of danger unscathed. Okay, she did get ambushed but otherthan that as she said, they were "nice" to her considering she is an innocentparty so good chances she won't die anyways (she is technically dead, by theway), but also how Natsuhiko understands what Hanako was talking about. So yeah,that is still plenty we don't understand. If Natsuhiko says this is playing fromSakura-chan or Tsukasa maybe, means it'll be over if they deal with Hanako? Oreventually they will be let out of the world between worlds? Then again, itdidn't take long for Hanako to save the maiden as long as she enters a fragmentof his past, it would seem. Funny to think that maybe Hanako has absolute powerof this school premises, which is why the "bad guys" had to resort to schemes totake Hanako down. As of now, I don't even know if they are anywhere close tofriend or foe. Tsukasa did turn a ghost into a monster-level apparition, andthen on the other hand did just not kill the girl. I mean, if we get rid of theassistant then it's easier to deal with the one guy, right? Next, we might getsome psychological fights incoming. Considering Yashiro knows nothing aboutHanako thus far even after all this flashback and stuff, her lack of knowledgeof the situation may get Hanako himself into trouble as he tries to deal withthe impending danger that is happening within the school, in case you need toremember what happened in a nutshell. Then begs the question, and sorry forsaying that this plot is better than Hatena Illusion lol: What is Sakura-chan'smotive here? Remember Hanako instructs Yashiro to work for him, well mainly asbait so that he can control the apparitions appearing within the school to someextent, like that love tree for example. If Sakura is doing the opposite andhelping as a broadcaster to make monsters in the school, then what is theirmotive? Destroying the school? I doubt so, but to just create chaos until Amanecan face his twin brother again? Maybe? I don't know. For now, let's follow andsee what happens, because we might get an answer soon, for the next episodehints at direct confrontation of the two Hanakos (lol) in a room of mirrors.Someone please explain to me what has happened so far, please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />[If you need a difference check on subtitles because I can listen to Japanesenow, Natsuhiko actually said "she won't die" as Tsukasa freaked fish Yashiro outbecause... she has mermaid scales, and the bond with her and Hanako makes herimmortal. Now you know subs are bullshi-]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VWSoSKjATbg/XmS71Erg2dI/AAAAAAAA5pA/EYTUCSm5VcIi92606IO_nLlP0G3nfX5RgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun09_game.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            LOL Yashiro even your idol game guy looks like Hanako still don't            admit you like this type?          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y9JhXZcvJV0/XmS7097WLXI/AAAAAAAA5o8/U4s6G3AsVTgDDlvYt2KPsbA5D2uMdv2LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun09_sakura2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW someone says I'm going out with some ugly f-          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

We go to Okinawa for the lab's training camp, but we know we don't wantto be seeing just science work in Okinawa. What are we, science-type nerds?<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But man, was this a good episode. Everything in essence about theseries is back with another hit, and it all went well. Yes, even that one guywho hit up on Himuro haha. Firstly, Yukimura sitting on a plane. I mean, is hedesperate or what, as he tries to do physical contact with Himuro on the planeie. saliva sampling but seriously, you can be more discrete. Did anyone teachhim that when he was a kid? You can be stealthy in everything you do in public,like collecting saliva, hugging, kissing, f**king... Well, you get the ideahaha. And Himuro desperately wants it too, so Yukimura you should have done it.Discretion is key, if you need someone to tell you that. Some would argue thatdoing things discrete is a fetish in itself. *winks* Amongst many missedopportunities, we see many more in this episode as the guys settle down in theirshort stay, and enjoyed the beach. Well, I mean, if enjoying is running lapsaround the ocean like the Prof then I guess, haha. And also, someone paid forthe high budget hotel, so thanks, poor author haha. But seriously, Yamamoto willmake a story in real life even if she has to make a 4P out of the others besidesthe main couple- MOVING ON!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And thus, we should give some credit to<strike>Yamamoto's hotel budget</strike> the main couple's interactions thisepisode (lol), as they try out ways to do some<a href="https://jisho.org/search/roshutsu" target="_blank">exposure</a> playhere (sorry watch too much porn liao my knowledge stretches through horizonshaha) including a private session behind the rocks. You know, where the REALrocks do things. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It... was hard for Yukimura. And I like how I amalready jumping the gun by saying you won't get too much besides Himuro's RACKhaha but yeah, he backed off, and in the eyes of everyone else, they startedthinking of ways to maximise "<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu"  target="_blank"  >skinship</a>", as they say. I'm not going to reference whatever kamasutra thing they mayhave talked about or Ibarada's craze for BL (lol please stop), but suffice it tosay nothing happened. Well, might still be enough material for Yamamoto thoughhaha. Embarrassment will make of good writing material anyways, to be honest.They played some watermelon splitting using complex planes (ugh) (yes, I knowyou can only know the angle from that; "x + iy" amirite?) and without insultinghow weak Yukimura is, uh, I mean, that reflector plate lol. And Yuuichi, (yep,that one guy that likes to hit on women specifically all the main girls in thisseries) who is also on the island, tried to chat up Himuro and Kanade to findout it's them again and ran haha, and went for Ibarada and got knocked out byTorasuke, haha. I mean, you will never win that poor fellow in "SeitokaiYakuindomo" lmao (you know who I'm referring to, thanks to the<strike>sensei</strike> despertae f**k lmao), but still, he's just out of luck.Going to Torasuke, I still don't get why Ibarada still can't get any realemotions out of her with regards to Torasuke being like, you know, manly to herin danger. I mean, it's not really danger even if Yuuichi grabs her hand, butyou know, gotta blame someone, Schrodinger. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, Ibarada, you noappreciation for this idiot to any extent? He might be your childhood friend andyou have shifted on him all his life but somehow, at this point I would expectsome appreciation, but her tears so far is just shed because she laughed toohard lol. Oh well, I guess not in this Anime. All in all, thank goodness theydidn't do nothing but experiments but I think Yamamoto may have gotten hermoney's worth out of this trip haha I hope your next work sells which is thisseries maybe lmao. Next episode though, is where we get to see presentations?Ugh, I thought I can get out of this outside work but to be honest? It has beensome time since I saw one (don't jinx it) (haha), so if I need to pick whosework is better Kanade-chan can just stand there and I'll give her full markshaha dear other Profs go easy on her, yes? Torasuke you can beat him up haha Iwished my FYP presentation was in Okinawa lmao bye<br />[Since they are so many long shots I'll do a couple]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="180"              data-original-width="320"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i1dcp1-bxN8/XmT4kVEksjI/AAAAAAAA5pk/vow-81Wtpq0A2uv6aW8ZIxqIXrDYoFMuwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi09_nodding.gif"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is so cute I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="626"              data-original-width="1600"              height="155"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-COtziZTrGig/XmT46Aki8ZI/AAAAAAAA5pw/C-uH9D4kUJMJPurtLlxRueol67QUcFrVwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/rikekoi09_watching.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="400"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When your friends come to visit your new home and you two are alone            and you forgot to lock the door lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Okay maybe you're not    Kotoko-chan level yet haha  </div></blockquote>This is as intense of a fight you will see in this series ever, so hold on toyour seats, everyone. Saki-san being commentator is better than any sports gameimo haha. In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri09) we are set to take down SteelLady Nanase, or how she has been named after (Rikka-san you piece of-), wefinally get into the debate which will hopefully settle this once and for all.Well, almost. Kotoko-chan will try though, whatever it takes. She's got a longnight to play this out, and so is everyone else, so let's see how far we can go.Firstly, Kotoko-chan talks about pushing responsibility to a virtual killer. Wehave talked about this before in past episodes so go watch those, but suffice itto say we have to make this a murder, and not a ghost who haunts and killspeople like what many have believed. Riding on Tereda's death (RIP bro),Kotoko-chan used his case to show that there needs to be someone smarter insteadof stronger than Terada in order to take him down, and this requires much effortin the back end. But maybe talking about how a murder takes this much setup justto get rid of him the same way a ghost <i>might</i> be doing to kill someone maybe a bit of a stretch (sorry Kotoko-chan I'm not on your side in the forums nowlol), so yeah as much as this doesn't make much sense, it still kind of works inher favour since again, all we need is enough people to think it's right. Andafter a good amount of explaining (shoutout to the one guy who said TL:DR;haha), she managed to convince people that Terada might be killed by someone whopossesses strong feelings for the detective and wants to kill him over probablysomething superficial like, he got a girlfriend and it's not her or somethinglol. So to be honest, Kotoko-chan is explaining past events as humane as shecan, as a Lord of the supernatural. And in retrospect, she chose a feasiblekiller to convince all, a woman, to kill him with wit instead of force since weknow Terada-san is a Judo expert himself. Reflexes though? Hey, who knows? It'sa dark night at an abandoned gas station. Also, if you think she is going tomake Saki-san the scapegoat you are not alone because Saki-san thinks that too.With association to someone who is close to him preferrably at work and knows alot of his behaviour and movements, Saki-san sounds like the perfect person topoint blame at this point, so yeah if I were here I'll freakout too lol we knowgirl it's not you. Also, it won't be you because Kotoko-chan can't hold this liefor too long either. Because now, it's answering questions about this lie.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Kotoko then now has to hold on her stand by trying to go around themany loopholes many may have found about this "murder" and rather believingfiction (what a bunch of idiots haha) that a ghost killed someone which sorryfor saying this, can't even happen in the first place. Okay, this is Anime soI'll forgive you if you think otherwise. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Which brings us to the mainquestion with respect to what we know about the only two survivors of theSakuranogawa experiment that, Rikka-san is also manipulating this discussionbehind the scenes, dying time and again (remember last week's GIF? haha sorry)if needed to change the tides slightly to her favour and that'll bring Kotokoback to square one. Because if you see, let's say politics now is left wing, andsomeone said a lot of left wing stuff to make people wanna vote right wing, whatdo you think the eventual results would be? Then, all it takes is for Kuro-santo also take the extreme side of the future polar opposite to Rikka-san's, andthey'll be done. Problem is, it's not working as expected, and that might stillbe a problem after what we have seen so far. All in all... they're going to onesolution per episode, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh okay at least we get an episode discountwe presenting two more next episode. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Cya guys next week haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9tTw-3ZU2IY/XmUDL4wgXEI/AAAAAAAA5qA/AZkPSCg8kbc6EkZPD0uzHWjK8mjeFXVaACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri09_killer.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Looks a lot like Saki-san, isn't it?<br />        Haha I mean, they could've given her long hair but      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>[Don't ask for postscripts it's either intense action or intense mystery talk Ican't make a joke on that okay besides Saki-san being the culprit haha that wasa good one]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Well, this is probably one of two weeks we'll get something out of this month,so let's talk all about it, I guess. Man, the week after next is going to berough as in I'm going to play Animal Crossing all weekend haha. Okay, songs.Firstly, <b>SID's new single</b> is up for review but I haven't given the onlineorder yet mostly because of the coronavirus thing so it's only going to delay somight as well (also I blew my budget last month so I gotta), but also I'mthinking <b>whether to give Jibaku Shounen Band's single</b> ie. "Hanako-kun"Opening a thumbs up because it's also a one-track single. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'll thinkabout the latter for a while more. Meanwhile, <b>ClariS' new single</b>&nbsp;wasdisappointing to say the least, but I got a lot out of<b>KANA-BOON's best album despite the new single</b>'s lack of punch, so I'lladd a couple more songs to my list. Well, songs performed by when they were afour-piece. Bassist why<br /><br />Talking about the Internet news first so I can have a grasp on what to listen tonext week, let's talk Twitter first. Because<b>Touyama Nao's new single is up on streaming</b> including Apple Music, we canalso infer that Numakura Manami's best album which released a month ago willalso go through this sequence, so I'll probably listen to it again after that itout; I've shortlisted a couple of songs anyways.<b>Asakura Momo's new music video preview</b> on YouTube is lovely but man did Ihave a different image of it based on the style and melody of the song (but heyI'm not he director who gets paid), <b>miwa's new song</b> is out on streamingbut not like I'm giving it a listen just yet,<b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's 2nd major album</b> is out next month in April so hypefever, <b>SCANDAL released a new music video</b> featuring the one emotionalsong I gave in their latest album which is great because it is,<b>Waki Azumi is releasing her 2nd single</b> in May and from the firstimpression of one of the songs in this again double A-side single it's... notgoing to top the first haha, and Anime "Kaguya-sama" is starting their 2ndseason in the upcoming season with a <b>Kaguya character song</b>? It's notmipressive even considering Koga Aoi who voices the girl just won an award forthis role and technically sang in an Anime-based band in "Tenshi no 3P", so...oh well I'm not giving anyways also please tell me Koko-chan will have acharacter song too that Fujiwara has so much chest she can sing a good song evenholding her breath amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span><br /><br />With this, so next week yes <b>Numakura Manami's best album</b> is under reviewonce again after I skimmed through it last month which I would admit is my faultwith my mood at work and all the other singles around (I mean, there's FuchigamiMai for valentine right?), and also talking about stuff releasing next weekactually, is <b>TrySail's new single</b>. Let's hope the B-side is good whenpeople write for Anime most of the time it sucks I don't know why and onlysometimes Naruto gets the best theme songs from like Scenarioart. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Oh wellnever mind I can only reminisce now to be honest<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Well, I guess I'm finally done. Sorry to anyone who cares like those guys in theSteel Lady Nanase's forums about this late of a post on Sunday night, but yeah Itook a while to start watching because my mom had her friends over and... Ithink our house is getting a renovation without anyone's approval besidesherself. Oh well, she's a co-owner anyways, whatever. She can do whatever shewants just DON'T TOUCH MY CDS AND PHOTOBOOKS UNDERSTAND!!?? Haha she saidsomeone's popping by to detach the aircon which resides above my shelves thoughso... DON'T YOU DARE haha cya guys next week and remember: Don't fall off yourbike just because you are pissed off at kids failing at cycling taught by theirmaid. Haha I htink that's how I fell I don't remember lol also just stay at homeno reason to come out to get virus<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
