So again, if you don't see images here or if they arenot from the show but from the game it's not your browser rendering problem(lmao), but also because I'm getting my desk top (as in table top, get it?)changed today instead of yesterday because of some newbie (hey, I get you but),so... expect super haphazard reviews this week haha THANK GOODNESS there aren'tany new songs to listen I may not be for the rest of the week even if there arehaha<br /><br />Let's start then. I'll try to focus on this instead of thinking of when my newvillagers are coming lol okay let's<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I'm thinking of a finishing move... It came up last night when I was out of    the bath" Wow Hatena-chan I don't know what it is but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>So it's going to be three episodes of Hatena failing? I'll look forward to thathaha. In this new episode (#HatenaIllusion10) somehow Gregory knows of the magicvillage and its people, so he presents them with a message from that old woman:get these three Artifacts back and yo mama will be released. Sure, the guys aregoing to jump on this, but if you think this is another trip of that fat womanbeing the final boss then think again. Because in this episode, we're gettinginto action. It's an order from the old woman ie. the grandmother from thevillage. It's literally seeing forth a challenge. So, since we all care aboutthe <i>real</i> MVP of the series Maeves-san (haha not true), everyone we knowso far is going to help. So, the objective to end the series so far is to obtainthree lost Artifacts. I'm not going to name them because why would I, but one ofthem is tasked to Mamoru, who will disguise his magic show overseas so that thekids can go take it back. But before we get to the good part, I really thoughtthere will be evil in this one, but so far so good. I mean, everyone is so good,the kids with the father left for Australia. So... no one is taking care of thehouse now? Okay. The bad guys are coming in though, just so you know,Jeeves-san. Surprisingly, they were all prepared. A group of people are ready toinfiltrate the mansion while the family members were away (ikr Mariah-sandoesn't count haha) (okay Jeeves-san cares about her so I'll take it), so theones left ie. secondary characters, prepare for a good fight. Firstly, Mariah'sinfiltration of a research lab for a hidden Artifact and...? Turns out, thesebad guys are researching on how to create Artifacts without the use of magic.So, easy solution, just blow them up into pieces. Hey, there's a familytradition to protect, you know. And that went real well. The second requires alittle more work since partially they don't know where it is. So, cue MichelleLin, obviously Mariah in disguise leaking info of the Hoshisato family leavingthe mansion empty (obviously not knowing the mansion ITSELF is an Artifact),telling it off to the bunch about infiltrating it for goodies, and they did.Interestingly, Hoshinozawa with her boss-like skills took down normal peopleequivalent to an army of soldiers easily, and the magic stuff was left to Jeevesto clear up. Excuse me, not the old man, <i>cool</i> Jeeves. Really, DragonballZ needs to re-consider their character design this guy is too OP he may be morethan 9000 lmao. While the guys are kept busy being "entertained" at the mansion,the big guys sat down with tea but is interrupted by Kikyouin's father, who alsohas an Artifact in his possession. He tells the bad guys their men are prettymuch screwed right now, and asks for the location of one of the three Artifactsto save Maeves-san. And since his Artifact is a pair of glasses who can readminds... well I mean, that sure is easy, isn't it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, it'smagic-powered, what can I say? Also, if you think he's not leaving there alive,he's not because those guys are leaving first... for the afterlife. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>Hey, this is as cool as it gets, guys. Appreciate it while it lasts. I'm soakingit in like a sponge though, really wanted this level of action for some time,really. Kikyouin (the daughter) however, gets to stay at home out of dangersince if you would remember she can't even get an Artifact to call its namethrough the any number of random house "intrusions" she did over the years lol.For next episode.. impress me, Anime. We're just getting started, aren't we? Iknow, that "smile stick" thing is going to make all this action so uncool realsoon haha is that what the grandmother was about keeping the family image alive?The old woman is this series' director? lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f6Zj0JJrOjo/XncBtX1hTJI/AAAAAAAA57w/SGrRPGZHizMTwTniG9rbwI3GdL9TeaOtwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion10_car.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            These animation drawings are so shitty I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jWHZQWrNgts/XncBsxUjWcI/AAAAAAAA57s/RiYQ1v7ln3YaXbUIWCJah_fu3Pla7a0wgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion10_mariah3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Did Mariah just blink to an old man?

Not like Mitsuba doesn't deserve more episodes ofhimself, but I feel like at this point we should've known the truth by now,whatever it is. Instead, we are taken further deep into the abyss, never to beknown of the truth. Hey, we got close last week. Not this week though. Wecontinue with the story of the Third of the Seven Wonders, who, unfortunately,sacrificed itself since Tsukasa took care of him real quick, which already makesyou wonder if Hanako even has such levels of power considering the lack ofdirect confrontation so far. Besides, it doesn't even happen; Tsukasa just hugsthe shit out of his twin brother on contact. Still, many questions we<i>still</i> can't figure out still exist, and we're <i>still</i> stuck withMitsuba's lack of reason in many cases than other. Story first, I guess.Firstly, Hanako needs to get into that Boundary, and you know, destroy thatYorishiro so they can't use their powers anyhow and of course, be manipulated byrumours and such. So, he and Kou enlist the help of... that fox and spider haha.So knowledge lessons, people. Suffice it to say that each Seven Wonder controlsan aspect within the school, with the spider on memories (with the library), andthe fox on space. And even with the Yorishiro broken, that doesn't mean theBoundary is off limits no more. So, let's just make Tsuchigomori's words easy tounderstand: it's like getting into the forum site without authentication.Breaking the Yorishiro is just revoking admin permission, doesn't mean cannot goin. Besides, the authentication is here, it's Hanako-kun himself. So itshouldn't be a problem. Centering around this episode though, is the realproblem as we all struggle to see how that idiot Kou would still think Mitsubais human in any way. According to Tsukasa, Mitsuba was still "alive" as anapparation because he took what was left of him after the last time he was seen(I don't know what being dead is after death but) to.... I guess take part ofhis soul and give him a vessel, if any spirit-based shows have taught me? Sureis creepy, since I mean Tsukasa just ripped out the heart of a Seven Wonder topower this Mitsuba, it still is far far away from the ghost Mitsuba we haveknown since we first met him. But still, Kou still keeps asking him out like aman would to a girl (lol) and hopes to be friends with him again? Man, what'syour f**king problem. Tsukasa, meanwhile, is making use of Mitsuba's fear ofknives (lol Hanako) to start attacking the trio in defence including the onedefenceless Yashiro who can be seen... well she isn't dead yet thank goodness,but all in all it was a meaningless fight. Really, Tsukasa didn't even doanything. That might be the point too, because he was experimenting. And becausehe reasons like a kid, it's hard to even understand whatever this antagonist isthinking. Really, motive and all, we have no idea what is happening. This mightbe a good time to say why I don't like the plot of the series because we haveonly one episode left to go and we're still left with questions that the Animedoesn't intend to answer. It's like me running away from my life problems, and Idon't like it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next episode though, I really wish something will getclarified as to how even Hanako can NEVER, EVER, get out of his mind to get ridof his twin brother AGAIN God he's so irritating lol I want to see a reasonableending, Anime. Please make it happen. Cya guys next week.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vpmjqyq8n8s/XncN2wx7mpI/AAAAAAAA58Y/1UiSVi4cF3I7HxMjdVhBxnP1G6mdlWhHgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun11_yashiro.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The cutest stuff this episode lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DQrqFdthZoA/XncN3pWjbAI/AAAAAAAA58c/hyqSMOKqFgcA7LF-O3485SRWgzBPaxkYgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun11_fox1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The cutest stuff this episode lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. *Tsukasa digs a heart out of the Seven Wonder* Man, really regrettedwatching this series I thought this was about cute girls haha<br />P.P.S.

Haha Kanade-chan with    the insults please me too hehe  </div></blockquote>I know, Himuro. This guy needs to do a jail sentence for what he did. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>In this new episode (#RikeKoi11) the two are quarrelling. Hey, welcome to themost realistic episode of ALL TIME lmao I mean, science can't really explainthis well too, huh. Hey also, GREAT episode to teach you guys to practice socialdistancing for the coronavirus these two are doing pretty well thus far.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, story. Story goes that... Himuro may have broke for getting lessphysical contact recently (it's like drugs but with a man) (haha), and kind ofranted it out on Yukimura so I have just saved you half an hour of watching thisepisode lol, but yeah, suffice it to say things went wrong. Kanade-chan isprobably not at fault considering Himuro threw everything that went wrong so farin the experiments... yeah Yukimura it's all your fault. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just as a jokethough, but you get the idea. Firstly, how it happened. Well, some from lastepisode, but more from this one. It's mostly (I'm not going to pull out a piechart, I promise) Himuro getting agitated about her relationship with Yukimuraand his actions towards other girls without much thought... that's calledjealousy, everyone. Nope, never felt that before since I don't have one.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still, someone got into trouble, Yukimura was still telling the facts,but you know, most facts many people would not want to hear. Hey, no one said hehas to suck up to people, but in this case bro? You may have to. Following theslap and the breakout (lol), of course the two have ruined the trip for the restof them (not for Ibarada she's still playing Animal Crossing New Leaf on her 3DShaha GO AWAY) (she's probably playing some BL game though lol), so yeah, theysort of tried to make it up. Firstly, from Himuro. Good thing is, we know shebrought it upon herself, her anger. Probably from past events (remember she gotleft out every damn time in the experiments since they were here?), and possiblyfrom the presentation but I don't think so already since they proved it lol, butyeah, she got ahead of herself real fast. Not like Yukimura was someone withgreat EQ so reasoning won't help here anyways, so... I hope you got yourconfession letter ready bro she'll only accept that as an apology haha. Still,we get to see a little more into Himuro's past, of her getting bullied (<span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>),of her not understanding love (I don't too to be honest), and her screwing suchthings up, to be honest. Okay, she didn't screw that up Yamamoto did it for herupcoming novel bestseller lmao way to keep the train wreck going, author. Butshe tried to hold it up altogether, and to apologise to Yukimura, to the extentof even getting him a gift. Now that is called sincerity. Yukimura, you betterprove to us you can even do half of what a man can do without being science-typeor else you are going down on the ikemen ranking for Anime characters haha. (Isthere such a thing? Haha let me check) All in all a great episode to build up tothe end of the series, I've enjoyed even these sad scenes so far, and man is itgoing to end well next week. Hey, this is as accurate they can get to areconciliation don't shit on them okay?

Hey,human evil is on the uprising, people, do be aware. I'm not talking about thepandemic by the way haha. In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri11) we finally reachthe ultimate conclusion to this big, big... mystery. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, conspiracy,more like. All done by one person. All done by... you guessed it, Nanase Karin.Wait, what? Okay, just a head's up, it's still Rikka-san, but yeah, that isKotoko-chan's last solution. She says, Nanase is the killer of herself. Well,sort of herself. It's an accumulation of the solutions she presented so far, andthis is the finishing blow. So yeah, she killed herself. Which also means,someone sacrificed for it. She found a scapegoat. Again, this is all fiction andmostly a lie, so remember that, for starters. So, who was it killed by a steelbeam? It doesn't matter. How it happened? It doesn't matter. What we do knowabout Rikka-san's plan to overtake the world by storm through rumour andchanging the future is that, she cannot prove herself. She cannot justify heractions. You think anyone will believe there's Steel Lady Nanase more than ifRikka-san is trying to test out youkai powers to rule the world potentially?Yeah, more likely so now because that rumour is dying down, and quickly.Firstly, Kotoko told another story. How all this was made up, and how Nanasestill got away with all the crimes she did thus far, killing a scapegoat andTerada, for starters. Then, she made sure people would deduce the truththemselves. Well, "truth". The point that her first three solutions would notwork doesn't matter, because it was meant to trigger interest in Nanase's death.But if we do the 360 and tell you that she planned all of this herself, all thesolutions before would make sense, at least at its base. For example, ifplanning took time, it's always the best deduction that it's someone who did itto herself, in this case, so that she can put it all according to plan. Well,coincidences here do count but you know, we're just writing fiction we don'thave to explain chance. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, Nanse then made sure she keptherself clean, and started a new life as the other woman who died in her place.Perfect. Now no one will know. Makes sense now, doesn't it? And Kotoko gave thefinal blow by saying: Nanase is keeping the death alive so she can live her ownlife. Considering her life till then was such a scoop, it's easy to put thatsite up and make people believe she is still alive while she's away from thisscrewed up world to live the rest of her life without anyone knowing. Dramatic,cliche, weird, maybe it makes no sense, but this is a solution to a mysteryRikka-san cannot refute. Kotoko then points the finger to Rikka-san and tellsher to prove that she is not Nanase Karin. Boy, is that going to be tough.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So there you have it. A wonderful conclusion to an otherwise dialogueheavy series, I would argue. But goddamn, was this quite a roller coaster ride.But yeah, that's it. They did it. Kuro-san almost went real close to dead deadbut you know, Kotoko pulled him back up. Again, he is immortal so it doesn'tmatter, but it's good to stop Rikka-san at her feet, literally. Man, is thissatisfying. I'm like those guys at the forums now feeling satisfied of knowingthe "truth" behind Nanase Karin's murder and whatever rumours about her thatwill die in a week lol. No literally, because we're at the end of this seriesalready. Yeah. I guess it's a wrap up, hopefully we get to see<strike>Nanase Karin</strike> Rikka-san in person too, but hey, no one said itmust be facts to make sure this works. We're not science-type anyways lol *looksat RikeKoi* The point is, because Kotoko is the "God of Wisdom", that she has totake such chances to otherwise explain stuff that would convince people tobelieve, in order to protect the spiritual world from falling apart. You know,in this case, a youkai monster holding a steel beam with a huge rack goingaround killing anything in her way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Please give me more romance andjealousy stuff next week to end it up haha bye<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vm62gwDD_Eg/XnckgEAz4RI/AAAAAAAA59g/cTYICMzJlmYHp9gErvEqWM8kRO2iUpmRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri11_couple1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Never thought I'll say this, but who's the immortal now, genius?            haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kfNrgtNK5LI/Xnckf0vXSLI/AAAAAAAA59c/wgI7740VcWsXrb-GaNSEznjAWEjV8SWFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri11_kuro2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Can we start a rumour of how "Steel Man Kuro" came about?

To give a quick update because someone is killing himself forlistening to me talk about Animal Crossing New Horizons already, I got lost inthe "tutorial" for Day 1 because it lacked direction which of course promotesfreedom, Day 2 was great because I get to leave the island to explore others butconstruction is such a drag, and Day 3 which is today... let's hope newvillagers come tomorrow haha. Still WAAAY better progress than when I decided toreplace by desk top and that DAMN F**KING GUY DOESN'T COME- I don't want to callcustomer service. Customer service is tiring I hate working as it and I hatebeing on the other end too, doesn't make me happier anyways. Cya guys next weekthen, and until next time... let's hope they appear today.
