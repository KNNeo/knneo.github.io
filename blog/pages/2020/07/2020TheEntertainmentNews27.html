Wow, was NakiNeko a good movie.&nbsp;<br />
<br />No really, I don't know what to say. I think we really need to watch these
types of animation movies once in a while. To get moved, to cry (lol), and to
love again. My life is so mundane I need something else other than buying stuff
to keep me moving haha. Talking about buying stuff... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay I'll leave the "Phase 3" talk in another post, because I put a heck a lot
  more into what I mentioned previously, if you don't mind. I won't mind so
  whatever haha let's start
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  As you can see above, instead of manga I opted for an anime movie, and... I
  loved it. Really good. I could watch more of these and be a lovesick f**k or
  until I get laid which the latter might be harder to happen so... my emotions
  are in your hands, Anime industry lol<br />

  So yeah, this took a while for those budding bloggers. But they finally got
  around to it, so let's see what I have to say about the list. As usual, those
  with air dates represent what I intend to watch:
  <div>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        F**K YOU ALL SEQUELS: I'm not in the mood for that right now. Besides,
        where is Attack on Titan Final Season? Haha
      </li>
      <li>
        I've heard things about&nbsp;<b>Appare-Ranman!</b> and about how, of
        course, Yuuki Aoi is main again, but that's not the issue since it's
        Anime original they don't reveal too much and from PVs it's like an
        ancient cross-continent race. Okay, if that's interesting to you help
        yourself haha they trying out steampunk or what? lol
      </li>
      <li>
        If you think I'm watching an Anime about girls fishing you've got
        another thing coming haha
      </li>
      <li>
        I thought <b>Gibiate</b> was cool until they threw me the action AND
        THEN the apocalypse. The latter is not appealing to me at all. Reminds
        me of BLEACH though, the main guy. Not going to power me to watch one
        episode of this, I'm afraid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Deca-Dance</b> looks cool but it's Sci-Fi and it's not cooler than
        "Fractale" so no thanks haha also Anime original so they are just
        testing me again so nope
      </li>
      <li>
        Ah, this. <b>GREAT PRETENDER [premiers July 8th 2020]</b> reminds me of
        Anime "ACCA" but less cool (lol) since there aren't idiots in the latter
        and this upcoming show that I will give a chance has some idiots.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Jokes aside because this one from first impressions has many, I
        think I can forgive the deception upon deception (not inception btw)
        against bad guys and even among themselves because I don't have to do
        the thinking. Makes me smarter already by comparison haha might give
        this an episode if you haven't watched exclusively on Netflix lol
      </li>
      <li>
        And as mentioned, I will be watching two shows that I have already
        confirmed since last season lol, and they are&nbsp;<b
          >Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! [premiers July 10th 2020]</b
        >
        not because of the rack but because of Oozora Naomi who voices the girl
        and it's just about going outside which I will need convincing again
        after the pandemic lol;
      </li>
      <li>
        And also, <b>Kanojo, Okarishimasu [premiers July 10th 2020]</b> because
        I'm as sad as the main guy even though I don't have a breakup with a
        girlfriend because I don't have any (BOOM GOT ME) (you're gonna hear
        this a lot next week onwards), and the cast is stellar. No joke. With
        Ten-chan as main girl, Yuuki Aoi as your
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/motokano" target="_blank">motokano</a
        >, and Naobou so I can FINALLY get laid and maybe if I have time for
        Rieri... this is a harem I DO NOT want to miss haha hey I wished they
        had more guys
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      So, uh, next week, I guess? It's... jokes and romance again, it seems.
      Well, kind of my thing now that I have work stress this seems to be the
      way to balance things up? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

        IT lol is probably what the guy is thinking but
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    The girl's fascination of her guy's voice is like how much I like all my
    female seiyuus haha but man is she living the life. Okay, I walked in
    without much expectation (and Mina-chan was in it lol) so I decided to give
    it a try, now that we have a break from Anime series. But I swear "SWEET CAT
    LIFE" is going to be the reason I start raising a cat- Okay just joking I
    won't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As much as I don't have allergies of them, I don't really
    want it ending up to be someone who likes me but in cat form- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Okay, now that I've spoiled the living human out of you, let's talk about
    this movie (#NakiNeko). It's popular. It's on Netflix. The girl's desperate.
    Pity you're not the guy. Period. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay seriously though, this is
    literally it, that is, if you can take the story. Story goes, that there's a
    girl called Miyo. (Muge's the nickname people give her at school FYI) She's
    having a bad life in middle school. Her mother walked out on her, she has to
    accept the stepmother who keeps asking for her acceptance (like, seriously,
    bro) (haha), and she likes a guy who doesn't like her. Well, not really, but
    you know, it's not a yes. So yeah, Miyo-chan lives her life greeting her guy
    with a butt kick (man I want it too lol you think this works? Haha), getting
    bullied by classmates who think of her outward personality as weird (now
    that I saw the mother for a bit - the biological one - I can see why) (lol
    dont slap me), and lives on her dreadful life because.. she can transform
    into a cat. Now you may say, what's the perk in being a cat? Besides that
    Mask Seller who will tell you everything but good stuff lol (well for
    example, life expectancy is a bad thing here for cats, they can't live past
    a decade) (*did Google search* okay maybe two decades haha sorry but I don't
    know cats), in Miyo-chan's case since she has been given a mask from the
    mysterious big cat, she can transform into one. And at this point, cat her
    has already made friends with the guy she likes. And probably the house and
    the people in his grandfather's clay workshop for good measure haha. Too
    bad, as we know, human you is never going to be anything else people want
    because you as a being are not replaceable (more on that later), but that's
    the conundrum Miyo has now. She can choose to be a cat forever (or for as
    long as she can, more on that too later) and of course, be showered with
    love by Hinode the guy for as long as she can without dating him as a human,
    OR live her pathetic life never to be appreciated forever. Hey, if it's what
    Anime has taught to me for years Miyo will just live her human life all the
    way feeling happy on the outside and sad on the inside anyways, so why not
    the cat, amirite? Not so easy. In a change of events, Miyo defended her guy
    in front of classmates (while doing the cat pounce, as a human lol), and you
    know, got an interaction chance with him in return. (I mean, sharing
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bento" target="_blank">bento</a>?? Isn't
    that what couples do? lol) And maybe, just maybe, this has let Hinode to
    think. Like, Miyo-chan you're on the right track with your actions right now
    you guys will be together by graduation lol. Hey, prove me wrong, Anime.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, but the drop has to happen right? For her to think being a
    cat is great? So yeah, since she has been enjoying this for a while, she
    thought that being just a cat wasn't enough (you know, she wants to be loved
    ny the guy as a human), so she decided to do the thing many will do without
    having to transform into a cat: write a love letter. And she did, but of
    course, she passed it to him in front of the class, which might be a bad
    idea considering there are jerks in school who will just read out her letter
    in class so yeah... Hinode is trying to cover for you. No really, since you
    know the guy? He wouldn't just say it to your face like that. But to appease
    the class off rumours means hurting the girl, so that sucks. Then, there's
    the stepmother with the killing blow haha. Technically Miyo has been
    sneaking out every evening to be a cat, and her parents found out about it.
    Well, the mother did. Excuse me, stepmother. But yeah, it's an eventuality
    that she would be found out, and with her pushy attitude to want to talk to
    the stepdaughter... that's probably where Miyo-chan broke. Yeah I can see
    why, and I must say this is good enough premise to not be human. And so, as
    the Mask Seller anticipated, Miyo's human mask fell off (wow, just wow), and
    he took it away. We'll not talk about what's on his business end, but
    suffice it to say, that's it. "SWEET CAT LIFE" . Well, besides the lick your
    butt thing you're good!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And of course, we reach the other half of
    the story, to why she wants to return back to being human.

    Since technically she left home to become a cat, then (for now) human Miyo
    no longer exists. Eh, this is human term for "<a
      href="https://jisho.org/search/yukuefumei"
      target="_blank"
      >missing</a
    >", for you cats out there lol. And like every other Anime, if people are
    desperately finding you when you are missing, that is meaning to live as
    human. I mean, I probably have a worse life than Miyo-chan so I should
    become the cat amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nah, capitalism can keep me alive haha.
    Anyways, and also, to add on, that's where Hinode notices how important she
    is to him, even if all he did so far was just ignore the heck out of this
    girl who likes to butt him every morning lol. He decides to help Miyo's
    friend (sorry Mina-chan I only mentioned you until here) (oh yeah, Yoriko)
    search for the girl even if it's lesson time because... they all care about
    her. And it's not just only her. The family is looking for her too. Yes,
    even the stepmother. Yes, even the biological one. All of them. Which is
    surprising because Miyo-chan never saw this side of all of them before. To
    the friend who thought to never give up on her despite having done that in
    elementary school, to the mother to ditched the daughter and the father...
    everyone. I guess it's also this importance that made Miyo think things
    through about what it means to be human, and how pathetic that will be
    leaving all that and being a cat. And then, we have the second drop. Human
    Miyo is back! Wait, what? Yes, you heard me right; I didn't say cat Miyo is
    back to human, by the way. Then is the question: who is acting in her place?
    Remember the Mask Seller who picked up her human mask? The cat took it. No,
    I don't mean her. Remember there was a cat in the house? That cat. So yeah,
    the reversal, ladies and gentlemen. You would then argue that why would
    human Miyo be able to just come back without much care of everything and
    pretend to like a half-human life previously as a cat? Yeah but this one
    likes the stepmother. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well damn, Taro. What'cha gonna do now,
    Miyo-chan? Amongst all these, I hope at this point you would have noticed
    Miyo wanting to be human is a lot more than she would have asked for now,
    isn't it? If you were expecting an ending where those two souls switched
    back, you aren't that far ahead. So honest is on the ex-cat Kinako then. Not
    like everyone is mortally evil in this story so that's good news, because
    Kinako then realised how much she is to the stepmother (for reference let's
    just use that, and also her name) Kaoru when she started searching for the
    cat day and night because she thought the cat left the house and never
    returned. I mean, I wouldn't understand this since I'm not a cat but
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I can understand the human perspective, that's for sure. And as
    time passes, the transformation slowly turns both of them into their
    expected forms, making Miyo weaker to understanding human speech (I legit
    thought the audio had issues lol wtf Netflix) (haha) and behaving more like
    a cat. Well, besides the licking butt thing lmao I'm not into sc*t. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Anyways, in the end the guy Hinode was brought to the cat palace with the
    help of Kinako who also decide it was best to revert back to a cat, in
    search of cat Miyo with hopes to bring her back again. And there's the whole
    thing but we'll talk about production later, and they... I mean, if you get
    to go out with someone in middle school your life is great. Period. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  <div>
    Overall, it was a good lesson to learn. As you can see, production wise it's
    spectacular, I thought audio was an issue until I realised what happened lol
    (prolonged use of the cat mask makes you one step closer to being one) (or
    maybe I'm turning into a cat lmao), the premise of the story in general is
    pretty good. It was rather complete, it covered a lot of aspects of Miyo's
    life and even Hinode's to the finest of detail which I'm impressed, talking
    about teenage dreams and love and everything in between, even friendship as
    seen by Miyo's relationship with her bestie. I'm thrown away by Miyo's
    bubbly personality (even though we know of her true self), the Mask Seller's
    scheming looks even as a cat haha that was actually impressive, how I can
    recognise
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/22/Shinichiro_Miki" target="_blank"
      >the voice of Urahara Kisuke</a
    >
    in this movie (yes it's the wisest in the bunch of cats who saved all of
    them), how I didn't expect Yoriko the friend to be involved in the story so
    much (I guess it's because of talking about loved ones all of them are
    heavily involved) (hey I get more Mina-chan so that's good hehe), and
    lastly, how much the story ties in together. Not that I don't see logic
    flaws, but I would argue they did explain the story well enough for you to
    not doubt about everything else. Finally, this thing is a tearjerker. So
    prepare some tissues; you're gonna need it. And don't "Aoharu ka yo" me
    because this one isn't a joke. No really, it's a good one. I really enjoyed
    it. And now even as the theme songs are imprinting on me playing in loop
    until I finish writing this (lol), I didn't regret picking this one up. My
    initial impression was really, only from the one trailer which was a "meh"
    to me, but I think I miss these movies. It's not Studio Ghibli (they don't
    do these anymore) (Spirited Away, I mean), it doesn't have to go too far,
    but this is the kind of Anime I want to watch, to be honest. Well, not my
    age range now but I feel that I can watch this once in a while. A simple
    story about love, and what it means to be in it. Hey, I'll learn about that
    someday I guess. But first, can I borrow that cat mask? The girl I like from
    back when I was in middle school would love me so much since she's a fan of
    cats haha no seriously how much <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe I also need to transform into
    a cat to learn what it means to live life as a human. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I'm good haha
    no really I'm not faking it I'm not as good in doing that compared Miyo-chan
    lol

    did "Penguin Highway", the first of long animation movies in their belt now.
    Maybe I should also give that a try haha no really if you think transforming
    into a cat by somersaulting is dumb wait till you become a penguin lol. Yes,
    and that

    TL:DR; If you watch this and have the same tingling feeling for tears and "I
    want to know more lore about this alternate universe" and realised you're
    not watching a Studio Ghibli movie? Then you have enjoyed this. And I did.

    Oh yeah, I forgot about music. Thank goodness I watched that movie (above)
    on Sunday or else my music listening this week will be ruined lol.
    <b>SHE'S new album</b> is actually not bad, and besides the topic songs they
    have revealed in music videos so far I have also given a couple more new
    ones. Hopefully I'll <strike>get used to</strike> like them and put them on
    the list haha. And of course,
    <b>yorushika's new songs for Anime "NakiNeko"</b> aren't that bad at all,
    and of the three theme songs two are going to be in their upcoming album end
    of July (I have a feeling the ending theme is reserved for the Anime itself
    and never to be released; it has happened before trust me), so I'll wait
    until then to give a different impression. Meanwhile, the rest of their
    catalogue isn't too bad, so I'll check them out next week or something since
    this week's about to end.&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    On news from Twitter and beyond, didn't know
    <b>VELTPUNCH released the rest of their music videos</b> officially on
    YouTube now so I have liked the wrong videos for more than a decade (sorry
    guys!), I did just drop by <b>fumika's LINE LIVE</b> for a bit after a nap
    (lol) and I heard her play a song with her ukelele,
    <b>SPECIAL OTHERS released another studio live</b> video which is the last
    of the series I think according to online sources and it's one I gave from
    their latest album so that's top, congrats Aimer for breaking the Anime
    theme song charts this new season with her opening theme, and
    <b>Amamiya Sora played a (short) piano cover</b> of that one song she sang
    too in Anime "Isshuukan Friends." Yes, that one from Sukima Switch.
    Ten-chan, didn't know you can piano. Probably she can since I've never gone
    to her lives but hey, that's a skill.<br />
    <br />
    So next week... ah. Yeah, we're going to go two weeks without new songs.
    Well, time to find new songs to listen. I mean, I tried yourness again but
    man are they not great. But yeah, maybe <b>yorushika</b> then, their songs
    are easier to swallow, provided if they have impact.&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Okay, just a little about the "Phase 3" thing, if you have read about
    <a
      href="../../2020/06/the-pandemic-upturn-shopping-spree-2020.html"
      >the PUSS of 2020</a
    >
    a couple of posts ago lmao. I thought some of the other will take a while
    since they were pre-order and won't be sent out on time for some reason, I
    decided to also jump on TrySail's cancelled tours to buy some merch and
    recently THEN realised they don't deliver immediately as it'll only start
    13th July ie. two weeks from now by the time it reaches to the forwarding
    service to let me compile, and then ship here. So yeah, I took the liberty
    to order some more from... uh... official stores instead such that we can
    pad this shipment and I went for Ayachi. Yeah, I know she married but
    whatever there is surplus from her tour last year so I'll take a couple. Not
    cheap though, but still cheaper than the tour pamphlet that costs two
    photobooks worth, by the way. So&nbsp; yeah, review probably by the end of
    the month instead of next week haha I was really aiming for the holiday next
    week- Yes it's Election Day here. You can guess where I'm from if you
    haven't. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully the new shows won't
    disappoint. I know two out of three won't. Haha bye meanwhile stay sane I'm
    not already for work I don't even know what to do tomorrow lol haiz bye<br />
