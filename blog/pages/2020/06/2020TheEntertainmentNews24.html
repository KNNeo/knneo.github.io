Yeah, that package arrived this week. Guess what I was doing all weekend.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  If you didn't say work you're out haha part of it was still work. And after
  that? Well, besides the bunch of games I'm obliged to play on a daily basis,
  scanning every single one of those photos I just bought. Yeah, I'm a real
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/otaku" target="_blank">otaku</a> now haha<br />
  <br />Anyways, let's <strike>clear this burden</strike> enjoy the best part of
  the week!! Hey, don't quote me on this but Anime is better than real life
  drama (lol talk about myself here)

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        "I'd like to hold a family meeting" Wow Hime-chan being the head of the
        household now I didn't even know lol you think she's bigger than the
        grandfather? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div>
      "It doesn't matter, they just want to have a meeting" Haha that can never
      be more true but somehow working from home recently due to the pandemic is
      making this less frequent lol which is bad news actually miscommunication
      is the devil that'll come back to haunt you if you don't deal with it.
      Hey, in this new episode (#Kakushigoto11) we talk about meetings. Many
      hate it, some like it, and some are just to "show face" as we colloquially
      call it here, but it's all to align ourselves at the same page. The
      characters in this series aren't though, otherwise it'll not be a comedy
      anymore lol. But yeah, somehow Hime-chan wants to have a family meeting.
      Yeah, it's just two human who will be involved, and the daughter be the
      serious type, so she's just taking things a little formal here, I assume.
      But yeah, as Kakushi and Hime-chan's classmate mentioned, you can do this
      anywhere. My family's typically on the dining table lmao yeah we only talk
      during dinner time. But yeah, somehow three of them being relieved of
      their worried through quite a big misunderstanding, still worked for all
      of them to know the reality of having meetings, and well, all is well. But
      yeah, who gives a sh*t about your editors' meeting, Tomaruin. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
      Talking about this idiot, he then thought of the greatest idea that would
      change everything... before this episode ended lol. It would seem like
      Tomaruin is just trying to get the editor-in-chief and Kakushi to meet up
      so he can eat good food since someone that is not him is paying for it.
      Wow, and they both have bad feelings about why do so too at a time like
      this? Man, you really like to Toma-ruin things, bro! Just stop. (Yes come
      back for more adequately used word puns made by yours truly) Things got
      real awkward with the two victims of Tomaruin's excellent dinner plan
      (because he just eats), and has good reason for Kakushi to believe that
      his manga series has to end. Well, apart from the bad idea of ending a
      series because he'll effectively run out of a job since he has no new
      ideas just yet, the assistants finally get to have a break. Hmm, must be
      tough just doing a weekly series for... weeks and weeks without breaks as
      they would like to take as and when they like, but yeah, the series
      suddenly got good so we can't end it now. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, Kakushi
      eventually found out that he thought his series was ending haha. I mean,
      them assistants (including Keshi-kun) (gotcha covered, bro) should still
      get a break though. Then finally, the meeting. Because Hime-chan finally
      found a well to have a meeting lmao (again, you can have meetings
      anywhere), she and the father finally can talk about... holding a birthday
      party. Yeah, that's it. What do you think the 10-year-old is thinking?
      Okay, 11-year-old since her birthday is over by the time I write this, but
      hey. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> It was all great (Tomaruin gave a gift to Nadila wtf),
      Hime-chan is cute I'm not a pedo (lmao), and Kakushi made mountains of
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/karaage" target="_blank">karaage</a>.
      (Wow, that karaage ramen I had this morning
      <a href="https://zenpop.jp/japanese-ramen-pack" target="_blank"
        >bought from Japan</a
      >
      is great you know) Good job, dad.
      <font size="1">Well, not really, but hey, we don't know yet.</font> To end
      this, in this week's reverse flashback, wow Rokku has grown real big haha,
      and Hime... she finally found the entry to Kakushi's secret. What is might
      be? I guess next week's the daughter confronting the father (I assume he's
      still alive) then. Hmm... please tell me this is a good ending. I want
      this to end happy, to be frank. If it's the sad ending? (Illegitimate
      daughter? What??) Well... I can imagine what it's like already, but I'm
      not like all of them who like to be misunderstood, so I'll see next week
      on what will be the conclusion for this series. Man, this deep lore is not
      what I expected; it's so deep, it's deeper than that well Tomaruin fell
      into haha

      P.S. TIL thinking about an idea for a new series for a new manga artist is
      an editor's job wtf them kids can't think of good ideas themselves? Haha
      well they probably want practicality in this so like, a success formula
      maybe. Like you know, it's not a harem if the guy knows who he likes
      already. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>

    <div>
      P.P.S. "I only gave (Tomaruin) the copies; there's no way we will give him
      the original manuscript" Haha even the assistants know the editor like to
      Toma-ruin things I guess they learnt their lesson lol

        got found out!! Quick, hide in the wardrobe- Is what normally people
        will do? lol
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    Yep, Haru-chan wants some protection from you, Rikuo. You can't run away
    now. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Wait, you gonna sleep at her place?? Oh, I underestimated you
    bro I thought she's going to your place haha. In this I wouldn't even say
    bizarre new episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte11), I mean... this is pretty much
    decided already right? Who Rikuo is going to be with? I mean, he's eating at
    her place?? Well, I don't mean Haru-chan, by the way; That's one's just for
    the break-in. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Let's start from the top, shall we? Story goes that
    Haru-chan's place got a break-in, and thanks to the cops, the guy probably
    got caught, but you know, there's the trauma of a break-in still, to any
    extent. Out of kindness, Rikuo decides to stay with her for the night, and
    don't ask me how he even came to her at any point because I don't think they
    were together when the break-in happened haha that will be WILD lol. But
    yeah, it's not much, so we shouldn't think too much into it. Though we
    should focus more on the main couple's relationship, and specifically, how
    everyone is going to learn of this bond. Again, hurting others along the way
    is unavoidable, so I don't think both of them should avoid it. Firstly, from
    Rikuo. This guy man, enjoying all the cooking that Shinako offers, is
    getting bento every day for work until the colleague wants in on the action.
    Well, girls, not his girl. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So much so that we see the point of them
    hanging out to eat and such, you know, dropping by his place to cook too.
    But yeah,&nbsp;Haru-chan decided to pay Rikuo a visit on the night that he
    called Shinako over for dinner. Man, this world of coincidences will only
    create more misunderstandings haha. So yeah, this is rather inevitable, and
    thank goodness Haru didn't drop the bagels and coffee (lol), because it's
    not worth it to do that for that one guy which you like seen going out with
    who he likes. I mean, that also means the war is over though. Remember the
    challenge issued from Haru-chan to Shinako? Yeah, we can confirm the results
    now. And as this hits Haru-chan, again we knew this is going to happen, but
    I can sincerely tell you I would hate to see Haru-chan cry. Like seriously,
    they gonna make her cry AGAIN!!
    <strike
      >Well, there was the break-in though so I think she got used to it
      haha</strike
    >
    O~kay that's a bad thing to say now sorry I gotta make my jokes somehow.
    Moving on!! We got another idiot who's going to hit the wall again haha.
    Yes, we're talking about Rou-kun, who
    <strike>after a quick time lapse of</strike>&nbsp;has been secretly making
    bentos for Rikuo from Shinako lol, has passed his entrance exams. Hey,
    keeping the secret was vital in making him succeed. But the thanks are good,
    she can't go steady with you now haha. Ugh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Just before we hit
    Rou-kun hard, let's talk about Shinako hanging out with her teacher friend.
    And as the friend mentioned, it's really important for Shinako to do what
    she likes now, even if obligation is in place or whatever reason is stopping
    her from like, you know, going out with another guy. (Haha I like how
    there's "an eyewitness" lol how resourceful are your friends, Shinako? lol)
    I guess the bigger problem is that it's making her guilty somehow. Like
    what, you guys aren't actually going out if you don't spend big bucks to go
    to Disneyland? Who cares?? If it doesn't make you happy then don't do those.
    Screw those normies (sorry haha) out there; do whatever even if it means
    just hanging out for dinner or something. You know, it's always these small
    stuff that make of a couple, not the once in a while gift bomb lol. Okay,
    back to Rou-kun. He graduated, Shinako went with him to pick up an attire
    for the ceremony I suppose, and I swear Rou still thinks she doing all of
    this for him because it's family. Okay, he may not be wrong, but can you
    even take it if she lets go? Or if you know about whatever her life is now?
    "Without You"? (sorry for the Yoru no Honki Dance reference lol) Haiz this
    is hard to pit against this kid though, considering how weak Shinako is in
    her emotions and actions. Maybe comfort zone, maybe guilt, maybe she can't
    keep a secret. I would argue that say like in "Servant x Service" Ichimiya
    didn't have to go out with her girlfriend because his sister's birthday is
    in Christmas Eve but the girl also had stuff to do on that day so it's
    fine?Which is why I think that obligations aren't a problem if (1) you keep
    a secret and (2) everyone else doesn't mind. Both don't apply in this
    scenario though haha I guess that's the problem. And as they hold off their
    plans to do anything else because of obligation as I would like to refer to
    now haha, Shinako... Shinako just wants to be together with him. That's all.
    So pure. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> I like. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And in some freak coincidence, Rou-kun
    shows up at her place. Oh well, but NO WHY NEXT WEEK haha yeah so this is
    going to end even more dramatically compared to this week? Well gg guys this
    kid is going to ruin everything now. I really don't want a train wreck,
    Anime. But hey, it's kinda unavoidable, don't you think? Haha let's see how
    well this goes next episode then it's the last, and I won't expect it to end
    well. No really, don't.

  <div>
    Ah, Kaguya, what have you done to your Shirogane? Like seriously, "return us
    our Shirogane" is what most of the female audience would day haha.&nbsp; In
    this new episode (#KaguysSamaS210) Shirogane Miyuki... actually sucks.
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Sorry, Kaguya-sama, but if you were to marry him you need to bear
    his complaints like a whor- Okay, where were we? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh, before we
    start? You know Kaguya is taking breaths from being too close to Shirogane
    when she puts her hand to her face. Remember that and watch the episode
    again. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, story. Firstly, Shirogane after being avoided like a
    bullet from Kaguya. Well, we know what's the reason, they played two
    episodes of it already. Problem is, the guys doesn't know. So yeah, he is
    just depressed at home now, and thus, the proper introduction of the members
    in the household. Surprisingly, Kei-chan the sister is still the most useful
    for advice as despite the father's efforts of trying to hear his son out,
    his advice as a father who had the wife walk off on him, refusing to sign
    the damn divorce papers and not having a job currently wtf, still has a
    worse love life than his son who is trying to get one. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Take that,
    father!! Haha anyways, from this we can deduce that the sister is a
    masochist haha I mean, getting shitted on by the brother all year long and
    still wants to give advice to him? This can only happen if- Moving on!!
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Someone lied about his skills again. This time, it's about the
    traditional Japanese soran dance. No as in, we know who it is, it's
    Shirogane. Teaching him again is a pro artist and everything is perfect
    about her besides her temper, <strike>Kohara Konomi</strike> Fujiwara Chika
    (lol Koko-chan don't hit me) (but seriously
    <a href="https://youtu.be/rvWXCEo_4Z0?t=14" target="_blank"
      >if you need evidence</a
    >
    I have them haha), is again at the behest of this motherf**ker who lied
    through his nose for the nth time since we have to go through his life
    lessons (literally) again and again, could not even do a dance just by
    following the dancer. Seriously, Kaguya, even if you stepped in it wouldn't
    work on him haha. So, Chika-chan like seriously and I agree with you girl,
    has had enough of his lies, is probably giving up on teaching him even if it
    means destroying her pride because even if she has one it's already gone.
    So, with the sports festival upon him, Shirogane has no choice but to learn
    it himself till the day comes, and that's where Kaguya comes in. Besides her
    earnest desire to touch his slender, pliant body (lol I'm not gay btw) she
    intends to use this opportunity to teach him stuff so that she can show how
    good she is at dancing? Well, not until Chika steps in and noticed it. In
    the conflict between science and art approaches to dancing which I think you
    can watch yourself, the two friends ended up quarrelling with each other on
    what they know about the dance. Somehow Shirogane got how it works though
    and manages to nail it in the festival, so good on you bro. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (I want
    to me pulled by two girls too hehe) Then, it's... Miko's friend? Yeah, let's
    call her that I still don't remember her name. Her observation, of
    Ishigami's life. To summarise, people might think Miko-chan and Ishigami
    might have something, but it's because this somehow special bond is only
    forged because they all know each other in middle school (obviously,
    Shuchi'in), and... Ishigami almost got expelled and it's Miko-chan who
    brought him back. I don't think he knows, but you know, love is a secret in
    itself. Haha Miko-chan don't kill me. Still, according to... the friend lol,
    and that's why people today hate Ishigami, because he had such a past, and
    how he was saved without knowing what he did to himself. Again, it's a bit
    touchy anyways, and hey it's youth, so I won't dig in too much into that. If
    you want to guess who Ishigami went violent for... I don't know. I don't
    want to know haha. So, last but not least, the sports festival. Besides the
    fact that his (useless) (unemployed) father is creeping him out haha,
    Shirogane technically has to stop the father from finding his girl, because
    you know, the dad sucks. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, about that, and you know the father
    is going to slip away to a corner just to... corner the girl she likes, you
    know, like a confrontation? Funny thing is then, Kaguya doesn't know of the
    father. Really? Not even though the voice? Well I guess she isn't blind so
    her hearing isn't heightened and it's a terrible quality phone call but.
    Still, Kaguya's argument thus far as from episode 1 (of season 1) is still
    that she like him for who he is in impression. I mean, we know how terrible
    the guy is at his home, but hey, Kaguya doesn't know of that. Now you know
    why they say "marriage is life's grave"? I mean, look at the father.
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So that's that. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Wow, are we close to ending this series,
    and I expect something better than the last. Remember, we have seen a lot of
    fathers this week which reminds us of someone else's father missing in
    action. So good chances Ishigami's father might have something to do with
    the ending haha bye (yes I lied)

  is... okay I guess? As with many voice actress idol-based music albums this
  one is similar as the production try to explore as many styles and especially
  genres, for future developments for the artist herself. This one... I believe
  it has given her more variety, although I would argue those aren't the ones I
  gave haha. The topic song with a music video is a meh, there's one song which
  sounds like when Minase Inori released an album ie. inspirational so I gave
  that chorus real good, and you know, Akarin's great as hype songs and I'll
  take that anytime of the day. Although I would argue that I would like more..
  you know, seducing songs. I mean, Akarin singing
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhIeiUbH2gg" target="_blank"
    >that Sumipe song</a
  >
  would be GREAT though it'll be hard to sell the music video haha she has no
  rack and butt THEM LEGS THOUGH lol<br />
  <br />
  Talking about stuff that is still music and it's on Twitter,
  <b>VELTPUNCH announced their upcoming album</b> to be on August after
  revealing their third music video for the past 3 months (which is actually
  good),

  is fine I guess but I'll wait for an album or single release, I assume to
  prevent spamming <b>Amamiya Sora's music YouTube channel</b> is up with short
  versions of the music videos thus far, and it's probably not related to music
  but I just want to say, <b>Minase Inori opened an Instagram account</b> on
  account that (pun not intended) there is out there an unofficial account
  raking in followers, including me. Don't think I remembered this too well but
  I don't follow fan accounts so I suppose it's real. Maybe I really thought it
  was a related account to follow back then. That or maybe their account is
  hacked. But thinking about it all these years, it's always mirroring of
  content from Twitter and hardly anything that is original so I suppose it's
  not real haha uh oh<br />
  <br />
  So next week... it's a whole lot of nothing, actually. Until the following
  week I may spend some time to listen to more songs from other artists, I
  guess. I don't know if it's recent events or the lack of active artists that
  made this happen, but as you can see in Klassic Note just this year, it has
  not been looking great. Yeah, my follow-up on these since I am working is
  already weak in comparison to the first 10 years, huh.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  So that's it I guess. Another week, another post. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, there's that
  one big thing this week following my efforts to scan every single of those 60+
  photos I bought online because I'm bored at home haha, so go check it out.
  Maybe when I'm done I'll put them up on that Github Page so I can admire them
  in the digital world without having to see them physically. Also, I need
  another photo album my current has reached its limit and my local MUJI is not
  open to sell them yet haha. Cya guys next week then, and until next time...
  well I'm trying to stay happy, and so should you. Hey, Yoru no Honki Dance's
  music video is a good one; go listen to it. Okay bye<br />
