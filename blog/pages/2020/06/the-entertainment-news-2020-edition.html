I really think this site needs an update.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well, more like, I want to change the naming conventions of the stuff around
  here. You know, for example, "Entertainment News" is such a terrible name to
  represent the Anime and music I watch and listen every week. Well, I can't
  come up with anything better but when I do, I guess.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Also unrelated, do you guys wear trunks before? Guys, of course. Very, very
  like just wearing pants without briefs. I guess not letting them balls hang
  around is quite a good thing isn't it? Also, briefs are like diapers I don't
  have to clean up lmao I hope you do haha let's start<br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div>
    Wow for a moment, just for a while, I thought like, the father re-married.
    Is this why he quit his manga artist career? Such a sacrifice, this Kakushi.
    <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, jokes aside, in this final episode (#Kakushigoto12) of this
    wonderfully funny yet sad series... we gotta end this, right? And end this
    they did, this Anime. Let's talk all about it, we not doing flashbacks now
    we're on real time this episode haha. Firstly, about who Hime-chan actually
    is.Well, who the father actually is too. So, if I didn't understand this
    wrongly, the one guy who walked into the old house where Hime is looking
    through all the stuff as she was 18 now, claims that he is her brother, is
    not wrong because the father was somebody's illegitimate child. And yes,
    that I don't think any of us will expect. Of course, I don't think this is
    something we will infer when we refer to secrets in this series, yes? Still,
    Kakushi did rely on his sister to keep his secret items in an event of an
    incident that did happen. More on that later though. And as for the other
    side we know already, that the old man Kakushi was seeing in the past couple
    of years, is the father-in-law, and also a great painter himself making
    loads of money I believe. And yes also, why the family is not relying on the
    in-law's paycheck is because their interests in art are different. I mean,
    this should be obvious from all these episodes so I won't elaborate. Then,
    what happened to Kakushi over the past 7 years. Ah, this is the content
    heavy part, to be honest. Man, did they dump everything in one episode here.
    So, in his years of writing Tights, Kakushi himself is also trying to find
    back his wife. Hey, what happened to the wife, you might ask? If you
    believed that the mother was dead like I did, you're not entirely correct,
    for the wife went missing in a boat accident. Not dead until found, we call
    it. So yeah, Kakushi has spent years finding the wife, and with some jerk
    out there exposing his activities to the public, he eventually lost
    motivation to write his comedy story and stopped being a manga artist. He
    then went into doing labour which probably isn't his forte but he still had
    to make a living to keep Hime-chan going until at least when she graduated
    high school, and he did. Sadly, it was also when he got into the incident
    that led him unconscious in the hospital for nearly a year. Yeah, to be done
    by manga... he would be better off just writing them, isn't it? Which brings
    us to the last part of this seven year gap. Why?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, now then we
    covering this I swear we talked about this halfway through already. But no
    less. Why? Why quit his job as an artist? Because someone exposed your
    lengths to find your wife? I mean, if it's a job it can still pay, so why
    not just continue? Well, normally artists at this point will just stop the
    series to make another one in hopes of changing the mood or sales or
    whatever in between, so he might be able to get away with this. But yeah,
    loss of motivation might be quite a big factor to this anyways. So yeah,
    last but not least, what happens now. He just regained consciousness, but...
    he forgets about Hime-chan. Well, not really, he knows he has a daughter.
    Just that, 7 years of memories have been wiped from his brain. Remember he
    was his by a stack of manga in the incident that got him into hospital?
    Yeah, that. Which is bad because suddenly Tomaruin is the editor again
    (still is, but to Rasuna-chan), everyone starts doing their assistant work
    like it's a miracle from 7 years ago haha, and the team got a new
    assistant... wait a minute. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, the dad just forgot that his
    daughter had grown up. While most of them decide to play along until he can
    recover his memories (including Rokku somehow, still alive btw dogs can live
    to a decade), Hime decided that, after hearing what the dad really wants,
    she really can't live with this pain anymore. So yeah, she went back to the
    old place, got all the works of Tights he has done over the years back into
    the hospital, and let him remember what happened that has been part of his
    life till now. Man, if you didn't tear up here go watch another Anime.
    <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh and to end this, Hime-chan has a secret she now keeps from her
    dad: she draws manga as a side hobby now, or even in school, damn. Not dirty
    jokes though, more like we're going to rely on her for the next shoujo manga
    series hey I'm not complaining haha. Overall... wow, I don't even know where
    to comment. Man, was this quite a ride. Okay, I mean, if they started with
    this and THEN told you about the past, it wouldn't have made much impact.
    Although I would argue they may have pushed a little too much in telling you
    what may have happened in the near future, like how Kakushi has kept his
    secret well to the daughter, the author or production whoever did this, has
    managed to keep most of the actual backstory from us well too, so I would
    say they have done it. Making an impact. Before this I would have believed
    that something happened to Kakushi, unlikely dead, and he's still writing
    manga. But I guess not. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> It's still a great series in my opinion,
    and just like how Kakushi managed to keep his and his daughter's live going,
    the Anime has gone so smoothly, I can't even complain. The weekly doses of
    jokes, Hime being Hime haha, and everything in between (Naru-chan!! Reporter
    now, by the way), this is still pretty impressive of a series overall. I,
    I'm just lost for words haha. Man, will I ever get such an Anime again? I
    doubt so. Making you laugh every episode and then dropping you the bomb?
    This is it, guys. I want a season two but they wrapped this one up so good,
    I think this is enough. Hey, Rasuna-chan you want to also give us a secret
    you've been keeping for yourself? We could do with a new series lol or maybe
    whatever your manga is we can animate that haha

  </div>
</blockquote>
Man, Rou-kun, f**k off. Seriously, f**k off. Haha I forgot we were still here.
But yeah, I hate to break it to you but, uh... I'll let Shinako say it lol. In
this final episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte12) of a roller coaster ride like every
other romance Anime, this one... not as exhilarating as the others until they
make you numb or faint (lol), but enough to let you remember. But man, did this
last one make you want to shoot yourself on the foot and then step on it until
it stops bleeding. Haha okay, analogy aside because that's gross lol, story. So,
if you have figured this out somehow you're great in relationships because I'm
at Rikuo's level when it comes to love, the couple... eventually broke up.
Firstly, about Rou-kun. Again, he's just as he is, Shinako keeps thinking that
she's at fault to anything and everything anyways. Again, Shinako, not your
fault, you were at his best interests. And yeah thanks Rikuo for staying around
and not leaving her alone, what a gentleman. But yeah, I wouldn't blame you
Shinako. Rou is always the one that likes to exaggerate thing and then make a
fuss about it so to ruin other peoples' happiness. You intend to let the woman
stay single forever, you shit? FANCY TELL WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DAD, YOU PIECE
OF SHIT haha okay Rou-kun can't do it anyways he's a pussy. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> He ended up
staying over at his friend's place too. What a piece of- Okay that's all the
sh*tting I'm doing for this brat for the series. Still, this of course, will
shed some light on what is about to happen. Again, it's not a bomb, but it
always start out as a reflection session or something. So yeah, fast forward a
little, the main two are dating, yes, but that's also where they start doubting
themselves about what they are doing to hurt others, by being together. But
seriously, this is the price of getting this ship going while sacrificing
everyone around them? It's a small price to pay, man. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> On the other
hand, yeah I think Rikuo may have realised it. He is not liking Shinako enough
like how Haru-chan likes him. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Maybe that's why. Maybe that's why he
will go through all lengths to apologise to the poor girl who likes him and
wants to see him every day after her work at his workplace at the convenience
store. Maybe that's why Shinako still wants Rou-kun to be family with her, like
they have always been in the past. Sacrificing selfish love together might be
too big of a price to pay. Hey, did I say if you figured this out you were a
love master? Haha legit didn't see this coming. But yeah, I would agree that if
they carried on on their own both of them wouldn't be happy. Then again, Rikuo's
infatuation and Shinako's hesitation may have played through without the people
around them, but that IS life itself. It's never an alone game when it comes to
relationships. If it makes you uncomfortable or you indirectly hurt someone and
feel bad about it, then you gotta do something about it. I would argue that that
shouldn't be how love is, making everyone doubt their actions, but this is some
healthy thought man. Also, this is Japan not the West so aggression don't work
here unfortunately. Eventually, Rou-kun did end up having Shinako visit him
probably to make amends because she feels bad every time and Rou is a jerk lol,
and Rikuo did end up choosing sloppy seconds haha okay Haru-chan I'm sorry. But
hey, you did make someone happy so you're good, bro. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Haru-chan is cute,
by the way, gotta give you that haha. Overall, not an ending I would have
expected, but if it goes the other way around ie. they get together, it'll be
real awkward for everyone else anyways, so.. maaaybe this is for the better? I
don't know. Really didn't expect the series itself to regret doing the series,
by the way. This show might be the first lmao. I guess I may have gotten on the
wrong ship then, thinking this is some straightforward romance masterpiece.
Still, I still like the mood of this series in general, as they don't really go
on and on about emotions and let misunderstanding do the talking, and you know,
keep things short and sweet, even in Rikuo's love reflection session with
Shinako at the bench. Still, real disappointed that Rikuo isn't with Shinako
anymore because seriously, we're NOT getting another season where we get to see
Rikuo go out with Haru-chan and that makes me sad haha. Well, at least we know
now that Haru-chan is happy, so that's good for me. Eh? Did I say I like
Haru-chan? Oh? Did I though? Haha you will figure it out on my own I've got
things to think of lol

  Wow, can this series stop with all this backstory? It's creeping me out lol
  ANYWAYS. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode of (#KaguyaSamaS211) somehow... this
  ending theme song is all the more bittersweet the more I hear it. Song's
  coming out next week by the way; be sure to give the single a listen. So,
  story. Last week, we learnt of Ishigami's story, how he did something bad in
  middle school like beating somebody up, and became the loner he is today. This
  week, we get the backstory. For a reminder from here, it's Ogino the jerk, and
  Otomo the dumb bitc- Okay, let's start. Story goes that I guess or let's
  assume Ishigami fell for Otomo's charm at some point for being, you know,
  caring of some classmate no one cares about. Hey, you don't see those girls
  every day, maybe that's why. But, here's the big BUT here, he has a jerk
  boyfriend. Well, Ishigami found out he's cheating on her, this Ogino. And to
  protect this girl, he eventually went to confront the guy and told him to
  stop. You know, like, break up with her or something. Polygamy isn't a thing
  in Japan, you know. Hey, I respect you Muslims but monogamy has its advantages
  you know. Not going to turn this into a talkshow by the way, we have a story
  to tell. So, instead of backing off, Ogino went the evil way as many would
  have done being a kid of a noble for some reason (hey remember it's a rich
  kid's school here), and derided to trade his very girlfriend for Ishigami to
  keep mum about his... wrongdoings, I guess. But you know, as Ishigami was kind
  of desperate, he went the violent way to beat him into giving up his evil
  deeds, but you know, this influencer ended up turning the whole school on him
  and made him the victim, so that's kind of sad. Ishigami just ended up being
  suspended of school until his high school days apparently. But seriously, what
  did the guy show Ishigami? I'm curious now lol probably the girl naked?
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Edit: Oh, it is a porno haha) I mean... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, not like
  anyone will understand anyways, just like how no one understood Ishigami.
  Sense of justice my a** that dumb b*tch can get cheated so many times we don't
  even care- Back to reality, and that's why Ishigami is what he is today. Quite
  a backstory, I tell you. But in the world of Shuchi'in, things like this
  happen. You're not in a neighbourhood school where everyone is an idiot- is
  trying to live life happily and not get into trouble. Hey, you tell me, life.
  Serious talk aside, I would argue that Shirogane, who eventually dug him out
  of the cave, was right: he could have done it smarter (like you know, gather
  evidence to his deeds and show the girl) instead of resorting to violence, but
  he did do it though. Ogino did get scared and dropped off this school because
  he was worried about the many times Ishigami never written an apology letter
  to him since like Ishigami mentioned, he can never put himself to do it.
  Obviously because, Ogino was doing something wrong in the first place.
  Infidelity, we call it. What, it can't happen in middle school? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I
  mean, most of us don't even have someone to cheat on yet so... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Still,
  and that's why Ishigami put himself together, with all his might back then, to
  protect this girl. All in an effort to not let the girl Otomo experience
  infidelity. Man, is it worth it though? I mean, I haven't eavesdropped on a
  man of a girl I liked cheating on her so... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I don't know how it
  feels, bro. But hey, I feel you Ishigami, for coming this far and worrying too
  much. Because worrying is part of life. But worrying won't get you anywhere.
  Not that it's bad, but you have to stop at some point. And with this, and the
  girl's appearance in the sports festival just to shit on the person who
  technically saved her from agony... not worth it, bro. Really, not worth it.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, Kaguya-sama might have been involved in bringing in the girl
  somehow (I don't have evidence but I can't beat Kaguya up lol), Shirogane is
  MVP this episode somehow because man did he clear Ishigami's name down to the
  sewers, and Miko-chan if you like a guy who will beat up someone for your
  happiness... Haha cya next week for the final episode then. Man, how are they
  going to one up this? Maybe another lockup in the sports equipment room??
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We shall see next week.

  Well, as you should know, I didn't listen much to new songs, but I did listen
  to songs I've not heard of. Thanks to one Kohara Konomi (it's in her Instagram
  story if you have an account) she was listening to a song from
  <b>Teshima Aoi's mini-album in 2008</b>, and after listening to it... I would
  say it soothes the nerves from my hectic work schedule for the week. Also,
  it's 2000s melodies so they won't suck so bad compared to now haha. So yeah, I
  chose a couple along with it. Thanks, Koko-chan! You've contributed to Klassic
  Note once more.<br />
  <br />Around the world of Twitter and beyond if necessary, be sure to listen
  to <b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new studio live videos on YouTube</b> because they are
  AWESOME hehe, <b>Aimer is due for another new single</b> which I hope I'll get
  a listen and if it's any good,
  <b>Earphones' hit their debut 5 years ago</b> so there's a re-arrangement of
  the debut song out for their upcoming new album which brings back memories I'm
  getting likes for my Tweets lol, and also listen to
  <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES home recording of "ReI"</b>, the project song for many
  artists which interpret the title and write a song in their own way. I've only
  heard theirs and I can already say theirs are the best haha<br />
  <br />So next week, we're finally on to
  <b>Fukuhara Kaori's new single</b> which is in time for Anime "Kaguya-sama" to
  end next week too, so... don't worry the song has grown on me and I've heard
  the music video in full so I know it's good already. Next season there's
  halca-san so I'll have to worry about that lol. Surprisingly, listening to the
  livestream of Anime "Kanojo, Okarishimasu" it ain't too bad, because it isn't
  an emotional song. Thank goodness haha<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Well, I'm done. Excuse me while I drop by Isobe Karin's new broadcast series
  announcement livestream right now since I'm done with my weekly assignment
  lol. Also, have to go back to workplace tomorrow so that kind of sucks but
  that's better since I technically have nothing to do and I'll be able to find
  something to do by then hopefully. Cya guys next week then, and until then...
  well there are a couple of posts when you click backwards for the week so be
  sure to read them all! Until next time... I need to sleep more haha getting
  tired from work already considering we don't have to take work leave for any
  reason now lol bye<br />
