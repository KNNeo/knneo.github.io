Wow this new Blogger re-design is not going to be fun to deal with.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yes, this post will be technically also, an experiment of sorts to crash
  test this new editor interface which I'm using now (which you guys won't see)
  such that they can move on to this by the end of the month and hopefully not
  break my blog by then but I've learnt to backup for this. So yeah, fingers
  crossed, seriously. Blogger, you have screwed me before last year already;
  please don't make it worse.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So far everything is working, so if anything happens especially the new
  designs on my part for the blog them I'll
  <strike>kill the employees at Google</strike> try to fix them if possible in
  view of the inevitable transition anyways. Don't you fret, I HAVE considered
  and even tried migrating to WordPress but they couldn't take 6 years of
  content import haha. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well, at least Anime is making me happy and especially the two weeks of
  waiting we may FINALLY be able to get the one package I've been mentioning a
  month ago haha let's start<br />
  <div>
    <br />

        ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kakushigoto</span>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        "I'm just a bad girl who can't help but eat everything that is in front
        of me" Wow Hime-chan you shouldn't say that when you grow up lol (I
        mean, you'll get fat haha)
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    "I'm just a bad boy who can't help but slack off as much as possible!" Okay
    this is #RealityCheck already haha. In this new episode (#Kakushigoto10),
    Hime-chan won a prize for a vacation. And we mainly talk about what it means
    to have one, as a manga author. I mean, Tomaruin is having a great time as
    an editor and not giving two sh*ts but Kakushi isn't him so sadly, he has to
    keep his series alive during this period. Well, he can still have breaks of
    course, once you rush through the next few chapters you can have a New
    Year's break. Just that, watch out when the publisher asks you back for
    minor edits and you still have to do it somehow because you know,
    <strike>for your readers</strike> work. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, another reason why he
    gets to rush through all this, as a direct consequence too, is that he'll
    just fall sick anyways. It's like me only getting sick once a year or
    something I don't know. It's more often before this when I can afford long
    term treatment for my ailments though, so... I guess? But yeah, Kakushi is
    down for a while before he can get up and go vacation with the daughter
    again. Problem is, they had to all visit him at the same time. Yes, even the
    women who liked him lol. Also, can you all settle on a call for your boss?
    "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/buchou" target="_blank">Buchou</a>" and
    "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shachou" target="_blank">Kachou</a>"
    means very different things, man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Since the subs aren't doing
    justice I'm here to help) (And let's not talk about the scriptures thing
    please lol) And so, the family (of three) (yes the dog too) get to go to Izu
    (not Hawaii) (F**K YOU TOMARUIN-) for a hotel stay which isn't bad. I mean,
    there's all-you-can-eat crabs. Not like I like to eat them but. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Anyways, their room is beside a room in which the dog is barking at somehow
    (ooo creepy) (but yeah, dogs wouldn't bark at something non-living btw), and
    when everyone is eating crabs they started to open up and share their
    secrets- I think the crabs are poisoned lmao. So yeah, everyone started
    sharing their secrets and crying, which kind of reminds me of a cult-like
    episode from
    <a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei"
      target="_blank"
      >Anime "Yojouhan"</a
    >
    but hey, if Kakushi will be able to reveal his secret... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well he
    was able to almost, until we remember the two guardians of Kakushi to take
    care of the daughter in the public female bath who are basically Rasuna
    and... Ami-chan? *double checks* Haha that was close. But mainly Rasuna
    because why not, who then saw the room open and of course, the staff
    revealing that the room is haunted because it was also the place where a
    famous author wrote his last work and coughed blood until he was dead in
    hospital. Kind of an elaborate plot but, yeah they did play around with it
    to make Kakushi the next paranormal sensation when he decided to sit in in
    hopes of the master possessing him so he could make it big someday. Well, I
    guess not considering what happened next but. And last but not least, the
    reverse flashback as I would like to call it. Firstly, Kakushi quit his job
    as a manga author. And it's mainly because he couldn't continue.
    Kubo-sensei, I can feel you. Next, it's about why. Rasuna hinted with a last
    word that his private life has been revealed to the public which led to his
    end as an artist, but how? I guess we won't have much time to know about
    this; we are pretty near the end. Man, I'm just laughing at the jokes dryly
    while we wait for the drop for this series, I tell you. To end this, and if
    you followed even just the Anime's Twitter account you'll know the author of
    this series is ending with its 11th volume which released recently. Yeah, we
    might get an ending out of this. Ooo boy this is going to be a secret that
    is hard to swallow even for me haha we shall see then wait next week's last
    episode?? And it's Episode 11 too??? This is a
    <strike>curse</strike> coincidence like I've never imagined...<br />

        carefree as heck
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    I mean, when your friend's wife is cheering you on, you gotta wonder.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Uh, I mean, no dear friend your wife is just trying to tell me to
    get Shinako I don't mean for you to get cucked- Okay good enough haha. In
    this new episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte10) where everyone has their own
    relationship problems but I don't (BOOM GOT ME) (<span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> I was so carefree
    about life too... <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>) and there's still wired phones at that time period
    haha what is wrong with my life now, we continue with the stories after
    Christmas. You know, new year new relationships amirite?? No? Oh well.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, story. Story goes from last episode, Shinako's got enough to
    Rou-kun who can't not be a kid for two seconds when they are alone together,
    then visited her college friends' instead and of course, the married couple
    has to hint on their relationship even if it meant telling them to go for it
    haha. Don't expect too much because I don't think I did haha I mean I did,
    but you know, we can talk about that in a while. So, on the other side,
    Haru-chan braced herself to appear in front of Rikuo's place again. And man
    if you pieced two and two together you'll realise what Haru-chan is going to
    stumble into or even ruin at this point. Uh oh, we're in it now. Well, I
    don't think it will Rikuo's not the guy who'll invite girls to his place...
    besides those who asked for it <strike>lol sorry Chika-chan</strike> wait
    WHAT?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh I gotta put an exception to this rule now because welcome
    Haru-chan!! Haha man Rikuo is too nice to be human. So yeah, Rikuo at this
    point should be feeling bad for letting Haru-chan like him because you know,
    he's kind of with Shinako to some extent and this girl still wants to see
    him every once in a while. I wouldn't call this two-timing but you know. I
    would argue that if Haru-chan is just watching and not impeding on the
    impending (not word pun intended) relationship between Shinako and Rikuo,
    it's okay to let Haru-chan be. I mean, isn't this what it feels like to be
    in a harem? Haha I've never been in one before so don't quote me on this.
    Also, because of the Christmas thing where the friend's wife egged him to
    give that "bought" present to Shinako in which she did accept (again,
    personally I don't do surprises so I would go shopping and buy you something
    you like as if I'm a rich person lol but yeah, because the risk of surprise
    is higher than the obvious feels of getting you something you'll like), the
    two spent New Year's Eve together. Shinako. And Rikuo. Yes, sorry Haru-chan
    and your work schedule haha. But seriously though&nbsp;Shinako why you
    cancel your trip back home at least Rikuo still can have a good time with
    Haru-chan ARGH WHY MUST THIS BE SO IRRITATING welcome to romance drama
    ladies and gentlemen. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And so the two spent New Year's Eve together,
    drinking booze and... coffee? At her place?? Man, Rikuo you really don't
    know how to be a man nice job Shinako didn't expect that tbh haha. And if
    you can believe it, Rikuo can't stand the tension (ON HIS DI-) in the room
    so... yeah, as we can all see, he's just not ready for it. Then again don't
    ask me on what to do I'll vote for the vending machine first lol. But man,
    Shinako is doing it though, getting out of her comfort zone. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
    Rikuo, you suck. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp; But really, Shinako's thoughts also should
    be of concern to Rikuo considering in your relationship you get such a girl
    who will be so open on her thoughts with you if it's anyone else you'll
    probably get dumped even before you started. Again, this is a softcore
    romance series so don't expect those extreme scenes haha. And I guess to
    return the message Rikuo went in with the hug. Man, sounds so forced lol.
    Last but not least, Haru-chan decides to call. Probably not Rikuo because I
    can't imagine Rikuo being shocked from receiving a call from her, but you
    know, it's probably something important going on maybe work so remember to
    contact people around you for the news, yes? He probably won't and it'll
    lead to more misunderstanding, I'm sure. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To end this, what is the
    problem with that ending song?? No wonder I already abandoned listening to
    Anime soundtracks years ago with this kind of shit??? Haha cya guys next
    week<br />

      P.S. Okay I think I dreamt about something the night before that was
      partly about this Anime that is like Shinako hopping to another place
      after stopping by her college friends' place. Well, don't think Shinako
      has that many friends so.. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div>
      P.P.S. If you need to recall a long story go back to when Shinako asked
      Rikuo if the gift was picked specially for her haha man that was a long
      hesitation in Anime history but yeah Rikuo be honest guy anyways

    Yeah Miko-chan always wanted to join the Student Council since young but
    just not this one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But hey your friends seems interested in it we
    can swap places lmao. In this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS209) where we talk
    about Miko-chan and her ideals instead of a certain someone with a notepad
    from another Anime lol, who the heck edited last week's episode until it was
    beyond recognition? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, I can't make this make
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank"
      >interjections</a
    >
    Anime please stop stepping on me Kaguya-sama haha. *ahem* Besides every
    other joke I made above, let's talk about jokes we haven't mentioned in this
    episode which aren't funny, so basically the plot line lol. Firstly,
    Miko-chan really wants to quit the Student Council. Again, I would argue
    it's more of the Student Council is crazy instead of her being paranoid, but
    you know, somehow with the friend explaining things to her and telling her
    to analyse rationally... she still thinks it's weird. Yeah, like, it's all
    Kaguya's fault. That might be true to a certain extent though, but I would
    say that has changed since like, midway through season 1 so Miko-chan you
    shouldn't be too bothered. She did hit the dot on the asking Kaguya about
    the President though, because you know, she's too thick-headed to know what
    their relationship is for the girl to be so lovesick she has to be sent to
    the hospital if she can't take the aggression from Shirogane lo. Talking
    about lovesickness (haha), Kaguya since after the incident in the sports
    equipment room, is not able to communicate normally with Shirogane anymore.
    Like seriously, not that hospital bills are cheap, but like the pandemic we
    haven't got a cure yet, so she'll have to withhold herself before she gets
    all horny- So Hayasaka being her butler and best friend (screw you
    Chika-chan haha) thought of teaching her to practice a ritual that can make
    her calm every time this kind of things happen. But you know, just gotta
    practice another way without using your right arm lest it being used when it
    happens lol. But hey, it worked, just that I can't but help think how
    aggressive Shirogane has been on physical contact recently, huh. Maybe he is
    the evil one like Miko-chan has seen so far haha. Lastly, Ishigami is in the
    cheer-leading team. Yeah, we have a miracle, guys. We can end the series now
    haha not so fast. Ishigami thought of being a normie so he decided to
    volunteer, only to realise that only normies will join, and he's right, it
    is. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, he was kinda forced to do this somehow now, and the
    team decided the guys have to cross dress. Is this what it feels like to be
    a normie? No wonder those people posting online about how aggressive
    university orientation camps are like f**k camps and they are normal. Uh oh.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Ishigami has to find an outfit to wear essentially, and
    Kaguya decided to help him. As a senpai of course, like she usually does
    with the any number of times from exams to anything else that involves her
    relationships with a certain someone haha. Anyway it went well, Kaguya got
    shitted on for her flat chest again (you wanna consider surgically padding
    it like those Korean girls? Haha), Miko-chan found out that Ishigami is gay
    lmao, and Shirogane is jealous. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Wow, when you put in that much
    effort into character development as a joke in your story, this is what you
    get. Chaos apparently, haha. But yeah, Ishigami is going along with it, for
    as long as he can handle, I suppose. Next week's the sports festival though,
    so let's see if I'll end up liking Ishigami as a straight man by then lol I
    won't I'm not gay. I'm gay though, as in happily enjoying this series while
    it lasts the month on end. Oh well, and all I wanted is to see a couple be
    made. Not the Kashiwagi one; that one's a fake I'll take over that guy's
    place and be with Mocho lmao Miko-chan needs to see a doctor haha bye<br />

        is... impressive, I must say, probably because of the Anime tie-in, but

        just passed through my brain recently so I remembered to give it a
        listen, probably it's better than the first but it's only the topic
        song, and don't ask me how are the B-sides. Like seriously, don't you
        think the two topic songs so far sound so similar I might as well only
        give one? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

      In terms of news in Twitter and beyond maybe,
      <b
        >Horie Yui's latest live performance is going to be available on
        streaming</b
      >
      end of July and probably I'll give as much as I have liked a listen
      definitely if I can remember, <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new song</b>/music
      video isn't too bad and digital single is out next week so I might give a
      listen which doesn't mean give until I guess the next major release, I may
      give a listen to <b>Earphone's upcoming album</b> in July which revealed
      its cover, <b>SHE'S new music video</b> isn't bad but man it's quite a
      grind to wait for next month to arrive, and
      <b
        >yourness' new song for Anime "Yesterday wo Utatte" hit a million
        views</b
      >
      on YouTube (review above haha) which is probably something this week's
      ending theme song won't reach lol well Sayuri might reach this number
      someday too actually.<br />
      <br />
      So next week, finally upon all expectations of idolism in Klassic Note
      haha, we have <b>Kitou Akari's 1st album</b> after a month's delay, and
      boy will I be hyped about this if work doesn't stop me from enjoying this
      to any extent maybe. But yeah, Akarin I need to be impressed by your voice
      more hehe. And <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new song</b> maybe if I can
      remember haha I'll check back here anyways I have a bad memory somehow
      lol<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      And we're done for the week. And boy am I glad my weekend isn't bogged up
      with work somehow considering the plan was to burn all my weekends this
      month, but hey, I've been avoiding them so far so... haha work delays I
      guess not my fault though. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully by then
      I will be in Bromideland where I sink in all the photos I bought
      (indirectly) over the past month. Boy, and I going to enjoy that hehe.
      Until next time... I need to change out that photo frame on my desk
      Futon-chan is making me watch porn every other day with her gravure? Yeah,
      she's not endowed but man she makes me want to f-<br />
      <br />
      P.S. Reviving some embed stuff I did years ago because the new Blogger
      doesn't auto adjust HTML when I switch to Compose mode now. Trust me, it
      actually happens. Maybe I should come up with a custom JS to write this
      down from a link to allow flexibility of code then. Hmm...<br />
