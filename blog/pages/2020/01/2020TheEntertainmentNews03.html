<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7jb_ir1Suo/XiPb1M51MBI/AAAAAAAA38c/xDYvQYzTHFUj0P66lUqiALyNlCsNgizRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun02_aoi.jpg"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>I know it's a bit sudden, but this year's theme for watching Anime shall be"openness".<br /><br />Haha I know I literally based this on the number of shows I picked up this timearound and I haven't even confirmed half of them to be able to say this but,hey, if it happens you'll see them around next week, I assure you. Oh yeah, nextweek... it's a public holiday here so I can't spend my weekend watching Animenow so... I may watch these earlier maybe. I just hope I don't have half a dozenshows to watch since Sunday is basically Anime day now lol<br /><br />Well maybe I'll just end up with 3 shows this season I don't know does thiscount as openness? Haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;">      Boku no Tonari ni Ankoku Hakaishin ga Imasu</span    >  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Okay, quick one. I'm not giving it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Easily for a number of reasons:    (1) The guy is doing the tsukkomi role for EVERYTHING based on just even one    guy so that's going to be tiring for even me seeing there's a diverse cast,    (2) the guys around the main guy are (probably) literally Baka/Yamamoto from    Anime "Jyoshimuda" who I can't even stand one of them in the intro already,    (3) the opening theme sucks lol especially with the colourful characters and    (4) I'm already watching 4 new shows this season. So, no. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>TL:DR; Even a kid will get tired of asking questions just by looking at fiveminutes of this show imo<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Babylon10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I asked a friend I trusted to take care of (my family)" If it means I'm    punished for killing the devil, I'll do it... is probably what Seizaki will    say  </div></blockquote>Again, I think I said this before, all this spreading of allowing suicide lawprobably spawned from one woman, and Itsuki probably is also done for by thewoman in the first place. So yeah, just one evil, it seems. But we don't know,maybe it was from Itsuki. In this new episode (#Babylon10) where I hope thingsare heating up further, we come to a proper conclusion of the thinking processof the suicide law from the world leader's prospective. Of course, I'm talkingabout the America President Alex as I will now refer to him from here on. So,story. Seizaki and his buddy went back to ask the Mayor of Hartford about hisvisit to the old folks' home (sorry I'm used to this term) and... some girlcommited suicide. Oh well, that Mayor told the kid that AFTER he received thatone call, so... RIP kid you will be missed haha AGAIN the latest female in theseries just came and went real quick I think this show is feminist. Moving on(haha), Alex consulted a priest about what it means in Christianity to commitsuicide. I don't know much about this considering I've only heard someone tellme about it during my university time for about 10 minutes I think, commitingsuicide is not a sin. And as the final words of the priest (he is not dead yet,I meant the cutscene), God loves mankind. Which is why obviously, knowing thefreedom that the world has even thousands of years ago even pertaining to afundamental thing of life such as death, The Lord did not state that as a sin.So yeah, you can die? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that's why I'm a free thinker. But then againI can think of dying too and am probably more susceptible to Magase Ai's...incitement to kill, so... haha. Anyways, Alex then moved on to talk about thiswith two other people who will influence his decisions about this suicide lawthing as a leader. First, his wife. The wife wanted him to not think too much,since time is of essence (she isn't wrong) and you aren't typically given allthe facts before making the best decision, which is why intinuition becomes yournext important thing. Hey, not telling you guys to just think of death and godie haha, but she is not exactly wrong. I just hope that his intinuition is notgo to commit suicide lol. He then talked to Seizaki mainly on two things: why hewanted to be in the FBI and giving all the information as we have seen him inthe US so far, and why he wants Magase, uh, I mean, the devil, eliminated.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (We can't say that she's like that Harry Potter villian that needs anickname) Firstly, Seizaki revealed to Alex his actual intentions of being inthe FBI: to kill Magase. (oops) No surprise there, I mean, we should've known.So he's here to get a gun to kill whenever, basically. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, goes toshow how hard it is to do this at any occasion. Well, it's world affairs now sowhatever. Then, he talks about his story to the President. I would argue thatnow that he has revealed his intentions to Alex himself (his chest hurts a bitman, he felt that) about how he practically lost everyone around him (at work)because of this dumb woman, that he is here to take revenge. Again, not reallydirectly related to the law but considering that if the law is enacted and youstart losing your life and people around you and this snowballs, we will seemany more people dying for no reason. So yeah, that's bad, I guess. Oh also, atleast we know now that the family is in good hands considering Magase doesn'thave much time to influence that one guy who is protecting the family to killthe family or whatsoever so, good on you, bro. Alex then gave him what he askedfor: a gun by being in the FBI officially so he can<strike>kill that bitc</strike> do what's right haha, and a command to alwayslisten to his orders. The latter one, will probably come in use as a way to stophim from something in case he needs to. Hey, if it's to stop Seizaki fromkilling himself it's always welcome. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, we've got enough peopledying already another one just died this week, okay? Then, it's the Summit?Okay, the Prez be tuning in to Itsuki's speech on live television now too? Sonow Itsuki is bullsh*tting about how the suicide law cities can work together??WTF isn't this a solo thing in the first place? This is no longer about societywell-being already, this is politics. When's the last time you hear of a new lawthat everyone will gather in like, not inside the United Nations to talk about?So yeah, Itsuki's trying a revolution here, it seems. And at the end of thinkingfor at least two weeks day and night, I think Alex has an answer. He thoughtthat he doesn't have to be the one who is thinking about the <u>morality</u> ofthe suicide law. (Take note of the word I just used) Because, just like Itsuki,he just needs to act like a leader. And considering he's the world leader(ignoring China and North Korea lol) he can make the world not fall into thistrap. I mean, it'll take as many occasions of Magase's influence to get enoughpeople to kill themselves, but it only takes him to stop all of that. (AndSeizaki with a gun too probably haha) That... might be the focus of next week ashe calls for his world summit to work against the one put forth by Itsuki, Iguess. We shall see. This is getting to a point beyond human comprehension,people. I'm not going to tell you what I feel about this show now, but I cantell you something that Seizaki is right about as he always is: I want to seethat evil woman put down. And I guarantee you we will see it happen. And if shedoesn't die I'll go in and take an Anime gun and do it like those isekai showshaha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_jHe8F8JR3M/XiPE4cwvEVI/AAAAAAAA37k/fyaDpEGv_dccdvsVULfNeRyLbiEMM-eIQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon10_girl2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Here's a question in a thumbnail:<br />            What you do think is the right age to allow the suicide law to be            applicable?<br />            Because if not I'm pretty sure I'll be dead younger than this girl            lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FmYiA1Z7BNY/XiPE4alZ5_I/AAAAAAAA37g/WwKBCZ8UqIMrmDh9zeWo6stJzbEbJm-xQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon10_wife.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Gotta love that wife, you lucky bastard haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I'm a Master Thief" Okay 12-year-old don't let me call    the police on you haha  </div></blockquote>Nah, he's not gonna hold that secret I mean look at Makoto's face he can't evenkeep a secret lmao. In this new episode (#HatenaIllusion02) I learn that<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">TSUNDERE</a>HATENA-CHAN<a href="https://jisho.org/search/saikou" target="_blank">SAIKOU</a>!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>No seriously, this might become the only reason why I'll continue to watch thisseries haha. So, story time, because we got lots more to talk about on...everything, it seems. Hey, Makoto not being a female is already good enoughcontent for one episode so they gotta push the side characters to this week,yes? Haha so, we are introduced to more characters of this wonderful series butfirst, a story about Artifacts. Since this is still by far the most interestingpart of this show, we can learn a little more about it as described byHatena-chan. Artifacts are magical objects with a will, it seems, that were(probably ancestors but also) made by the mother. Problem is then, a good amountof them were stolen. (Why make so many in the first place?? lol) (Then againKokomi could also do this too lol later on that) Stolen probably to be used forbad purposes, since now a good amount of people know of these and could be usingthis for evil, or even for own benefit like auctioning this stuff. Hey, if it'smagical then it has great value even if you don't know how to use it. So once ina while the current Master Thief i.e. the mother, has to go "steal" back whatwas theirs to begin with, which is effectively just replacing it with an objectthat looks the same so the normal humans won't see the difference anyway. Andthat's why they call the mother the Master Thief. Of Artifacts. Haha not likewe're going to make a justice Robin Hood series out of this lol it's just takingback what's been stolen. And Hatena-chan is in line to succeed in her mother'sduty. She sucks, haha, but still, she is in training. Then, they go to school,and here is where the new slew of character introductions start. Cue KikyouinKokomi, <strike>Hatena-chan</strike> Kana-chan's childhood friend and classmatewho, amongst all things, keep talking about that other name in which as of nowshould be kept secret. What a d*ck friend, amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> There is morereason to this which we will talk about later, and Makoto somehow got a few newfriends at school like those guys (the biggest dude is real suspicious imo whoasked you to join the little boy gang lol) and probably picked up a few chicksin school by showing off his magic wand (which is surprisingly not his penislmao OKAY) and probably defending Hatena in the process (considering Ema-san isstudent council level busy). You know, because that silly girl keeps showing offthe magic stuff and probably is the one who gets the Artifacts stolen from themansion in the first place. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> So that's why. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> ANYWAYS, back inthe mansion, Makoto gets to take a break from school instead of doing butlerduties because there isn't anything to do at the time (that or the old geezer isreal good at it) so he gets to talk to Yumemi. Man, Yumemi-chan's room is thebest haha IS THAT A PX4?? Haha and in case you didn't notice her room is filledwith Artifacts which will probably protect her when needed. Problem number 2comes in during dinner where Kokomi suddenly shows up at her childhood friend'shouse to... well, besides finding out that Hatena is hiding a man at her place(thank goodness it's not her room lmao) (also, sweet female butler you gotthere), Kokomi is also here to search for an Artifact. Yeah, just any one, shedoesn't care. Unlike the Master Thief of her successor, this one... doesn't knowabout magic. So... it'll be practically impossible to get one under her commandanyways but man did the father promise something stupid and think it'll not comeback to bite on him. Oh well, the servants will clean up after this so... haha<span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Kokomi, and her family, turns out, is also part of a conglomerate (wow Ispelt that correctly first try I thought autocorrect was broken lol) which willsomehow take care of all administrative matters in this series, I'm sure. So sheknows everything. And after a good day's digging of someone else's place withoutsaying sorry, the girl leaves for the night. (I don't like the butler's grin atthe end, and she can fight too so) All in all, wonderful development for aseries that I might continue watching, to be honest. I mean, I'm already in forthe theme songs so this will do quite nicely for the season haha wtf is withthat ending lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JaZT8USFFbs/XiPQTXvlmuI/AAAAAAAA370/kMmu13Fzyp0FozqQZYSvE3AKvnlMqgpLgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion02_girls.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How you know you have successfully picked up chicks with your magic            skills haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nEMMDag1k_o/XiPQVaiySJI/AAAAAAAA374/Wsb8_eHQzJUzJKdmbZ3S0ftVw8TqMMFdwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion02_kokomi2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Nowhere close to porno, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Anyways, story because we have quite a lot to talk about.Firstly, the youkai in question this week as hinted last week. Well, there isn'tmuch of a hint besides the radio thing at the end and considering I still getmuch from it... oh well haha. (Okay I went back to see it again and it stillisn't much of a hint) So, it's about losing stuff. I mean, from Yashiro losingher textbook to missing locker doors, man is this getting from bad to worse realquick. We would expect Hanako-kun to take care of this but, uh, he's moreconcerned about keeping that one girls' toilet clean lol does he have OCD??<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For Yashiro, she rather spend her time helping other (male) senpai outwith paperwork though haha. I get you, girl, but both of you two are hopelesslmao. Okay, Yashiro has more friends than the one apparition so... lol. Too badfor Yashiro, it's her job now for being saved (technically) twice in an episode,so she kinda has to do this now after school every day. Man, there's evensurveillance for keeping up with this thing btw (which is also probably exposingher to danger tbh Hanako-kun you piece of sh-) and talking about that, someyoukai noticed that, for sure. Turns out, it's some youkai who keeps devouringon stuff which made people think their stuff got "lost" so Hanako did end uptaking care of it. Turns out, they are innocent little creatures who like toplay prank on humans from time to time. But things can be different in thiscase, and instead of letting the rumours spread negatively, Yashiro as a humancan help change the rumours to give these little beings (it's a plushie too btwgo look it up) a chance of being viewed positively because that's their purposein their youkai life, and to stop the weird stuff from happening where only theone girl can explain haha. So, the rumour now includes a reversal, where if yougive them candy they will not pester you. Sounds like a great trade-off, sothere's that. Secondly, we have a rival. Well, not as in love rival becauseYashiro doesn't have any (BOOM GOT HER haha), but we have someone to comeexorcise the one guy in the girls' toilet. I wouldn't call that exorcise sincebesides being an offence to be present in a girls' toilet as a male (lol), he istechnically evil. But as Yashiro said, we don't know anything about this ghost.So, cue Minamoto Kou (if you need a reminder he was confessed to multiple timesby girls but not Yashiro, and got bumped by her probably down the stairs andgiven terrible gifts like twice all in one episode lmao) who apparently is undera line of exorcists (nope this is not "Ao no Exorcist" I don't watch that weebshit lol) and is tasked (by himself) apparently to get rid of Hanako. I mean,the friendship is nice and all between the two just earlier, but then Hanako hadto fight back. And he won. Well, to a newbie in this, but still. He was akiller, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, considering this youkai has a knife for aweapon, this shouldn't be too surprising. And in what seems to be the mostamount of action (as in time, and as in intensity) we have seen thus far, thisis probably that side dish I'll end up remembering for this series, to say theleast. Of course, we will end up having to answer the question where thisex-killer will be able to<a  href="http://approachinese.com/dict/zh2en/%E9%87%91%E7%9B%86%E6%B4%97%E6%89%8B/"  target="_blank"  >clean his hands upon the gold pan</a>(sorry if this is a Chinese proverb) and not start splashing blood everywherebecause we've got a new rumour in the house!! Hey, if that fourth step on thestairs brings me to the "Spirited Away" world to be a servant it might be worsethan cleaning the toilet for some youkai haha cya next week<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7jb_ir1Suo/XiPb1M51MBI/AAAAAAAA38c/xDYvQYzTHFUj0P66lUqiALyNlCsNgizRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun02_aoi.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Cute youkai may be cute but cute classmate is better hehe kawaii          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n4YyyD08nAM/XiPb1mHk3XI/AAAAAAAA38g/PxIRrtdpk-MJXDPPF2dqyJqK6hUkdHVKACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun02_gay.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is so gay I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Well Kanade sure is not lol. In this new episode (#RikeKoi04) of aseries where it's focused on nothing but experiments instead of lovey-doveystuff although there is, this series is going to be literally "Kaguya-sama"episode 1 but it's every episode haha. Goddamn though if there is any Anime thatcan science up romance this much it's only this show, I guarantee you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>Let's <strike>talk about</strike> analyse this episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But seriously,this series is just making me laugh like an idiot while making me dumb, and Ilike it. So this episode, the duo go dating. And if you expected it to be anexperiment, you're not alone haha. And so far... I mean, it's only gettingbetter tbh. And thank goodness there's two other observers in with thisexperiment, or else the two might already be wrong from the start. Hey, thisAnime is not whatever tsukkomi Anime I rejected earlier so thanks Kanade-chanfor telling them to get clothing haha. And as expected, they had to plan on howto do this experiment, from how to come up with proper hypotheses to how totrack data and so on. Again, if you don't mind any of these this show is stillwatchable. Why? Because of the many romantic scenes here and they have to letthe two tap on their counter app on the times they felt something haha. Butseriously, it might be too much. The Anime sure knows how to reduce that as muchas possible in order not to lose audience like me though, as the bear literallygave up to explain too much so to not bore the rest of us. (Just Google"statistics normalisation" if you need to understand that) But otherwise, Himurois lovely af, Yukimura is going along with his intuition a lot more in this date(after arguing with the one guy who is trying to chat up his girl) than his owndeductions which is great. Also, the recording of data from the other two is thebest haha. There is technically also flexibility in this experient (lol), whereYukimura gave up in holding hands with his girl so to make Himuro feel so sad wecan only tell with the data that she is instead of looking at her face. Hey, whosays feelings in a date cannot be seen? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on and ignoring thatloser who got slapped by going out with some other girl lol (okay he did gotanalysed by two people on picking a girl up, so...), we move on to the next partof the date, which is the theme park. Hey, so stereotypical, you just need towatch enough Anime to know this is the place to go on dates. But heck, all alongthe way the couple is only talking about physics and scientific theories, fromroller coaster centripetal force to historical paranormal discoveries- Okay I'mtired haha I don't get grades for explaining these here anyways. (Sciencestudent here, by the way) All in all, besides the science stuff that can makethe show real dry after getting us wet (I mean, look at Himuro and hear herscream on the rides haha), there are certain scenes which I said, Yukimura didtake some initiative to make it look like a date than follow the experimentplan. For example, the present. I know it's still based heavily on scientificanalysis (yeah Yukimura why not analyse her vag-), but they are afraid ofheights while sitting on a Ferris Wheel haha, and the experiment was a success.Hey, at least we know Himuro was enjoying it lmao. Okay, and here's my ultimatumright here: Not going to do hypotheses, but if they can keep up this pace ofhaving something to talk about (scientifically and romantically) every week I'llwatch it. We shall see what they can cook up i.e. experiment plan for next week.But then again, right now I'm 65.2% sure I'll watch this series till the endhaha you thought you won't get stats from me??

In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri02) of this otheryoukai series, I've never seen a serpent want a beautiful woman's body that badlmao. Okay images of snakes eating up humans whole are surfacing already solet's talk about this quick haha. Hmm... if you are still okay with mysterytalks every episode to a bunch of youkai who won't give up on explanations likeyour mom then... hey, I'm liking it because it's rather peaceful tbh. So, thestory of the week is a serpent. Kotoko was summoned to the river a town awaybecause the "Water God" living there has something to clarify on. Hey, it bemore persistent than the best detectives out there, and this will take a lot ofexplanation it seems, but she seems bent on going anyways. She's been given thetitle of God of Wisdom, after all. If Kotoko wants a backup plan by calling onKuro-san who literally saved her last episode, it's no wonder it sucks when herejected the offer. Also, having regeneration skills like Kuro would be realuseful in many occasions if he didn't also take in another corpse other than amermaid to cancel his immortality. Man, this show is complicated haha. So yeah,that's how it is for now, so we'll leave what that other one is that he ate fornext time. Meanwhile, Kotoko has to go up to the mountains alone... aftervisiting Kuro-san again in the evening in hopes he would join, and man is hereally cooking up soup for dinner lol. Kuro gets her ready for the mountain triphaha, and off she went. Alone, of course, and he snatched a youkai as a promisefor coming back alive, I guess. It was quite a long debate going on so I won'tbore you with the story if you aren't as interested, but a murder case likelytied to a third person with someone covering it up... so far won't explain whythat one woman who admitted she was the killer threw the corpse into the riverthe God drinks water from. Hey, she couldn't find anywhere else, can? It was thenearest place she could go at night why you have to rat it out on her?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>I'm pretty sure if I said that I'll be removed of my duties by being eatenimmediately haha. So... I don't know man. You guys enjoyed it? The jokes inbetween somehow got me going though, but to be honest I may get real bored ifit's always like this every week. But I'll try. I saw the original work a littleand there are several arcs with the first major one coming out soon so we shallsee. For next episode...

I reallymissed her when she was in Victor, to be honest. A cute her is better than coolher imo. Now, for past releases. <b>Play.Goose's first album</b> (yep, the guyswho were in Goose house) was... said to be the answers to the previous songs,and... not that I cared about that in the lyrics because I don't, but I couldpick up a song or two just to remember, so sure I'll continue to listen to themmaybe. <b>Dido's latest album</b> as I have given her one song years ago is...different than her usual style, but that doesn't mean I can't give her a song ortwo. I'll give myself another week to sink in on this.<b>Cider Girl's new album</b> which released last week apparently wasn't toobad, but it's definitely not great enough for me to talk about itenthusiastically (man what is with songs today), nonetheless though I will givechance. Last but not least,<b>Anime "Kyokou Suiri" opening theme song single</b> which released even beforethe Anime previewed it this week, released last week and... it's a band alright.It's... just not the ones I'll be liking. They are J-Rock too so that's ratherbad on their reputation haha. Which will be complimented by the fact that I mayend up dropping the Anime after all, so don't feel about it, yes? I show noemotion to songs that suck-<br /><br />I can imagine what it feels like when vivid undress writes their first Animetheme song- Please don't be like them haha<br /><br />Next week brings us a slew of releases which I don't know if I'll like but we'llsee. These range from <b>Tachibana Rika's first album</b> after she started acouple of years ago and I've literally given her nothing besides the recent songwhich I probably will start doing AFTER she got married (lol no relation btw),<b>Uesaka Sumire's new album</b> literally based on the one single which rockedthe world last year so I'm not anticipating much hearing whatever that topicsong is about (it's her quirk and I don't like it), and<b>Base Ball Bear's new album</b> since their band turned three-piece last yearand I started giving them more songs, so this might be the most anticipatingone. And considering it's holiday season next weekend I'll have plenty of timeto decide all of the above sure enough. Music subscriptions are making this realeasy to do so, by the way so FUCK YOU SPOTIFY-<br /><br />I would love to write a post about how well Spotify and its ad-driven servicecompares to the Apple Music Japan subscription I pay for now but that'll have towait until I have the time to type a lot- Oh yeah my subscription I have torenew haha<br /><br />Talking about new news across the Internet, of course, about music for KlassicNote, I'm probably not going to get hyped about<b>TrySail's new single</b> considering their previews didn't hook me in at all,<b>fumika surprised us with a new single</b> with her which I've not heard yethaha, <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song</b> for a.. college festival projectis written by yuiko-san in which I cannot express how great she sounds singingsolo, and <b>Anime "Kaguya-sama" is airing next season</b>. Welp Attack on TitanSeason 4 because you will be forgotten haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This shall be it then. I also clicked the order button on my last photobook forthe year which starts on my birthday and this 10th book will probably appearnext month which is... Kitou Akari's 1st photobook. Because she's gettingpopular. I'll save the talk on the actual post itself, but suffice it to say Ihad to wait for the pre-order sign event ticket chance to expire on Monday?Yeah, before I could order because I probably won't go even if I get it and Idon't really want to rob others the chance of winning one which will probablynot be of my concern lol. Hey, good guy me, but not like Akarin will know. Butwe are getting good side dishes along with the book (talking about special giftslol), so I'll look forward to that. Cya guys next week, and until next time... Iwant to finish that Harvest Moon Mineral Town game before the new AnimalCrossing game comes out. I just need to marry someone haha hardest decisions ingames amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Haha bye<br /><br />P.S. Windows 10 has been doing me well so far I just don't know why my mousescrolling has been bad ever since I changed OS the keyboard was after that and Istill have the problem<br /><br />P.P.S. Not going to make a post about it, but this year's calendar is... sphere.It's probably bad enough to compare to the table fold-around calendar fromMikakoshi since it's all live footage images so I'm not showing you guys what'sinside. Ugh this year sucks haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="1200"          data-original-width="1600"          height="240"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s5RRsqhWlr0/XiRQiDV3ZrI/AAAAAAAA3-U/DP5okhUjxl0qIdOjSkUrBqBp4Q_z0KJ2ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_20200106_213717.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Really, it's literally 12 pages, sorry, I mean, SIX pages of this stuff        because they can't take better images <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
