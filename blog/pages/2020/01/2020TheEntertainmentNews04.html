To all those who celebrate it of course. Otherwise, Ihope you had a great weekend haha I tried my best to watch these whilst goingout tbh it was hard to do it though as you will see I've rushed through 2/3 ofthese in one night<br /><br />If you see anything going amiss with the blog, please do tell. ApparentlyBlogger changed their HTML template without warning me and I swear something waslost in the process of me saving it while adding features to here and then I hadto fix it and at some point removed some js I wrote since the last time I backedit up SERIOUSLY MAN<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span><br /><br />So far it's only the arrows on the labels on mobile view which I will have toredo again but otherwise I hope nothing is lost I lost my mind on it on ChineseNew Year Eve though MOTHERFU- Let's begin haha<br /><br />Edit: Might be changes to facilitate the new UI, so technically if I create anew blog now I DID THAT SIX MONTHS AGO YOU PIECE OF-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Babylon11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    *speechless* I can't take any quote from them they are all bullsh*t haha  </div></blockquote>To be honest? I think that thinking about it in economics aspect will work itsbest by asking the question "what would a rational person do" in approval of thesuicide law? Now it suddenly becomes easier. You're welcome, Alex. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Inthis probably pivotal episode (#Babylon11) we hold two international summits.Well, that's how them leaders do it to solve problems, hold summits, sowhatever. Don't ask me how they got the approval to hold that one Suicide Summitfrom the Japanese leader, but he's useless, whatever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> First, the actualsummit. They can't really name that summit over the real name, so they gotta usea fake one, replace the SEVEN leaders with... similar ones although I wouldargue that French leader is not a real replica haha, and they... talked aboutmorality. Yep, Alex did it. It was initially about the standpoints of the statesand why they have such a view, from Canada, to France, to the UK, to Germany...but that's not all important. That's because, Alex wants to talk about good andevil. And among all the discussion, two morality stories were mentioned. Thattrolley one-save-five question that you should've learnt in school because ifyou don't then your education system sucks lol, and a similar one but this onegot ripped apart to save five from organ failure haha. (Magase might betriggered by this, please) But the leaders got more confused and deep into thequestion of what is right, because anything that is not evil can be right.Should morality then be based on this? Well, that's at least how they think now,and are deviating from it though. But if you think that saving one than five issinful because you killed the one instead of an accident happen, and that's howMagase can take advantage of that and kill one by one with this assumption.That... I don't think is a good ending haha. Remember, we are driving thattrolley to the split section right now we can't turn back. And so, Alex is stillthinking even further until... they cut to Itsuki and his speech. But seriously,where's our Magase Sensor? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh Seizaki is right there haha gotta put himin the center so we can know if anything weird happens haha. So, the actualsummit got disrupted by the one Itsuki Summit which I shall refer to insteadbecause why not he's the hero now (lol), he's going to live broadcast someonejumping off the building again. Man, besides the reality talk of me wanting thisto stop (*gets axe flashbacks* <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>), Itsuki also brought a good amount ofpeople to witness this in Shiniki. And thus, he proposes that Alex talk to theone person who can't decide to commit suicide. And surprise surprise, if youdidn't think it's anyone else considering it's a female too, it's Magase. Yep,the author literally wrote until he cannot answer himself anymore haha. Becauseif you are impulsive like a normal person then you would persuade her fromcommitting suicide because that's what negotiators do in those police dramas.But this is "Babylon", ladies and gentlemen who don't want to die. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>Conventional thought doesn't exist in this show already. So, the evil hasfinally surfaced. What can we do now? It seems like it's just a rational talkand Alex can win, but you gotta think deeper (like him) and question theintentions of doing such a thing, kind of like a practical experiment where onestep and... well besides falling down the building, will cause millions ofpeople to change their decisions about life. Can he do it though? If he talks toher then he'll eventually be dead though ALEX NO~!! Man, this is going to be funto watch. Not the death, I mean. Again, this is the most I have thought of stuffin an Anime in years RikeKoi has nothing on this series haha we're done thinkingfor the week<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9s4TERzjFWc/XixS8USt7sI/AAAAAAAA4IQ/4LNhRt30ewQMXpunn6zuLQNozKfbWftSACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon11_g7.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Very inconspicuous, by the way, allowing this name to pass through            haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6z3rC6fJD0Y/XixS9QCqRUI/AAAAAAAA4IU/yfmkKzJceO4CRVeVntoPZtlZ3bELuW9yACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon11_leaders.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Man, do any of these faces give you a good reference of the leaders            today?

Okay I may be dumb to realise this until now, but yeah it's literallyreferencing Alexander as The Thinker in that sculpture, in case you aren't awareof its existence.<br />P.P.S. Just as a joke answer, I want to allow suicide in society only on onecondition: they must sacrifice their value to society before death. So we'll getrid a good bunch of poor people who are suffering even as they speak (lolsorry), maybe get rid of some of the rich and earn some state funds out of it(haha), and... maybe the world will be more balanced. It'll probably ruin thestock market every other day with all the rich dying but... haha because again,influence does not take part in my decision and probably all of theirs if youthink about it<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It's been a month since I came here" I've learnt nothing new haha poor    Makoto  </div></blockquote>I'm pretty sure if your mom gives you the most precious family treasure she isgoing to risk her life for something. Mama no~!! Okay we made a similar joke onBabylon haha. In this new episode (#HatenaIllusion03) of a series I will begiving I guess, the animation is really bad. Like, you saw the fight scenes,right? I can't... really. Okay, here's how I will still eventually give thisseries. I mean, you can see if this is still around next week haha. Now, story.They got a bath scene after what seems to be the girls soaked in rain (that'sreally important must mention that Makoto got hit in the face twice haha also noone wants to look at you Hatena did you look at Mariah?), but also to the pointthanks to Kokomi-chan, the two sat down to clarify all their misunderstandingsso far. So yeah, as of Episode 1, Hatena thought that Makoto was female. I mean,she didn't think that far, but then again she probably doesn't know of gender asa kid so... sure. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also, that tsundere said it. That she's been waitingfor him. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> To become magician partners, of course, in case you werewondering haha. Hey, she's 12 she can do this stuff. Confession it is for surethough, I would admit. And so, as the cloud clears in the night ofunderstanding... something got stolen. Hey, shouldn't have had that sleepoverhaha. And since the mansion should have defences from outside, we can easilyguess who's the rat here. I KNEW we shouldn't have trusted her, that Mariah.THAT B*TCH!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And so, the hunt is out for her. Using some Artifact thatwill probably claim Yumemi as the hacker of the series, she managed to locateMariah's location at the docks. (But of course) So Hatena went for her, theMaster Thief in-practice. And since she's not experienced, you can expect acouple of mishaps along the way. She almost fell down from the sky and thisseries would have ended lmao. (RIP author) She reached and is probably feelingreal hot (HELL YEAH haha she's 12 btw don't imagine things), and here's wherethe beating up starts haha. Hatena is obviously weak against her opponent, whois revealed to be the sister of her mother (hey aunt where's my red packet lol#CNYfeels) and is of course, taking it to produce more Artifacts to earn aliving or whatever. Again, whatever I mentioned last week is true this act israther immoral but not like anyone else besides the Hishisato family cares aboutthat besides its potential. In what happens to be a real defeat and probablyHatena's short life (lol)... we can cue the hero now haha. So something happenedat the mansion, and through Makoto's sheer will he became a magician?? Okay. Andnow his stick is called... "smile stick" GODDAMMIT WHY MUST YOU BE THECARDCAPTOR haha also isn't that a really lewd name? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And that's why youdon't let kids name things at 12 lmao okay Muff-kun is fine haha. He comes in tosave the girl (Hatena, I mean), and manages to snatch back the treasure. Intheir argument, and I would like to argue against Mariah, and that's why themother is preventing all this from happening because you're doing it? You knowthat's already evil, right? Oh well, and she left. But she'll be back. Hopefullywhen the mother is around maybe lol she's probably not that dumb. And... thisbrings us to the first part of the series I guess. I mean, is it not obviousthat you have to make a judgement to watch this series now? But to be frank,just from this episode? There are easily a lot of plot holes. Firstly, Mariah'slocation as they sleep. Not that they should cover it so it wouldn't besuspicious, but it's so secret? And in Hatena's room too? How could she not haveknown? I just think it's rather absurd haha. Then, is Makoto's power. He justSUDDENLY got his powers? And yes despite it being invisibility and shield isthat all he can do?? I mean, APoL has way more action scenes than that hahaalthough I would argue they aren't. Nonetheless, I still think this is weak fora premise for an Anime, and not that I have a long portfolio of watching magicgirl Anime, but this one man... is not really making the cut. I'm notcriticising of the author to be honest, but I feel it lacks substance. In manyways than other. The theme songs are great so far, I would say. Everythingelse.. you can watch the animation again I'm not going to comment BLEACH had ahigher budget than this China-fuelled production lmao we'll see if we will seeyou next week I may continue this for Yumemi-chan and if Hatena gets drenchedagain hehe come on they chased out the big chested woman what have I left towatch? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jVczWLjzSiA/XixgtkpKEaI/AAAAAAAA4Ik/1c9dOPohDAstFVlE1pBXlxelTR9SLSDxgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion03_yumemi2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Not me as a programmer haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W7doQO3GgZ8/XixguwX6FCI/AAAAAAAA4Io/KAvgspRou1M-N5IOMH4tqk2TSCtt--1ZACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion03_mamoru2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The father is still by far, the coolest character so far imo          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Do you have a partner?" Yeah it's a    half-ghost haha *frantic look*  </div></blockquote>In this new episode (#HanakoKun03) of probably my favourite series this season,we... just lost Yashiro's best friend. Yep, RIP cutest girl in the story; youwill be missed. Haha okay probably not but man, must they make it freakish?Well, at least it won't be gory like the other youkai one I'm reviewing haha. Soin this new episode, we have a new Seven Wonder of the school to talk about.This time, as hinted last week if it's not obvious enough, it's about a flightof stairs. I'll do this summary in a more complete manner since it deserves to.According to Hanako, there are many places in the school which can bring thingsfrom the human world to the spiritual world. Think a bit like that alternateworld in Anime "Kekkaishi" made by that Byakuya if I didn't remember wrongly orthose temporary worlds made by Anime characters with special powers, like theone doll house from Bungo Stray Dogs or BLEACH. In this case, it's a step on thestairs. Remember, the rumour will stay as long as people believe. But once youstep on it, you will be forgotten forever. Everyone. Even your family will notremember you- I SWEAR this is EXACTLY taken from<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/10163/C__The_Money_of_Soul_and_Possibility_Control"  target="_blank"  >an original Anime I liked back in 2011</a>you sure Aoi is not spending Midas Bank money? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Then again how did thisrumour stick on for so long if the victims are gone... Anyways, Yashiro got realworried when her bestie Aoi was completely lost from the human world so nosurprise, this was probably done by a youkai. Ignoring what else Hanako could bedoing in the day (probably spying on other girls in the girls' toilet lmao),Yashiro managed to get him after school to investigate this incident. Of course,Minamoto who we saw last week, also lost some girls who were probably supposedto come confess to him lol. So yep, the guys decide to just go into the worldand check for themselves. Of course, the rumour isn't as bad as it sounds, asyou wouldn't get ripped apart immediately as you enter. But the challenge hereis then to listen to the youkai's demands as again what Hanako mentioned, theyoukai are masters of their spiritual realm, so going against it would not be awise choice. So, they were tasked to find amongst all the... stuff lying around,body parts that would satisfy the youkai's demands. And there's a time limittoo. They managed to survive the first one (I will legit cry if they shippedYashiro in half, I tell you), but there are many more. Again, I like how Hanakocan talk about her weakness and then realise they still have to get to the endwhich is probably the center of the spiritual world in order to try out if thatweakness exists haha. I liked the ecchi jokes here and there (it's two male andone female btw so not surprised at jokes considering Hanako is a-), andeventually they reached the end. I wouldn't want to spoil too much because apartfrom the wonderful animation I've praised since episode 1, the story was verywell adapted from start to end. Never at a point did I think this plot was dumb,but then again, it could use some improvement. But I enjoyed it, so yeah, I'mdefinitely giving this one. Between that ero-daikon who wants a pair of tits(lol), to a pervert for a half-ghost to some...<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kouhai" target="_blank">kouhai</a>? I don'tknow, he keeps calling Yashiro a senpai isn't she also first year in highschool? Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All in all, I really enjoyed what I've seen thus far:the flow, the jokes, and everything in between whatever Yashiro has on her chestwhich is nothing lmao. We shall get a proper conclusion next week on this, and Idoubt the trio will get away with this Seven Wonder that easily. What happenedto Seven Wonder No.1? Is it the found &amp; lost youkai?

In this new episode (#RikeKoi03) come on I SWEAR this is Kaguya-samahaha if you need references you can start from there and let this nonsense endfirst haha I watch every week so in case you don't. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, for this theywere planning for a date...? I have a feeling I'm not watching a flashback fromwhat I saw last week but, uh... let's leave at that for now it's okay. (See endof review for answers) Ahem, they had to plan a date. Well, Kanade-chansuggested them to plan a date because that's the easiest way to show how coupleslove one another, to build up their relationship by spending time with eachother. I would argue that Kanade-chan again, as of now, still has the closest toany experience of dating considering that they asked the one guy who likes Animegirls for an opinion in which Yukimura praised him wildly about (yay me) andthen shit on him immediately for being too excessive in love (haha loser), andthe other childhood friend is into BL haha wtf HIMURO YOU TOO?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Heyguys we still have a BGR (boy-girl relationship) type of Anime to make soplease? Ahem, anyways, and Himuro seems really uncertain about everythingsomehow, this relationship. She then thinks back, when asked by Kanade-chan onher confidence in whatever she is doing now, on the time she was determined anerd and bullied in school just by liking bugs. Hey, them kids also used to playwith crickets, why bully the girl? Come on, we know I am the real hero she needslol. So yeah, she was bullied hard, but some boy came to her to explain how muchher interests and passion can be turned eventually into a dream career she candesire and motivate to work towards. And that kid grew up to be... SOMEBODY MAKETHE JOKE!! THAT BOY IS YUKIMURA, RIGHT?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ugh this Anime hurts meinternally and I like haha thanks Kanade-chan for the save. These two cannot getany dumber this is literally Kaguya-sama it makes me want to scream into thevoid. Anyways, the two spent a lot of time planning the perfect date on all thethings couples would do during one to the extent of when going to an amusementpark, to plan the most efficient route for finishing them at the fastest timethis is not about dating anymore haha. Kanade-chan is real good at it though sheis researching on... Mocho I didn't get you it's called travelling what?? Hahathat bear. (Also the reason I knew I watched in the wrong order, read on) Andthen, to end it off, the guy has to ask the girl out on a date. Hell yeah thismight be the best part of the episode. And so next week is.. them going on adate again?? I'm really confused. Don't tell me they are testing the firstchapter thing in the manga in Anime too? WTF?? Ugh we shall see next week butfrom what I see it... I might be in the wrong order. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Okay, realised itjust now because them subs screwed me up real hard so... we'll be watchingepisode 2 next week. We watched episode 4 last week. Well, so much for a gooddate. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Cya guys next week haha we'll get it right in two weeks whenepisode 5 comes out<br />[TL:DR; Kanade-chan is going to be fuel for me watching this show every weekprovided I can get the episode order correct ugh]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aNBnX_X-aW0/Xi2uH04CsgI/AAAAAAAA4Kg/xs-rxErgn-0cb35iJN9aWIo4NgvVDmiXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi03_sleep.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is as wrong as it is awesome I want to see it happen they did            it in Kaguya-sama haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_Qw8H4bmk4k/Xi2uJkH3leI/AAAAAAAA4Kk/-pS94jljONUxUQVNspMiAGqxEOuPjCrHgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi03_kanade2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            That's irl me and my internal tsukkomi role shining through the            light lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Hmm... in this newepisode (#KyokouSuiri03) in which I have to decide to give or not... How can Inot give? Let's talk about it. Because in this episode they actually gave us alarger worldview and an actual plot after dealing with whatever River God whichKotoko-chan had to go to the mountains to talk to from last week. Man, that wasquite a drag. I don't think it's a reminder of what the series would be goingdown the line, because later half of the episode sheds a different light on thewhole series altogether. Firstly, the talk with the serpent. Kotoko-chancontinued from last week and ending on a conclusion that the supposed murderer,the woman, was hiding something else besides the one murder because... she hasdumped a corpse into the river before? Yeah, it might sound ridiculous, butwhatever it takes to give a good explanation to the God, man. BecauseKotoko-chan explained it as such, that after breaking up with the boyfriendthinking that he killed someone in which we learnt from the police that hedidn't because the boss came into her place to confess, the girlfriend had tothrow away stuff to forget about the guy. But, the only thing she was not beable to throw away, is a baby. So yep, this show is gross, they really showed afetus in this series which means this can only air on national television waaaayinto the night lol. So yeah, and that's how the woman also knew to "dispose" ofthe evidence to incite the police after the interrogation to search the riverfor... the fetus after realising the boyfriend was not at fault. You know, realweird relationship things. That's how you save a relationship?? Lol but then theGod cleans up the river every now and then, so... It probably is hard to traceat this point. Storytelling complete. The snake would love to ask more questionsbut Kuro-san is here so I guess it stopped haha. So, let's hope it'll stay thatway; the case is even more creepy than the threat of explaining to the God why abody was disposed at the lake it drinks water from haha. Moving on a couple ofyears, and our first major arc villian appears. It's a youkai called "Steel LadyNanse", and I promise you, I may just continue to watch this series because if Ido it's because of BOOBS!!! I mean, she is not normal haha. Also, no face. Yeah.Not normal even for a youkai haha. A female police inspector was talking to hersuperior about this case, and recent cases concerning the youkai ending otherpeoples' lives. Again, you can refer to Hanako-kun I guess, but rumours areneeded to keep the youkai alive, and she is technically fulfilling it so... ugh.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Still, it is a problem even for police standards with all the reportingof cases and people dying, so it has to be discovered in truth. Truth is, thefemale inspector can see things. Youkai, I mean. Obviously the superior can't,but then it's also because she saw a kappa one day at the river. Yep, flashbackto episode 1, ladies and gentlemen. So Kuro-san was not the kappa as I said lol,but the kappa was speaking in fear of Kuro-san, whom we know now is technicallyimmortal because of the mermaid which he ate- go read last week's review haha.So, she was real scared of it, his girlfriend... and yes, Saki-chan is a policeinspector. It all comes together. That's why I can still argue this is stillgoing to be worth the watch because besides the fact that the loop is completeand the police technically can help settle this too maybe they can't seeanyways, but you know helping with local authorities is rather important foryoukai who like to wreck havoc in a peaceful city. So, if you don't see metalking about this next week then good chances I'll be skipping it THOSE BOOBSTHOUGH haha also I need to get over giving one of the theme songs as my ownrequirement and I don't really want to give Miyano Mamoru for the ending themesong and I did say Uso to Chameleon was not great last week so... we shall seethen. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7CW3GJscPOA/Xi26KkfW49I/AAAAAAAA4LE/0ShOrlOAQ6Ix0kY200wk6479d6QJey3pwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyoukosuiri03_saki1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Since this might be the last episode I'll be watching here's lovely            Saki-chan<br />            (I'm ignoring that youkai Nanase for judgement btw that's a            distraction lol)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qd4BFhJyn38/Xi26L3cjnkI/AAAAAAAA4LI/2HnzUcpQx3ozvgmQp-ep3sPR_oJnnz_dQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyoukosuiri03_kotoko3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when I was asking to get punched in the face haha literally          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

This week was a long week of releases because basically there'sthree albums so we will go through them real quick:<b>Base Ball Bear's new album</b> was quite a disappointment considering nothinghit me in particular and the topic songs I've heard thus far from last year wasbetter than even the album topic song which I didn't like,<b>Uesaka Sumire's new album</b> is... very sumipe, so I'm not giving much and Ionly tried to give one song so you can guess which one it is it's got to do withthe night warrior haha what, and <b>Tachibana Rika's 1st album</b> is... okay atbest, because once again the only thing stopping me to give more songs from heris not her voice but the songs. It's like a huge trash dump the composers aredumping their sub par quality creations to let her sing because they know itwill sell. Sorry for being harsh on that but despite I still gave a couple ofsongs because... I want to give her chance, really. With respect to that thoughwe might not have any more chances considering she's married and she probablywon't have time to do this anymore I guess. Singing., I mean. And this isn't it,everyone. <b>Liyuu's debut single</b> for Anime "Hatena Illusion" shall becomemy first Klassic Note Review this year because I have come full circle tosupport a Chinese cosplayer singing Japanese songs lol,<b>TrySail's new single</b> is... only good on the B-side and it's obligatorythat I give them a listen every time in which I did, and<b>Game "Alternative Girls" new character song single</b> is... I didn't knowTWEEDEES was behind one of the two songs I'm taking the other because it's abetter song and the lyrics were written by the seiyuu herself. Juuri... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Sorry, internal joke only fans who watched that OG livestream series will knowhaha<br /><br />Next week brings us more releases despite me having not holiday season overhere, as <b>Waki Azumi's debut single</b> is finally ready for release. I...probably wouldn't be giving FOUR songs for it to be on my shelf, but we'll see.It's one song so far after hearing the music video earlier this year whereearlier is literally on New Year's Day haha. And since this is the only releasefor the week I'll be ready to listen to, I'll go back to a couple of releasesI've missed mostly from the Anime I'm watching this season as above, like<b>Suzuki Aina's new album</b> which has "Hatena Illusion" ending theme song,for example.
