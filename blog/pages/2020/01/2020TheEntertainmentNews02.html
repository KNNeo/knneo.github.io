Let's hope I have time to finish all these today.<br /><br />If you don't see SIX reviews of Anime by Sunday, then good chances I don't havetime for all of them since I have to deal with so much work over the weekendbecause people get work leave and I technically just changed departments anddon't know half the things and the team, whatever they are thinking about.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's continue before I start b*tching about them lol<br /><br />Also, I'm giving most of them a chance first so if you don't see a full reviewmeans I didn't enjoy it. I can stop halfway through an episode, by the way.Built from experience of watching Anime for a decade haha you gain resistancetowards terrible shows<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Babylon09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Why don't you go through the normal processes?" Me when I try to complain    to higher-ups without asking my boss haha that poor mayor  </div></blockquote>Hey, FINALLY we get some answers. The President did not do anything, to behonest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In the new episode (#Babylon09) I think we have waited a longtime but, we finally know what is causing all the cities to start adopting thesuicide law. I mean, those motherf**kers probably did not even know about thelaw or even know about Japan, but yet... Okay, let's talk about it. Firstly, thePresident is worried. So, he has to make phone calls. At least, to warn thecities of the consequences of adopting the suicide law haphazardly. This, is forshort term deterrence. So even if anything evil is happening behind the scenes,he can still stop them from making it to reality. Next, the FBI is called. Andguess who's the new investigator on the line. Welcome Seizaki, but heck in thiscase is he speaking English, Japanese English or Japanese to the Americans?<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, yay him, and he may even get appointed as an official member,but his immediate superior suggested such a promotion mainly because, apart fromthe other 2 reasons, that he is dangerous. Seizaki... is not dangerous as in theway that he can kill. He is dangerous because he's volatile, I would argue. Evenas we watch this series we still can see him twitching once in a while to hisown hallucinations of Magase, receives text messages somehow in the USA fromMagase, and still not get confined by the FBI lol. Even the dumbest person inthe FBI would also know to investigate on Seizaki himself, which I hope for thesake of themselves, they would probably do that by now. However, he is usefulnow since he knows a lot of info, has direct contact with Magase, and can helpsee what happens in the recent cities that announced such a thing. He went toHartford with a buddy (RIP, for starters) (I'm not jinxing it but still) andwith some investigations found out that the Mayor of the area recently went toan old folks' home, and received a phone call. Yep, it's Magase Ai again.Besides the obvious trigger for Seizaki to which he should TOTALLY tell hisbuddy about ("Hey bro, I'm aroused by this" lmao), we also get to actually knowwhat Magase is doing in detail which made people change their decisions to theextent of remove their will to live. Although I would argue that does this workon free thinkers? Haha I am so... Anyways, she may have different ways to talkto people about this or else she would be caught in the act already, so let'shope she screws up the one time and gets ripped apart by Seizaki- Don't worrythat won't happen. I do hope for Seizaki's sake that he doesn't getdouble-crossed by the FBI and die an innocent death without explaining what heis experiencing through as of now, to be honest. This is going to end well, nomatter which direction we take haha. Then again, I would like a surprise ending,and with Seizaki's volatile character as of now, it might just happen. We shallsee then this is getting REAL exciting hehe I am not evil btw haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HWqfA4MeCp0/XhswY15fM6I/AAAAAAAA3yc/JI7eZYI7Hjov0Wl-7Hg_3bKuH7-BnhhUwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon09_seizaki.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        All the other characters aren't as cool as this guy so he shall do for        now haha      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. "When you die, it's over" Haha yeah Dr. Magase you being a scientist andinfluencing me with your scientific studies in the face of religion? lol I don'tcare I DIE WHENEVER I WANT haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    If you are a Master Thief, does that mean you are not punishable by law?    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;  </div></blockquote>In this incredibly flashy opening of a series, the first episode(#HatenaIllusion01) gives us the main perspective of the plot and everythingelse that exists in general. I don't really know why I decide to pick this oneup, but I did think along the lines of "if this isn't Tejina Senpai I'll watch"kind of way lol. Firstly, what happened. When you have a childhood kid who savedyou when your were young(er) (she's 12), you'll be darned she'll be BFFs withyou after you grow up. For Hatena-chan though, that might not be the case.Problem? She thinks her childhood friend was a female. Oops. People make thosemistakes as a kid. The production probably made a mistake already letting afemale voice Makoto (I checked, it's a guy haha), who is in fact, a male. Yep, aman is one without a chest haha I thank the Anime for not going for... you know."I see someone has grown a d*ck" haha <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay, lame sex jokes aside lmao,the family of Hatena-chan is welcoming his return, mainly for apprenticelearning from the parents who are themselves, professional magicians. Well, justbefore we continue, the worldview is magical, but not as in Madoka Magica lol,but of the<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tejina" target="_blank">tejina</a> level butstill rather crazy levels, I would argue. (I mean, teleportation or illusionmagic? Well hello, David Co**erfield) Okay, back into the plot. So Makoto waskind of lost reaching that mansion of the professional magicians family, (Imean, you can just bring the kid to the nearest police post and be on your way-Oh yeah, he was lost too. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) but hey, upon the realisation of truth fromHatena-chan the parents already are busy with work I assume, leaving the houseand such. So... what do you do with a guy inside the house? I mean Hatena-chan,what about the old butler? So yeah Makoto joins the old man as a butler, aftersomehow "accidentally" breaking an Artifact (we shall come to that later) of thestoreroom in which this poor bloke is living in for the moment, now has tocompensate for it because the family maid Ema decided he has to. I mean, is shethe fourth wall of this series or what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, as much as we stand byher side to want to see this development happen between the two, Makoto alsoleft good impressions on everyone in general. He gave a small gift inappreciation of meeting Hatena's younger sister Yumemi (GAMERS UNITE lol), isstill very respectful to others especially now the father is his<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shisho" target="_blank">shisho</a>, the motherrepaired his wand for him when he was young anyway FLASHBACK!! So yeah, the dogbroke it years ago, and perhaps the parents should help repair Hatena's brokenheart since she can't live with this guy in the house somehow lol. Now,impressions. I liked the theme songs and with time probably I will anyways, andit isn't Tejina Senpai. There actually is a plot here with all the mystery fromthe house of traps (if you walk the wrong corridor lol), to the mother creatingan Artifact maybe disguising it as a repair to Makoto's wand... there seems tobe much to talk about even for one cour, and I think I can watch it. Threeepisode rule, I suppose. And considering I can talk about it this much I thinkI'll like it. Hey, give me a new couple by the end of the series and... itprobably won't top other romance Anime I intend to watch even this season sowhatever haha I'll enjoy a good laugh though they are easy to anticipate<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cKWLmzfpMfs/Xhsw7_Db0RI/AAAAAAAA3yk/AVaueljyrGonpOZ3bd8ivgWLF7o7gq4lgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion01_kana1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Really, this is modern-day Shana-chan if I ever saw it (and I did)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bh2yf0hfw2w/XhsxAVlx89I/AAAAAAAA3yo/PxxEffD4qt0aWVbrOMqfq5IdFmqOOmRbgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion01_ema3.jpg"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This girl is literally asking for a couple to be made.<br />            I see we are standing on the same side haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

In this fabulous first episode(#HanakoKun01) I didn't expect to like, we are brought to a real yet surrealuniverse. Nope, not your next isekai world by any means; We are still in amodern day school lmao. The school, just like any school in Japanese Anime(lol), has seven wonders. Well, some have more but. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And the seventh,because if we talk about the first six it'll take three seasons lol, is anapparation in the girls' toilet. Yeah, you can see where this is going haha.This apparation though, can fulfill one wish in exchange of something from you.So Yashiro - this innocent, cute, love-struck and down with love luck girl -comes to ask for <strike>his</strike> <strike>her</strike> his help. Initiallyit was all but a joke, as he gives more practical approaches to getting the guyshe likes. Then again, she did mention her case as trying to find someone elseto piss off the one person she confessed to earlier in school, so... asHanako-san said truthfully and I agree, anyone will do. So... I hope you didn'trealise the plot twist now, because we still have ways to go haha. Realisticapproaches don't work (really, giving him vegetables from your own plantationwouldn't work lol), so here comes the not-so-realistic ones. Yashiro found apouch of mermaid's scales (they come in two, just so you wonder), and shethought this might be it. Well, she's not right though, as Hanako-san tries toexplain what they are and... she swallowed it. Well damn, that sucks, becauseit's a curse. And also because since she didn't give the other to someone elseie. someone she likes, the scales won't form a bond and... Yashiro becomes afish. Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This show is real amazing at how it can play aroundwith this spiritual stuff, I would argue. But a fish isn't complete in theapparation world without its master, so... cue the mermaid. I mean, if youthought the mermaids in Pirates movie series were disgusting, this one will makeyou throw up if this were to be made into a real life movie haha okay stopimagining that now lol. Hanako-san defends her underling (lol) by saying that hehasn't fulfilled her wish yet, and deals with the old b*tch (fish, haha) with aknife. I don't think the action plays a lot in this series, so I'm glad? (It'skinda lacking though tbh) Anyways, and if you need suspense for this one,Hanako-san decides to save this poor fish, uh, I mean, girl haha, by sharing thebond with her. And so, he takes the other scale. She returns to normal, but yeahnow technically they are a couple. Yay, we're done. Romance series ended. Hey,thanks for coming to the last episode of this series- I'm just joking this isjust starting. As much as this Hanako-san is a perv, he is just going to useYashiro for labour considering he's half ghost, and probably throughout thisseries they together will discover many other strange things in this school.Your new duo is born, ladies and gentlemen. In terms of production, I am stillimpressed but am not getting used to the less than realistic drawings so far,but I think I can live with it. Otherwise, you get quite a jovial couple (Imean, it's a perv and a radish what more can you ask? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) who will talkabout spiritual stuff every once in a while. Hey, Anime? If you want to flirttoo I'm fine I like that Hanako-kun fellow haha we shall see a couple moreepisodes to see if there is a standard flow I won't get bored with<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Gv9-C2Mq2O8/XhsyAMzMouI/AAAAAAAA3y4/XMAERxmBPPkbAIeUbpRaVm9UdmXK1fnsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun01_reject.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when I ask a girl out lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NJImmXQvJg4/XhsyBGcb1PI/AAAAAAAA3y8/vHZba-WZLAg0fUrKQKyZYdy9xvO8MiMlgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun01_hanako3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Let            <a href="https://jisho.org/search/eroi" target="_blank">ERO</a>-<a              href="https://jisho.org/search/daikon"              target="_blank"              >DAIKON</a            >&nbsp;be the best joke of this week haha before the week is over            let's          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Hey, I paid 2k(SGD) for a fortune telling because my mom told me to, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Inthis first episode (#RikeKoi01) of the smartest Anime we have seen yet haha,JUST GET TOGETHER ALREADY GEEZ. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, first things first, I'll talkabout production. You must get used to either of the things I mention now whichare (1) the animtion because it isn't the best you can find out there and alsobecause any of the above I reviewed this week is better (thanks for the cuteranimations too those got me in haha), (2) the super cliche plot lines that theywon't explain since it's science and they can say it whatever way they want kindof like how you can argue your way through university projects any way you likeand you'll still get As and (3) the real technical stuff, because if you don'tknow null hypothesis now is a good time to learn what it is haha. If you can getover any of them, the reward here will be fantastic. I'm not going to draw piecharts to explain how much you'll like this show just by liking any of the abovepoints because I'm not a researcher lmao. Okay, story time. There's the girlHimuro and guy Yukimura. Somehow, the girl like the guy. Yeah. We're done. Easy,right? Explanation over. But instead of embracing each other like normal peopledo, they go talk about that one null hypothesis about why they will love eachother. Well, now that they have to spend the next 12 episodes debating about itlol, the first comes with a more direct approach, mainly physical contact.Himuro also compiled a bunch of reasons and deduced how she came to like the guyand so on (and that's why I say this may get dry and boring), but yeah it'sbasically her flirting all over the guy haha. I mean, if they say they cansearch the Internet for suggestions (and technically prove them wrong) the girlcan just find as many intimate things (besides sex) (haha<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34934/Koi_to_Uso" target="_blank"  >Koi to Uso</a>GO AWAY) to ask the guy to do because you know, her heartbeats will go realquick? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, as you can see we have a very mature yet desperate womanhaha. Kanade joins in as our first side character in this first episode, andshe... she knows the reality. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The reality meaning that it's about thefeels. If you really do like someone there might be reasons, there might be anorigin, but normally it's also because of a lot of reasons and how you feel(circumstances mostly) (I am not a "love master"&nbsp;go talk to TsurezureChildren's<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/139290/Shinichi_Katori"  target="_blank"  >Katori-senpai</a>haha) in general that determine how you will want to do more for that specialperson.

Haha waiting forthat plot twist, to be honest. In this rather calming start of a first episode(#KyokouSuiri01), we got to 9000 real quick, and it might become my favouritethis season. Okay, let's talk about it. Firstly, the deception. The Anime willstart you in a calming scenario without much origin, but that's okay.Storytelling is required for this to work out, so I can understand. The maingirl introduces herself as Kotoko, someone who mysteriously got kidnapped andlost a leg and arm and was found alone two weeks after she went missing. Shetalks to a guy Kuro, who are both outside a hospital. The conversation... I'llleave you to understand yourself, but yes, she is one heck of a God of Youkai.Just the stuff I would actually like if it isn't full on crazy like the manyother Anime though who walked these traditional fiction story footsteps. Theguy... no, let's talk about the girl first. Apparently, she has a walker. Notbecause it's cool or whatever, but she lost a leg. And an eye, to be more exact.Story goes she was "kidnapped" years ago and then woke up to a bunch of<a href="https://jisho.org/search/youkai" target="_blank">youkai</a> asking herto be their saint. A "Goddess of Wisdom", as they mentioned. She agreed, andthat sounds like a huge price to get your limb taken off and eye gouged(perfectly, by the way), but hey, she be living the life now, eh? And somehowshe likes the guy. She saw him at the hospital as he was visiting a patientwhile she was a patient (if you didn't realise she needs to recover afterwhatever she went through which hit the headlines), saved him from a fall whichprobably would get him a good concussion. At that time, the guy still has agirlfriend, but now... she has a chance to confess? Okay, Anime, whatever yousay haha. If you thought RikeKoi was weird wait till you watch this lol. This...awkwardness in relationship probably will play out soon, but let's talk aboutthe guy. He is Kuro-kun, a normal guy who recently broke up with his girlfriendbecause she saw a kappa when they were taking a stroll by the river. The girlinitiated it. And if you watched the episode and didn't realise the hiddenmystery, he is what his girlfriend saw. BOOM hope I didn't blow your mind haha.And the people he ate by the river, yeah? This getting to you right now? Hahathat's probably one of the charms of the Anime, I would argue. If you need ahint as to why, the episode then ends with a somewhat action scene in dealingwith a youkai, but man is it gory, so if you wanna watch this one please getover seeing the girl in the operation room with her leg chopped off first lol.Overall... I still think this Anime is awkwardly interesting somehow. It's likethe normal youkai master Anime but.. a little dull, and more like peaceful, Imight add. But uh, if you can't understand this story flow then this reallyisn't for you. But for the sake of Kitou Akari (yes she be main girl again) Iwill give this a couple more episodes like the others to see if I can accept theweekly flow of fighting monsters... without using weapons? Okay that fireextinguisher is kind of a weapon lol. We shall see. I'm not as crazy about thisshow as Kotoko-chan is crazy about Kuro-kun hehe<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nZMWW1K4IBo/Xhs5TbrMkyI/AAAAAAAA3zg/xAXxHrG-RD0cgcafCHbNdoid_imLY73HwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri01_youkai.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            My dad when he has to tell me to get a life lol<br />            (I know I'm not a female but)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YtaY4XSB4qE/Xhs5R2Nu6TI/AAAAAAAA3zc/AiqDqhHCt_USDy3cdHP4IB-TD0mJIo8QACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri01_kotoko1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">She came lmao</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Haha I am liking their styleanyways, as much as they always try to overdo it with the instrumentals to youknow, look cool. I also took some time to look back at a release that I've notyet rejected last year which is <b>a flood of circle's latest EP</b> and... ifyou need to be happy for the start of the year, this thing is it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Itgot me happy real quick the moment I heard it. The<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/mdrySQnMxTA" target="_blank"  >topic song music video</a>is also real funny, so you can watch it. "Lucky to be alive", yes? Haha<br /><br />Next week we welcome a slew of Anime theme song releases in which I may or maynot give so you can come back next week to see for yourself, from<b>Yuuki Aoi's new single</b> to <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> for Anime"RikeKoi" that you might have read above. Yeah, this might be her first and onlysingle we'll hear a cute her in... pretty much everything from her singing to- Ijust want that fanservice music video hehe<br /><br />About news on Twitter and around the Internet if they aren't on Twitter whichthey should be, you can hear a snippet of<b>Minase Inori's new single</b> online now which is okay probably,<b>Numakura Manami's new music video</b> and her final song in her solo musiccareer already made me weep, and why must<b>Ikimonogakari's new music video</b> go through the history of their bandformation and singing "goodbye youth" haiz mine is also gone from hearing youguys too <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry for the haphazard post this week, but I really settled work and rushedthrough this in one night. Maybe tomorrow if I have time after work and not beforced to work overtime (FU-) then I'll update on the thumbnails. Yeah, for nowthis might be it. You know, you can gauge how much effort I will do in relationto which series I might actually give in the end, but for now... let me goshower and sleep haha. Cya guys next week, and until then... I hope you havetime to watch Anime this week haha a lot of shows appeared for the new seasonalready. I feel sad not giving Anime with more action compared to these few Ilanded with but hey, it's not even final. Haha see you guys around.<br /><br />P.S. Ah, I know why now. The Anime aren't cool enough because they lacked a coolphrase or line. Man, remember those Anime where they like to "I'll take care ofit" and starts rampaging on a monster or something? I miss those days haha<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
