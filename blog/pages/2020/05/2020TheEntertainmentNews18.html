That did not go well lol. Over the last 12 hours I've been testingall sorts of methods to try to recover it back but ended up with a more brokenMicrosoft Store (lol is that even a bad thing) to the extent that I can't openmy start menu and touching anything will prompt a system error. The other halfof the time is figuring out why the heck I can get a fresh system image fromonline through official means ie. Microsoft themselves but my sis can do it withher PC WTF haha haiz I'm tired so we shall rush through this I'm sorry forshorter reviews this week but we got so much good sh*t this week on Animethough.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Miyu-chan!!~ Okay that's a JoshiMuda livestream joke that NO ONE will get hahajust google it it's somewhere on YouTube where I saw it the sensei's voice actorwas being creepy not me<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Kakushigoto05">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kakushigoto</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "You have to do your duty when it's your turn" lmao Kakushi this is just    Hime shitting on you  </div></blockquote>What I've learnt from this episode is that we need a change of editor forKakushi haha this guy is very close to an idiot lol. In this new episode(#Kakushigoto05) we learnt that you have to gather five silver medals to bebetter than the one having the gold medal in the Olympics haha Hime-chan'sinnocence needs to be protected. Okay, that idiot editor. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The funnything actually in this episode is clearly that, along the way, you'll realisehe's not the newbie. Kakushi is. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Let's talk about it. Firstly, Kakushitakes on a role of a judge for an indie manga festival. You know, the placewhere you ruin many children's dreams haha I assume he hasn't ruined Hime-chan'sbut still. He initially rejected it because he know it sucks, but yeah Himemight still be right it's also kind of to make his name out there anyways, onlyto realise Tomaruin (thanks to Kakushi I remember this idiot's name now) (FYIthe last time I used this word was in Anime "Aho Girl" lol) added a joking endto every comment on his judgement, literally throwing his reputaation to thegates of hell. After asking why he did it, he then revealed that he's also doinga duty like how Kakushi is for being a judge to show face in the industry, buthis is in the editor industry, doing his job of taking care of Kakushi himself.I guess since no one really wants to do this, they normally push the newbie tohim, and this is normally what happens but you know, this one is dumber haha.Next, rushing again for deadlines. Well, Tomaruin can explain this but, youknow, last minute rejections of manuscript for printing is often a common casein the manga industry I believe. So yeah, Kakushi has to pull an all-nighterhimself. Well, not really himself since his team has been called in some wayinto the bathrobe party (lol we're only interested in Rasuna-chan, boys) in thehotel while leaving Hime-chan... well exhausted, I would assume haha. That idolleft her house due to a quarrel to stay at her place (imagine if Kakushi didn'thave to do overtime lol), Nadila was contacted by the master only to be rejectedby her next client so she went back to accompany Hime-chan, and they had abirthday party. So yeah Kakushi, if you kept your mouth shut and locked the dooryour daughter may have slept a good night alone lmao. Lastly, since they have totalk about the single parent thing, the gold medal. I would love to give Kakushian Aqua Timez song to congratulate him for his contributions to his daughter'sgrowth, but I guess she knows how to give back her thanks to the dad she thinksis the best way possible. Hey, I didn't even do that so good for you, Kakushi.And this brings us out of the flashback and into grown up Hime, because sherecognised the handwriting on the boxes after 17 years old, we now know theseare from the father. Man, the dad's not dead yet right? lol I feel like thisshow is so dark in reality I can't even. But seriously, we know the dad can onlygive her not erotic manga to read anyways lol I'm not going to make any hentaijokes and don't you care put a "jk" thing at the end you hear me?? Geez haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WYlG0PCf45k/Xq6-_0JKqcI/AAAAAAAA6xE/asjkhRnNceY4FcdhaotYzzXQJOKkI2mCwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto05_rasuna3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is as erotic this Anime will get we won't get the manga in the            manga content ever          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZTFQArWJT7E/Xq6_BSa4vgI/AAAAAAAA6xI/3MjxlmxMWEoPzIXLAfywBnxTpaFrGA_mACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto05_sleep.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            On a scale of 1 to 10 how wrong is this? lol they are father and            daughter bro          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "You can do things other than erasing?" That's literally my boss beingimpressed when he thinks I'm doing a good job because that's my job scope lol<br />P.P.S. "One entry per box? What is this, Amazon?" Eh, sorry but I don't get thisjoke lol must be a Japan thing but I order from Japan before though haha (Iguess they are talking about generosity in packaging because they can packlittle but still charge little to nothing on shipping)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Yesterday wo Utatte</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="YesterdayWoUtatte05">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "And he's kind of cool too" Then Haru-chan go date him then. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay if you think this new guy has no relation to any of them, you haven'twatched romance Anime before haha. In this new episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte05)hey we have a new guy, he's called Minato. And since Rikuo has to take on morepart-time jobs even stuff that he doesn't get like managing an art gallery, hestill has to do it, I guess. Not everyone has a stable job like being a teacherin a high school. *looks at Shinako* So, cue new guy, still in college, aroundthe same year as Haru-chan since they were classmates before she dropped outlol, but yeah, and has a crush on her. Hey, if you took this long to realise, gowatch another Anime haha. Why the sudden entrance though? Then you gotta watchto find out. But first, Rikuo's new part-time job in the museum. It's not like,the Louvre, but you know, you gotta at least recognise the differences betweenphotos which he can't lol. Anyways, Minato submitted his application in themuseum and is doing part-time too, but guess what, he knows Haru-chan. Again,for someone to know Haru-chan that well in high school considering she droppedout and it's a guy, it's hardly anything else but infatuation at some point, buthey, I watched the episode already so don't call me a genius haha. I mean, heeven went as far as asking her where she works and camps at the cafe all night?Someone should've taken a hint haha not Haru-chan apparently. Hey, innocence isbliss, people. But you know, it's pissing someone off. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> At this point, Ican confidently say that Rikuo is going to see it go. This affection fromHaru-chan. That is, IF he doesn't take it back like<strike  ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7VgHEikuJ4" target="_blank"    >Yoru no Honki Dance does</a  ></strike>Minato does since I think he believes in a second opportunity like me. I mean,if I ever met them again and they aren't married (well, I know who are alreadylol) then... yeah, I might just do it. Or he'll just be the backup to Haru-chanjust like how she is to Rikuo now haha GOT HER lmao. And that's how it ended,with a day together outdoors. He confessed to Haru's surprise, and of course sherejected it. More importantly, Minato is leaving the country to take a break offcollege ie. he dropped out too. Must be easy in life to drop out of anything,huh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, what do you think, guys? Did this Anime hit you yet? It'samicable, it's peaceful, there's romance but it's mild... you think this works?To be honest though? This Anime works for me so far, and I like it. Mainlyfuelled by Haru-chan's cuteness lol, but you know, the plots are also prettydirect. Say even for this episode, we have a guy that comes and goes. Even this,it's as subtle as it gets, and we get even get pissed off Rikuo in return lol.Can't wait to see what's next. But yeah, Rikuo is itching. I can feel it. Hahacya next week.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VQ7q_21jUqg/Xq7KBQOnywI/AAAAAAAA6xY/vqu3hxNzp1ECfa3CdpT8nTyIoyB8PyGdQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday05_haru9.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            More Haru-chan because she is            <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kawaii" target="_blank">kawaii</a>            hehe<br />            (Don't look at the manga artwork you have been warned)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P55Q_7ub0Bw/Xq7KFFn2SmI/AAAAAAAA6xc/wJvO-0Be448dKhu8dF07KeNOGmNYriaogCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday05_gravure.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I saw this and I'm like "am I in the wrong Anime or what" lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "Why is <i>he</i> with Haru?" Haha Rikuo is CLEARLY pissed lol that's a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAlK41ICgEw" target="_blank"  >jealousy</a>bro no seriously play that music video in the background while watching thisepisode again<br />P.P.S. "He's also not a coffee lover; he puts lots of milk and sugar" Just likecoffee, it's only the bitterness one tastes in order to reflect its own state oflife. Haha quote me on that but the manager of the cafe is really right if you acoffee lover you don't put that much sweetness and forget about the coffeetaste<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bqanime" id="KaguyaSamaS204">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "..it'll be like a confession to President" I mean, you already did it last    week how hard is it to do it again? lol  </div></blockquote>Haha Kaguya is going to cry by the end of this series from people fighting overShirogane wait is she even trying? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well. In this new episode(#KaguyaSamaS204) we have competition. I mean, Hayasaka might be the least ofher worries, 'cos we have a new girl in town. In school, I mean. And she's beenthere for a while I guess; it's high school anyways there's three years andshe's been in two. Firstly, Hayasaka. But seriously, she is pissing me off rightnow. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Go be your calm collected, own the whole Shinomiya bath type ofwoman or something. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, since Kaguya challenged her butler to go datewho she likes... again, we know she regretted it already even before she saidit, but you know, the pride thing we've seen since the very first episode ofseason 1, haha. And thus, Harcasa advances on Shirogane on her supposed day off.And to not put quotes on all the "lies" she said, apparently she's just tryingto point out as many things as possible so Shirogane can spend an afternoon withher alone... while Kaguya is watching lol. Hey, what else you gonna do on aSunday afternoon? Fix your PC? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Haiz Hayasaka I wish you could help mefix a PC up and not tell me to touch access right settings lol) It was a nicedate lmao, and technically Harcasa did confess to Shirogane, but yeah, obviouslythis isn't even a first date and they "barely knew each other", so yeah he justplayed the "I like someone" else like he always does haha I hope not always lol.In revenge though? Hayasaka blurted the heck out of Kaguya's business whenShirogane came to visit her in her class to ask to meet up after school roundthe back. Normally we know this is for a confession, but with a Student Councilelection coming up, it's definitely nothing but. And with the whole schoolphysically watching the two after school and the rest on livestream (lmao), theykind of spoke in secret. Which surprisingly did not kill Shirogane's popularityand made it way more mysterious, which of course, helps him in his re-electionafter people think that that is actually a confession scene but clearly theydon't even know about season 1 haha. So, to end this episode, and finally, wehave the other new competitor who is in second place, and who will be fightingagainst Shirogane (hopefully, not for long hehe) in the next few episodes: it'sIino Miko. Surprisingly Ishigami knows her (lmao), and after this episode...yeah I think we know who she is now. This one is honestly tougher to crack thanKaguya-sama imo haha. But hey, we're not dating her; we're just trying to winthe elections with her... tough... policies? Man, what is this, military school?<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, turns out, with a Morals Committee background, Miko-chan isactually a real serious person who probably never takes breaks consideringShirogane's grades aren't as beautiful as hers (haha GOT HIM), but also might betoo extreme as she tries to campaign back formality within school compounds.That is not going to get you votes, girl. By experience you should know thatconfessing to Shirogane would give you a better chance at winning the election-Wait, did I just fortune tell this? Haha hope not but we shall see so next timearound though!

The album... Iguess once you get into it you'll give them, just like the couple of albums I'vegiven of the years, and I think I ended up with all the topic songs somehowdon't ask me why. Again, they aren't really great with their emotional songs soI ended up only giving that only one so "surely but slowly I can move on" haha.Thanks to <b>Naobou's live performance</b> premier on YouTube (see below), Ialso tried to give chance to her 1st single and... well, I'll decide on thatnext week haha. While going through some live footage from last year though(which is the cause of my PC going haywire) I did end up giving more songs inthe form of <b>MOSHIMO</b> mainly because of the one song they sang to behonest, don't think I can last with that high pitched female vocalist and somepremonition of speech more than singing in their music. We shall see, guys. I'llgive an album a listen along with the song might as well.<br /><br />On news concerning music from Twitter and beyond but mostly the former,<b>Scenarioart released more live videos</b> in hopes to get more Internetattention though I guess, <b>miwa also did a FIRST TAKE video</b> but it's herdebut song which I did not give (lol),<b>Kitou Akari's new music video preview</b> is somehow dope because UNISONSQUARE GARDEN is doing composition and I CAN'T STOP giving that quirky yetimpressive style,<b>Touyama Nao's live video performances have premiered on YouTube</b> for alimited time only I think for like a week if you want to watch (there's oneright now which I'm giving a miss since I only gave her 1st album which aired onWednesday),<br /><br />So yeah, next week I guess I'll give <b>MOSHIMO and their album in 2018</b> achance I guess. Other than that... well I thought Naobou will give me a betterimpression of her music but hey, turns out like many it's only her voice thatsells not the songs. Hey, idolism in music for you in a nutshell. According tomy stats which I spent a good amount of time to do (now at Song of the daystatistics, yep) it's consistently<b>a third of idolism, half mainstream and the rest is Anime related</b>, whichare the only three main categories I came up with to summarise the songs Ilisten to in Klassic Note. Quite interesting, I would say, considering I saididolism music quality is on the rise with Minase Inori winning top rank fromlast year you would think the scales would topple by now. Well, depends on mydefinition anyways but I'll share on that someday soon enough. I intended to dothat sort of stuff if not for my itchy hands, you know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br />(minachan stream) (and that is some late night anime, well as late as I canbefore I realise I have to work from home tomorrow and I can barely catch somesleep okay bye)<br /><div><br /></div><div>P.S.
