Well, that's what happens when you screw around with system access right
settings in Windows 10 haha<br />
<br />
Okay, long story short, because I wanted to skip the admin confirmations when
transferring files or reading from the system drive off my files, I decided to
overwrite all the user access right settings so I can use the root folder for my
own purposes. That did not go well lol. Over the last 12 hours I've been testing
all sorts of methods to try to recover it back but ended up with a more broken
Microsoft Store (lol is that even a bad thing) to the extent that I can't open
my start menu and touching anything will prompt a system error. The other half
of the time is figuring out why the heck I can get a fresh system image from
online through official means ie. Microsoft themselves but my sis can do it with
her PC WTF haha haiz I'm tired so we shall rush through this I'm sorry for
shorter reviews this week but we got so much good sh*t this week on Anime
though.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Miyu-chan!!~ Okay that's a JoshiMuda livestream joke that NO ONE will get haha
just google it it's somewhere on YouTube where I saw it the sensei's voice actor
was being creepy not me<br />

    Hime shitting on you
  </div>
</blockquote>
What I've learnt from this episode is that we need a change of editor for
Kakushi haha this guy is very close to an idiot lol. In this new episode
(#Kakushigoto05) we learnt that you have to gather five silver medals to be
better than the one having the gold medal in the Olympics haha Hime-chan's
innocence needs to be protected. Okay, that idiot editor. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The funny
thing actually in this episode is clearly that, along the way, you'll realise
he's not the newbie. Kakushi is. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Let's talk about it. Firstly, Kakushi
takes on a role of a judge for an indie manga festival. You know, the place
where you ruin many children's dreams haha I assume he hasn't ruined Hime-chan's
but still. He initially rejected it because he know it sucks, but yeah Hime
might still be right it's also kind of to make his name out there anyways, only
to realise Tomaruin (thanks to Kakushi I remember this idiot's name now) (FYI
the last time I used this word was in Anime "Aho Girl" lol) added a joking end
to every comment on his judgement, literally throwing his reputaation to the
gates of hell. After asking why he did it, he then revealed that he's also doing
a duty like how Kakushi is for being a judge to show face in the industry, but
his is in the editor industry, doing his job of taking care of Kakushi himself.
I guess since no one really wants to do this, they normally push the newbie to
him, and this is normally what happens but you know, this one is dumber haha.
Next, rushing again for deadlines. Well, Tomaruin can explain this but, you
know, last minute rejections of manuscript for printing is often a common case
in the manga industry I believe. So yeah, Kakushi has to pull an all-nighter
himself. Well, not really himself since his team has been called in some way
into the bathrobe party (lol we're only interested in Rasuna-chan, boys) in the
hotel while leaving Hime-chan... well exhausted, I would assume haha. That idol
left her house due to a quarrel to stay at her place (imagine if Kakushi didn't
have to do overtime lol), Nadila was contacted by the master only to be rejected
by her next client so she went back to accompany Hime-chan, and they had a
birthday party. So yeah Kakushi, if you kept your mouth shut and locked the door
your daughter may have slept a good night alone lmao. Lastly, since they have to
talk about the single parent thing, the gold medal. I would love to give Kakushi
an Aqua Timez song to congratulate him for his contributions to his daughter's
growth, but I guess she knows how to give back her thanks to the dad she thinks
is the best way possible. Hey, I didn't even do that so good for you, Kakushi.
And this brings us out of the flashback and into grown up Hime, because she
recognised the handwriting on the boxes after 17 years old, we now know these
are from the father. Man, the dad's not dead yet right? lol I feel like this
show is so dark in reality I can't even. But seriously, we know the dad can only
give her not erotic manga to read anyways lol I'm not going to make any hentai
jokes and don't you care put a "jk" thing at the end you hear me?? Geez haha<br />

P.P.S. "One entry per box? What is this, Amazon?" Eh, sorry but I don't get this
joke lol must be a Japan thing but I order from Japan before though haha (I
guess they are talking about generosity in packaging because they can pack
little but still charge little to nothing on shipping)<br />

  </div>
</blockquote>
Okay if you think this new guy has no relation to any of them, you haven't
watched romance Anime before haha. In this new episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte05)
hey we have a new guy, he's called Minato. And since Rikuo has to take on more
part-time jobs even stuff that he doesn't get like managing an art gallery, he
still has to do it, I guess. Not everyone has a stable job like being a teacher
in a high school. *looks at Shinako* So, cue new guy, still in college, around
the same year as Haru-chan since they were classmates before she dropped out
lol, but yeah, and has a crush on her. Hey, if you took this long to realise, go
watch another Anime haha. Why the sudden entrance though? Then you gotta watch
to find out. But first, Rikuo's new part-time job in the museum. It's not like,
the Louvre, but you know, you gotta at least recognise the differences between
photos which he can't lol. Anyways, Minato submitted his application in the
museum and is doing part-time too, but guess what, he knows Haru-chan. Again,
for someone to know Haru-chan that well in high school considering she dropped
out and it's a guy, it's hardly anything else but infatuation at some point, but
hey, I watched the episode already so don't call me a genius haha. I mean, he
even went as far as asking her where she works and camps at the cafe all night?
Someone should've taken a hint haha not Haru-chan apparently. Hey, innocence is
bliss, people. But you know, it's pissing someone off. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> At this point, I
can confidently say that Rikuo is going to see it go. This affection from
Haru-chan. That is, IF he doesn't take it back like
<strike
  ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7VgHEikuJ4" target="_blank"
    >Yoru no Honki Dance does</a
  ></strike
>
Minato does since I think he believes in a second opportunity like me. I mean,
if I ever met them again and they aren't married (well, I know who are already
lol) then... yeah, I might just do it. Or he'll just be the backup to Haru-chan
just like how she is to Rikuo now haha GOT HER lmao. And that's how it ended,
with a day together outdoors. He confessed to Haru's surprise, and of course she
rejected it. More importantly, Minato is leaving the country to take a break off
college ie. he dropped out too. Must be easy in life to drop out of anything,
huh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, what do you think, guys? Did this Anime hit you yet? It's
amicable, it's peaceful, there's romance but it's mild... you think this works?
To be honest though? This Anime works for me so far, and I like it. Mainly
fuelled by Haru-chan's cuteness lol, but you know, the plots are also pretty
direct. Say even for this episode, we have a guy that comes and goes. Even this,
it's as subtle as it gets, and we get even get pissed off Rikuo in return lol.
Can't wait to see what's next. But yeah, Rikuo is itching. I can feel it. Haha
cya next week.<br />

bro no seriously play that music video in the background while watching this
episode again<br />
P.P.S. "He's also not a coffee lover; he puts lots of milk and sugar" Just like
coffee, it's only the bitterness one tastes in order to reflect its own state of
life. Haha quote me on that but the manager of the cafe is really right if you a
coffee lover you don't put that much sweetness and forget about the coffee
taste<br />

Haha Kaguya is going to cry by the end of this series from people fighting over
Shirogane wait is she even trying? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well. In this new episode
(#KaguyaSamaS204) we have competition. I mean, Hayasaka might be the least of
her worries, 'cos we have a new girl in town. In school, I mean. And she's been
there for a while I guess; it's high school anyways there's three years and
she's been in two. Firstly, Hayasaka. But seriously, she is pissing me off right
now. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Go be your calm collected, own the whole Shinomiya bath type of
woman or something. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, since Kaguya challenged her butler to go date
who she likes... again, we know she regretted it already even before she said
it, but you know, the pride thing we've seen since the very first episode of
season 1, haha. And thus, Harcasa advances on Shirogane on her supposed day off.
And to not put quotes on all the "lies" she said, apparently she's just trying
to point out as many things as possible so Shirogane can spend an afternoon with
her alone... while Kaguya is watching lol. Hey, what else you gonna do on a
Sunday afternoon? Fix your PC? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Haiz Hayasaka I wish you could help me
fix a PC up and not tell me to touch access right settings lol) It was a nice
date lmao, and technically Harcasa did confess to Shirogane, but yeah, obviously
this isn't even a first date and they "barely knew each other", so yeah he just
played the "I like someone" else like he always does haha I hope not always lol.
In revenge though? Hayasaka blurted the heck out of Kaguya's business when
Shirogane came to visit her in her class to ask to meet up after school round
the back. Normally we know this is for a confession, but with a Student Council
election coming up, it's definitely nothing but. And with the whole school
physically watching the two after school and the rest on livestream (lmao), they
kind of spoke in secret. Which surprisingly did not kill Shirogane's popularity
and made it way more mysterious, which of course, helps him in his re-election
after people think that that is actually a confession scene but clearly they
don't even know about season 1 haha. So, to end this episode, and finally, we
have the other new competitor who is in second place, and who will be fighting
against Shirogane (hopefully, not for long hehe) in the next few episodes: it's
Iino Miko. Surprisingly Ishigami knows her (lmao), and after this episode...
yeah I think we know who she is now. This one is honestly tougher to crack than
Kaguya-sama imo haha. But hey, we're not dating her; we're just trying to win
the elections with her... tough... policies? Man, what is this, military school?
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, turns out, with a Morals Committee background, Miko-chan is
actually a real serious person who probably never takes breaks considering
Shirogane's grades aren't as beautiful as hers (haha GOT HIM), but also might be
too extreme as she tries to campaign back formality within school compounds.
That is not going to get you votes, girl. By experience you should know that
confessing to Shirogane would give you a better chance at winning the election-
Wait, did I just fortune tell this? Haha hope not but we shall see so next time
around though! I wonder if Miko-chan resorts to dirty tactics like Hayasaka does
haha really Hayasaka MVP every episode already what did I tell you<br />

P.S. *points at chest as lie* Yeah I realised that much already haha but hey it
could be real v1 of Hayasaca was in an obscure maid outfit after all haha<br />
P.P.S. Okay legit thought Miko-chan would actually offer some sort of Student
Council competition by you know, bring out the youth spirit in a new generation
of students to pit against Shirogane but damn girl, "smartphones are not
allowed" is a real no-no in this election, you know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />

This week on Klassic Note we have <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new album</b> which
really took a while to appear and thanks to not delaying the digital release too
I'll count this one in first before its physical release in June as with many
releases now I just hope May isn't nothing on the list tbh haha. The album... I
guess once you get into it you'll give them, just like the couple of albums I've
given of the years, and I think I ended up with all the topic songs somehow
don't ask me why. Again, they aren't really great with their emotional songs so
I ended up only giving that only one so "surely but slowly I can move on" haha.
Thanks to <b>Naobou's live performance</b> premier on YouTube (see below), I
also tried to give chance to her 1st single and... well, I'll decide on that
next week haha. While going through some live footage from last year though
(which is the cause of my PC going haywire) I did end up giving more songs in
the form of <b>MOSHIMO</b> mainly because of the one song they sang to be
honest, don't think I can last with that high pitched female vocalist and some
premonition of speech more than singing in their music. We shall see, guys. I'll
give an album a listen along with the song might as well.<br />
<br />
On news concerning music from Twitter and beyond but mostly the former,
<b>Scenarioart released more live videos</b> in hopes to get more Internet
attention though I guess, <b>miwa also did a FIRST TAKE video</b> but it's her
debut song which I did not give (lol),
<b>Kitou Akari's new music video preview</b> is somehow dope because UNISON
SQUARE GARDEN is doing composition and I CAN'T STOP giving that quirky yet
impressive style,
<b>Touyama Nao's live video performances have premiered on YouTube</b> for a
limited time only I think for like a week if you want to watch (there's one
right now which I'm giving a miss since I only gave her 1st album which aired on
Wednesday),<br />
<br />
So yeah, next week I guess I'll give <b>MOSHIMO and their album in 2018</b> a
chance I guess. Other than that... well I thought Naobou will give me a better
impression of her music but hey, turns out like many it's only her voice that
sells not the songs. Hey, idolism in music for you in a nutshell. According to
my stats which I spent a good amount of time to do (now at Song of the day
statistics, yep) it's consistently
<b>a third of idolism, half mainstream and the rest is Anime related</b>, which
are the only three main categories I came up with to summarise the songs I
listen to in Klassic Note. Quite interesting, I would say, considering I said
idolism music quality is on the rise with Minase Inori winning top rank from
last year you would think the scales would topple by now. Well, depends on my
definition anyways but I'll share on that someday soon enough. I intended to do
that sort of stuff if not for my itchy hands, you know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />

(minachan stream) (and that is some late night anime, well as late as I can
before I realise I have to work from home tomorrow and I can barely catch some
sleep okay bye)<br />
