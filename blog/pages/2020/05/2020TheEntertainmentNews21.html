<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBywUJD0V5E/Xsodul36iyI/AAAAAAAA7TM/1awwn0TlmWEZk4Sig8RMUPZ7c4fPtfOTACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto08_box.jpg"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>Okay now I'm kinda worried the items on the warehouse is going to expire soonand the last package hasn't arrived yet someone please tell me how<br /><br />Oh, I'm referring to the next big surprise I have for myself but it's more likea bomb at this point I'm spending so much money I don't even care. We'll talkabout that soon maybe next month, but for now you can read the previous onewhich I talked about tour pamphlets ie. the most profitable thing they have doneto ensure idolism is in order haha. No really, you can buy an album worth ofsongs for that price. Well I guess those guys who do go to the live tours aredumb so whatever haha<br /><br />Talking about dumb, we have a lot to laugh to this week. Mainly me because I'mlaughing like an idiot haha great shows this season man what can I say<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Kakushigoto08">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kakushigoto</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "She has saved her life" Oh come on, I'm pretty sure with this adaptation    Hime-chan has saved many more lives than she would have expected haha  </div></blockquote>Well even the dog's name was a word pun haha gotta "go<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/touroku"  target="_blank"  >touroku</a>" that in haha. In the new episode of Anime that Kakushi gets to stab himselfin the chest again (#Kakushigoto08) (lol with the "don't hide thing from me"thing to the daughter when he's the joke), Hime-chan starts to worry if thefamily needs a stepmother. Uh oh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Firstly, we talk about the dog. Thepoint that I used "the dog" to refer to the new pet in the house which came inthrough suspicious reasons (ahem) means that they didn't give it a name yet. Andyeah, that's kinda bad. To be attached to the pet means giving it a name, andeven though it only lasts a decade, this is still rather necessary. And...Hime-chan didn't think of one somehow, oh well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (start reading fromthis paragraph again lol) But you know, it works, calling a dog a rock haha.Next, <strike>a new member joins the detective squad</strike> Hime-chan made anew friend. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Kayo-san I would saw you be careful to let your owncuriosity get over you, but suffice it to say thanks to Hime-chan she won't be alonely transfer student after all. You know, they hang out together now. Isn'twhat friends were for like this? I mean, I don't even remember my days as astudent where I hang out at other people's places... no seriously. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>*gets flashbacks* Anyways, with the discussion and all in the office, we nowknow that Tomaruin only gives sh*t to the magazine's anniversary because he's aneditor, Rasuna-chan drew a flash mob in Chapter 100 of the series for Kakushilol, and... Hime-chan was hiding something from him. Haha okay it isn't muchdefinitely not a confession that she has to reject lol, but suffice it to sayHime-chan knows what it feels to have to celebrate stuff every year. I mean,tell those otakus who are celebrating their favourite Anime characters with likea ritual in their homes posted on Twitter and tell me Hime-chan if your birthdayis worth celebrating. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, the dad will do anything to make thedaughter happier, so he promises to get her friends over to celebrate next time.Will he break the promise though? Well this isn't Kaguya-sama and the father soprobably not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So Kakushi had to improve his cooking, because<a href="https://jisho.org/search/karaage" target="_blank">karaage</a> is soimportant in birthdays he gotta invite a female chef to teach him at his place.Oh no Hime-chan it's not like this she's just here to teach him; He pays her forher services! Ah- <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And as with previous episode, we end with the realitycheck, with Tomaruin still around with Rasuna for some damn reason (F**K OFFTOMARUIN haha), Hime-chan realises how similar her old house is to her currentone. Or is it the current one? It's for sale already though. They may have movedagain. But one thing is for sure: we know the dad raised her real well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>Okay a bit obvious, but seeing as the others were relaxing in an abode and he'snot here "at work", we know what happened to him HE GOT FAMOUS!! CongratsKakushi, this is TOTALLY worth celebrating- Ah, it's not? We gotta wait for the1000th chapter? Come on. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yep, as we can see so far, the lore isgoing to hit us real soon. My guess for now, is that it's about how fathers areoverprotective of their daughters, from Kakushi to his daughter, to hisfather-in-law to his daughter, who passed away ie. the mother. I guess we'llfind out soon enough. I think my assumption that the dad's still alive might begetting myself into trouble hehe<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBywUJD0V5E/Xsodul36iyI/AAAAAAAA7TM/1awwn0TlmWEZk4Sig8RMUPZ7c4fPtfOTACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto08_box.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            That box is going to hit me real quick, I tell you<br />            (Writes "The 30s")          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7maKgtxot4c/XsodusyWClI/AAAAAAAA7TQ/qKlT7L-SHG8M33_6yz-pC6Axn0bxHJyWQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto08_kakushi2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            No one is going to make this joke so I will do it.<br />            (Ahem)            <a href="https://jisho.org/search/mekakushi" target="_blank"              >Me-Kakushi</a            >.

"In order to surpass my ink work from my draft, I just have to lower mylevel of drafts" Okay, genius, slow down. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. "I think celebrating every fifth or tenth anniversary is enough" Hey whatdo you know, Klassic Note is on its way to success- Okay it's just me haha<br />[I look at the next episode title and the last quote that was said and I can'teven (FYI title is a reference to "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso" and the last quotetalks about how manga artists are all lolicons... well if you're one in KiraraFantasia magazine I'm pretty sure you are haha)]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="YesterdayWoUtatte08">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Yesterday wo Utatte</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "An opportunity that will never happen twice..." I know right? Well Rikuo    you are just out of luck bro haha "Unbelievable" OH COME ON haha  </div></blockquote>And then they start canoodling outside of the apartment such that the wholefloor knows about it- Haha not going to happen you be glad she's even invitingyou inside the house, bro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new exciting episode(#YesterdayWoUtatte08) WE. ARE. GETTING. LAID!!! Haha probably not, but it's agood start, I'll tell you that. But yeah, it left as soon as it arrived, thishype train. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's talk about drama, shall we? I know, and I don't evengive two sh*ts about TV drama haha. So, the story so far. Story goes that Rikuostill doesn't know how <strike>Kana-chan</strike> Shinako's room looks likeanyways, because you know, she still didn't have the courage to do so. I knowright shoutout to the shitting on the two of them from their friends haha. So,let's talk about what happened to them then. Firstly, about Rikuo himself. Hiscareer in photography just took off, where he gets to do this job at the photostudio full-time which made him have to quite his part-time job at theconvenience store. Good for him, yes? His life is finally taking flight. But hismistake here is obviously, he didn't break the news to the people around him,specifically Shinako and Haru-chan, of course.&nbsp; Shinako probably doesn'tmind but we'll get to that later, but Haru-chan man, she's very close topunching the person she likes haha. So, about Haru-chan. She gets lonely notbeing able to spend her everyday with him at the convenience store even if it'sjust to see him for a while, so now she's just getting desperate. It's notpushy, but we can see she's lonely. That's something to remember because sincewe may be heading in a different direction and that doesn't involve Haru, thisis starting to feel a lot like "Toradora!" since she's going to be the likelyvictim of the next blooming relationship, I would think. So now, about Shinako.She... I mean, the point that she is always relieved about status quo, I wouldsay, just like Rikuo, she doesn't like progress in relationships to any extent.Because aren't friends great? Looking after each other, hanging out and stuff,without the burden of being attached... I get you, girl. But as we have seenfrom last week, there seems to be more than what she wants out of her trying tomaintain such a balance while still satisfying her own inner peace, I wouldargue. I know that sounds harsh, and something is going to hit her hard soonenough, but hey, that's why this show is good at cooking that drama. We justwatch it happen. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Which is why just watching this episode alone Igenuinely think that Shinako is really just scared of hurting the people aroundher. Man, girl, love is selfish, you can't do what you want and not hurt others.That's what love is. Also, if Rikuo's not popular why would you even want him?Like, look at me. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> *bangs head on wall* Moving on!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, to herown answer of wanting to see Rou-kun again after that one hug on the streetswhich I swear no one saw it haha not even the father, they meet again. Well,Shinako went to his place like the usual so... I guess it's fine? Haha we shallsee about that. And Rou-kun, please don't scare your dear senpai away. Please, Ibeg you. But in case he doesn't, Shinako? Prepare to run while you still canthis guy may not be convinced at you maintaining status quo and may beaggressive about this so run when you need to okay? I can only but watch fromthe mirror of your lives over here haha. To end this off, serious talk, do youthink Hanazawa Kana is such a person in real life? Did this character hit her sohard she's going to re-live her 20s?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay cya next week<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8yzdlwl_bLA/XsoqZ9vkTLI/AAAAAAAA7Tg/pNP03Yu4x3caS9c4mTokzFwrO6UBe5wiwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday08_photos.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when I get those Kana-chan bromides next month haha SO HYPE          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="180"              data-original-width="320"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g1ggcvCQUi8/XsoqZ7k6dKI/AAAAAAAA7Tk/s9FUhudl4BoiyOQ76e_qG7cviochBdhOACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday08_realising.gif"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW I actually still like Kana-chan after all these years lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Thank goodness I wasn't drinking something haha wtf  </div></blockquote>"You're a briefs man" Okay just as a secret between us and/or to myself? Now I'mTOTALLY doing to buy those new boxer briefs so I can have my balls not bestrangled everyday haha ok TMI Chika-chan be aroused already lol. In this newepisode of (#KaguyaSamaS207) whatever this joke show is about, I think I'm notbuying those new underwear haha. Thanks, Ishigami. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And... I think wehave to ban this episode from airing haha. Why though? Let's talk about it. Ithink, we should try talking about this episode from Miko-chan's perspectivehaha. I don't know, why she has to walk in on all this whatever situations? Ithought the Student Council was a clean place that offered s*itty love adviceand cheats in elections? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's see... that is four times Miko-chanfailed to walk in to talk about serious stuff. First one was when Kaguya learntthat that boxer briefs are worn by... uh, I mean, I think I'm the weird one tooalready wearing briefs so I won't say too much (sorry dad) (haha), so whateverthe standpoint is, Kaguya wants to see it. That guy's undercarriage. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>Okay maybe just the cloth but still. She asked him directly too. But seriouslyShirogane, your first reply is "you mean for men or for women", bro. Can't evenanswer such a simple question. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And so, since his assumption is aboutfemale underwear... I mean, we know his firs impression has already gone to thedrains down to the sewers and beyond, and he did shout it out when Miko-chan waswalking in so... I wonder what type she wears? Haha no please I'm not apaedophile I meant it as a joke. The next time Miko-chan composed herself towalk into the Student Council room, the two Presidents were on top of eachother. I mean, I will run until I'm out of the school premises even if it meansgetting punished, I tell you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> How did that happen? I mean, wouldn'tbeen great if Kaguya enjoyed it more but Shirogane technically is suffering fromwhatever bull force this girl has lol, and I thought Kaguya isn't into se-MOVING ON!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The third time (yes 3rd time now) Miko-chan tried to walkinto the Student Council room again after being totally scarred at the morals ofthe Student Council and she's still the Morals Commitee President mind you, theguys were reading a shoujo manga that is popular and probably started withShirogane's sister Kei. I mean, if it's a real tearjerker why isn't it sellinglike hotcakes in real life? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Ok besides getting them with this joke, theguys were trying to convince the last member of the Student Council who hasn'tread it yet: <strike>Miko-chan</strike> Kaguya-sama. And so, of course, normallyin order to make a convincing argument especially to someone who doesn't evenlike manga, they had to spoil it. Haha and that's where things took a real turnlol. They had to shut her mouth up, Chika-chan, so... Miko-chan saw it and tookit upon herself to save her? I don't know. I would just run and try againtomorrow haha.

"This episode is sponsored by Apple Siri: Where you tell it facts so thatit will work." Haha okay just a joke seriously Tim Cook don't come sue me now<br />P.P.S. "I have to look at President's (Shirogane) underwear!" O~kay I'm callingthe cops haha "I'm just a pervert!"

Like, uh,today? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <b>flumpool's new album</b> is uh, okay? I won't say that, butas I listen to the album I want to give them chance since they have many songswith good choruses in this very large album to be honest, but failed on many dueto reasons I think I've mentioned in Klassic Note Review until I don't even wantto say haha. I'll give a couple more songs from the Anime theme song that led mehere, that's for sure. <b>Sayuri's new song</b> for Anime "Yesterday wo Utatte"was... whole songs was okay to be frank, but really not much compared to thefirst theme song, I guess. Try harder, Sayuri, haha. On the other hand, she isreleasing an acoustic compilation next month so if you are listening to hermusic unlike me be sure to go listen to her as if she sings on the streets.Yeah, she's YUI in the 2010s haha<br /><br />On news this week, <b>Taketatsu Ayana surprised us with a new song</b> when shealso suddenly started her first ever Instagram live (yes I'm in that damn placenow please stop following me),<b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai released the second half of their live from last year</b>which I still didn't watch the first half because I forgot lol, and<b>GLIM SPANKY is releasing more live footage</b> that I haven't watched so Idid catch up on that one. Eh, again, burnt out, and totally ruined by otherYouTube videos which are better played in the background so.... oh and<b>Sayuri's music videos are mostly online</b> now so if you still can't afforda Spotify or Apple Music subscription... haha<br /><br />So for next week, I'll likely be giving the<b>special single from Anime "Kakushigoto"</b> for ending theme sung by OotakiEiichi which I said I'll be giving this instead of actually giving hisanniversary album since there's this option haha, so there's that. Otherwise...I think I need to spend some time going on a trip. MOSHIMO did me well a coupleof weeks ago, figured I should go find more next week. It's a public holidaytomorrow here, so I guess I should.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So hopefully I can catch up to whatever I want to do next week mainly tomorrowsince it's a public holiday, so most of the time will still be trying to getthat database going such that data storage and analysis can happen more easily(SQL FTW), and also trying to arrange more stuff around the PC considering Iupgraded the OS early this year. Surprisingly my folder arrangement is stillgood enough it doesn't require much change, but you know, move the foldersaround a bit wouldn't hurt haha. Cya guys next time then, and until then... I'mglad Anime is part of my life now. Even if I don't have the time to listen tosoundtracks like what I do a decade ago, or go dig footage of live events orwhatsoever, I still have the time every week to watch the latest episodes. That,I'm still grateful I can still watch more than 1 show per season, I tell you. Soyeah, like your Anime while you're still into them, that's the advice hahabye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
