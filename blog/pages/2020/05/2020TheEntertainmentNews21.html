We'll talk about that soon maybe next month, but for now you can read the previous one which I talked about tour pamphlets ie. the most profitable thing they have done to ensure idolism is in order haha. No really, you can buy an album worth of songs for that price. Well I guess those guys who do go to the live tours are dumb so whatever haha<br><br> Talking about dumb, we have a lot to laugh to this week. Mainly me because I'm laughing like an idiot haha great shows this season man what can I say<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Kakushigoto08><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kakushigoto</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"She has saved her life" Oh come on, I'm pretty sure with this adaptation Hime-chan has saved many more lives than she would have expected haha</div></blockquote>Well even the dog's name was a word pun haha gotta "go<a href=https://jisho.org/search/touroku target=_blank>touroku</a>" that in haha. In the new episode of Anime that Kakushi gets to stab himself in the chest again (#Kakushigoto08) (lol with the "don't hide thing from me" thing to the daughter when he's the joke), Hime-chan starts to worry if the family needs a stepmother. Uh oh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Firstly, we talk about the dog. The point that I used "the dog" to refer to the new pet in the house which came in through suspicious reasons (ahem) means that they didn't give it a name yet. And yeah, that's kinda bad. To be attached to the pet means giving it a name, and even though it only lasts a decade, this is still rather necessary. And... Hime-chan didn't think of one somehow, oh well. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (start reading from this paragraph again lol) But you know, it works, calling a dog a rock haha. Next, <strike>a new member joins the detective squad</strike> Hime-chan made a new friend. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Kayo-san I would saw you be careful to let your own curiosity get over you, but suffice it to say thanks to Hime-chan she won't be a lonely transfer student after all. You know, they hang out together now. Isn't what friends were for like this? I mean, I don't even remember my days as a student where I hang out at other people's places... no seriously. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> *gets flashbacks* Anyways, with the discussion and all in the office, we now know that Tomaruin only gives sh*t to the magazine's anniversary because he's an editor, Rasuna-chan drew a flash mob in Chapter 100 of the series for Kakushi lol, and... Hime-chan was hiding something from him. Haha okay it isn't much definitely not a confession that she has to reject lol, but suffice it to say Hime-chan knows what it feels to have to celebrate stuff every year. I mean, tell those otakus who are celebrating their favourite Anime characters with like a ritual in their homes posted on Twitter and tell me Hime-chan if your birthday is worth celebrating. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, the dad will do anything to make the daughter happier, so he promises to get her friends over to celebrate next time. Will he break the promise though? Well this isn't Kaguya-sama and the father so probably not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So Kakushi had to improve his cooking, because <a href=https://jisho.org/search/karaage target=_blank>karaage</a> is so important in birthdays he gotta invite a female chef to teach him at his place. Oh no Hime-chan it's not like this she's just here to teach him; He pays her for her services! Ah- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And as with previous episode, we end with the reality check, with Tomaruin still around with Rasuna for some damn reason (F**K OFF TOMARUIN haha), Hime-chan realises how similar her old house is to her current one. Or is it the current one? It's for sale already though. They may have moved again. But one thing is for sure: we know the dad raised her real well. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay a bit obvious, but seeing as the others were relaxing in an abode and he's not here "at work", we know what happened to him HE GOT FAMOUS!! Congrats Kakushi, this is TOTALLY worth celebrating- Ah, it's not? We gotta wait for the 1000th chapter? Come on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yep, as we can see so far, the lore is going to hit us real soon. My guess for now, is that it's about how fathers are overprotective of their daughters, from Kakushi to his daughter, to his father-in-law to his daughter, who passed away ie. the mother. I guess we'll find out soon enough. I think my assumption that the dad's still alive might be getting myself into trouble hehe<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi40xqIixCwjaSSIIq6cboz-k1svM0jpelEFNzkCOf6MEI7BNfmdLv5xamtlvRpC28maSop_W94QaIBnA2f3uRp84cmB1Zb7AVUF1fzAtDGNgrLeaiWCfwWFE_1otTXEliEjyrASo28opg/s320/kakushigoto08_box.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That box is going to hit me real quick, I tell you<br> (Writes "The 30s")</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpQQBtpiNPVvn3OhUgINj_WDGF38P5Ul1uzh6Jvy05VNoQWcnFA7-RO9xWYFxAH4LkIEHF-c-zqZpEGGEIecUvZMfgbkf6QMP75HLnnePw_k2tkU5mTVTEBkXnOsTS3gkt0t3wG1th42Y/s320/kakushigoto08_kakushi2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>No one is going to make this joke so I will do it.<br> (Ahem) <a href=https://jisho.org/search/mekakushi target=_blank>Me-Kakushi</a>.

"In order to surpass my ink work from my draft, I just have to lower my level of drafts" Okay, genius, slow down. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br> P.P.S. "I think celebrating every fifth or tenth anniversary is enough" Hey what do you know, Klassic Note is on its way to success- Okay it's just me haha<br> [I look at the next episode title and the last quote that was said and I can't even (FYI title is a reference to "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso" and the last quote talks about how manga artists are all lolicons... well if you're one in Kirara Fantasia magazine I'm pretty sure you are haha)]<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=YesterdayWoUtatte08><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Yesterday wo Utatte</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"An opportunity that will never happen twice..." I know right? Well Rikuo you are just out of luck bro haha "Unbelievable" OH COME ON haha</div></blockquote>And then they start canoodling outside of the apartment such that the whole floor knows about it- Haha not going to happen you be glad she's even inviting you inside the house, bro. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new exciting episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte08) WE. ARE. GETTING. LAID!!! Haha probably not, but it's a good start, I'll tell you that. But yeah, it left as soon as it arrived, this hype train. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Let's talk about drama, shall we? I know, and I don't even give two sh*ts about TV drama haha. So, the story so far. Story goes that Rikuo still doesn't know how <strike>Kana-chan</strike> Shinako's room looks like anyways, because you know, she still didn't have the courage to do so. I know right shoutout to the shitting on the two of them from their friends haha. So, let's talk about what happened to them then. Firstly, about Rikuo himself. His career in photography just took off, where he gets to do this job at the photo studio full-time which made him have to quite his part-time job at the convenience store. Good for him, yes? His life is finally taking flight. But his mistake here is obviously, he didn't break the news to the people around him, specifically Shinako and Haru-chan, of course.  Shinako probably doesn't mind but we'll get to that later, but Haru-chan man, she's very close to punching the person she likes haha. So, about Haru-chan. She gets lonely not being able to spend her everyday with him at the convenience store even if it's just to see him for a while, so now she's just getting desperate. It's not pushy, but we can see she's lonely. That's something to remember because since we may be heading in a different direction and that doesn't involve Haru, this is starting to feel a lot like "Toradora!" since she's going to be the likely victim of the next blooming relationship, I would think. So now, about Shinako. She... I mean, the point that she is always relieved about status quo, I would say, just like Rikuo, she doesn't like progress in relationships to any extent. Because aren't friends great? Looking after each other, hanging out and stuff, without the burden of being attached... I get you, girl. But as we have seen from last week, there seems to be more than what she wants out of her trying to maintain such a balance while still satisfying her own inner peace, I would argue. I know that sounds harsh, and something is going to hit her hard soon enough, but hey, that's why this show is good at cooking that drama. We just watch it happen. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Which is why just watching this episode alone I genuinely think that Shinako is really just scared of hurting the people around her. Man, girl, love is selfish, you can't do what you want and not hurt others. That's what love is. Also, if Rikuo's not popular why would you even want him? Like, look at me. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> *bangs head on wall* Moving on!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, to her own answer of wanting to see Rou-kun again after that one hug on the streets which I swear no one saw it haha not even the father, they meet again. Well, Shinako went to his place like the usual so... I guess it's fine? Haha we shall see about that. And Rou-kun, please don't scare your dear senpai away. Please, I beg you. But in case he doesn't, Shinako? Prepare to run while you still can this guy may not be convinced at you maintaining status quo and may be aggressive about this so run when you need to okay? I can only but watch from the mirror of your lives over here haha. To end this off, serious talk, do you think Hanazawa Kana is such a person in real life? Did this character hit her so hard she's going to re-live her 20s?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay cya next week<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3IqL-WcPo5Rwg9oEwtuiEq6MJwA97svvxuWN6De2K3kdVO0I69z-N_Lx6ts-540n6rcCVcijzQkaTszgiVLnM3z48Khm3yr-p8aptaUFYnO-bI4G_ZfA2yonsB-3VKM2_ICRpfMz0SVk/s320/singyesterday08_photos.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I get those Kana-chan bromides next month haha SO HYPE</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtChfaOMSpdW277QQ2y1bGvjkhAAzS_nYmytyXi7hBE7OeDuU4YFOdurqlO0N6Z3E4nCjXwsJDKYgbKrPaxC2PmWJSMznszZrFC8vRG5nQxrc870kzkd8HY4b55wQYyi28jZHOECH1m_c/s320/singyesterday08_realising.gif style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I actually still like Kana-chan after all these years lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Thank goodness I wasn't drinking something haha wtf</div></blockquote>"You're a briefs man" Okay just as a secret between us and/or to myself? Now I'm TOTALLY doing to buy those new boxer briefs so I can have my balls not be strangled everyday haha ok TMI Chika-chan be aroused already lol. In this new episode of (#KaguyaSamaS207) whatever this joke show is about, I think I'm not buying those new underwear haha. Thanks, Ishigami. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And... I think we have to ban this episode from airing haha. Why though? Let's talk about it. I think, we should try talking about this episode from Miko-chan's perspective haha. I don't know, why she has to walk in on all this whatever situations? I thought the Student Council was a clean place that offered s*itty love advice and cheats in elections? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Let's see... that is four times Miko-chan failed to walk in to talk about serious stuff. First one was when Kaguya learnt that that boxer briefs are worn by... uh, I mean, I think I'm the weird one too already wearing briefs so I won't say too much (sorry dad) (haha), so whatever the standpoint is, Kaguya wants to see it. That guy's undercarriage. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay maybe just the cloth but still. She asked him directly too. But seriously Shirogane, your first reply is "you mean for men or for women", bro. Can't even answer such a simple question. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And so, since his assumption is about female underwear... I mean, we know his firs impression has already gone to the drains down to the sewers and beyond, and he did shout it out when Miko-chan was walking in so... I wonder what type she wears? Haha no please I'm not a paedophile I meant it as a joke. The next time Miko-chan composed herself to walk into the Student Council room, the two Presidents were on top of each other. I mean, I will run until I'm out of the school premises even if it means getting punished, I tell you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> How did that happen? I mean, wouldn't been great if Kaguya enjoyed it more but Shirogane technically is suffering from whatever bull force this girl has lol, and I thought Kaguya isn't into se- MOVING ON!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The third time (yes 3rd time now) Miko-chan tried to walk into the Student Council room again after being totally scarred at the morals of the Student Council and she's still the Morals Commitee President mind you, the guys were reading a shoujo manga that is popular and probably started with Shirogane's sister Kei. I mean, if it's a real tearjerker why isn't it selling like hotcakes in real life? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Ok besides getting them with this joke, the guys were trying to convince the last member of the Student Council who hasn't read it yet: <strike>Miko-chan</strike> Kaguya-sama. And so, of course, normally in order to make a convincing argument especially to someone who doesn't even like manga, they had to spoil it. Haha and that's where things took a real turn lol. They had to shut her mouth up, Chika-chan, so... Miko-chan saw it and took it upon herself to save her? I don't know. I would just run and try again tomorrow haha. So, the fourth time is when she came back with a stick (refer to Anime "Kakushigoto" on uses for that thing lol) to stop those two guys and... I guess they also spoiled it so we're good now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey if you aren't in tears right now not from reading the shoujo manga which will never publish but tearing from all these jokes you are not human haha. And to end this episode... goddamn did they adapt a shoujo manga real quick even with the voices wtf narrator not you too!?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay I'm done haha cya guys next week it is not fake though they just shoujo manga-fied it lol I knew the two guys would end up going to the aquarium together<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjm09MDOrCIOxoyiPFnMKhrw4J9RVIFwSmUET4R9rWK9VaRz28YZx4oNHhB85fJJ0WAmiT7Q_5baoCLmnqEOKm6hjIlnRBhdk9IsgKeuA00-T5lDoj_SJLoCBe3DNah81ojLHlFstEcuEA/s320/kaguyaS207_kaguya7.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I didn't expect to see this in this series so... haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgr75rU9HMGvRDtCgXl_FXXWg18W-0-0qmndxki_W50yxbwqHkMJA6QoJ5e1EUjbPV5odO_08aEt1xDzaZkO0ULr1n4mIeJLwZ7jy8Cm0tvx5hL7HXQoprYvK1APBMwsIlh_HsmM4Gu3gY/s320/kaguyaS207_kei2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I didn't expect to see this in this series too so... haha</table></div></div>P.S.

Like, uh, today? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b>flumpool's new album</b> is uh, okay? I won't say that, but as I listen to the album I want to give them chance since they have many songs with good choruses in this very large album to be honest, but failed on many due to reasons I think I've mentioned in Klassic Note Review until I don't even want to say haha. I'll give a couple more songs from the Anime theme song that led me here, that's for sure. <b>Sayuri's new song</b> for Anime "Yesterday wo Utatte" was... whole songs was okay to be frank, but really not much compared to the first theme song, I guess. Try harder, Sayuri, haha. On the other hand, she is releasing an acoustic compilation next month so if you are listening to her music unlike me be sure to go listen to her as if she sings on the streets. Yeah, she's YUI in the 2010s haha<br><br> On news this week, <b>Taketatsu Ayana surprised us with a new song</b> when she also suddenly started her first ever Instagram live (yes I'm in that damn place now please stop following me), <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai released the second half of their live from last year</b> which I still didn't watch the first half because I forgot lol, and <b>GLIM SPANKY is releasing more live footage</b> that I haven't watched so I did catch up on that one. Eh, again, burnt out, and totally ruined by other YouTube videos which are better played in the background so.... oh and <b>Sayuri's music videos are mostly online</b> now so if you still can't afford a Spotify or Apple Music subscription... haha<br><br> So for next week, I'll likely be giving the <b>special single from Anime "Kakushigoto"</b> for ending theme sung by Ootaki Eiichi which I said I'll be giving this instead of actually giving his anniversary album since there's this option haha, so there's that. Otherwise... I think I need to spend some time going on a trip. MOSHIMO did me well a couple of weeks ago, figured I should go find more next week. It's a public holiday tomorrow here, so I guess I should.<br><br><br><br><br> So hopefully I can catch up to whatever I want to do next week mainly tomorrow since it's a public holiday, so most of the time will still be trying to get that database going such that data storage and analysis can happen more easily (SQL FTW), and also trying to arrange more stuff around the PC considering I upgraded the OS early this year. Surprisingly my folder arrangement is still good enough it doesn't require much change, but you know, move the folders around a bit wouldn't hurt haha. Cya guys next time then, and until then... I'm glad Anime is part of my life now. Even if I don't have the time to listen to soundtracks like what I do a decade ago, or go dig footage of live events or whatsoever, I still have the time every week to watch the latest episodes. That, I'm still grateful I can still watch more than 1 show per season, I tell you. So yeah, like your Anime while you're still into them, that's the advice haha bye<br><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
