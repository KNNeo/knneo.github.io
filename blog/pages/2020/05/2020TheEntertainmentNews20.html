Or maybe not, whatever. I'm kinda burned out man. Maybeit's because of the "lockdown", maybe it's because I haven't had a work breakfor some time, probably since my birthday I think. So yeah, sub 3 monthsalready? Last year I took a break at this time of the year but with the stay athome stuff? Suddenly that is unnecessary. Maybe I should start applying for abreak next month when all goes back to normal. Well, as normal as society canbe.<br /><br />Let's Anime then, I guess. Not that I'm not interested in the drama, but I'mjust too excited for stuff I'm too lazy to do. That or I'm still anticipating aHUGE package coming to me at some point next month. Not going to talk about ittoo much, but I think I need to prepare the upcoming blog post for it so I don'thave to burn another weekend to write it haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Kakushigoto07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kakushigoto</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I'll only live for about ten years, so please stay by my side as much as    you can" Aw... and in case you don't know what that is, it's not the mother    haha *sees Kakushi cry* Uh oh.  </div></blockquote>"When walking a dog, people usually only look at the dog" Yeah that's actuallytrue one time my colleagues and I were out for lunch and a hunk came in with adog and it's literally all the girls swarming up to... the dog. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah, Idon't know if we can call this bliss or not even getting a dog (that I'mpotentially allergic to) can get me laid lmao. In this new episode(#Kakushigoto07) we.. are getting a lot of plot development. This Anime isserious, it seems. And I might be getting more lore to this story then I mayhave expected. I'm getting scared. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, this week is all about gettinga pet. Specifically, a pet dog. I have been recently examined (a year ago?) tobe slightly allergic to dogs (and none to cats), but even then I do not have anyluxury to have one. Well, because I'm the pet. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Uh, I mean, I have anelder sister. This might be a bad analogy so... okay, to Hime-chan. She wants adog.The father feels stressed in getting one not really because that he doesn'twant the daughter to have it, but then realises that she wants one mainlybecause she might be lonely. Yeah, that "missing a companion at home" thing ishitting her already. And as Kakushi looks around for opinions of others aroundhis life other than Hime, from Ichiko-sensei who has one to the assistants whowant one in the office (lol), to whoever sent that piano over ugh (haha),everyone has an opinion to give. On the other hand, Hime-chan starts to thinkthat whether having this "burden" on this single-parent family is a good thingor not. The point is that Hime-chan is such an understanding kid at her age, allof this doesn't matter. It's not because she lost her mom; it's not because thatshe doesn't mind about being alone. It's because she knows. She knows it'll onlybe a burden to others, all this time. This is the kind of kids you want to haveby the way, parents out there. Anyways, the dad in the end did decide to get herone after all, amongst all expectations, but the one on the poster has alreadybeen fulfilled so... the father-in-law gives a hand. So, more family lore, andthanks to Keshi-kun for bringing that piece of artwork into the workplace, wenow know that that man in the limo is likely Hime-chan's grandfather, and ishimself a professional artist (considering Kakushi's as a manga artist isn'tprofessional) (whatever dude like I buy your paintings but I buy manga though),is probably saddened by the passing of his own daughter, and feels that thegranddaughter will feel the same for her own childhood. And thus, most likely,the accidental gifts that have been appearing on their doorstep. I think we knowwhy Kakushi chose independence over reliance of the wife's family, but it seemsthe connection can never be cut off, as we have mentioned before. Nonetheless,Hime-chan's cooking as a kid is getting better, and with a cut back toreality... Hime has been followed lol. At the end of the episode, now I guessbijin-level Ichiko-sensei who followed the "detective squad" who are followingHime-chan (lol), reveals to them (and maybe Hime) good and bad news. What arethey though? I sure hope it's not the mother coming back to life haha hey wedon't even know if she's dead or not. Remember: Hime-chan has not yet burst intotears as a kid. Not yet. I'm getting worried I might be getting a lot of jokesbut a lot more lore down the road, and that might be a good thing. Cya guys nextweek.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OXa7pvl_yxY/XsEhdMJuGHI/AAAAAAAA7CM/sjQPIt9IMtssQtZxjT3CxerWYAhzBwkWQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto07_sleep.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When you have to take care of the dog and the father at the same            time lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5uhoADThyzE/XsEheqV5rRI/AAAAAAAA7CQ/WKm1aGl94mIRa4EZnvdMPG1UtdGTsny5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto07_pat.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Who's the matured one now, you tell me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />            (But seriously man, parents are human too they need a break once in            a while)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Idon't really like people who look like me so... I'm glad he isn't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>Okay, maybe, but it seems like a tie-back to Shinako which we have been waitingfor. So, about Rou-kun first. So, Rou talks about how wild he is and doesn'treally like to be in situ forever especially with relationships I guess, andespecially with childhood friend Shinako. We know that he already has feelingsfor the woman who took care of the brother until he passed away, still can't getover the brother after all these years. Hey, before we carry on? I would like toargue for Shinako's case that she is a mentally weak person, that she reallycannot get over the brother after all these years. This, I think we may haveseen enough of it all these weeks and also this episode to understand that. Butconsidering we know how Rou-kun and Shinako think... Rou-kun where's yourrespect for the elderly? Haha Kana-chan I'm so sorry I just wanted to make ajoke, sorry. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But really, Rou has his selfishness tucked into his wildpersonality, and that is making people around him uneasy, considering Shinako isin a different age gap AND thinks differently from him. His aggressivenesswould've worked well on Rikuo (we will talk about that later haha I can't wait),but for Shinako... I would say he has made the wrong move. I wouldn't say isthat he was late, but she isn't interested in you. For her to put down the factof a dead person whom she loved, she has to forget about you. You cannot repeathistory to make it worse for her, man. To know whether Rou-kun screwed this upalready, I can confidently tell you he did because he said "I'll protect you inmy brother's place" because in case you haven't realised then, you are NOT thebrother. You screwed up bro; you're not getting anything out of this right now,I can tell you. And I SWEAR if Shinako appeared in front of Rikuo's place to nottalk to him about things but it's to confess, I'll be even more darned for aroller coaster ride. Thank goodness from the author, we know this series isn'tso direct of a case. Phew, got me worried for a moment haha. But secretly weknow, dear author, secretly we know it's going to happen. I think I better sayit here first, but whoever Shinako confesses to first will be dealbreaker to therelationship hogs we have here so far.<strike  >We shall see if I'm correct in the next few episodes haha I said it here  first.</strike>&nbsp;Well, turns out, spoiler alert, that we don't have to wait for nextepisode. And because we know Shinako does have feelings for Rikuo, and he hasbeen a great listening ear thus far (I mean he is, and so am I) (haha I takepride in this btw), Shinako finally decides to take action after not beingpushed for so long and realising no one will. (Basically my life in a nutshell)Oh boy, would this change things up. See, Rikuo? Changing your career path ain'tall too bad after all. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To end this, I swear I stared at how Shinako wasstaring at Rou-kun's arms for the longest time ever, and I paused to realisethat she's probably thinking about the brother. Ah... AH!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This showis deep, in many ways than other. Let's see how deep this rabbit hole we can do,we're only halfway through this. But I believe, we might be just gettingstarted. I dig this ship, this Rikuo Shinako ship. We're going to depart for thehigh seas, boys! I can't wait for next week where Rikuo gets LAID lmao aboutthat<br />[And BOY am I SO GLAD I can recognise the voice in that new theme song, so incase you don't know of "Sanketsu Shoujo" Sayuri, now is also my time to get backinto her music this one isn't bad]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CGhAODbW-Nw/XsEthECH_XI/AAAAAAAA7Cg/mHIq0MMp_pQ3OHuvPS4rXulcqZcfH9G4ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday07_rikuo1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW... anything, actually.

YeahHaru-chan, you're the best haha<br />[Oh yeah just realised that Haru-chan is the first victim in this. Yeah, thisepisode is the happiest you'll see her in, by the way. Sadded haha]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KaguyaSamaS206">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "You just want us to win such that we don't make Iino Miko a laughing    stock?" Haha Shirogane, didn't know you can read human minds, out of all of    them.  </div></blockquote>Man, with all this seriousness, I can't get over the fact that we aren't evengetting a joke dropped down half this episode, but yeah, this is what happenswhen you get a second season Anime adaptation haha. So, it's time to getserious. In this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS206) we reach the final part of theElections arc I would like to say, and it ended spectacularly, in many ways thenother. Firstly, Shirogane's edge. Obviously, through many means than other, heis at the winning side, mostly due to Kaguya being scheming as heck even to theextent of bribing and getting teaches to stare at students who are not on theirside (wow, just wow), but that's not the point. On Miko-chan's turn, that'swhere the focus is that this time around. We have learnt that Miko-chan hasnever won Student Council elections thus far, not even once. For being tooserious, she is never liked by anyone other than her best friend since shestarted school. That said, when standing upon the stage for her own speech,that's where everything including her past and present hit her. Not the awesomegrades, not her confidence, but the lack thereof. One should know even withoutlistening to her backstory as explained by her friend that, over the course ofso many years ever she started running for Student Council elections, she hasbeen infamously... bullied, in many fronts. I'm not going to start sh*tting onher because I am one myself to a smaller extent, but I would argue life treatsall of us differently, and evil is mostly what was placed upon Miko-chan.Looking at you, Kaguya-sama. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But going back to Ishigami's request atthe start of the episode, he stated one thing that he wanted to do, and that isto win the other candidate by a landslide. Though rather vague, he didn'texplain why until he showed Shirogane her stage fright due to all the years oftrying to break through, and if you didn't have that of a conclusion fromShirogane... I hope you have learnt a lesson too. Because really, Miko-chan hassuffered enough. Just like Kaguya but she never changes so I won't care nowrefer to season 1 for that haha, but suffice it to say that helping Miko-chan isbetter than killing her. Mentally, I mean. It takes a lot to voice out what youwant (ignore those protesters please, I swear), but as an individual, doing thatrequires a lot more than confidence. Finding that new comfort zone is never aseasy as doing it forever until you get it. Coming out from all these years ofgrowing, I can say that too. So Shirogane dropped the bomb on Ishigami seeinghow he was pissed at her, is that they should help her learn. And thus,Shirogane, instead of cutting her off just as she was speechless at her speechafter Kaguya literally railed on her election speech, chose to let her presenther point to the students in the school so she could get her point across.Though she did not win, the students then learnt of how bad the prestigiousschool's reputation was on morals ie. rock bottom, and why there is a need toimprove on it, basically her as a member of the Morals Committee. But yeah,seriously, Shirogane's team has been enjoying life too much in school. Didn'tthey say the worst of life is at school? These kids look like they're on avacation lmao. In the end, Shirogane still won because we know the election wasrigged (thanks, Russia) (haha), but that didn't stop Miko-chan in getting herown group of followers after that ravaging debate on stage that the whole schoolwitnessed. And of course, we now know why she was the new girl of the series(sorry to her friend lol), but yes because she's here to set things straight.That is, if she joins the Student Council. Hey, it was a long and rough run,guys.

"Shaved heads are more cool" Haha that's joke of the episode right therehaha Miko-chan didn't know you're into baldies lmao "I don't care about yourfetish!" <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> "We have a hashtag trending on Instagram" lol<br />[<a href="https://jisho.org/search/miko" target="_blank">Miko</a>-chan wouldmake a GREAT WIFE by the way she do the cleaning chores so well I can't even]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>So this week, and probably our busiest week ever in Klassic Note, we have acouple more releases to listen despite the delays here and there and CollectionArtists not coming up with new songs lol. However,<b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new album</b> delivers some promise that their style didn'tfade off, but I would argue them now is really between past them and acousticthem which probably made them more mellow and softer than they should be.Remember "PB"?? Yeah, those were the days. <b>Waki Azumi's new single</b> isdetermined by me to release digitally this week despite the physical releasedelay to next month, so I'm giving the one song first since... even with 4tracks she can't hit me with another one. No, not even the one which isliterally techno don't do this to me I don't like that haha. Lastly,<b>LuckLife's new single</b> is... meh, to be frank. But I can give the topicsong, to say the least. Compared to their mini-album last year due to theirshift in music label, this is far from that level, I would argue. Well,something better next time, guys? I really want to see a new them in thisband.<br /><br />In news all around Twitter mainly,<b>Amamiya Sora is releasing a new album</b> by the end of the year (so yay?) (Iswear this should have been earlier since that single in January but you know,pandemic), <b>VELTPUNCH's new music video</b> and also 2nd in the new musicvideo series up to their new album is not as great as the first,<b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai released part of their live performance</b> last nightwhich I haven't watched yet since you know, things haha (that or I can wait forthe second half to watch it together) (ah, available until next week), SCANDALhas a new song coming next month,<b>TrySail celebrated their 5th anniversary with a special YouTube video</b>which you can see online (they, uh, sang their debut song at their homes), and<b>vivid undress' upcoming mini-album has been delayed</b> from June to August.What did I say about the delays, eh? Haha I'm getting tired I need more music asfuel man stop pushing them backwards dammit<br /><br />Next week, I'll be giving <b>flumpool's new album</b> a listen mainly because ofAnime "Kakushigoto", but we shall see if I can give more. I mean, they are a lotlike BUMP of CHICKEN by my impression and those aren't exactly my style so let'ssee how far I can get. And maybe I'll remember/forget Numakura Manami's bestalbum at some point haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay, I'm done. The lightning is bad out there, I'm kind of sweating somehowfrom typing all this and I still haven't showered today my hair is real long andI need more sleep. I mean, I have stopped taking naps now? So that's a problem.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week then, and until next time... I need to be moreexcited for Anime every week, man. All I do is work and play Animal Crossing nowI feel so dead inside haha okay maybe playing with this website is stillentertaining compared to YouTube videos in the background lmao you should'venoticed some changes when clicking on the labels and searching for posts. I'mdone, and congrats on getting married, Mikakoshi. I... wish you happiness.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> *smashes fist on table* I'm fine, this happened with Aki-chan alreadyand it's about time she got married too...
