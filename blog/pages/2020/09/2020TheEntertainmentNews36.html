Hey, I had a great nap so let's finish this week with another post!!
<div><br /></div>
<div> Yes, I said another. Because as you have noticed, another package dropped by my place. Which might be of your interest. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I believe if anyone is here in this desert of a blog or perhaps you stumbled it through digging through my Twitter profile you might end up here, that you must be interested in idol stuff. So you're welcome. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Sorry about the barcodes on some of the faces though that's my friend's only complaint when I showed him that very photo but then again not like he'll suddenly like any of them he doesn't like older women lol (Hey FYI I liked a woman nearly 7 years older than me thanks Aki-chan for the memories before you got married haha) (Yes you can find them in that one gallery that's so good someone cloned <a href="https://knneo.github.io/" target="_blank">my GitHub repo</a>&nbsp;before I removed the images from that repo lol yeah I just directly contributed to Internet piracy)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div> <div>  Let's start, shall we? I'm starting with Uzaki-chan first because somehow my  friend watched it already (remember, I only watch on Sundays) and he wants  to talk about it. Right now we can only talk about those two in the cafe  eating two bowls of rice each lmao<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="GREATPRETENDER09"> <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> GREAT PRETENDER</span> </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <div style="text-align: center;">  "Even if you knew, you still wouldn't know how she (Abbie) feels. The  rest of us wouldn't either" Yeah so far it's that, guys. Not this week  too? Oh well </div>  </blockquote>  Wow I hope the production studio is ready for this episode because they have  been disappointing so far in making Singapore as realistic as possible in  their story- Okay I'm just joking they can't fly here to do surveying now  and they can hire locals to do it too, why not. Just a heads up if you  haven't watched it yet, but the best scene is when Makoto is sipping on that  small cup of coffee in front of Sam lmao this definitely one-upped last week  with Laurent eating Chinese food haha. In this new episode  (#GREATPRETENDER09) where we get Sam get off the hook and win money for now,  we talk about how big a horse anus is haha hey I didn't start the  conversation ask Cynthia and Laurent. Makoto, though, has other ideas.  Besides duping the heck out of Sam of course, but also, about Abbie. So  first, let's talk about what is with Abbie's history we know about till now.  And I think it's still not a lot considering the previous one also pretty  much gave us a good idea of what it is already. But first and foremost a  warning: Abbie's race is... if you watched till the end already, Middle  Eastern. And we do know stories from that place being a terrorist fighting  ground until recently, so yeah, they chose this to talk about so I'll  briefly make guesses so that I don't get flagged for inappropriate content  lol. So, Abbie as a kid was a ballet dancer, all was well, the parents hang  out with her until... planes flew by her country she was living in. Normally  that is good for Singapore where your local Air Force has nowhere else to  fly (can I put this blog to have exclusive information already? lol), but in  the Middle East where you can build airstrips on deserts... something's  obviously not normal. Soon she was in war, and probably volunteered as part  of the local Force to deter the opponents who took their land and... she got  out alive, but probably alone, that is. So, we'll put that aside for now  because we know this will easily affect her racing in due time because  spoiler alert, she might be trying to kill someone here <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span>, but yeah,  the underground casino first. So yeah, Sam so far has made what, 3 trips  alone to the casino betting every time on Abigail on every time she is in a  race, so yeah, he's earned quite a lot so far, almost bankrupting the  conman's coffers, if I would say. But no worries, it's a small risk to take  to empty the rich oil tycoon descendant anyways, so yeah, they are riding it  right now, it seems. And with more strategy too, from initially letting him  win happily, then banning him and letting Makoto go on his behalf (bro be  glad you're still alive after all this haha) and THEN losing all of it  because they tampered with the engine... Well we had Cynthia to go on site  to "observe" the opposing team, even though we know the "observation" is not  on her because no one "observed" Abbie putting the pill into the trunk. Hey,  if it doesn't work on Sam it'll definitely work on all the other guys  because we know Sam's gay anyways lmao. Anyways, we now know that's the same  method used to disable Lewis but compared to him the latter got an emergency  landing on the beautiful straits of Singapore River (on second note can you  stop polluting it so it looks like the 1950s again? thanks) (haha), so that  dude got it out alive maybe, he got out. Like, he ran away from the  competition. Hey, must be God punishing him for staring at tits, amirite??  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, that's how far they are egging Sam on so that he will  swear to earn them all back, so yeah, as you can see, it's pretty intense.  And I thought this wouldn't get more intense, Abbie asked Lewis out (wait,  without the wife?) (lol) alone in the middle of nowhere... to ask questions.  Yes, that's what it is. Interrogation, considering he's already on a  wheelchair. But really, after seeing all that in this episode,&nbsp;is it  his fault though? I mean, it's war, Abbie. You can't do this in Singapore go  settle your problems elsewhere where guns are not prohibited. Haha cya guys  next week for the results then. To someone's bet on their own air races, and  to whoever's fate we need to deal with at some point I have a feeling it's  not going to be only Abbie's now <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> </div> <div>  <div class="thumbnail"> <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ddpxtpWNGts/X1TIAR9Pk3I/AAAAAAAA-GQ/rjwaD1bwlq0ozIQsbv8SaBGEOJcEdQJOACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender09_abbie1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    This never gets old haha<br />   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div> <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EDhVtvnxKOY/X1TIAbPDKuI/AAAAAAAA-GU/8nAsx6Vl3NskZL7SxDPe0VmYHh513RiKACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender09_cynthia.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Once again, if you're not attracted to Cynthia I'm pretty sure    you're gay.<br />Or maybe you're not into boobs lol or old women    *gets punched*   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div>  </div>  P.S.

In  this new episode (#UzakiChan09) where we finally welcome the mother into the  mix, I still can't believe after a decade of watching Anime I'm watching a  slice-of-life series that is literally waiting for fireworks to happen lmao  isn't that every romance series. Also, didn't realise I need a dosage of  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/869/Saori_Hayami" target="_blank">Hayami Saori</a>  after this long of not seeing her in Anime- oh she's not 43? Oh, that's the  character she's playing? Oops. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, story I guess. Firstly, we  talk about the mother because... why not? Well, just for the one reason, I  guess. Someone puked on Sakurai's bed and he has to get a replacement for  it, but you know, he got a cheaper one so he's just returning the money back  lol mom how much money did you give him as compensation? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah,  this new character though... genuinely fears Sakurai. Just like bystanders  who normally see him in a bad impression because of his eyes and build  mainly, the mother (using her name isn't that easy to reference so I'm  avoiding it) (also "Tsuki ga Kirei" sounds like it'll give her the wrong  idea lol read on for more) sees him in a more worrying light when she found  out that the senpai her daughter has been hanging out with is... a male.  Hey, you didn't tell this to your mom? Really? As anybody's parent I'll be  naturally worried, especially when it's Sakurai. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, story.  Sakurai did kind of out stay his visit, but not until he had a quarrel with  Uzaki-chan (the daughter) in front of the mother, and also, stare at  <strike>her boobs</strike> her cats haha like seriously it's the eyes. So  yeah, and considering we get a hint of that drama plot she was watching  earlier it's no wonder she'll get misunderstood easily and it's only going  deeper the further she talks about it, especially to the people in the cafe.  Like seriously, someone's throwing their rice away and eating vegetarian  already lmao. So yeah, the mother did visit her daughter's workplace and is  surprised to find Sakurai also in the premises (well no shit he was here  first), but then in the end digging the hole deeper as she eavesdrops on the  wrong stuff around the premises lol. Then, Uzaki-chan gets pissed off again.  Now that we can see the formula it's kind of irritating to, as a man, have  to be gentlemanly to apologise for the words I say to a woman because that  is PRECISELY what Sakurai is doing so that he can get this b**ch to be  normal again. What? But then I realised this is what I was here for, and  just took it like a man- Okay we should be good here. They kind of  quarrelled in the cafe which is bad for business (unless you're business  savvy like Ami-chan lmao) (I'm sorry to say sir, that your cafe is going to  fall into the wrong hands at this rate), so the one kid stopped them by  giving them a lottery ticket. And as you know, with all lottery tickets in  Anime, they always win the best prize so without further ado... they get a  (I like how it's) 2 night 1 day trip to... Tottori? Well, you can look it  up, and I swear the panels out there is not sponsorship of some sort but i  don't know, but as you can see, it's only for 2 amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> So next  episode... is that a MIB reference?? lol no kids will get that haha they  only know Conan is a kid anyways even though he's an adult haha bye (okay  they hinted at the end who they are already I guess) </div> <div>  [TL:DR; Between the chests of Uzaki-chan, Ami-chan, and the mother... uh, no  comment haha]<br />  <div class="thumbnail"> <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dm7a_CRO36U/X1TJiGod0GI/AAAAAAAA-G0/Ejpy4GLDzxU45vrs03zUgwVPoSbPERMSwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan09_distance.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    THIS is how you practice social distancing so Uzaki you're too    close to Sakurai haha<br />   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div> <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vys-WZAXztg/X1TJiNBddlI/AAAAAAAA-Gw/xzHBeEORpWcFXhjhl7l-f5zYbAxrRnhBwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan09_uzaki5.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Somehow nice Uzaki is as irritating as normal Uzaki and I swear    Sakurai only apologised to keep this series going lol<br />   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div>  </div>  P.S.

Yeah, this is Kinoshita  "Boner" Kazuya, ladies and gentlemen. Without a doubt haha </div>  </blockquote>  Okay all I remembered from the preview was that Ruka-chan was having a great  time haha look if she's having a great time so will I because I just want to  see her in happin...ess... okay now that my Anime creep's out of the way  haha. In this new episode (#KanoKari09) where Kazuya has to get a part-time  job to survive because he burnt too much money on rental girlfriends lmao  (hey same here bro but I'm to a smaller extent and it's not on women)  (haha), I've... honestly never been so excited to see a hotel again since  (okay there was "KimiSui" but) I got disgusted on "Koi to Uso" lol. So,  story, I guess. Just revising on the "this relationship's purely business"  thing to Kazuya too, just in case. But look how happy he is with that one  phone case because cookies would've been a better gift lmao SUCK IT KAZUYA  haha. Okay, joke's over, so story. The main two were caught by Ruka-chan  again. And I would argue I'm going to refer to "the main two" as Kazuya and  Ruka soon because... he got brought into a hotel room?? Yeah, just for  confrontation though, relax. For Ruka-chan though, her heartbeat's still  going strong so good for you, girl. But as we can see so far, the guy's not  reciprocating your feelings to you. So yeah, reminding ourselves about  forced happiness again, I guess. But unlike Chizuru,&nbsp;Kazuya, she's  prepared to "take it all in", semen and everything. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, being  trapped in a love hotel somehow because at some point Ruka-chan got bored of  normal dates lol (Naobou I know you don't have the guts but if you want to  do this to me that'll be stellar haha), Kazuya has to tell her everything or  else he's gonna don that condom I swear (and that'll count as a porno so if  you would excuse me) (haha), and even then yeah we're right back to Episode  1 with Ruka here because she also knows lie upon lies is not a great idea at  any point, even if it's lying to the grandma about the girlfriend thing.  Also, she was here first haha and it's impossible for Kazuya to get TWO  girls anyways so (hey I gotta shit on him too somehow) I guess this episode  really is focused on Ruka-chan going on the aggressive. Not on Kazuya mind  you but seriously if he wants to he can (haha what), but yeah, sort of, to  erase this fact about those main two being together as a couple because we  all know... it's not true. Sadly, that's not what the grandma thinks. Again,  because all this while Chizuru's girlfriend image has rubbed off on the old  woman, liking this future daughter-in-law so much she's like me liking  <strike>Naobou</strike> Ten-chan (haha) so yeah, it's that complicated, it  seems. Talking about story, because Ruka-chan managed to see the message on  Kazuya's phone about the grandmother, she knows to appear at the supposed  meeting between Kazuya's girl and the old woman, to.... well so far it's  just her being a pathological liar about her being girlfriend Kazuya I can't  believe you can say lies like this lol. Hey, it takes a bigger lie to cover  up the previous one, just so you didn't realise this. The grandmother  believed it though, but I'm pretty sure within the couple of hours in the  restaurant the grandma went from "you two timing her?" after scolding him at  the entrance thinking it's a misunderstanding to "you two timing her?"  because this lie seems like it's too much also wtf is this harem lmao. And  then you'll realise they went to the shrine on New Year's and notice that  Kazuya's miracle is basically impossible going from his draw of the  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/omikuji" target="_blank">omikuji</a>  anyways so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (But seriously if I will ever see such fortunes on my  draw, I know I'm in for a good time lol what) Ruka-chan did remind those two  (main two, not talking about Kazuya's parents lol) about the situation  anyways, and really insists there is something more going on between them  which is not wrong. Well, at least, to some extent, I guess. Hey, you tell  me, those who read the manga till the latest chapter haha. Anyways, and  suddenly Ruka-chan and the grandmother were missing from the shrine, which  obviously spells bad news but, in the end, because of the old woman's love  for Chizuru (lol what did I tell you), she... Ruka-chan didn't say it. I  know right even if you say it though no one will believe you more than his  son who IS the real pathological liar haha GOT HIM <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, instead of  going aggressive so far, Ruka-chan in the end then decided to, you know, do  the girlfriend the normal way. Gain favour of the family, and so on. It's  like dating Kazuya, but you have to date the grandmother too because that's  what's Chizuru is going anyways lol. Lastly, everyone's fortunes. I mean, we  don't need to know about the ones from the elders ("you will gain a new  family member in happiness" and then the grandma will be like) (haha), but  more importantly actually, on Chizuru. Okay maybe Ruka-chan's was spot on  too which led her to her conclusion here but still. I know, obviously they  are giving you the question mark on Chizuru's side till the end (or if the  end will ever come), but this is kind of a long thing coming, it's  complicated, maybe we can move on with things not until they are 80 but at  least until the elder passes away and no one in the family totally loves  Chizuru crazily by then lol but you get the idea THE ENDING THEME IS  GREAT!!! Haha out this week btw and if you want a dose of halca-san the  singer she has a phone line for rental girlfriend now lol no joke haha bye  (wtf is that Chizuru doing the devil next episode with Kuri?? Oooohhhhh!!  haha alright) </div> <div>  <div class="thumbnail"> <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JuBscVACg5I/X1TK81UKilI/AAAAAAAA-HI/AgpaOpZUz60u6wJuhr9Icq7MVzlWm01KACLcBGAsYHQ/s2560/kanokari09_tired.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="2560" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JuBscVACg5I/X1TK81UKilI/AAAAAAAA-HI/AgpaOpZUz60u6wJuhr9Icq7MVzlWm01KACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h180/kanokari09_tired.jpg" width="640" /></a>   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Everyone after work lol yes the retirement age here is not that    low FYI<br />   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div> <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBD-9TP9NXM/X1TK85aSHiI/AAAAAAAA-HE/lv8wR6AUqFcDt_ONKwwnrJZ2HFoSePOeQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokari09_sex.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Okay I'm legit still disappointed I can't find a (satisfactory)    hentai version of this series lmao<br />   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div>  </div>  P.S. lmao when I saw the comments Kazuya saw when he thinks it's special  haha bro what did I say last week about Chizuru now being everyone's slut- </div> <div>  P.P.S. lol the notice on the door lock removal in a love hotel bro if it's  an emergency it's NOW man let him out!!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> </div> <div>  [More Ruka-chan love because Kazuya is not giving it haha poor girl now you  know why she's in Twitter Trending also Sumi-chan somehow even though she  hasn't appeared? lol] </div>

Haha okay maybe it's this week at work haha. I spent some time listening to <b>UNLIMIT's special live video</b> footage on YouTube, and came back with a couple of songs? Yeah, so one from the 2014 album I've listened to before, and two from their 2011 album so it's before I started getting into them (FYI like many, from Anime "BLEACH" ending theme) so I might as well reviewed it too, so that's quite a harvest here. Other than that, let's talk about new releases this week. <b>halca's new single</b> is... meh at best, but I'm so glad the topic song is a lot better than I've listened to so far, so that's a plus. <b>Kano's new single</b> which is for Anime "Uzaki-chan" but unlike the Anime (fortunately) doesn't have Uzaki-chan in it, and it still sounds quite good(?) so I ended up giving it. That, or I think I brainwashed myself half the week to give it anyways haha the rapping part really isn't that great. <b>Amamiya Sora's new album</b> is... well, I didn't give many but some of them did impress me, from the one topic song with music video which you can see on YouTube, to the first song after the prelude which is my new beat now, to I think I've heard that "new" song in her recent live I've heard last week which probably, cemented this song's position in my list haha hey watching lives do help in increasing my music library lol</div><div><br /></div>  In news of music on Twitter and unlikely beyond because I don't have to but just in case, Happy Birthday Freddie Mercury just because, <b>Sambomaster's new music video</b> is actually good and yes I'm talking about the song and we might have a new single incoming, <b>Ikimonogakari's new music video and single</b> release on Monday isn't that bad and I'll probably try to give it next week when it's not that busy as this week, <b>Tsuji Shion's summer live livestream</b> is great and I don't know how I missed it last week so I watched it on archive which probably is gone from YouTube by now, and welcome our newcomer <b>Collection Artist Amamiya Sora</b> because I've given enough songs from her new album to put her into the list. I know I skipped it since last week on her birthday but (haha)</div><div>  <br />  So next week, thanks to this reminder from the above paragraph, <b>Sambomaster's new single</b> will be under review which I must say it has been a long time coming since the previous one, and of course we'll see if we can put <b>Natsukawa's 4th single</b> on the shelf. I, uh, really can't get my hands on a preview of the B-side so if it really will happen I'll decide on Wednesday personally. Excuse me. *says in a suggestive voice* "I'll review her on Wednesday personally" haha I sound like a pervert manager talking about that newcomer "<a href="../../2020/07/the-latest-stuff-from-east-coast-what.html#DoukiChan">Ganbare Douki-chan</a>" haha you thought I was about to say Idolmaster you otaku f**k (lmao)</div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />So yeah, a week just passed by again. Man, pondering about life at work sucks haha then again I may be not busy enough to be able to spend time doing that so maybe I'll put my lack of problems with someone else preferably so that I can actually be busy or something lol. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... Maybe I should go back to writing APoL. I know I say that many times already, but man if I can get rid of the stench off my body that is called video games, maybe I'll get back to it. Again, ask me in my alternate life and I'll say I'm a book lover. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ok bye</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Really, that dream with Rieri in it was too real it's not like I'm on top of her but (lol) it's such a real depiction of me as a fan if I were to ever meet her in real life, no joke haha</div><div><br /></div><div>P.P.S. Anyone wants light theme mode on this blog? No? Then okay haha</div>
