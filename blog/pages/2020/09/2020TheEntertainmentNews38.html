Hey, Anime on Saturday because I... am going to hate Sundays from this week
onwards. I already am though haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Long story short (as short as I can make it), because this Chinese physician
  is only available on weekends on Sunday (unless you want me to take work leave
  to see the doctor on weekdays but we'll get to that in a bit), and there is a
  real queue to an extent that you have to wake up as early as 7am to queue for
  a number which may not be applicable for the morning consultation session so
  you come back in the afternoon, but I'm starting to feel the effects. I may
  not go this long because other than the disruption it causes to me on Sundays
  specifically, it's also going to take a toll on my mom who is so willing to
  queue early morning so I can sleep a little more (thanks mom), and also, spend
  hours on end cooking the medicine (yes, they just give you the not processed
  ingredients) just so I can drink this once a day. Imagine if it's twice a day.
  I tell you, if it doesn't work on me which also means now I have to
  effectively control what I eat every day ie. saying goodbye to my colleagues
  on Friday which I did (<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span>), I might as well just stop this torture and go
  to another sinseh who will probably get the same meds but without having to
  let my mom suffer. Like really, it's not going to be worth it we have been
  doing this ever since I have the money to pay for this from working.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Let's just hope this pays off because I'm paying something now and it's not
  just using money and I'm not happy about it. Okay, Anime time!! Let's knock
  that sadness into the abyss!! And yes, KanoKari first because Sumi-chan is
  finally here, like, for the last two episodes of the series you sure this is
  not two cour? Haha<br />

  Okay who dubbed the Chinese and French this week?
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hetakuso" target="_blank">Hetakuso</a> da
  haha okay I'm not going to show off my Japanese here I only know Chinese
  please spare me the agony. Also, it's not that it's bad but it doesn't blend
  in with those Japanese haha trust me on that. So, in this new arc of a new episode
  (#GREATPRETENDER11) where everyone doesn't blend in especially Makoto lol,
  this might be their biggest episode budget in hiring foreign talent to do the
  dubs haha it paid off though because there's that language gap. So firstly,
  the situation now. It's winter now, in France, and don't expect snow in
  Singapore by the way lol. Laurent is hanging out in France drawing Cynthia,
  who hate people who draw, and we'll get to that later because Makoto is
  crapping out in a sushi shop that can't even sushi haha, you know, trying to
  live an honest life, as he always wanted. Obviously, not really going his way,
  but as you can see, he's living it through. Working at a place who doesn't
  recognise him for his efforts (I mean, China people in a Japanese restaurant
  in France?? lol), living in a boarding house sipping off coffee... that's kind
  of a life, I guess. Hey, trust me, things could be worse. But as some dude
  walked in to insult his boss on his food, forcing him to close shop, and the
  France owner of the boarding house he lives in sudden debt and having to close
  the place so effectively Makoto has no place to work AND stay now... this is
  going to be quite the pinch. So, he devises a plan, surprisingly, without
  Laurent, to save the owner from selling the place, and to teach that dude a
  lesson. So, pros and cons with a heist without Laurent 101. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  Pros: (1) Things get done quicker. Makoto's plan is just to sell the painting
  on the boarding house's wall for 20k euros so the house family can pay the
  debt, so he asks Cynthia for help, without Laurent, to complete the task and
  you know, get the dude to pay for it. Easy. Quick. It's not that tough as
  Makoto gets what he wants real easy. (2) No Laurent. You don't know how
  advantageous it is without seeing his face around lol, but hey, it's just a
  small heist of duping a dude into buying a painting which he intends to gift
  someone else, so why not? And now we can talk about why Laurent is important
  to the series haha. Cons: (1) Intelligence checks. As Cynthia would have
  hinted already as they pretend to be the masters of a random art gallery and
  put up that painting, that dude is famous art appraise and auctioneer James
  Coleman, and with her face like this we'll talk about what it has to do with
  her for later. But yes, that means Laurent would have researched on the guy to
  ensure they get up to 20 million euros of that cut, even if it will take some
  time for the painting to be authenticated. Even if not, Laurent will find a
  way to sell it at that price anyways lol so yeah Makoto you already lost. (2)
  It's Laurent. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, jokes aside, let's get back to story, and how
  this will lead us to the current arc's fate. So in case you haven't noticed
  till this far, Cynthia has something with this James guy. Besides seeing him
  in a flashback of hers, obviously we know that she knows of the dude's real
  identity, so yeah she decides to run away in fear of the painting not being
  able to deceive an art appraiser such as him, but thank goodness that was a
  real painting hidden in the shadows, so I guess all of them got the run for
  it. Sadly, at... let me check 20 million divided by 20 thousand... 1/1000th
  the price of its appraised value haha, but oh well, at least someone is safe
  from debt and Kudo-san did get the biggest cut out of this lmao. Then, it's
  Cynthia's drunk talk about the dude. So yes, it's a previous lover or
  something or else why would she hate people who like art like Laurent
  (although I would argue that they might be a couple of some level I don't
  know, these two), and then she talks things like stealing the painting back so
  it can be sold at its actual value?? Haha if this is going to be all of it and
  they are moving to England for this this will be exciting to watch, for
  starters. And please spare me the foreign language stuff I can just listen to
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/toutoi" target="_blank">toutoi</a> Japanese
  voice acting thanks. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Let's hope this swindler of a James Coleman can
  live up to his name so we can really see him freak out when Cynthia kicks him
  in the butt with her heel haha cya guys next week
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; GREAT PRETENDER in a nutshell (pun not intended but) is basically the
  two buying chestnuts and not understanding anything, sit down in such a
  heart-warming scene eating together and Makoto says his ass is cold lmao]</div>

  I swear I never thought I'll like a scene with Hayamin and Naomi-chan panting
  in 2020 but here we are. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#UzakiChan11) where
  Uzaki Hana is trying to pimp out her mom to his... boyfriend?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay
  you guys give me a while while I get the rice cooker going. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, not
  that I have a lot of... whatever to accompany with the rice I'm cooking now
  lol, but yeah, this is quite an episode, and for once, a lot about Sakurai
  being outdoors. You know, because if by now you still don't think he is a
  gamer and stays indoors and can't go for solo karaoke- Okay I'm not the one
  sh*tting on him okay? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, about the story. Firstly, about Uzaki-chan
  taking Sakurai's place like a museum of sorts. You know, taking whatever she
  found (and then bought?) on the streets and showing him AND THEN not needing
  it anymore because she showed her senpai?? Are you that rich, girl? Or are
  those things so cheap you can spare that instead of just like, taking photos
  of them and sharing it with the guy. I can understand with the frog cushion or
  beanbag but man, did everything else go into the trash real quick. Well, at
  least his room's cleaner now. Just... don't throw away the stuff she leaves at
  the fridge Sakurai that's to feed you. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Talking about cooking, the
  cafe owner thought it would be nice to ask Sakurai to help out in the back ie.
  cooking, but turns out... he can't cook. You know, it's that bad Uzaki can
  laugh until she got a stroke. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, he asks the mother for help. Since
  the cafe owner's wife is... we don't know who she is anyways, Uzaki's mother
  decide to teach this guy, just, you know, don't look him in the face then all
  is well. But you know, these two gotta tell her about petting the cats someday
  haha she keeps getting the wrong idea that it's not her. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next up,
  rock climbing. Sounds a little sudden, but hey, it's kind of thanking Uzaki
  for helping him learn to cook from her mom, just that this one is going to be
  a showdown Uzaki is meant to lose too, considering Sakurai's well-trained
  physique he can climb the walls so many times, Uzaki can only look at him show
  off. And then, probably the highlight of the episode especially when they are
  drunk we'll get to that later, is Sakurai in karaoke. Dammit we were so close
  to hearing him sing the opening theme so too bad this would not be on the
  soundtrack (Remember Anime "Kannagi" where all the songs they sang were in the
  soundtrack in the karaoke episode?? Those were the days haha thanks Aniplex)
  (Also Aniplex thanks for Anime "Kaguya-sama" character songs you guys just
  write new songs for a radio show segment that's impressive), but guess who wil
  be on the soundtrack. Nobody. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Because besides singing, Uzaki and
  Ami-chan found him singing alone which it's regarded as a societal sin doing
  that alone (even for rehearsal purposes you should be shaming yourself at the
  first outing to the karaoke with your friends dude), but yeah, it's a literal
  party crashing, if you equate it to watching movies alone and suddenly you're
  not alone. Life sucks, isn't it? Not if you order a couple of beers and they
  decide to dress up in cosplay though!! Yes, my heart is with Ami-chan Sakura
  might be aroused by bunny girl but I'll take that bullet (twice) from the cop
  anytime. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Premium rubber bullets haha) (That is a Yakuza 4 reference
  lol) Also, does it really pay off to be ripped? I gotta start training.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And, to end the episode and as a prelude to the end of the series,
  Uzaki suddenly showed up at her senpai's place all drenched and said with
  tears down her face that she cannot play with him anymore. She must be
  pregnant haha okay we'll see how this ends next week
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; You think
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuki_Kaji" target="_blank">the husband</a>
  knows about Ayachi touching up on ripped dudes? lol]</div>

  Yeah, Rieri must use her cute voice for this role again, huh. Kind of guessed
  it from her but still, I'd like her to use this voice less but oh well I got my fair
  share in JoshiMuda already because IN THIS NEW EPISODE OF SUMI-CHAN (#KanoKari11) lol
  which no one should leave her out just because it took 10 episodes for her to even be
  mentioned in the Anime, like really, we can have another series where it only
  stars Sumi-chan and get those other b*tches out of the way lol no really the
  author wrote a novel based on her instead, first volume out this month.
  Anyways, let's talk about Anime. Well, after watching this week's episode I
  must say, I miss Ruka-chan A LOT haha okay I have my fair share of high
  pitched girls anyways so back at you, me. So, story. Story starts strong with
  the Sumi-chan date so far, so that's good, straight to the point. Just that,
  you know, the ex is watching. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay not about her first, let's talk
  about the new girl. The episode starts with a description about the life of
  this introvert and has some level of&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/komyusho" target="_blank">komyusho</a>, studying hard at college and waking up early like her grandparents used to
  teach her (probably but I'm just guessing or else who would do this) (I meant
  waking up early you should study hard in college haha), but more importantly,
  she is a... woman? She is a woman with little words. Like seriously, in her
  call with Chizuru they gotta cut her talking about- You can be a light
  novel-based video game main character haha they also don't talk. Anyways,
  Kazuya has to think of ideas for the date since you know, she doesn't plan all
  the stuff unlike the #1 Rookie in the company lol, so yeah, getting rental
  girlfriends such as her would be rough. So yeah, I hope you have a plan when
  renting this one at random haha. Anyways, they go bowling, and there's where
  you see <strike>Mami-chan</strike> the title card from the Anime on their official site (Mami-chan
  not yet, please), but since she hardly ever leaves the house unless it's for
  school, Sumi-chan... can't play many things even at this location. From
  bowling to baseball to ice skating... she always finds a chance to show off
  her <strike>panties</strike> lack of skills as a rental girlfriend. Well, not
  that you must have those skills; I'll take a girlfriend who knows nothing so I
  can psycho her into believing my lies lmao. But yeah, Kazuya did to some
  extent, do his job as a boyfriend, and guide her along this "date", but yeah
  as he said, this is going to be rough. Sumi-chan is already hitting the ground
  running and she can barely catch up with the competition. Well, if the
  competition means Chizuru of course haha. Anyways, they bumped into Mami-chan
  which is of course bad news since as much as Sumi-chan doesn't know of what is
  happening right now for this dude, (Oh and this is the time where Sumi-chan
  braves up to say she's his girlfriend?? Haha man, I know this date is
  technically confidence training but this is not a great time lmao) but also,
  it'll be hard to explain to Mami-chan on anything about this "date" unlike how
  he dealt with those dudes who want to pick up on Sumi-chan earlier. But yeah
  Mami-chan, as much as I would like to believe that you'll (not) keep a secret,
  even if you tell on Chizuru, Kazuya also won't have to worry because there's
  nothing going on between all of them. Like, nothing as in no relationship at
  all they are all just client and employee relationships haha. So now that we
  are here, about Mami-chan. We know she's a virgin. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I mean, look at
  her. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> She can't even teach her ex a lesson, for goodness sake haha
  only lashing it on social media haha. Ignoring that, she seems kind of jealous
  with all these girls around his life right now (Spoiler alert, but they are
  all not his girlfriend lol), and as much as his (younger) brother is itching
  on her lol hey bro, she... might really want him back for all we know. But
  now, especially from the end of the episode, I think she wants to break havoc.
  So, let's see how far this takes her. All in all, in a production standpoint,
  I can't understand why they bring in Sumi-chan (even though she's cute I'll
  give you that) just so they can end this with Chizuru saying she's going to
  stop the rental girlfriend business. And of course, whatever you saw at the
  end of this episode. Sorry for comparing this to "Toradora!", but this
  confrontation thing should've happened in like, last week's episode haha I
  guess there's Ruka-chan too then. Hmm, I don't know. It sure is great with
  many episodes of Chizuru though, but I have a feeling that may be too well to
  talk about just so we can put in these other characters to talk about in case
  this series isn't hyped enough with just Ten-chan or something haha. But hey,
  the initial story is literally getting a rental because the ex fell through
  with the guy, so yeah, hopefully this is the end to everything. Well, for this
  adaptation anyway. With 17 volumes and counting, the author is sure to make
  this exciting with new characters (AFAIK there is one new one looking from the
  covers) just so you don't get bored of Chizuru- I won't though, author, trust
  me haha cya guys next week

  P.S. "...I wake up 5 minutes before the alarm rings" Hey it's totally true because that's what they call your biological clock, where you will wake up before the
  alarm goes off because you are used to wake up at that time period already.
  That's literally me every weekday haha which also happens on weekends too
  actually but I just go back to sleep haha FREEDOM!! lol</div>

  This week... well there aren't any new songs, so it's literally me trying to
  find releases if I have the time. Clearly, I didn't have the time so whatever
  haha I should really browse through Apple Music Japan's new releases more
  often so find more to listen. So that, we'll touch on next week since it's
  also pretty much empty too oh yeah that nano.RIPE album. So this week, since
  <b>a Scenarioart song from their latest album appeared in my head</b> somehow
  I can't get rid of it (unlike a headache) so I think it's here to stay. Must
  be the recent live I watched some time ago but man did it outstay its welcome.
  Other than that, I listened to <b>Mishima Souhei's debut mini-album</b> which
  - if cinema staff's vocalist is more adequate of an introduction to this now
  also solo artist - really made weird shit in that album, I must say, so it's
  real hard to give anything I must say. So yeah, I'm kinda weird too so, maybe
  one song. Maybe.<br />
  <br />
  On news concerning music on Twitter and hardly beyond because I'm not that
  bothered to go that far normally (I probably should though),
  <b>VELTPUNCH's live livestream yesterday</b> slaps a** so much I gotta tell
  them after the livestream on Twitter (instead of donating on the spot because
  I only have money for women lmao) (Audience: Aiko-chan the bassist is woman)
  (ah about that) so yay me (translations included in case you can't Japanese
  like me <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span>), <b>marble might be back</b> (it's a band name not a noun) for
  more new songs after what, at least 10 years under cover? Well, at least they
  are active again, for remember that streaming thing for Lantis called MixBos?
  Yeah, that. But also more will be revealed on their upcoming livestream I
  assume, so I'm seeing how that goes I think next weekend.
  <b>Natsukawa Shiina's new topic song got another music video</b> but it's
  animated so no her but it's probably a good time to intro more indie composers
  and animators behind it I guess (I don't care I count that as an official
  music video lol), <b>Happy Birthday Kotobuki Minako</b> I enjoyed my playlist
  of your songs at work that day so much, and whatever whatever
  <b>Earphones' latest music video now has English subtitles</b> if you can
  stand the... music?? lol I can't even it's rather cool though once you reach
  the chorus. "If" you can reach to the chorus haha<br />
  <br />
  So, for next week, it's <b>nano.RIPE's best album</b> time, but from the looks
  of two topic songs and music video collaborations with other Anime solo artist
  ie. female voice actors (lol), it is not looking great so let's see if I can
  give some oldies if I'm into it or not. Since I said I saw some stuff on Apple
  Music on their new releases (which is never new because there's that one week
  lag), I'll be listening to <b>DENIMS' new mini-album</b> and
  <b>Cocoro Auction's new album</b>, both released this month. And also because
  releasing a full album isn't very profitable now lol.&nbsp;And yeah, from zero
  impression, why not. I just had to check if they are legitimate new releases
  or just some re-upload of their old library lol<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  The stars have aligned, my friends. Yes, the "September Otaku Package" which
  will be no doubt, quickly renamed to "October Otaku Package" mainly because
  when the last of them appear in that warehouse next week and shipping gets
  delayed again... I could use another package haha I'm energised again for next
  month haha so yeah, maybe let it come next month, I guess. Cya guya next time
  then, and until then... the physician suggested that I sleep early so good
  night haha I'll make a half-hour extension for that Yasobi show on Wednesdays
  of course who can resist Mikakoshi and Sumipe hehe bye<br />
  
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S.&nbsp; Every year, at this day, I remember her birthday. It has been so
  long, I don't even know how to face her after seeing all the comments and
  wishes for her on her day, I feel sad and lonely to ever approach her again,
  since we are so far away, and my... advances on her have never worked because
  I hardly try. Horie Yui, Happy Birthday, my girl. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Audience: I'm
  pretty sure you're talking about someone you had a crush on at middle school-)
  (SHUT UP haha)
