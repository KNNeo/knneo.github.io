Yeah, doing this quick because there's... work on Sunday. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Haha oh well, all in a day's work I guess<div><br /></div><div>And yeah, I'm on impulse... buy... mode now I wouldn't say that, but I'm just doing stuff I could have done before the virus ruled the world outdoors from upgrading into a newer PC for the whole family ie. me and my dad because it has been 6 years lol (not sponsored by Aftershock) (yet), to that package that'll be coming soon to... a calendar I probably can't hang on my wall. Haha that we'll see how it goes I'll just put my hand over the rated bits. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh also, that failed delivery of a desk yes talking about you IKEA the next time I do this you better reach here lol<br />
<br />Well, let's get to it then! Plenty of things to talk about that isn't work (thankfully) I must say, and yeah, my mind is kind of future-worrying as we speak but... we'll think about it when we get there as the Chinese saying goes "the boat will naturally straighten as it reaches the bridge" or is it the other way around I don't remember...<br /><br />

Looks like we're saving kids this time around. Will make of a good change
compared to the last time these guys did anything good lol well there's the
small story of Cynthia giving all the money she got from the manager from
gambling to the employee who had a kid and got fired. Remember that? Because I
do. In this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER16) where we think Vietnamese can listen
to English (especially kids who haven't went through any education) and you
thought the Japanese who voiced Cynthia got replaced by... whatever that is
lmao, we see Makoto undress Abbie. Yeah, I summarised this episode for you
already, you can go now. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, about the plan to dope the Japan mafia.
Hey, they did go for it, and Makoto is somehow their best alibi and translator
for the company here, so... okay there's the fat woman too but we'll get to that
in a moment. So, story. Cynthia and Shi'on (because she's technically Korean and
it's different from Shion) flew to Japan to negotiate with that trading company
which is under the mafia (we'll refer to the woman as Akemi from here on) to you
know, get some money from Akemi here since she should be rich, and could use a
boost in sales, if you know what I mean. So, the plan was to pretend to nab a
Middle East princess and then let them deal with the cr*p later before realising
that all this isn't even real (thanks Clarke for the assist haha) (you think Sam
will rat them out? lol), and get 100 million out of this. Excuse me, 1 billion
out of this. Yen, of course, but it's still quite a lot. Akemi got to see the
evidence for herself (mostly rigged) (I mean, the manager isn't that smart
haha), and with a threat of selling this prized good to Shanghai (I suppose,
mafia based there that isn't them), they got good money off the bat. Now, to
save Abbie. Sorry, "Abigail Ibrahim" is the 14th princess of the- Are we really
going to get away with this shtick? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the plan is to save her,
so Makoto had to treat the manager to a couple of drinks so to replicate the key
on his parson as I guess she is important property and they can't escape through
the window lol, but then Makoto can just take over the shift from the other guys
at night and THEN get her out? That doesn't seem like a necessary plan. Well,
it's stealth, I'm sure. And of course, in typical Makoto fashion, instead of
leaving with the lie in place ie. with Abbie and Laurent, he decides to save the
kids. Well on the other hand Laurent and the others have a plan to save those
kids, so that's the least of our problems. *looks at Laurent* Maybe not. Wait,
you no prepare another car? I like how he's scared of the traffic law at this
time of night lol. Anyways, Makoto goes back for them, and... they didn't want
to leave. Even with the door open. I would argue that since they will be sold
out to rich people they may have more fulfilling lives in the near future even
though it's probably just servant level so whatever people say they have to
follow, but hey, at least it's not their parents. BOOM got them haha sorry for
bombing trafficked kids too I gotta. And hey, I wished the drop on those kids
were "Have you heard of freedom?" Haha oh well they probably haven't went that
far yet huh. You know, live your life thing and then realise you have something
to live for such that if you get kidnapped or sold you'll want to escape so that
you can get back your life? No? You guys don't too? Hey, what a coincidence haha
cya guys next week although I would argue Makoto will still save them though
they can join Laurent's group lmao&nbsp;<div><div>

    </blockquote>
    Why would you call it "<b>fall</b> in love"? Because it's a trap you fall
    into and can never get out of it again- Oh that's marriage? Ah, I see.
    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And yeah, not like you'll know Elaina you're only... 18? Haha hey
    that's pretty young man I miss those days. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also, that was quite an
    intro, her stumbling into a... country practically burnt to the ground in a
    mass of snow. In this new episode (#MajoTabi04) where if you are bad with
    people (communication wise) you'll be glad to know you don't have to
    interact with anyone in the place Elaina is going to because... there isn't
    anybody. RIP, everyone. And to get this out of the way, this week's special
    guest to the Elaina podcast series (lol I meant the Anime not the radio
    show) is Lynn-san, and man she sounds great in this one. Hard to see her in
    Anime these days, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lynn.06.01/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>
    if you want more of her haha. So, story. This is a story about everything
    going according to plan. We'll talk about why later, because as Elaina
    recalls of a certain story (I guess, to make this easier to understand), she
    reaches the city... burnt to the ground. Well, I guess we're done here, huh.
    Cya guys next episode- Okay she found someone. Elaina went to the castle
    which is surprisingly the only building standing, and found the princess of
    the nation. She... besides living a great life in the castle in case you
    haven't noticed, surrounded by a magic barrier as Elaina passed through it,
    saw a letter by her bed to remind her of where she is. Yeah, she somehow
    lost her memories of what happened. This letter, in summary, talks about the
    current situation where a dragon rules the city when in night, which is
    probably also what happened, and is instructed to kill it. Oh also, the
    princess here is also a witch. Then how does she not know- YEAH NO SHIT she
    lost her memory she also probably forgot how to magic. Man, this story is
    getting dumber the further you read down the letter lol. And I guess, that's
    why Elaina is here. "I'll be watching you from a safe distance" Haha hey no
    one said she's gonna help lmao hey dear author you wanna rewrite this
    script?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, not that her asking Elaina for help will be
    required anyways, because as you see her slowly regain her memories and
    devise a plan to defeat the beast, Elaina practically was just there to
    watch the show. Hey, just like us. We're here to watch her though lmao okay
    me. And as much as they have prepared for the battle the next night coming,
    Elaina still can't help but just stay away from the action lest this plan
    fails badly and she is killed by the dragon because considering how far this
    series goes it never ends well so <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, in the night of battle,
    everything went according to plan as Elaina watch the princess unleash her
    magic on the dragon as she leads it into a magic covered hole deep enough
    that it can't climb out of it, to say the least. Hey, all thanks to Elaina's
    magic I guess. Though I would argue the princess can do it herself but you
    know, she did treat her to breakfast and a good night's sleep. (Man, the
    irony when they sleep in peace while the dragon wrecks havoc in the
    background) (Still better than me sleeping with the park nearby being noisy
    as heck at midnight lol) And as the memories resurface back in her mind, the
    princess then recalls - as explained by Elaina later - how her love fell out
    when her father (coincidentally also king of this very nation) rejected her
    love for the cook in the castle (I mean, "dad, you know he can give me
    happiness if he can feed me for the rest of my life) (haha) which in the end
    I assume the father forgot she was a witch, cursed her father into a dragon
    that ruined the city (why though, she can just kill him normally), and
    placed a backup plan for herself such that she can recover after the curse
    by sacrificing her memories. This hardly will make any sense anyways, but
    considering her evil laugh and how she eats breakfast normally (without
    Elaina), it's that "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/minikui" target="_blank">minikui</a>" situation again, ladies and gentlemen. Story aside, I must say this is
    the best magic action we've seen this far, though I'll hardly call this a
    fight it's just a witch owning the heck out of a dragon lol. I want to see
    Elaina do magic though and not like, for digging up a hole haha. Cya guys
    next week for more depressing stories I guess. Alternatively, dear princess,
    you could've just faked a poisoning of your dad or something, or curse him
    to become a clown or something. At least your mom can take over the nation
    lol bye

    <div>
      Ah, so in case you didn't understand the introduction to this week's...
      that's right before she saw Nasa-kun... get railed by a truck haha. So in
      this new episode (#ToniKawa04) finally, we get to know of Tsukasa's story.
      And yeah, Tsukasa, you "may not have anything to show off at this rate".
      <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I think we learnt real well that it's about time Tsukasa had her
      own phone, huh. Oh well haha. Anyways, story first, because man, is this
      quite an episode. I'm sorry if you jumped out of this ship last week
      because are we kicking things off right now with an origin story... sort
      of haha. We're introduced to Tsukasa's past, specifically about her past
      living in a mansion with another girl Chitose and her.... great great
      grandmother if I didn't remember this wrongly (how old is she?) (well this
      is Japan so technically such people exist, of that age) and probably left
      the house because of... well, something. Yeah, so I gues that makes sense
      now for her to leave the family and ask the next guy who confesses to her
      to marry her so she can get out of that lifestyle... Hey isn't this the
      most Hayate story level ever?? Haha dear author I gotta give it to you
      here and kudos to the production for making sure the selling point is not
      the backstory lol. So, story. Last week, if you can recall, Nasa left the
      wife alone back home and her thinking in her own monologue is probably a
      bad idea (a certain someone said the same thing too, that younger sister),
      because besides being alone and thinking weird stuff (lol) she's also
      confronted by the new girl, who surprisingly is trying to get her back
      home. You know, where she initially belongs, I guess. And so, she told her
      to leave her alone, she's fine, and can live outside the house on her own.
      Oh also, she gotta tell her imouto that she's married. Heck, why is
      everyone so shocked about the marriage? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yeah, I know right? Like
      it's some crazy thing too. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We'll get back as to why later (it's
      dumb too because comedy), but yeah, as she cries down the steps on the
      apartment being rejected by the elder sister... And then she saw Nasa-kun.
      Okay, hey bro, maybe you CAN help her *sees marriage papers* I don't think
      you can. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yeah, besides ignoring the fact that they're kind of
      married now and they sort of have to live together (I would argue that
      Nasa-kun can go into the mansion but I guess not) (lol), and yeah, the
      legal process is indeed in order. I'm getting serious Alice to Zouroku
      flashbacks right now so we better be quick talking about the story lol.
      And then Nasa-kun got kidnapped. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, I guess Chitose is trying
      to knock some sense into Tsukasa, but not without using the most elaborate
      comedy approach ever to defile a marriage: journalism. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Man, can
      we not have so many jokes in one episode I was here for the wholesomeness
      not the... two... maids. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I'll leave the jokes in the episode for
      most of it, but suffice it to say, that eventually they did escape. You
      know, because the door was unlocked and Tsukasa can just waltz through the
      front door- Probably not the case but still. Anyways, even if the tabloid
      was made, the wife won't get angry anyway because besides realising what a
      smart and awesome guy she got married to (hey, I agree) (haha) and can fix
      her... moonstone problems lol (I'm not talking about her period, please)
      (lol), and come on, they are outside of home so it'll be wise to escape
      when they can, and so they did. Lol how dumb can these people get. Hey,
      turns out, Nasa-kun might be the smartest guy in this series haha. And
      escaping through a secret passage because all mansions have one at least
      (two if it's built during wartime lol), they surfaced in a church. Hey,
      how about her for the wedding, Nasa-kun? She likes it too and...that's how
      you save on the wedding!!!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Sorry but I gotta haha. Yeah, kiss
      scene, everyone. This wholesomeness made up for the nonsense we got for 20
      minutes. We're done. Thanks for watching I didn't know this was the last
      episode I thought it was Episode 1 okay I'm done I'll leave more of the
      jokes on the thumbnails lol

    This week we did get through a lot of stuff, so I suppose I should talk about it here. Besides continuing on giving Pyxis' 1st album released back in 2016, I did focus on giving... newer... songs so for <b>ClariS 10th anniversary albums</b> though I did listen to it casually at work I also did not feel like giving any of the two new songs even though they just recently showed their faces. (You don't know? It's literally them 2nd on Trending on Tuesday during their online live) (Japan trending, yes) So yeah, pretty easily justified not giving the other oldies already for those who haven't got in, so I'll leave them as that. (Seriously, stop reminding me of Alice haha) So, for this week's new new songs (lol), <b>Ueda Reina's new single</b> unexpectedly will be on my shelf some time soon following ORESAMA's entry into Klassic Note Review (Why? I mean, you should've read my Tweets), <b>a flood of circle's new album</b> which I wished they didn't slap this year as the album title (just like Porno Graffitti's song back then, aptly titled "2012Spark" lol) was fine, but yeah their style like GLIM SPANKY is those standard types which will get me bored easily, but even giving by melody barely any can stay besides those which had a video on YouTube which is just those two, and finally, don't ask me why I gave <b>THE BAWDIES' single from 2009</b> just because I watched what now is Japan's rock festival but only aired on TV (*ahem*), and I could use some '60s Rock, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well, at least the song title will make of a good joke haha<br />
    <br />On news this week on Twitter and hopefully related to music and sometimes Anime, you should have seen <b>ClariS face reveal</b> on their recent 10th anniversary online livestream even though it's just like two photos but man is Clara-san totally my type (lol reminds me of ChouCho which I also like tbh), congrats on <b>Anime "Kaguya-sama"</b> getting an OVA and a new season their 3rd season coming, Ajikan's vocalist <b>Gotch's new music video</b> is... I mean, I rather listen to THE ORAL CIGARETTES lol the setting is also a church somehow, and <b>Minase Inori is releasing a new single</b> due December to commemorate her 5th year singing songs I don't think I've mentioned this because you can also her her new song preview (quite a long one) on her radio show which is also uploaded to YouTube. The song though.. makes me miss "Wonder Caravan!" haha no seriously that song is great (for this one apparently is composed by the one in&nbsp; her previous single topic song)<br />
    <br />
    So for next week, we have a couple more releases to end the month of October, including <b>Kitou Akari's 3rd single</b> which I think I made my point so let's see if that'll even change by Wednesday, and <b>ChouCho's new single</b> which is a Klassic Note listen in what, 6 years? Yeah, for Anime "MajoTabi" ending theme, of course. Or else why would I listen to the subpar melodies- Hey, it depends on the composer, okay? She's writing the lyrics though so maybe that'll change something? I mean, the beats are weird I don't study music that much so I don't know what's with the 3/2 beats in this tbh<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Wow I woke up this morning actually wanting to just watch Sangatsu no Phantasia's recent online live performance so bad, I went to check if I could buy the tickets to watch again and then remembered... yesterday's re-watch with Mia-san tweeting was the last day.&nbsp; Oh well, some other time then, Mia-san. You looked real cool with the shadowed photos though, not gonna lie here. Cya guys next week then, and until next time I would say I'm keeping this short so we'll talk about if we would have a chance to ship THREE singles to the next package that'll hopefully reach me next month lol. We'll see about that I have to go back to work now bye</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. That "MajoTabi" Halloween event is tops but thanks to work I missed 20 minutes of... the least important parts haha I'm just there to hear Ede-chan and Kana-chan scream when running the blender for making their own smoothies lol the comments already know it's not well blended because of chunks when poured out</div><div><br /></div><div>P.P.S. The above and Anzai Chika's... "chill stream" playing and freaking out of a sheep raising game I'm sure you have seen before is fuel for my screwed up work schedule this night I thank you all for making this suck less</div><div>
