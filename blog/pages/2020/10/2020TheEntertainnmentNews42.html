Hm? There's a bath episode on "Tonikaku Kawaii" this week? Meh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We're
back on normal Anime schedule now lol
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Hey, when there's a Satou Satomi in an Anime, YOU KNOW it's gonna be good haha
  talking about that "Kino no Tabi" ripoff lol and for getting back into the
  habit, I chose to watch Anime on time on Sunday mornings... again. Yes, I'm
  getting lazy as you may have noticed over the past few... months? Yeah, work
  is making me tired I must add. But the things I want to do that is not work is
  fuelling me to continue, including, if you have seen this in a mobile theme
  good chances you have seen a new sidebar button on the bottom left corner.
  See? I want to spend more time doing more meaningless things like this than
  earn money. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Let's do more meaningless things like watch animation and listen to music
  then!! And if anyone has suggestions of a calendar for next year besides AV
  actresses and SCANDAL because I saw that on Twitter already (such a lame one
  though, it's just 1x poster with a live tour location backdrop) that would be
  most helpful.<br />

    Wow, a monologue from Makoto already? We're not even close to done with the
    series, but I guess the Anime did want to recap what happened so far before
    we move on to the, yes ladies and gentlemen, final arc of the series. And
    yes, in this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER15) we touch on Laurent's past.
    Okay, without much to talk about that though, let's quickly pass through it.
    We got a scene, of Laurent carrying a woman (of course), up to see the...
    I'm not sure it's northern or southern, so Aurora Borealis (yes I googled
    that lol), so probably at the poles, these two. That's all. I doubt the
    woman is any of the new guys we know of this episode, but hey, let's talk
    about the... setups of setups in this upcoming heist. Firstly, Makoto is
    leaving. Hey, we have heard a lot of that already, but in his earnest talk
    with Laurent, he just doesn't want to die being a conman I guess, as he sees
    his family grave and talks about his past with these goons. So yeah, once
    again, he's into job hunting. I would argue though, that all these has made
    Makoto a little smarter. Just a little. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And in his job search, he
    got into a trading company who deals internationally. Ignoring his criminal
    records, you gotta suppose something is wrong behind the scenes alrady, so
    we shall also ignore that first and talk about how Makoto figured it out
    this time. Unlike the last time where he got tricked into working as an
    apprentice plane mechanic, this one... he's just a trader. Learning from the
    bottom, getting recognised by the chairman (chairwoman, I suppose), real
    quick, and trading in all kinds of goods, from clothing to statues to art
    to... kids. Okay, that last one sounded real bad already and I think Makoto
    already has some deja vu when he saw that manager's face (I mean, me too),
    so we already know something's fishy. This time though, I would say that the
    job found him, because with a criminal record, and the manager saying that
    "he's done it before", it's probably his resume that already attracts him to
    this kind of... shady job scope. So yeah, no comment. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And as he
    sees the kids from Vietnam get paraded in front of rich dudes who would buy
    them in millions of dollars (Jesus), he knows it's either (1) this is real
    corrupt and we can do a heist to make sure the Japanese underworld never
    comes back again which is impossible considering the Yakuza series lol, or
    (2) Laurent is behind this. Period. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, as the blonde dude explains
    to him, those guys deal with illegal trafficking. "Trading", we call it.
    Obviously in real life this is hardly possible, but hey, not saying it isn't
    a possibility lol okay it's not. Don't corrupt your pure mind from this
    series it's real bad now haha. And as we end the story for probably Makoto's
    return into the heist... I was expecting like, he would come in at some
    point instead though, like, to tell Laurent off so he can continue with the
    scam, but I guess not. Meanwhile, while we worry about Makoto's fate doing
    an "honest" job, we see another familiar character Laurent and Abbie are
    meeting. I forgot his name already lol oh yes Clarke. Sam's the other gay
    dude who got scammed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I legit thought we'll need to bring in a
    wheelchair lmao yes Clarke made that joke too) And since we don't really get
    what Laurent is on about, let's see in future episode what is there to
    unfold. Man, I hope this arc ends real good so I have a great overall
    impression of this series. And so far? Hey, it's real good what can I say</div>

  O~kay must they start every episode with a Ede-chan dialogue praising about
  herself?? I'll take it, whatever. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#MajoTabi03)
  we have TWO stories? What? Haha I guess this is anything goes then, so yeah, I
  can take more stories to convince me that this will be a good series. And
  after these two stories, yeah sure why not. So firstly, about the land of
  flowers. Elaina passed by a beautiful field of flowers, all grown naturally
  without any care, it looks so nice too, and she saw a girl who asked her to
  bring a bouquet of them to show the people in the nearby city. And so she did,
  of course, without realising what is upon her. Soon, we then know about the
  origins of the flowers, and specifically, with the shawl that came with it.
  The guards at the checkpoint stopped Elaina from bringing the flowers into the
  city square because... they were poisonous. Magic level poisonous, which is
  also why nothing happened to this beautiful, beautiful witch. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And
  so, it was burnt to a crisp, that bouquet. I mean, you can just take a photo
  of it. Wait, what year is this? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the wrapping also indicated
  to one of the guards that his sister might be missing outside of town, and so,
  after a day in the city and as she flew back into the field of flowers... The
  guard did find his missing sister though, I'll tell you that. What I would not
  tell you is... that the other guard was right about the flowers having a
  hypnotic effect on normal humans, turning them into hallucinating agents.
  So... "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/minikui" target="_blank">Minikui</a>", as the Japanese call it. "Ugh." <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah that's easier to understand,
  isn't it? Haha okay moving on. (I guess the guards will have to clear hoards
  of them every night too huh, by killing them) (What, how else you gonna stop
  those... those flower zombies) Next up, I wish I could bottle happiness for
  someone I like. Haha of course that sounds like bullsh*t but hey, this is a
  magic world so anything is possible, literally. Elaina was in another area
  close to a village where she saw this guy with a bottle of happiness. I guess
  he can use magic too but not as good as this genius right here? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  (Hey, Elaina did say to praise her more so you're welcome, girl) The guy
  intends to show her this bottle to the girl in his house... servant,
  Nino-chan, to kind of, cure her of her depression, I guess. Does that work
  though? We have little to believe it has, given the context of this Anime
  already but. Upon reaching the village chief's place, the guy... Emil, is it?
  Yeah. He decides to put his plan into action, but this plot kind of reminds
  the house guest of a certain story she read when she was a kid, about a
  magician also showing his bedridden wife what happiness looked like outside of
  her room. And as Emil picked up his guts just like how Elaina picked up the
  mess Nino-chan did and got scolded by the village chief(calm down, bro) (lol),
  he showed the innocent girl of happiness, and... I swear that like Nino-chan
  here, if I saw that bottle of happiness I'll also be sad- Oh that wasn't it?
  Hey, and you thought that dude figured it all out. Remember: he was the one in
  happiness. Well, sort of. At least he's happier than the girl. So yeah, turns
  out I might be right. If you need some explanation, is that the reality is
  upon&nbsp; them to not be in such happiness, and showing them it will only
  make things worse. I mean, it's like sh*tting on them of sorts. Ridicule, as
  people will call it. You don't want to know what happened to Nino-chan here
  considering she might be tortured to some extent by the village chief without
  the kid knowing anyways (ugh) (haha), but the wife in the story... she took
  her own life. So yeah, might be better to not show happiness to people who do
  not have the ability to obtain them considering their circumstances. Unlike
  them though, I probably should. Or maybe I also have a limitation here.
  Probably my image? Haha hey I'm not as charming and attractive as Elaina- Okay
  I need to save some compliments for next week lol. All in all, very real,
  adult stories to tell I suppose for the rest of the series, and I think I can
  watch this once in a while. But as they say here, show people of adult stories
  when they're living in it is like showing people of happiness when they can't
  get them. I promise you guys though, I won't take my own life I'm too timid to
  do so haha BUT if there IS magic that can make me die painlessly and
  peacefully I might as well learn magic lmao just joking Elaina is too cute to
  die without finishing this series haha cya guys next week</div><div>

  </blockquote>
  "(She's) wearing an apron!" Okay dude stop getting a boner on everything about
  your wife, please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also Tsukasa stop being so smug about your cooking
  you're freaking me out lol I guess you guys are real compatible in this aspect
  lmao. In this new episode of happiness (#ToniKawa03) Tsukasa I think just
  realised what she signed up for. Turns out, she got married to a mad scientist
  who has zero EQ lmao what could be worse. An otaku? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Besides this
  being another inefficient episode which should already be from Episode 1 since Tsukasa got into his life, hey
  new characters everyone. I know right, we WISH it's just the two of them lol.
  Sadly, this is not "Takagi-chan" so we're getting none of that middle school
  romance between only two people. So for new characters we got uh, a sicko and a
  pathetic woman...? Good enough. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Before that, let's talk about
  cooking. And the not scientific part of it because Nasa-kun is BORING!!
  Although I would argue that having hotpot everyday will be good for my overall
  health considering my condition now (I am asked by my doctor to avoid fried
  and spicy stuff... forever haha <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>), but yeah, that's not cooking, bro. So,
  Tsuksasa dons an apron, and shows her cooking skills to the husband that she's
  so good he can't even. (Well he did eat cr*p for months on end so...) And
  then, we go to the bathhouse. Sorry for the wait, everyone, but yes, even
  Nasa-kun wants this bath episode so badly lmao. I like how Nasa-kun thought of
  seeing girls in a bathhouse naked specifically her wife but you can just get a
  bathroom at your place and it would have been the same so... time to move to a bigger place I
  guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, they walk 400 metres to the place (lol okay), and we
  chance upon the first new girl Kaname. Kaname-chan here... likes the guy?
  Yeah, there's that 30-year-old-single confession she's waiting to drop on him
  lol (hey btw where's mine?) (haha), and... she will only remind&nbsp; you of
  "Seitokai Yakuindomo". Okay, maybe "Nagasarete Airantou". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ecchi this
  technically isn't, but you can't stop this girl from telling perv jokes, that's
  for sure. For that, I'm alrady staying to watch haha. But seriously girl,
  please stop describing Nasa-kun's dick I'm pretty sure we know how small it is
  already lmao. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I think we better move on. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, on Tsukasa's
  side, as she thought she was alone in the morning bath, turns out someone
  slept in the bath nearby, and it's Aya-chan. Aya-chan here... is basically me?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, way more polite than me I would argue, but the monologues and
  literally screwing people up even though you might as well not say it...
  that's close enough to my description lmao. Okay, jokes aside, and even
  Tsukasa can't take a break in front of this woman. Pretty calm for an Anime
  character though, Tsukasa. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, we also found out about the
  history of this bathhouse, and how I guess Nasa-kun can take free baths... as
  long as he doesn't tell Aya about his marriage? Haha we don't know about that
  yet because we kind of got away with it maybe. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> And as Aya explains her
  family's past... yes, ladies and gentlemen, typical "Hayate no Gotoku" level
  storytelling, in case you wonder. Extremity is the author's strong point, by
  the way. And yes, because Nasa-kun is better than me in economics lmao well
  mainly finances, he flipped the place around and got them out of the brink.
  That screwed up of a father better not come back, I tell you. So besides the
  thankfulness we see in the girls to him (maybe to the extent of marriage,
  which, uh, sorry to tell you Aya-san but) (haha), and as we reached the end of
  this episode... Tsukasa is saying Aya is cute. I think she might be jealous.

  somehow... well, at least we now know Nasa-kun will be working towards a
  proper wedding already I guess, as inefficient this abrupt decision might be
  now. Tsukasa only wants to be praised though but really haven't we done that
  for like 2 episodes so far? I mean, she IS cute, whoever she is. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So
  next episode... okay now THIS is really like Hayate already why the rich girl
  and her maids lmao does she have a butler who looks like Nasa-kun by any
  chance? Haha cya guys next week because good chances we're dealing with a rich man's girl again

  <div>
    Wow have I listened to too many songs this week already? Hey, again, that's
    the whole point of Klassic Note- Remember how you listened to songs like,
    every day, me? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, we should get back into the habit now that my
    enthusiasm for YouTube has dampened recently. (Don't ask too much, you don't
    want to know what happened) So, for new songs, let's talk about
    <b>ORESAMA's new single</b>. It's going to be a Klassic Note Review soon.
    Yes, I bought the CD already, which also means I gave the B-side. Well,
    because it ain't bad (not that it's awesome but) and I want to give them
    another chance, after not giving them songs for this long... well. Again,
    their style is easy to get stale with, a bit like GLIM SPANKY, so I take
    breaks between them so I can get back into them again. That's how it works
    for now, I guess. And if you are around long enough maybe we'll give that
    Artist Collection honours lol. Also, I talked about it last week, I'm giving
    <b>Spira Spica's new album</b> a chance, which released like, half a year
    ago. It's... well I'm just here for the topic song so yeah, that and another
    one from their past singles. Yeah, the new songs aren't actually great so I
    just gave up in giving them. Hey, I chose between ORESAMA and this so...
    haha. I think I said this before, but this band has potential, and it really
    depends on their melodies. That's all I ask. I remember digging through
    their archives when I heard them sing for Anime "Ao-chan" like last year?
    Yeah, didn't leave with many new songs to listen though. Just one, I think.
    I also gave the digital singles of&nbsp;<b>Anime "ToniKawa" theme songs</b>,
    so there's that... don't ask how I gave the opening lol. But seriously
    though, the opening animation did give a bad first impression that beats
    part is only half the song the other half is actually nice. Over the weekend
    I also listened to another live from <b>SPECIAL OTHERS ACOUSTIC</b> back in
    2015 when they branched out of their main band so I might as well give it
    already lol, and maybe I'll catch on Pyxis when I have the time. I'm not a
    fan of radio podcasts of voice actresses but now I'm in for video form
    somehow so... that's my life on YouTube now lol
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  On news concerning Twitter and music specifically unless I deem irrelevant and
  still want to slap it on here (haha because I do it anyways), small pog for
  <b>Anime "RikeKoi" getting a season two</b> announced at their live event on
  Saturday, we'll get to KANA-BOON's new song at some point I promise,
  <b>Polkadot Stingray announced a new full album</b> due December on vocalist
  Shizuku's birthday (hey many people have birthdays this week don't ask me
  why), I know it doesn't concern music but
  <b>TrySail's doing a YouTube live on Halloween</b> (yeah with cosplay?) (hey,
  next weekend's MajoTabi livestream has witch cosplay though <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>), and so
  many online lives I don't even want to mention. Because really, I rather
  physical lives because I don't get to see them. Not that I'm tempted to click
  on them, but it makes me or even fans sad that they can only watch like, a
  studio live, or a empty audience live, at this point. It's just sad. I can be
  sad, but I don't want the industry to be this sad, so Japan, revert back to
  those industry-healthy times, yes?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So for next week, man I already have to review another two dozen songs at
  least liao with <b>ClariS' 10th anniversary albums</b> (emphasis on the
  plural) because we've reached another point in time where I have to reminisce
  about Alice and b*tch about Karen taking her place again lol. Okay, seriously
  though, all sung by the new duo, so we're really removing traces of that girl
  at all costs now. I'll also be listening to <b>Ueda Reina's new single</b> for
  Anime "MajoTabi" opening theme too when it comes out... I'm probably more keen
  on Choucho's the following week but we shall see if this voice actress singer
  can hold on her reputation in Klassic Note for her first time coming. And yes,
  <b>Pyxis' 1st album</b> since it has the theme from their weekly livestream
  and I might as well give them a listen too while I'm at it. Good chances, they
  sound too cute for me to give them more so I'm not holding my breath haha<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  That shall be all, folks. I didn't take any naps this weekend and next week's
  going to suck so I better get some more sleep while I can. Getting harder to
  sleep nowadays already, I wonder why. Passion projects that'll need more time
  to do and I know I don't have them? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Working life sucks haha now then I
  realised that? Haha cya guys next week then. The new package won't be coming
  that soon so I won't bet on that appearing by next week. Until next time...
  since I can understand some Japanese TV shows especially those who dump the
  words on screen (which is most of them lol), I'll catch up on some
  Anige-Eleven! (now hosted by Waki Azumi because they got rid of Lynn-san)
  episodes then the latest is about Ten-chan, people. Go find out if she's as
  lazy as you think she is, keeping her drinking life in check but leaving her
  room in a mess lmao I thought about this sentence lol bye<br />
  
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. I already know Ten-chan is like this already, teasing people and somewhat
  a sadist (lol), but the lazy part... I mean, I'll do the housework if we live
  together hehe (probably because I can't stand the mess anyway lol and I'm
  already considered lazy already FYI)
