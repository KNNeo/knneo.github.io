  Yes, the package for last month is finally here. But I'm not going to touch on
  that first. For I have work tomorrow and I want to "sleep early", I'll do
  up everything else by then, but meanwhile... we can do another Klassic Note
  Review.&nbsp; A month in the making, and probably a lot more before that for
  her because you'll notice the release numbering... Mmmmm Nan-chan!!! Haha okay calm
  down me
</div>
<div>
  <br />So yeah, this time around, we're back to my beloved imouto yet again.
  Sorry for missing your 3rd single, dear girl, but maybe when you release your
  2nd album we'll get back to that again BUT FOR NOW!!! Haha okay I know I love
  her we're good here lol. Let's get to it then! Even I wonder why this single
  would be here after what happened around the world this year...
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And yes, I know the official title was "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/anchite-ze" target="_blank">Antithese</a>" so give me a break already I don't want to do spell checks all over this
  post haha

  (Don't ask me why let her hold the traffic post which is real heavy according to her, but
  I'll take the slight closer-up, thank you)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: This, is a single of sorts. This is a single from her own music label
  and talent company MusicRay'n moving into the new age, in my opinion. It was
  April 2020, a time of confusion and instability, and that's where Natsukawa
  Shiina - voice actress and member of unit group TrySail - started her own
  YouTube channel. And first in her group. In the whole company, even. I suppose
  it was probably then where she covered songs she liked from rap to modern pop
  rock tunes that led to this single, I might say. Fast forward a couple of
  months later, she introduced her new single to us, bringing up much hype to
  every aspect of it, from the songs, to the music video, behind-the-scenes
  footage and so on... all produced/edited by yours truly, this is truly an age to live
  in. I hope that she really enjoyed making this single as much as I listened to
  it, because I tell you, this is some kind of a release.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Antithesis</div>
<div>From the first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Always</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Until (my) emotion limit can be released, I'm still holding the grudge to be
    alone
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Above this kind of life and still eating away, (I'm) still strongly,
    strongly struggling"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  If this is not the definition of modern day pop rock, I can't find another
  description. Listening to this within seconds it'll hook you in, as with the
  intention of the indie composer and producer Surii would intend to do, and
  even later presented in a lyric video about how rebellious this song might
  sound, and it's totally on point. The song and music video show the strong and
  cool type image of Nan-chan we might otherwise not see (all but more, of
  course), but this makes it even cooler, embodying itself into a song that dabs
  itself. With a catchy melody and lyrics to remember, this will make a point
  across, with hype and even fit with anger. So much power, you'll won't even
  question my criticism of parts of this song I would otherwise dislike, just
  because.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Crazily Above Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) RUNNY NOSE</div>
<div>From the first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "(I) want to stand out, (I) want to laugh (it out)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I) want to be in a form without keeping up image
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I) want to expose (myself) but it still hurts
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Peeling off (my) shell</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I still have to) Come up with a reckless excuse"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  And as if one hype song isn't enough, the B-side will make you never put down
  this release. Apart from the fact that the solo artist singer herself came up
  with the lyrics which are hard to read even if I have read Japanese for the
  past decade, the music itself will be enough for you to bop your head, let
  alone shake it like it's Saturday night. It's also this that brought in a
  great first impression when she revealed this on her YouTube channel, just
  days before release date. The whole song itself is even more impressive than I
  thought, though I did hesitate in giving the song mostly because it'll take
  some time to get used to, considering the genre and obvious extension of
  melody to keep up with the lyrics. As much as this is a weakness of having
  separate composer and lyricist, this won't stop you from cheering with the
  background vocals, and shaking your head up and down in the chorus. This truly
  is a wild song inside out.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Rocking High on Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: Everything done here might be an experiment. To suit Shiina's
  tastes, to test out modern day social media, to go into a genre the company
  itself hardly explores... all in the name of an emergency. I guess that's how
  we will have something good in our hands right now. If you are a fan of her,
  I'm not going to convince you to do otherwise, but if you have heard any of
  the songs on YouTube and thought this was cool? You're only hitting the tip of
  the iceberg, my friend. Nan-chan can do so much more, you'll think her
  cuteness is getting her way, and I love her efforts for that. This single will
  go down as something to remember, even for her as an solo artist.

  because since she's not that popular (oops) and I can take my time to order
  this at any time, I ended up choosing the one I liked most with that
  combination of close-up and you know, maybe a different expression of her.

  In case you didn't notice even from the disc because I covered it, it's also a
  first for MusicRay'n to release both instrumental tracks for their singles
  (normally it's one, unless it's double A-side), which is why I keep
  emphasising how much has been blessed on us for this particular release.And
  since Nan-chan is so generous to share pretty much everything of this single
  to the world, you can click in to see the images, including the one below.
  You're welcome. <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span>

  That shall be it then. Stay tuned for tomorrow where I will unravel the rest
  of the package I got like, 2 weeks after all of them have been shipped. Or to
  make this sound worse, planned back in August. Yeah, remember that month? It's
  gone now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, cya guys tomorrow earliest then, and with bromide
  photos to scan, you bet my weekday nights this week will be busy haha I really need to sleep
  early so bye
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. About what I mentioned about release number, MusicRay'n ones start with
  "SMCL", and for comparison (Regular Edition for reference) Asakura Momo's 2nd
  album released in April was "SMCL-655" and Amamiya Sora's 3rd album released
  in September a week before this single is "SMCL-675". This single was
  "SMCL-649". Now you should get the idea: it was intentionally delayed. Or the
  reverse, so that part of the music can be licensed on YouTube for her videos.
  Hmm... I'll leave you guys to think about it haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Considering how this was packaged and especially, consolidated so all
  of it can come in one piece, I'm highly suspecting how much the staff at
  tenso.com are enjoying looking at my package hehe more tomorrow I promise
