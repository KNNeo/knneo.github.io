Have you been looking at #YouTubeMusicWeekend? No, you don't need a YouTube
Music subscription like Google is pestering me to sign up for whenever I open
the app on my phone, but yeah, Japanese artists have been releasing live footage
on premier all weekend and I assume it's on archive so you can check those out.
Notable artists I know of include
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WDYWOkFm1Q" target="_blank">[Alexandros]</a>
(which I skipped lol),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZf0MthDFH4" target="_blank">GLIM SPANKY</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gTX8GRupB8" target="_blank">wacci</a>
(thanks for the first song totally loved that one), and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuOdqVH1pac" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari</a>
which is probably airing by the time I post this and they also have recent weeks
of live footage revealed too so... I'm only thankful in these times that I get to see more appear without me actively searching for them haha lol<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anime time, I guess. I chose the Sunday morning route now haha well I was
  watching my archive of Anime yesterday, and wrote a randomizer to run on my external hard drive haha. "ACCA" is still the best imo haha okay
  I want more "BLEACH" too but that's not in 2 years at least so I'm just hyped
  for the "Bungou Stray Dogs" next season whatever spinoff that is I just want
  more Elise-chan lol let's talk this season Anime instead. But seriously though "Demi-chan"
  is soooo good Ede-chan in that is my fuel I want an overactive vampire as my daughter lmao ok me<br />
  <br />Oh yeah, side note: Attack on Titan airs on Sunday late night and I
  gotta sleep for work on Mondays so... I've done this before but instead I'll
  <u>add it on to here after I watched it tomorrow</u>. You'll see the hashtag above once it's up. That's all. Anime
  time!<br />

  </blockquote>
  Wow I would have guessed, but man, Shi Ohn is OP support in this series, I'll give you
  that. She's like that support character you don't use in your character building deck until you have to trash someone. Oz is not even close haha okay Makoto don't hit me. In this new episode where Laurent
  "is paying an old friend a visit" which I doubt will go well but surprisingly it did (#GREATPRETENDER21) we are at the last stretch of this arc and this season.
  Yes, season two in the near future, if you need a reminder. So, as expected,
  thanks to Dorothy (RIP), we do have a contingency plan, even for death. Excuse
  me "expected death". I mean, if you recall the first arc where they were shot
  in a hail of bullets for the drug deal you would have known. Firstly, about
  what happened so far, let's do another update. We go back a bit to (1) before Cynthia, Abbie and Oz got sent to the ocean bed and (2) where Laurent explains
  the plan for this very arc and heist. Yes, for the latter, since we now know
  the backstory, we know the two ladies do not know of Dorothy and whatever
  genius so-called is Oz, and how Shi Ohn can dive? Well, she is Korean and
  good chances she's one of those divers looking for shells when she was young (do
  Google those documentaries if you've never seen them), so yeah, not really
  surprised because at that age... please someone let her retire haha. So yes,
  the plan for such a bailout that would only be put to use because we have to save
  all the kids thanks to Makoto (so yeah it's his fault technically), and thankfully because we know how the mafia works now, the three get to be saved. Thank
  goodness, because we still have another heist to pull. So secondly, the plan
  so far, as Oz continues to explain to his son who may or may not follow
  according to plan because you know, we know that Makoto isn't great at
  sticking to plans just like Abbie mentioned. But nonetheless, that whatever Skype meeting between the two factions went real well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, with both
  translators rigged what do you expect? A change of USA President? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And
  that's why translation is so important Liu; I get it now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah, the
  sweet smell of a scam, I can smell it even from where I'm watching this in
  another dimension lmao. Because Makoto is known of the plan, and Laurent is at
  Shanghai's side now (So how is he going to leave again? Can't be his father's
  about to die right? lol), so yeah, it's not translation anymore, ladies and
  gentlemen. So, instead of negotiations, it became a money tribute of reconciliation contributed
  from both sides...? So yeah, the "confidence men" here will pocket it, if that is not obvious enough. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They won't bring in fake money, and both sides did bring an intent to kill. So yes, Laurent's team is LITERALLY raking this up,
  money and lives and everything. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Can't wait till Suzaki's real son comes
  back and ruins this lmao. Or Liu's fortune teller telling him there's a
  traitor in his gang. Lastly, what might happen in the near future. They are
  going to meet up in Tokyo, supposedly Liu giving the money to Suzaki and vice
  versa? I don't know it doesn't make any sense now anyways haha. Well, I hope
  everyone got their bulletproof or stabproof vests ready because next week will be quite the ride
  haha don't ask if Makoto will forgive the father or not it's work vs family man it's
  always a man's dilemma if you have family haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Just a reminder that despite Makoto being emotional or the most
  emotional character in this series, he doesn't mind since he's a cheater himself he
  knows how it feels to be cheated besides he can't keep secrets lol]

  "You just have to deliver it and get paid" Hey, sounds like your local food
  deliveryman haha man tell this to someone 20 years ago and they thought you'll
  be referring to wedding buffets haha. In this new episode (#MajoTabi10) where
  freedom is an option lmao, tell me when Saya will open that box, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Serious foreshadowing I can't even. Okay she didn't thank goodness haha.
  Anyways, story, I guess. It's another flashback, about two mages who can't get
  along with each other. Little do we know, their teacher wrote a book in the
  future in which Elaina would read as a kid. Yes, if the ending isn't obvious
  enough. Seriously though it's like Elaina's ancestor or something with the
  hair colour. So, story. Story goes that Sheila and Fran were on vacation to
  the Town of Freedom, where in this case, they reminisce the days of... working
  together. So, long time ago, when Fran was an apprentice, her teacher decided
  to take on another apprentice, but you know, as with anybody else, this one
  wasn't feeling welcome. Besides Sheila making a bad impression on her fellow
  apprentice mate, they also don't like to agree with each other, almost all the
  time. We'll get to the exceptions later, but suffice it to say the teacher
  always has to meet in the middle so that they won't start killing each other
  lol how is bread in between beef and fish. To be honest, I think the easiest
  way to settle between them every time is... scissors paper stone. No joke.
  Really, a simple and quick showdown without magic. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You can track your
  scores too, I don't care. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But over time somehow, the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shishou" target="_blank">shishou</a> has
  thought of a way to teach them to work together, and by also taking a job that is
  slightly irritating but not enough to risk their lives on, in the country of
  Qunorts. There's an association here supposedly larger than the Magic
  Association stationed there, and they ask for external help because... these
  guys are troublesome. Not only are they tarnishing the reputation of magicians coming to
  the islands by putting up posters, and despite being not magicians they are
  technically using magic tools to threaten citizens and magicians alike. Hey,
  that's how you be bad guys lol what. So yeah, as you can see, it's a problem,
  but not such a big one that the shishou has to step in. So, she told her
  two disciplines to do it. In an effort to deal with the situation, and of
  course, in a way to make sure they have to cooperate in order to settle this
  case. Because if not, as stated by the teacher that they will be expelled if
  they failed, they would only continue to sabotage each other in order to get
  the other expelled even though we know, this is the opposite Prisoner's Dilemma
  where no one can get the other expelled and they can only work together, or else this will stay at
  status quo. It's that simple. Thankfully, they both thought of sort of getting
  caught by the bad guys so they can technically infiltrate their headquarters
  and deal with them then, and yeah, it was a lot easier when they can deal with
  the group together... with knives. Yeah, their training has come full circle. Lastly, as
  they sat down tired after dealing with a lot of dudes all at once (*hears
  sucking noise in the distance*) (haha) they talked about how they got into
  magic. Shiren was living by stealing peoples' money (GET A JOB lol) but
  eventually got caught by the shishou, and Foula just wanna brag that she's the
  only magician in the country. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> How is that similar lol one of them is a thief
  haha. Yes, I'm also referencing the names to the book Elaina read, so it's not
  wrong by any means they have to augment the names anyways, easier than putting
  the coincidence of names foreword. To conclude, I have no idea what that small box contains if it
  contains friendship I'm not investigating further haha cya guys next week

  "If it can be fried, it can be bought!" Wow how did you just describe my mom's
  cooking skills in one sentence haha. Also, that's how you'll end up hating
  those "air fryers", trust me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we continue
  to do embarrassing things instead of shitting on my family lol (#ToniKawa10)
  we talk about... the two of them apparently because Aya-chan probably already
  left overseas to study haha yeah also cut her hair. So, about the two of them.
  I guess we just continue the wholesomeness in the Yuzaki family despite being
  in someone else's roof which they promise they won't interfere (lol Kaname)
  but hey, you can send great tasting melons here Tsukasa doesn't have them haha
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways, story. Firstly, about relocation. Remember last week
  something happened and they had to live in the bathhouse? Yeah, that was like
  an ad-hoc arrangement so instead they moved to another place with furniture
  old enough they bring you back two eras in Japan haha welcome to the Reiwa era
  people. Despite that, Tsukasa can still whip up a meal to embarrass the whole
  of Showa Era (lol) and still make her husband a happy man. Good on you, bro; I
  hate you so much I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Talking about melons... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay
  we made that joke a while ago so refer to that, but Kaname gave them some
  fruits after their dinner haha so embarrassing things this episode Part.1:
  feeding the wife, literally. You can just watch that yourself I'm not going to
  describe it that whistle when Tsukasa is hesitating is the best haha I hope
  it's in the soundtrack lmao. Then, news about the new house. Yeah, Nasa-kun's
  landlord called. Remember? The one who's shophouse got burnt down due to
  lightning or whatever haha. Yeah, he said the place already under construction
  for a new apartment, so yeah soon they can move in without having people drop
  in to see them every 5 minutes. Excuse me, 2 minutes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still, the
  landlord probably sent him the wrong details, which they ended up in a
  high-rise building instead lol how did they even get permission to go in lol I
  guess this building is also new #FamilyGoals haha. Nonetheless, I guess the
  author (lol) wants us to feel what it's like for them to have a great life,
  but hey Nasa-kun? If all else fails we can always have a barrel over campfire
  as a bath lmao I'm not even trying to shit on "Sangatsu no Lion" right now.
  But yeah, considering the dude's so tech savvy he's basically an engineer
  without a degree (and I have one haha <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>), we won't even see that happen in
  the new place even if they don't have a bathtub he'll just transform the
  barrel into a tub. Talking about tech savvy, we talk about life in the
  bathhouse, in the perspective of Kaname-chan. She might be the ultimate
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a> role
  here, but hey, she be having a tough life because her sister is USELESS haha
  like seriously though. And Tsukasa feels bad living under someone else's roof
  so she <strike>asks if she can help out</strike> wants to help out so she
  don't feel so bad about it. Hey, nice guys be like this, people. I'm not one
  of them haha I'll never get laid. And despite the human effort needed to clean
  up the place, much of the process has already been automated or improvised
  thanks to Nasa-sensei because he's technically smarter than me lol (<span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>) so
  pretty much everything he has made to ensure the ladies can handle without
  much trouble. You see, this is what happens when the breadwinner of the house
  just left with another woman. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Lastly, the evening stroll. Yes, and as
  recommended by that mother, the two took the scenic route. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay,
  joke's over, we know they want to have some alone time together but seriously
  though is security too good in Japan or what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Shoutout to those
  areas of the world where your neighbourhood suffers from noise pollution,
  light pollution, lack of law enforcement or a combination of any of them) Okay
  seriously though when they hugged I can't even tsukkomi to that because I'm a
  loser and have no one to hug haha I'll see myself out lol. So yeah, you can
  feel that last part of the episode yourself you don't know how great it is to
  hug someone yes I've done it before and it's not with my family members hehe
  OKAY cya guys next week haha (Please, that was just a friendly hug)

Taketatsu Ayana, is that you? Hey the final "BLEACH" arc is not upon us yet,
girl; Don't rush in to voice the Sternritters, jeez. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I hope you figured
out who she voiced (or not), but even if not this new episode (#AttackOnTitan60) won't
make it any easier for you to pick up the pieces where we left off. Hey, that's
what the year on recap episodes were airing in Japan for anyways. Ah, "Armoured
Titan" kind of rings a bell, I wonder what's with the successor thing. So, story
or flashback I guess. Marley... I think if you can recall, are the dominant race
now, holding hostage of the Eldians, the Titan race. Obviously, when you have
this power, you're going to use it for advancing your territory, so as we can
see this very episode, that's what they were doing. Talk about inhumane, but
then again they aren't human at some point, so whatever. So, the Marleys were using the Eldians at war, but only for two main purposes. Firstly, as bait. As
that Commander prepares to send them to destroy that one anti-Titan train filled
with ammo to ruin their plan, Gabi steps up to show her potential and not finish
800 of her own people. Because secondly, they are also potential to inherit the
Titan powers. Since the Marleys know as much as the Eldians do, they know how to
transfer the powers to other of the same race, to keep the war superpower(s)
going, similar to what happened to the Founding Titan. This is then overall demonstrated by the successful takeover of an enemy
fort, but in the... most, most <a href="https://jisho.org/search/minikui" target="_blank">minikui</a> way possible (nope this is not "MajoTabi"
lol): parachute drop. You might wonder, what's bad with an airdrop. Yeah, it
isn't bad until you see the sky above your fort filled with tied up Eldians.
<span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Yeah, and with a scream of the... what's that summoning Titan thing?
Yeah, they all transformed into titans. So yeah, more like bomb drops, but it's
Titans. Purpose is likely to send them to destroy all the canons because those
are also anti-Titan (that can pierce through the Armoured Titan's armour, mind
you) but those little ones didn't do much, so it's up to the two special ones to
take the place down. And after that's dealt with with the two covering each
others' backs, that intelligent Titan which I also forgot its name Zach or
something? Haha okay I hate to remember names so whatever. That one came down to
take down the fleet of ships by the sea, which despite drowning into the seabed,
did strike the fort good all at once with what I would assume, also anti-Titan
cannons- Man, this war is something. The narrator was spot-on: It is living in a
world now where titans weren't supreme anymore. You know, technology driven by war will lead to such advancement haha. Guess we're not going to see our
favourite guys anytime soon for now, because we have a worldview situation to
catch up on. And to end this, in case you wonder the timeline, this is present
day. Because Reiner is the Armoured Titan. Yep, that was him almost killed by cannons. Phew, that was
close, wasn't it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh yeah, that wasn't Ayachi by the way, it was Sakura
Ayane haha didn't know you two sound similar lol
<div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; I'm just watching this series till the end for the cool Titans that's all
    not the puny ones which are smaller than my d*ck hahahahaha]</div>

      P.S. Considering how the final season of this wonderful Anime series
    should be concluded, I'm actually relieved that they chose Shinsei
    Kamatte-chan to do the opening (they did an ending theme before, and boy)
    because if you need a reason to describe weirdness, this band has a lot of
    it, trust me. And I've heard a lot in the past decade. I'll give <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E8%A1%9D%E6%92%83-single/1542009224?l=en" target="_blank">the ending theme</a> this season instead which is also kinda weird too haha yeah WOOO NO LINKED HORIZON!!! Lmao okay me&nbsp;</div></div><div>P.P.S. Just so I can flex my Japanese music knowledge, ending theme is by Andou Yuuko, who also wrote for amongst many idols I know, Toyosaki Aki. She wrote "CHEEKY" which is also the song I regretted giving the most haha<br /><div><br />

      </blockquote>
      Well as mentioned last week we'll only be talking about one release every
      week in December until the song awards and I have to decide the fates of
      many songs, first week we have
      <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/starlight-museum-single/1543317169?l=en" target="_blank"><b>Minase Inori's new single</b></a>
      for her 5th anniversary as solo music artist. I don't care about the
      special live from yesterday but that doesn't mean her new single is good.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, even the topic song is well dragged on so that's not
      going to leave a good impression considering the same composer did such a
      wonderful job on her previous single topic song which I reviewed this year
      so... what's with the difference in quality is the question. Oh well,
      might also be me anyways, so hear my rants on Twitter, I guess.<br />
      <br />On the onslaught of news we got on Twitter regarding music which
      might be too much for the new popup elements but let's see how much we can
      fit into a paragraph: Read the first paragraph of this post again if you
      need help finding out what happened in Japan on YouTube this weekend,
      <a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1335191823791222785?s=20" target="_blank"><b>congrats SHE'S on 10 years</b></a>
      even though you're only about 3 years in Klassic Note but I see potential
      in me hitting 10 years too at some point,
      <a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1335183277661933568?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song</b></a>
      is for that female Inuyasha Anime which Mikakoshi voices the main girl but
      not like I'm watching it lol,
      <a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1335147046949437446?s=20" target="_blank"><b>ClariS released a live video</b></a>
      from their recent online live and I dare you to release the one with the
      full face reveal haha,
      <b>Minase Inori released
        <a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1335056801495207944?s=20" target="_blank">two</a>

      (but I liked them both so it counts haha),
      <a href="https://twitter.com/HZshizuku/status/1325423641534763010?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Polkadot Stingray's new music video</b></a>
      is... very them I suppose (*let's hope they have better songs in the
      album* Haha),
      <a href="https://twitter.com/VP_official/status/1334798648098504707?s=20" target="_blank"><b>VELTPUNCH released a new live video</b></a>
      footage which is underrated as usual but man am I glad for the upload, the
      <b>Anison Awards in Japan</b> gave awards to
      <a href="https://twitter.com/AnisongtaishoAJ/status/1334850095695581184?s=20" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora</a>
      and
      <a href="https://twitter.com/AnisongtaishoAJ/status/1334852314155257856?s=20" target="_blank">Yunomi</a>
      for theme songs that impressed (okay now I have to give them Top 20? lol),
      and last but not least I'll not quote all the artists who retweeted so
      here's a summary of
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SpotifyJP/status/1334679062523023362?s=20" target="_blank">Spotify's 2020 Wrapped in Japan</a>
        based on overseas listeners</b>. If you can't understand it, notable results with respect to Klassic Note include (1) Aimer and Ikimonogakari are most listened artists in 7th and 8th
      spot respectively and (2) Anime theme song dominate the most listened
      songs mostly Naruto series apparently. Again, those people have no tastes, only listen to LiSA and don't pay for Apple Music Japan so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <br />
      So next week, and finally we're getting to it, I'll be tuning into
      <b>yanaginagi's new album</b> in quite a while to be honest, so we shall
      see how much I can give her this time around. The previous album... didn't
      do too well haha likely the same too as I heard the preview video so... we
      shall see.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      In other things not concerning anything I've mentioned before... <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I
      bought more bromides. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I did say we're done since the last
      time, but I saw so many Kido Ibuki-chan ones I can't say no- Nan-chan it's
      all your fault for being cute. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If that arrives next year then
      <em>technically </em>I'll not have lost my own promises- The problem is when
      her new photobook releases in a couple of weeks and then they start
      selling out their bromides again and then I will HAVE to get it again okay
      please stop. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, I should be done for the year in spending.
      Oh yeah, I still have to consolidate this month's orders- I really should
      stop. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week then<br />
