And boy aren't you glad we're done with 2020? Hey, I got through this year
pretty well I didn't get laid off and I still got money to buy so much cr*p haha
just a reminder to browse through that post I did for Christmas which summarises
the list of stuff I bought this year through the Internet of Japan for this year
alone. I mean, we shouldn't talk too much about what we did another year ago but
still.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So, how's your Christmas doing? Going from my phone wallpapers since Christmas
  Eve, pretty good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, it probably sucks to not visit relatives or
  gather at this time, and it's probably going to suck too once the new year
  arrives anyways, but let's hope for the best, yeah? I did promise to not talk
  about this stuff in this blog but I guess we can do it just once. Zoom calls,
  by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  So, as usual, I'll talk about what I deem interesting, what is worth watching
  and what is not. Hopefully I don't have to shit on everything haha
  <div>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        Yes, as mentioned previous season, since this started at a bad timing
        literally start of December 2020, I'll still be watching
        <b>Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</b> [Premiers 6 Dec 2020] till
        its end. Here's hoping I can remember everything along the way.
      </li>
      <li>
        Getting this out of the way, been seeing too many sequels this season
        and yeah you can include the above if you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've seen Oozora Naomi promote the heck out of this Anime she is minor
        character in but,&nbsp;<b>Tenchi Souzou Design-bu</b> sounds like the
        Anime that might be work but it's all just slice-of-life. And after I've
        seen the trailer (wtf Naomi-chan you shouldn't be saying "poop" out loud
        lol) I'm still not convinced to watch this series to be honest. It's
        like at work for me where user suggests something but won't come up
        functional design for it so these guys have to lmao
      </li>
      <li>
        It really feels like&nbsp;<b>Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun</b> might just be a
        romcom in a nutshell, but considering how heavily it's focused on this
        dude's background which is basically me with no life but likes to game
        all day because I'm not lol, and I would say the trailer didn't make it
        better a desire to watch over that one Anime I've given years ago
        "GAMERS!" so...
      </li>
      <li>
        WIXOSS is back??? No I don't care haha (When the first season of Anime
        started I used it as reference for my own card game story, but
        <b>WIXOSS DIVA(A)LIVE</b> now...)
      </li>
      <li>
        Ah, I think I've seen <b>Horimiya</b> [Premiers 9 Jan 2021] before
        somewhere long before this adaptation, and man, did it leave some sort
        of impression I'm now recalling from the depths of my memory for some
        reason. (Must be looking at the opening visuals) So yeah, I'll probably
        give this a watch. I'll take another awkward love story again. Hey, been
        lovesick since I started watching Anime, what can I say? Also, stellar
        cast because it has been a while for Tomatsu Haruka to get starring role
        in a romance story again. Can't wait to fall in love with here again lol
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Kai Byoui Ramune</b> sounds like a real life psychiatrist, but this
        one is more obvious because unless you can grow chilli peppers as
        fingernails you've got another thing coming. Not something I would watch
        though, even after looking at the trailer I don't want to wrap my brain
        around weird stuff lol
      </li>
      <li>
        Can't find enough info to want to watch&nbsp;<b>Kemono Jihen</b> though;
        maybe if it really heats up then maybe I'll look into it the description
        from the website is also not great though it's like forcing me to watch
        a popular series
      </li>
      <li>
        Just because it stars 10 very new voice actresses of which I've already
        fallen in love with one (lol), and sphere and TrySail members as rival
        idol groups doesn't mean I'll watch&nbsp;<b>IDOLY PRIDE</b> anytime
        soon. Please, they even had a browser rhythm-based game recently, but
        don't ask how I know so much of it and REFUSE to watch it at all lol
        it's idol Anime man it's always a no for me
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm only watching&nbsp;<b>Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</b> [Premiers 12 Jan
        2021] because I just want back more of this series as possible, and I
        did read that this is different from the original series ie. a spin-off,
        so I'll just watch for the laughs and character voices because I miss
        them already lol
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Wonder Egg Priority</b> is an original Anime that sounds like a load
        of egg pooping (lol) until you understand what implications that has:
        "The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world." So
        yeah, I may have to destroy the world of Anime before having a kid with
        someone in the future haha okay probably not watching this anyway
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      In summary, that is maybe 3 shows if we count Attack on Titan haha man
      this list was hard to read. Also also, just because we are also taking
      breaks next week, I'll be watching author of BLEACH's spin-off story
      probably based more on Harry Potter series than his previous work which he
      finished around 5 years ago "BURN THE WITCH" next week. I thought of
      ending this year on it but hey, we probably can start next year worse so
      let's watch it then lol
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Update 2020.12.28: Honestly almost forgot about this until my sis was also
      looking at the above list (I told her about the site years ago too can't
      believe that is still her point of reference) and thought this was cool
      haha but at this point it might be hard to introduce her to this series of
      despair and bloodshed without looking at the cool cover art with the
      manoeuvre gear she's into mech girls though lol

      I'm like doubting for a good amount of time when I saw the first Tybur
      family scene and really though it was just kids making a lot of noise on
      the park downstairs of my place but I guess not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this not so
      funny new episode though (#AttackOnTitan63) well at least they got me with
      the "yesterday's enemy is today's enemy" speech lol. So, story, I guess.
      The main point for this episode, in case you have forgotten about the
      trailer last week, is to reveal a progression for this worldview, like you
      know, a declaration, to where this war will go with Paradiso and the rest
      of the world, led by the ruling family of the Marleyans: The Tybur family.
      We've got a lot mote to talk about here, so let's talk more. Firstly,
      About Tybur's visit to Marley's capital to deliver a speech. Wait, not
      speech. A theatre performance? A play, perhaps? Okay, sure. Willy, the
      head of the family who also brought this diplomatic talk together with
      many leaders of enemy nations, decide to put an end to all this fighting
      with a solution. A solution, he will only reveal to them on the night of
      the festival the following day of the banquet he held. He also did many
      things out of hand, like giving more power to the Marley military since
      his house is not much besides the one who holds the Warhammer Titan power
      which I have a sneaky feeling might not be Willy himself he's just a
      mediator, but hey, who knows? Remember how a bunch of kids inherited Titan
      powers? Could be any number of them lol. Then, Farco is surpassing Gabi,
      slowly but surely. Not that Gabi will understand the intentions of why
      because Farco's family is already honoured in citizenship as explained by
      that one "doctor" in the hospital but we'll get to that later, so maybe
      Gabi is also too thick in the head to understand this anyways, so I won't
      say too much haha just refer to last week's talk and you'll know. Next up,
      "Kruger" and Dr. Jeager? Yes, if any of the names ring a bell don't be too
      surprised because that's probably what you think it is. So, for the latter
      human first. He's a doctor until you saw his red band on his arm ie. he's
      Eldian, he tells Kruger about Farco's family and past, and encourages him
      to not help send letters out of the nation lest he got caught and his
      family will be in danger again for the stuff they did in the past. Well,
      Kruger is planning to leave anyways, so I think that advice is heeded
      already. Talking about the "doctor" and his family though, and yes since
      his family name is same as our dear main protagonist who hasn't appeared
      yet Eren, this is most likely the father. How he escaped to this land and
      then got caught in this mess himself probably is because he was involved
      in the war at some point, but we can just make guesses as he continues to
      recuperate in the hospital, I guess. Then, they have a great time for
      festivities. Hey, just because there's a pandemic in the real world
      doesn't mean they can't have a great time in theirs (lol sorry I promised
      not to make such jokes again), so yay those kids had a better time than
      Reiner's pockets did I'm sure lmao. And, before the start of the
      festival's play where you would remember will star Willy that Tybur head,
      Reiner got called by Farco to an underground room and yes I'm still glad
      someone isn't assassinated immediately, because he got brought in to see,
      you guessed it, "Kruger", excuse me. Eren. What? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, to piece
      everything we've seen this episode: Eren has been in a POW hospital for
      some time because remember this is present day so it might be likely AFTER
      the guys in Paradiso saw the rest of the world where they were at the end
      of season three (Part 1 to be exact), probably got caught but not like
      anyone knows he has Titan powers, which will beg more questions like where
      are the others, why is he alone here, and what will be his intention to do
      here now that he is able to
      <strike>send messages back to Paradiso from time to time</strike> recover
      discretely under Marleys' care and his likely plan for revenge. Does he
      even know of these guys? If so, this proposal for war might be more
      interesting to listen to than the play lol we shall see about that next
      week I guess

      I follow be tweeting about it and that's how you know I'm following all
      the cool people haha yeah<br />
      <br />
      Next week, I'll stop for a week of course, to deal with
      <b>Klassic Note Song Awards 2020</b>, the thing I've been doing the 13th
      time coming (yes man), and somehow still not gotten bored of it. With
      stuff I learnt from work I am learning to automate as much as I can so I
      can spend more time thinking about who or what to give than processing
      data, so we'll talk about those in due time. Other than that, we'll see
      how many reviews from this year I can cover next year I've missed, and see
      if Takigawa <strike>Alisa</strike> Arisa will provide me some Chinese song
      recommendations because apparently
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_AF0Bky8TE" target="_blank"
        >she did a YouTube video about it</a
      >. (Hey you don't have to understand it; You just have to see the titles
      and Google them)<br />

      Okay I'm done for now, and sorry for the rather late post. I noticed I
      want to wait for announcements to happen around this time first or else
      like Minase Inori's news will only appear next week which is fine I guess
      I just face regret every time I post this and then new stuff comes up and
      I can only talk about the hype next week. Speaking of, the package for the
      month might be in place, and rather soon after I decided to split the
      package because that one membership card be sitting at the warehouse for
      three weeks lol but likely that'll come before the year ends maybe, and
      the rest by next month. We shall see. We can start a year with more stuff
      to review haha I wonder whether I should get myself a photobook every year
      on my birthday just to celebrate. Yes, Waki Azumi and your new photobook
      releasing on Valentine's Day, I'm fascinated by

      haha I'm such a terrible human I can't even. Cya guys next week then, and
      until next time... just remember to come back for the Song Awards, yes? I
      could share with you some good songs I've heard over the year. THEN we'll
      call it a year, how about that? See you then.
