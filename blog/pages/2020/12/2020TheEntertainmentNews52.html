Hey, I got through this year pretty well I didn't get laid off and I still got money to buy so much cr*p haha just a reminder to browse through that post I did for Christmas which summarises the list of stuff I bought this year through the Internet of Japan for this year alone. I mean, we shouldn't talk too much about what we did another year ago but still.<div><br></div><div>So, how's your Christmas doing? Going from my phone wallpapers since Christmas Eve, pretty good. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Yeah, it probably sucks to not visit relatives or gather at this time, and it's probably going to suck too once the new year arrives anyways, but let's hope for the best, yeah? I did promise to not talk about this stuff in this blog but I guess we can do it just once. Zoom calls, by the way. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Winter2021Anime><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:var(--secondary);border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:text-bottom"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Winter 2021 Anime Preview</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>[Powered by <a href=https://randomc.net/2020/12/22/winter-preview-2021/ target=_blank>Random Curiosity</a>]</div></blockquote>So, as usual, I'll talk about what I deem interesting, what is worth watching and what is not. Hopefully I don't have to shit on everything haha<div><ul style=text-align:left><li> Yes, as mentioned previous season, since this started at a bad timing literally start of December 2020, I'll still be watching <b>Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</b> [Premiers 6 Dec 2020] till its end. Here's hoping I can remember everything along the way.<li>Getting this out of the way, been seeing too many sequels this season and yeah you can include the above if you want.<li>I've seen Oozora Naomi promote the heck out of this Anime she is minor character in but,Â <b>Tenchi Souzou Design-bu</b> sounds like the Anime that might be work but it's all just slice-of-life. And after I've seen the trailer (wtf Naomi-chan you shouldn't be saying "poop" out loud lol) I'm still not convinced to watch this series to be honest. It's like at work for me where user suggests something but won't come up functional design for it so these guys have to lmao<li>It really feels likeÂ <b>Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun</b> might just be a romcom in a nutshell, but considering how heavily it's focused on this dude's background which is basically me with no life but likes to game all day because I'm not lol, and I would say the trailer didn't make it better a desire to watch over that one Anime I've given years ago "GAMERS!" so...<li>WIXOSS is back??? No I don't care haha (When the first season of Anime started I used it as reference for my own card game story, but <b>WIXOSS DIVA(A)LIVE</b> now...)<li>Ah, I think I've seen <b>Horimiya</b> [Premiers 9 Jan 2021] before somewhere long before this adaptation, and man, did it leave some sort of impression I'm now recalling from the depths of my memory for some reason. (Must be looking at the opening visuals) So yeah, I'll probably give this a watch. I'll take another awkward love story again. Hey, been lovesick since I started watching Anime, what can I say? Also, stellar cast because it has been a while for Tomatsu Haruka to get starring role in a romance story again. Can't wait to fall in love with here again lol<li><b>Kai Byoui Ramune</b> sounds like a real life psychiatrist, but this one is more obvious because unless you can grow chilli peppers as fingernails you've got another thing coming. Not something I would watch though, even after looking at the trailer I don't want to wrap my brain around weird stuff lol<li>Can't find enough info to want to watchÂ <b>Kemono Jihen</b> though; maybe if it really heats up then maybe I'll look into it the description from the website is also not great though it's like forcing me to watch a popular series<li>Just because it stars 10 very new voice actresses of which I've already fallen in love with one (lol), and sphere and TrySail members as rival idol groups doesn't mean I'll watchÂ <b>IDOLY PRIDE</b> anytime soon. Please, they even had a browser rhythm-based game recently, but don't ask how I know so much of it and REFUSE to watch it at all lol it's idol Anime man it's always a no for me<li>I'm only watchingÂ <b>Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</b> [Premiers 12 Jan 2021] because I just want back more of this series as possible, and I did read that this is different from the original series ie. a spin-off, so I'll just watch for the laughs and character voices because I miss them already lol<li><b>Wonder Egg Priority</b> is an original Anime that sounds like a load of egg pooping (lol) until you understand what implications that has: "The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world." So yeah, I may have to destroy the world of Anime before having a kid with someone in the future haha okay probably not watching this anyway</ul><div>In summary, that is maybe 3 shows if we count Attack on Titan haha man this list was hard to read. Also also, just because we are also taking breaks next week, I'll be watching author of BLEACH's spin-off story probably based more on Harry Potter series than his previous work which he finished around 5 years ago "BURN THE WITCH" next week. I thought of ending this year on it but hey, we probably can start next year worse so let's watch it then lol</div><div><br></div><div>Update 2020.12.28: Honestly almost forgot about this until my sis was also looking at the above list (I told her about the site years ago too can't believe that is still her point of reference) and thought this was cool haha but at this point it might be hard to introduce her to this series of despair and bloodshed without looking at the cool cover art with the manoeuvre gear she's into mech girls though lol</div><div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan63><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:var(--secondary);border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:text-bottom"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I'm doing this for you!" Man, that's a confession from Falco that won't turn this into a romance Anime lmao Gabi be like</div></blockquote>I'm like doubting for a good amount of time when I saw the first Tybur family scene and really though it was just kids making a lot of noise on the park downstairs of my place but I guess not. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In this not so funny new episode though (#AttackOnTitan63) well at least they got me with the "yesterday's enemy is today's enemy" speech lol. So, story, I guess. The main point for this episode, in case you have forgotten about the trailer last week, is to reveal a progression for this worldview, like you know, a declaration, to where this war will go with Paradiso and the rest of the world, led by the ruling family of the Marleyans: The Tybur family. We've got a lot mote to talk about here, so let's talk more. Firstly, About Tybur's visit to Marley's capital to deliver a speech. Wait, not speech. A theatre performance? A play, perhaps? Okay, sure. Willy, the head of the family who also brought this diplomatic talk together with many leaders of enemy nations, decide to put an end to all this fighting with a solution. A solution, he will only reveal to them on the night of the festival the following day of the banquet he held. He also did many things out of hand, like giving more power to the Marley military since his house is not much besides the one who holds the Warhammer Titan power which I have a sneaky feeling might not be Willy himself he's just a mediator, but hey, who knows? Remember how a bunch of kids inherited Titan powers? Could be any number of them lol. Then, Farco is surpassing Gabi, slowly but surely. Not that Gabi will understand the intentions of why because Farco's family is already honoured in citizenship as explained by that one "doctor" in the hospital but we'll get to that later, so maybe Gabi is also too thick in the head to understand this anyways, so I won't say too much haha just refer to last week's talk and you'll know. Next up, "Kruger" and Dr. Jeager? Yes, if any of the names ring a bell don't be too surprised because that's probably what you think it is. So, for the latter human first. He's a doctor until you saw his red band on his arm ie. he's Eldian, he tells Kruger about Farco's family and past, and encourages him to not help send letters out of the nation lest he got caught and his family will be in danger again for the stuff they did in the past. Well, Kruger is planning to leave anyways, so I think that advice is heeded already. Talking about the "doctor" and his family though, and yes since his family name is same as our dear main protagonist who hasn't appeared yet Eren, this is most likely the father. How he escaped to this land and then got caught in this mess himself probably is because he was involved in the war at some point, but we can just make guesses as he continues to recuperate in the hospital, I guess. Then, they have a great time for festivities. Hey, just because there's a pandemic in the real world doesn't mean they can't have a great time in theirs (lol sorry I promised not to make such jokes again), so yay those kids had a better time than Reiner's pockets did I'm sure lmao. And, before the start of the festival's play where you would remember will star Willy that Tybur head, Reiner got called by Farco to an underground room and yes I'm still glad someone isn't assassinated immediately, because he got brought in to see, you guessed it, "Kruger", excuse me. Eren. What? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So, to piece everything we've seen this episode: Eren has been in a POW hospital for some time because remember this is present day so it might be likely AFTER the guys in Paradiso saw the rest of the world where they were at the end of season three (Part 1 to be exact), probably got caught but not like anyone knows he has Titan powers, which will beg more questions like where are the others, why is he alone here, and what will be his intention to do here now that he is able to <strike>send messages back to Paradiso from time to time</strike> recover discretely under Marleys' care and his likely plan for revenge. Does he even know of these guys? If so, this proposal for war might be more interesting to listen to than the play lol we shall see about that next week I guess</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IQaUPzhaHog/X-nVFWniJuI/AAAAAAABAl0/AAvTjN_azh4IrvaTtlY5bKdH5REm8RjYgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan63_food1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Since the festival is so much happier than our situation in real life now might as well<br>(RIP Reiner's wallet lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-htDhrcZ1zsY/X-nVFRUcdrI/AAAAAAABAlw/Nt2ffHyrUdwEWG38njUZwNnpbjwCge7QACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan63_food2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Since the festival is so much happier than our situation in real life now might as well<br>(RIP Reiner's wallet lol)</table></div></div>P.S.

"This was is more natural to me" Okay Pieck you like the doggy style position? lol I'm not into porno of this series I promise you<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span style="background:var(--secondary);border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style=font-size:large>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week, it's just <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%BB%E3%81%86%E3%81%8D%E6%98%9F-single/1542944418?l=en" target=_blank>SID's new single</a></b> because you know, there shouldn't be too many releases at this time of year or else it's just going to be rough ending this year's Klassic Note anyways. Don't worry; last year was worse we have like an Ikimonogakari album at this time of the year. It wasn't hard to give them songs though, just the timing isn't great. I also ended up listening to more official <a href="https://twitter.com/lucklife_info/status/1342410124074225664?s=20" target=_blank>YouTube live videos</a> and/or livestreams from artists themselves (see more below), and gave <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/anta-ga-taisho/1507144324?i=1507144419&amp;l=en" target=_blank>another song</a> from <b>LuckLife's latest single</b>. But yeah, that's not going to be the Top 20 anytime soon don't worry I did skip giving the song once so<br><br> On news concerning Twitter and music and hopefully not Christmas lol, you can take a sneak peak at <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1342681544368869377?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's live performance digest</a></b> on YouTube to know why she deserves a spot on Klassic Note this year with her 2nd album, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1342395910844686336?s=20" target=_blank>Taketatsu Ayana's new song preview</a></b> is... well you know haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1342428596107759617?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai released another YouTube video</a></b> of their latest hit for another time because how many times can you promote your best song yet and then invite kids to dab in the background lmao, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/pg_koushiki/status/1342437443190939649?s=20" target=_blank>Porno Graffitti revealed a new song</a></b> on Christmas so maybe we'll get that song next year perhaps, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1342077622549811200?s=20" target=_blank>ClariS is releasing a new single</a></b> for Anime "Hataraku Saibou" next season (and if you need more images of them girls' faces <a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1342078743964078080?s=20" target=_blank>here you go</a>). if you missed watching <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPYAIRSTAFF/status/1342017202694672384?s=20" target=_blank>SPYAIR's new music video</a></b> don't worry I missed it too lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1342080555655987200?s=20" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's new music video</a></b> as topic song for her upcoming album sounds better than her upcoming single which is releasing on the same day as the album already, I'll go around to giving <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kanokari_anime/status/1341684980993335296?s=20" target=_blank>Anime "KanoKari" character songs</a></b> next year I guess, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kayanoai_10th/status/1340975300964839424?s=20" target=_blank>Kayano Ai's new mini-album</a></b> reveals more details and a preview of the topic song wrote by composers I find familiar (again man Kitagawa), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1342451310629539841?s=20" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia did do a Christmas livestream</a></b> and also reveal a fanclub so if you like what you saw of Mia-san and her face slightly lol then please give them more money haha, and yes <b>COUNTDOWN JAPAN 20/21 is cancelled</b> so RIP one of the best avenues for finding new songs every year because <a href="https://twitter.com/FFLOWER_STAFF/status/1340956471228416000?s=20" target=_blank>every</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sambomaster_txt/status/1340945184129835015?s=20" target=_blank>other</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1340947331831644161?s=20" target=_blank>artist</a> I follow be tweeting about it and that's how you know I'm following all the cool people haha yeah<br><br> Next week, I'll stop for a week of course, to deal with <b>Klassic Note Song Awards 2020</b>, the thing I've been doing the 13th time coming (yes man), and somehow still not gotten bored of it. With stuff I learnt from work I am learning to automate as much as I can so I can spend more time thinking about who or what to give than processing data, so we'll talk about those in due time. Other than that, we'll see how many reviews from this year I can cover next year I've missed, and see if Takigawa <strike>Alisa</strike> Arisa will provide me some Chinese song recommendations because apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_AF0Bky8TE" target=_blank>she did a YouTube video about it</a>. (Hey you don't have to understand it; You just have to see the titles and Google them)<br><br><br><br><br> Okay I'm done for now, and sorry for the rather late post. I noticed I want to wait for announcements to happen around this time first or else like Minase Inori's news will only appear next week which is fine I guess I just face regret every time I post this and then new stuff comes up and I can only talk about the hype next week. Speaking of, the package for the month might be in place, and rather soon after I decided to split the package because that one membership card be sitting at the warehouse for three weeks lol but likely that'll come before the year ends maybe, and the rest by next month. We shall see. We can start a year with more stuff to review haha I wonder whether I should get myself a photobook every year on my birthday just to celebrate. Yes, Waki Azumi and your new photobook releasing on Valentine's Day, I'm fascinated by <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CI7MMqOFBYE/ target=_blank>how your front looked like when you lie down</a> haha I'm such a terrible human I can't even. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... just remember to come back for the Song Awards, yes? I could share with you some good songs I've heard over the year. THEN we'll call it a year, how about that? See you then.</div></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
