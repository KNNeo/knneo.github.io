Welcome to the Klassic Note Song Awards 2020!<br />
<br />
I'm Kaineng, Klassic Note's only listener and judge. It's that time of the year
again, where I sit down at the end of the year to give out awards and try to
rank the songs I listen over the year. This year as been a disaster in itself,
but that did not stop my passion for finding more new songs to listen, whether
they were released this year or not. The days continue outside or at home as I
continue to discover new artists, get hype over new announcements over the
Internet, and enjoy the liberty of online live performances, as this year became
a year where music was taken to the Internet. With this much going on, it's no
wonder I can keep finding songs to like at every corner.<br />
<br />
Just a head's up because I always say that, the results below do not fully
represent the many songs I listen to for the year. Idolism may have really
reigned over Klassic Note this year since it did from last year, Apple Music
Japan has only gotten better with more songs up on listen, and Collection
Artists are not attempting to win over my heart this year, but all in all I
still enjoyed what was served up my plate for the year. Many of the songs
mentioned here will no doubt, be songs to remember and be a reference to newer
songs ahead. A big thanks once again to all the artists who participated and
continued to present their music through the Internet despite the situation this
year, and it really isn't Klassic Note without any of these. I try my best to
give recognition to as many artists as I can every year, and as you will see, I
hope through this yearly song awards I have given as much recognition to all of
them as possible.<br />
<br />
<div class="details">
  The results below will be split into six segments, with the first two covering
  statistics and analysis of the songs given this year and how they fare.
  Diagrams will be shown in some segments to give a better overall picture
  rather than just displaying tables of data. Finally, I'll conclude on with The
  Top 20 and an audio edit of them by yours truly, so to give you a better idea
  of what songs truly represent the year around in terms of general mood for the
  year when it comes to music around me.

<br />
(Results finalised on 31/12/2020)<br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;">STATISTICS</span><br />
This year, I have given a total of 205 songs over the past 12 months. As we
know, this year isn't exactly a great year to release new songs and even talk
about them due to lack of reach, but I think with the Internet it might have
helped even more. It did not stop the momentum of giving new songs though. Below
is a summary of what were in, but you can also check out the full list in what
is now, my GitHub Page. (To be updated)<br />
<br />
<div class="details">
  Firstly, I break down the songs to who sings them and sort them by artist
  composition and gender, giving a good look into a usual heavy bias of female
  solo artists singing good songs, also known as the Vocal Styles Popularity
  Survey. For this year, Female Solo vocals have returned to the yearly average
  of 2.5 to 1 against Male Solo vocals, which shows a return of the strength of
  solo artists in these times due to the lack of new mainstream artists in my
  list for the year..<br />
  <br />
  Then, we have the Song Integrity Survey. Initially taken as an experimental
  analysis in Klassic Note, now it is used as a guide to follow past years
  judgement criteria. As I give further detailed analysis to the many songs
  rated in the generic 4-star category, this is to attempt to give a better
  insight into how most of the songs are rated. It is also became the new
  benchmark in recent years in pushing to give more 5-star songs which were then
  based on early impression which is not possible now with maturity of song
  judgement bias. As you can see, there is higher tendency to give more 4-star
  songs as songs above average rank instead of promoting them to 5-stars.<br />
  <br />
  Thirdly, we have the generic statistics of the songs of the year. These
  include language (for those with a vocalist), year of release (old songs can
  appear in the list as far as 2008 for this year), Anime songs (because when I
  say "sometimes" on Twitter I meant this) and B-side analysis for singles which
  is a direct representation of proving that songs which are good need not be
  their release's topic songs, and we should give more criticism and praise to
  songs not under intentional spotlight.<br />
  <br />Last but not least, we have the Song Appetite Report. The chart
  represents how many songs I've given every month, and show peak and trough
  periods typically based on release month dependent on the music industry or
  periods of time where I just want to give more or less songs. I would say
  despite the difficulties and therefore delays in releasing new songs this
  particular year, many still were released in due time, and therefore did not
  miss much in terms of leaving an impression in Klassic Note, and I am thankful
  for that.

This is how the new songs fared this year:<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

  <span style="font-size: large;">SONG OF THE DAY</span><br />
  Every day is unique as it is special; it will set us in a mood to drive our
  everyday lives. From waking up and going to sleep, there's always a different
  melody that will pop up in my mind from listening to the huge amount of songs
  within and outside of this year. I would confidently say that my mood could be
  summarised with the songs I'm listening to every day.<br />
  <br />
  Congratulations to Ryokuoushoku Shakai for being most memorable as Song of the
  Year 2020!<br />
  <br />
  <div class="details">
    The first two tables below show what are the most popular songs I've
    listened for the year and for each month. The last two tables show the most
    popular songs to wake up and sleep to to give a different perspective as to
    how they potentially can feel if you start and end the day with maybe.
    Criteria are subject to conditions in sleeping habits, mood, and mostly due
    to songs I've listened recently during certain times of the day.<br />
    <br />
    Starting from 2019, Song of the Day has been transformed into a rank-based
    system, where every mention pushes you up one rank so that rank sharing will
    make sense. The results shouldn't show much of a difference though, but it
    will more accurately reflect on the position of songs within.

  <span style="font-size: large;">RELEASE RANKINGS</span><br />
  Now we shall talk about the singles and albums reviewed over the year. Many
  releases did perform well this year, not really to impress but more of to
  leave a remembering, and I think many of them have done it. Many artists are
  either going for the one good album bomb to settle the year's limitations for
  exposure, or dragging it throughout the year such that it gets enough
  spotlight on the Internet's headlines to make their final release for the year
  or next year impressive. Regardless of their approach, they still are subject
  to me giving them, and with best albums (mostly) out of the way, we can
  actually give praise to the long awaited albums and surprising singles I have
  given throughout this year.<br />
  <br />
  <div class="details">
    In Klassic Note, top singles are determined by (1) whether they are in
    Klassic Note Review ie. all songs of the single have been given and is not
    digital only release and (2) how good they fare in impression, so ratings
    come to place. Details for giving these singles shall not be discussed
    further since there is The Klassic Note Review for your reference. Top
    albums are determined mostly by how many songs have been given in it, so
    best album have a natural advantage if I've been listening to the artist for
    years, and mini-albums tend to get an edge on these too but they have been
    put lower in priority to allow full length albums to shine.

  <br />
  Congratulations to Minase Inori for an upturn best single (see review) and
  Asakura Momo for best album of Klassic Note 2020 respectively!<br />

  <span style="font-size: large;">COMMENDATIONS</span><br />
  In Klassic Note there are Awards; And then, there are Commendations.
  Commendations are thing that are worth mentioning but not necessarily in
  competition since it can be unique in circumstance. That, or I want to credit
  them all so it won't be an award. Many listed may be repeats, but this is the
  place where I give proper recognition to those who stood out amongst the
  others. Congrats to ORESAMA for coming back with a music video to remember,
  which also eventually got itself a Klassic Note Review and a place in top
  singles for the year. As you can see, this easily shows the power of music
  videos which are all the more important at a time like this where the Internet
  is the best place to promote your new songs..<br />
  <br />
  <div class="details">
    Commendations are given to songs which stand out on their own (eg. terrible
    English, same song title) known as Song Commendations, releases that I
    reviewed and/or are outstanding known as Release Commendations, artists
    which may or may not be singing this year also known as Artist
    Commendations, and honours for (promotional) music videos which excelled in
    impressions also known as Video Commendations.<br />
    <br />
    Instead of giving them as awards, Klassic Note here compliments videos which
    stand out better than their music, sometimes better than not, in order to
    give better representation and thus impression to their audio listeners. And
    so, I commend and also criticise (a bit) on those, as you can see below too.
    Many of the music videos can be found online too, so be sure to check those
    out for yourself. I'll post the links to get you started.

  <span style="font-size: large;">AWARDS</span><br />
  One of the most important things that built the foundation of the Song Awards
  are of course, the Awards themselves. They have also been the toughest to
  decide every year besides the Top 20, which shows how much thought is put into
  figuring out the distinct feels of all the songs I give for the year, and how
  important they are compared to all of the others above. As with previous
  years, it has always been a challenge to get enough songs which will fit what
  the Award should represent, and as much as I try I still hardly feel for some
  of the songs which are worthy of the titles. However, I have made my decision,
  so here are the results.<br />
  <br />
  Congratulations to Scenarioart and yorushika for THE ARTIST (JAPANESE
  CATEGORY) and THE NEWCOMER Awards and together take THE CONTRIBUTOR! It really
  shows how much they have indeed contributed to this year's song list. THE
  IDOLISM has two winners this year purely because of fierce competition all
  around, SPECIAL OTHERS dominated THE MUSIC award this year despite mild
  competition, Ryokuoushoku Shakai is here to sweep up as many Awards as they
  can also because...! We will see what I mean soon.<br />
  <br />
  <div class="details">
    The Award titles mean exactly unless stated otherwise, which are stated as
    follows:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        THE CHARASON now represents all songs from the Anime and Game genres so
        to give more songs recognition on how good they are (CV refers to
        "Character Voice" ie. the actual voice actor behind the role)
      </li>
      <li>
        THE IDOLISM awards idol songs (sung by voice actress who became solo
        artists mostly) which have been on the rise and the award goes to the
        one with judgement possible to be independent of usual criteria eg.
        melody, music style
      </li>
      <li>
        THE INSPIRATIONAL awards songs which spark motivation and/or creativity
        for me, encouraging and pushing me along in life
      </li>
      <li>
        THE NUMBER ONE SONG OF THE YEAR is based on SONG OF THE DAY results, and
        the Award is presented to the best here
      </li>
      <li>
        THE SINGLE and THE ALBUM are based on RELEASE RANKINGS, and the award is
        presented to the best of each category here
      </li>
    </ul>
    Nominees are excluded from the list due to presentation space constraints,
    but I will find a way to show them in the near future.

  <span id="2020TheTop20" style="font-size: large;">THE TOP 20</span><br />
  Last but not least, we have the song rankings. Every year, I try my best to
  showcase Klassic Note in the most vibrant way possible, hopefully with a good
  balance of what I truly love and representation of what the year means for
  Klassic Note in 2020. And in these 20+ songs I'd like to recommend, many have
  left an impression, others I think they are genuinely worth a mention. It was hard to come up with the list at the first place, and there have been many dramatic changes to when I initially planned for this nearly a month ago, but now that the results are out, I'm not going to think
  too into it and hope it's adequate for reference to all who see it. So, without further ado, let's get to it!<br />
  <br />
  Congratulations to Ryokuoushoku Shakai for snatching the #1 song in Klassic
  Note! Should I also mention how they are also #2 too? Yes, these guys have been making grounds, and I thank them for saving Klassic Note 2020 singlehandedly.<br />
  <br />
  <div class="details">
    In Klassic Note, The Top 20 will include certain conflicts in rank number as
    some of the songs have to share the same rank due to my lack of criteria to
    differentiate between them, but is also a ingenious method to show certain
    trends or similarity within topics and timeframes, to a smaller extent. So
    do not be surprised to see up to 25 songs every year on this supposedly "Top
    20" list.

  <div class="details">
    To talk about the troubles I had to give this year's Top 20 in particular and as elaboration from above, here is a good summary:<br />
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        Initial plan for 1st was planned to allow the first exception of two
        winners this year because Ryokuoushoku Shakai is so good, but for
        feeling the mood of the year and a way to not break another record by
        putting emotional songs on the top, THE ORAL CIGARETTES was promoted and
        stayed in same place as my birthday song in 2nd place. Next time for two
        winners, perhaps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Asakura Momo's "Agapanthus" was originally planned to be 3rd, but saw
        pressure from having to give mainstream (as you can see the list is
        mostly solo artist songs), but got balanced down to 5th not just because
        there are songs worth mentioning compared to this, but also to allow
        Waki Azumi's "Fuwatto" to be recognised, her debut solo artist song.
      </li>
      <li>
        20th place was typically reserved for not so great songs I would like to
        promote, but ORESAMA's&nbsp; "Gimmme!" was actually good I'd rather put
        it in a higher position, compared to the other reviewed single I've done
        this year of Ueda Reina which in comparison, did not get recognised into
        this list. The last place in Top 20 was eventually reserved for a
        Sangatsu no Phantasia song from their recent album because I thought
        Mia-san really deserved a mention for having such great songs and not
        winning any Awards. Coincidentally, the composer of the song also is in
        group yorushika, whose topic song in their latest album placed them in
        3rd place.
      </li>
      <li>
        Numakura Manami was planned to deserve a mention this year, but due to
        the last song being such a great hit in Klassic Note, it has been push
        up time and again to ensure a good impression for this year's list. She
        eventually even took over Suzuki Aina's place to take 11th place.
      </li>
      <li>
        AIMER's "SPARK-AGAIN" might be the only good song overall to deserve a
        place in Top 10. It was placed 6th due to more songs leaving a stronger
        initial impression of it not being Anime theme songs, which are a
        natural turn-off to me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Natsukawa Shiina's "Antithesis" was honestly speaking, her best song in
        her solo music career so far, but ended up only given a mention in the
        next 10, along with Fuchigami Mai which also had a great though older in
        style song written for Valentine's Day. Both were pushed up in place and
        not allowed to drop further due to how good they were, even though many
        songs from mainstream were below them, including long-run Collection
        Artists VELTPUNCH and SID.
      </li>
      <li>
        VELTPUNCH was already guaranteed a place in Top 20 due to my bias of
        them as a Collection Artist, but unfortunately their new album really
        did not make an impression with sub-par music video production by the
        male vocalist himself, and songs which represent them but not their
        best. They were pushed all the way down to 14th this year, after being
        missing in Klassic Note for 4 years.
      </li>
      <li>
        yourness and SHE's initially did not have a place in Top 20, but were
        added due to heavy idolism bias and lack of emotional songs in the list.
        For the latter, "Higher" was initially picked to be mentioned in the Top
        20 until putting two of them together pushed me to give the more
        emotional yet better melody overall song "Tragicomedy", also the topic
        song for the album.
      </li>
      <li>
        Suzuki Aina's debut song "Hikariiro no Uta" was planned initially to
        take Top 10 position until the realization of Top 20 competition
        actually took place during the judgement phase. It was eventually pushed
        down to current 12th place, the last being from Numakura Manami on her
        last song for her solo music career.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br />
  <br /><br />
  And this is it for Klassic Note this year, I hope you enjoyed looking at these as much as I do. Again, if you're just
  here to give yourself a chance to listen to the above preview, I thank you for
  even giving me a chance to tell you how wonderful Klassic Note has been for this year. If you have given any of them a listen after this, even just one of
  them, it will already make me happy. Klassic Note has once again been another great year in the making despite what happened to the world, and I'm still proud to be able to follow my passions every year, and still have time and dedication to make all this happen.<br />
  <br />
  See you all next year for another year of Klassic Note! And as always,
  do not forget to be "Searching For A Different Melody"!!<br />
