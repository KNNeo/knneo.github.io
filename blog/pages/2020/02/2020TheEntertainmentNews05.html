Well, hopefully this is the last week of the season I have to deal with FIVE shows on Sunday haha *yawn*<br />
<br />
Welcome back. It was a fruitful weekend haha well by my standards at least<br />
<br />
I can technically split by two-day weekend (I mean, whose isn't?) by spending like half the time sleeping (lol), probably 10% each on two games, about 5% on getting meds from a TCM because if I don't I can't hear Anime (yep) and the rest on this. I love this the most haha come on the gacha didn't even give me shit lol<br />
<br />
Okay let's start I dragged this too much, I didn't rest today and my eyes are twitching while laughing when watching just now so let's finish this<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align: center;">
"That's a woman, right?" YEAH NO SHIT ALEX you blind or what?? Haha I can only make this spoiler-free joke</div>
</blockquote>
I mean, any rational human being who has watched this far would agree that we should kill that b*tch, but you know, Alex doesn't feel that. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> In this final episode (#Babylon12) of this whole nonsense we have been going through, it's interrogation time. Just this time, it's on the top of a building. It really feels like this is a trap for Alex to talk to potentially Magase but it's not, for starters. But what happened next probably will not change your opinion of this series. Well, at least for me. Firstly, the talk. Alex had to convince a woman to not take her own life upon a building and... it went well, surprisingly. They gotta find an interpreter for this though. And... Seizaki's buddy stepped in. I mean, "kill him whenever he does anything stupid" shall be my final warning to him haha, but I guess we may not have to. Because besides listening to the woman's tough story about whether to die after losing a kid she did with another guy without getting married (lol everyday thing there and I can't even get myself laid), the talk went successfully and Alex just said the same thing: he still doesn't know. But after telling her that and letting her live without killing herself, he then realised upon the answer. Okay, from her on this is literally the author's standpoint so spoilers if you haven't seen it yet... to live is to continue. Which technically makes sense. That's what life is about, yes? Only people who risk death are doing bad things, for most of the time. Doesn't mean you can do risk-taking things like play with the stock market but, you get the idea. But then, as Alex realised this, he made the worst decision of his life: pick up the wireless receiver to talk to the woman again, thinking that the same wearer would still be on after the talk. But hey, surprise surprise, Magase is on the line now. Which explains that the one on top of the building is just one of those people who want to die, not the evil itself. So, part two of this episode. Since Alex is a normal person like most of the guys who can get seduced by Magase's voice (yeah technically Seizaki is abnormal haha it's the power of his wife and kid man), he decided to take his own life. Let's ignore the panic this has caused for a world leader who wants to die now as he climbs to the highest point of the building which probably won't kill him it's like 4 floors lol, but Seizaki found him. Okay this one, I can argue with the author so let's do it. I'm not pleased. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Normally we have a proper ending like any other Anime even as weird as it gets like "Kara no Kyoukai" as I would like to reference to be the weirdest psychological I've watched so far in Anime. No really, even that had some proper conclusion. But if you are expecting an ending or even a happy ending, don't even think about it because the author is not giving it to you. Well, at least this adaptation isn't. I'll focus on Alex's talk about talking to the woman which he convinced to not jump, and tie it back to the talk about good which we mentioned earlier. In essence, he said that he'll be telling her a lie, and that he'll not be doing something good. Remember that he mentioned that good in continuity? So if you flip this around, and as us as we are now, we will argue that she <u>should</u> die, but then be telling her a lie? So she should die if her life is that screwed up already? So yeah, here comes my argument. If good is continuity, then many people would have been evil accidentally by ending their own lives. Think of the woman that he talked to just now. I like to quote on the poor on this because they didn't have much of a choice, so what does that make them? Poor people are evil now? Go read some articles on how some of them took education and lived to see the revival of their village in Africa. THEN you come tell me if it's good or not. It is, isn't it? On the contrary, then why is evil ending of life? Oh by the way, I'm not going to rant too much, and if you want a reality check if you haven't been influenced by Magase at this point because I assume you haven't... as much as people say living in a sin (I'm going to jump off a building after all this lmao no really I won't I promise), <b>life is all about finding a purpose</b>. If you fail to find one it's fine just live with it, but if you find it and it's "kill yourself" then you're f**ked up, to be honest. And in the case of Alex the Thinker, it would be continuous. And that's why you shouldn't die. Because I guess we can quote on Nomaru again remember that debate? Yeah, human tendency is not to die. Even if one has lost all hope in life. Because besides for the purpose of survival, we have all the reason to live. To find another purpose in life. You think the animals out there who barely have a brain will just die because they survived a struggle with another species? Hey come on that ant you stepped on probably only lived for 2 days with purpose and you killed it. Isn't that evil?? So yeah, in this case, the author is right: evil is ending things. Even one's life. I think we mentioned on this on how it'll affect other peoples' lives if you die, so you get the idea. That doesn't mean it'll be good if you die naturally, but then that is not your choice. As you continue to fight to live probably because you have a purpose even if it is for family, it's still a purpose. Think about it. The author, in conclusion, may have led us to a bad turn or even a trap (hey real life Magase haha) to think about good and evil. There is no good and evil by the way, because we are both. To think of evil is part of our nature, and to do evil becomes natural as an instinct; I believe we mentioned this before too. The real question probably Alex needs to think about is then what is life? Because to think about life as a sin is itself a sin, since then we will think of the opposite ie. dying. Again, don't want to iterate too much but I hope you get the point. Continuity alone isn't everything. Seizaki of course, ending up taking on his own life, as hinted by the ending where Magase is pretty much alive. Because clearly, she is not at that location where the two people died. Bad ending, I guess. I thought we could expect a good one at least, but hey this isn't local TV drama, they do whatever they want haha. All in all, quite an inquisitive show to think about life, but as I said, I've thought about it more than Alex at a much younger age than him, and my standpoint is still valid: living in society is signing an invisible contract with the government, and <b>not committing suicide and to live and contribute for the benefit of society is your purpose in life</b>. So do not forget that. To die then is a sin. So go strip your citizenship and then die haha I'm done with this shitshow I need some comedic relief<br />

P.S. "What should I do?" I mean, after listening to your story? Have another kid? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Oh yeah right she did a one-nighter with the guy haha okay nvm<br />
P.P.S. "At that time I'll die with you too" Man Alex, did you just betray your wife and try to do a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinjuu" target="_blank">shinjuu</a> with another woman from across the globe? I can't kill him from here but can someone push him off a building? haha *serious foreshadowing*<br />

Okay I gotta say it here, but I want this Anime to be awesome because the parents will be their last draw and is in a level different from the bad guys who are tougher than the house without them. Well, at least, the mother will be. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> In this new episode (#HatenaIllusion04) we have more issues, specifically with Yumemi. Hey, I did say it was somehow because of her that I continue this series, but as simplistic as this episode has shed a light about the series, I still think this is nice compared to whatever intense thinking stuff about suicide I'm watching this season lol. Let's talk about elementary school kids problems, yes? In a nutshell, Yumemi doesn't want to go to school. And it's not really because of the boys playing around with her which I must say is a real turn off to anyone who has to go to school, but more of what the boys are insulting her of, that she doesn't look like her sister. For example, just the hair colour, inherited from her parents. I mean, you can always dye your hair brown. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Since the father came and left after praising Makoto about last episode let's ignore him lol, but yeah it was a tough process to even talk to her about it, to say the least. Yumemi's friend in school and teahcer even went so far as to visit her at her place. And of course the sister and his boyfriend are eavesdropping on them. I mean, what do you think they were doing, Yumemi-chan?? Ah, she doesn't understand that kind of stuff yet haha.  Hatena was concerned about her and asked about what happened in school that made her not want to go to the extent of having to fight their Artifacts over it. And now Yumemi you're asking about what to do now that you've upset your sister? Ah well, she's only in elementary school so whatever you're forgiven lol. Even with all this, she still refuses to talk to anyone properly... besides Makoto. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Hey, what did I say? The one who possesses the wand or whatever it's called... "smile stick"? Haha yes, whatever that meant, is the one who brings joy haha. At least, that's what <strike>the author</strike> Makoto thought is true. Turns out, she doesn't want to go to school because she's too smart for it? But girl, do you know about Triple Integrals and Fourier Transform? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> That's... what I learnt in university lol and that's why you go. Anyways, she's just an elementary school student; We've all been there, something is making you not want to go to school mainly social issues because them kids all are d*cks before you can be one (lol), and they will never apologise but you still have to live with it for 6 years. *getting intense primary school flashbacks* Haha, but in this case, the kids came to her place and apologised to her, and... she ran away haha I gotcha girl I know you were going to run. But seriously man, if they apologised, and as Makoto mentioned, just say it's fine. And again, if you are smart, you could teach them a few tricks. Also tricks other than homework because I can use this word pun to talk about the magic trick she did to impress her classmates and maybe change their impression of her. Hey, if it works, it works, author. I can't criticise on your now lol RIP btw. Anyways, nice episode to watch though, as much as it is simple in thought, at least it made some sense besides the fighting with Artifacts which I must argue is the animation's strongest point thus far haha. Next episode... we may have a troublemaker coming our way. Looks like some rich woman who doesn't know about magic asking for something probably from the parents, so... we shall see how this plays out. Can you imagine the amount of sh*t the house has to deal with regarding the family and Artifacts? I'm glad the butler and maid haven't resigned yet because I would lol okay maybe not for Yumemi-chan haha<br />

Okay wait, so this is an affair?? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> No wonder the wife wants to kill kids- Wait I can't say that this site will get banned haha. In this new episode (#HanakoKun04) to end the Misaki Stairs mini story, we have plenty of take into with regards to the story behind, and it's most definitely not what I mentioned above haha. Last week, we were left with the confrontation of the youkai responsible for this fiasco of students missing all over the school, so the trio came in to piece up a body as the youkai requested from the phone. And... it looks hideous haha. Then again, Yashiro's finds would not have worked though if they just built a normal person out of mannequin parts, but we'll talk about that later. Because firstly, we have to fight the damn thing. Hanako also realised that the weakness is not up there in the world, but probably down below (come on author that youkai is a woman lol), so after Yashiro realises her friend was one of the many in the (half dead) corpse pile amongst the stabbing scissors... Hanako threw her off the edge haha wow this change in mood. As funny as that is, the story in which Yashiro later found out as she appears in another area below the surface, is another thing in itself. Since for starters, Misaki is not the youkai they were fighting. It's a teacher in school. <strike>That youkai when she was "younger"</strike> Okay, this might not be a good explanation. Let's start with the diary. In the diary which Yashiro accidentally found lying around, it dictates the times where some kid? Yeah, wrote a diary about his or her life with the sensei, specifically Misaki since the teacher's comment on every page is signed by him. Yes, Misaki is a him. And as Yashiro figured out, it was a student falling in love with teacher scenario (and as usual the teacher cannot return the favour because "you're like 20 years below me kid" haha), but one day, the teacher died. After falling down that flight of stairs. Now you know where this is going. And in the diary was a photo of a bunch of kids with the sensei. So... yeah, flashback!! <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> In the actual tale, specifically mentioned in the diary too, Misaki-sensei gave her a pair of metal scissors (this is probably some decades ago FYI) after helping her to cut her hair, the youkai's. And since she is one... she can hide, uh, I mean, disappear. In a story where one would expect it to be a story where similar someone turns into a youkai, in actual fact that was done in front of a shrine, so yeah, that kid who wrote the diary and the guys are already fighting, is a fox God. That fox God fell in love with a human. Hey, that took a real turn around haha. Misaki arranged for the kids to take a picture with her in it. That's how kind to the God he was. I hope she realised that haha he probably did he pulled it out of nowhere. So all in all, it's some fox God dreaming about being with the sensei who died and in her effort to try to create him once again... I mean, can she? Surprisingly though, the plot line developing up till the end was gripping, to say the least. (Says lesser about Kyokou Suiri for the past few weeks but we'll bitch about that later haha) In the end, Hanako had to send out his powers to ensure this God's duties are removed because heck, you can't date on duty lol. The kids were returned to normal by daylight, and Minamoto... he was a warrior haha I can't think of a doll joke lmao. The fox God in its actual form is not kind though, but what the heck I may have destroyed your love dreams but you know you can find love with another human, right? It's time to move on haha. For next episode... we might have been revealed of the Number One Wonder of the school. Not that she's the new school idol lol (wonder, get it?), but yeah, she seems to have something like Hanako-kun and his... I'm not going to read that name hahahakujoudai (lmao), but she looks like an evil one to say the least. Remember the origami which stayed on Yashiro and accompanied them in the past couple of episodes? I guess it's for observation purposes and if it's similar in power Hanako would hardly figure it out, but this is going to get interesting. In-fighting? Hanako-kun I didn't know you had a sister lol it's Anzai Chika too HELL YEAH I'll be a youkai for her hehe<br />

WOAH MAN THIS BITCH KNOWS TAEKWONDO I'm sorry Kanade-chan for saying you're cute haha. In this not new episode because remind me to fix back the episode numbers (#RikeKoi02) so it will fill up the gaps? Well, there isn't any since it still looks normal until... well the past few weeks have been rough lol watching the wrong order. In this episode, we have been introduced this episode to a new(?) character Ibarada, who just games all day even though I can hardly call her a gamer Chio-chan is more of a gamer than her haha. So firstly, about the senpai who is older than everyone else around in the lab. She may have redeemed herself by stepping into the love experiment the couple were practising on, talking about the couple's experiment misses, but otherwise you have literally a gamer science student who can juggle between work and play more efficiently than any machine around the lab haha. (And she has a childhood friend but we'll leave that aside for now) She technically also proved that Yukimura gets aroused from just petting girls around the room. <a href="https://jisho.org/search/urayamashii" target="_blank">URAYAMASHII</a> haha please bro stop showing off how unsocial you are with females. On the other hand, Himuro sure is pissed from not getting that love she intended to have by proving that literally just her would be enough to prove her love for him. Oh well blame Ibarada for that then haha. The second half of the episode was focused on... love with cooking. Hey, if you need help understanding this over significant figures go get yourself a partner lol or just watch more romance Anime tbh. So for those who have lived in a well like Yukimura, there is a legend that states that love cooked with passion and specifically love will make a dish taste much better. They should've tested this against cooking for someone without any emotions (say, cook for me) (haha <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span>) and let Yukimura eat it too, but the couple actually forgot to remove the experiment control of cooking experience as a factor to this test. So yeah, they stopped Yukimura from science cooking real quick lmao even I can't stand it. And as Himuro suggesting to test various ways to "inject love" into cooking (here's a secret it works best when both are cooking together haha don't tell Yukimura), and we kind of landed on the psychological aspect. You know, from heart-shaped bentos to carefully designed dishes to even your grandmother's special... they all share a common theme. And I swear in order to not get slapped by Himuro, Yukimura had to say the one with that layer of love sauce all over it (haha sex joke) must taste better than the other one WHY THEY GOTTA SHOW RIPPED DUDES IN HERE haha. To end this simple episode considering that there are complex topics mentioned in this series, is to talk about whoever is mentioning all the details ie. Kanade-chan. She is cute. I think I elaborated that real well over the past couple of episodes haha. But yeah, this lab is probably where she shines as she continues her line of tsukkomi to the dumb senpais lol (fancy calling yourself a genius, Yukimura), gets used as reference material or experiment subjects (and I don't mind tbh), and... gets tortured to read papers into the night. YUKIMURA YOU PIECE OF SHIT- Cya guys next week we should be on track by then haha<br />

Eh I may have screwed up the naming for Kurou-kun but Kuro is fine haha he's not black though lol I'm not racist. In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri04) featuring Steel Lady Nanase... I guess we have to get through the love rival thing first, huh. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Yep, so rival whatever first. Hey, I think I'm staying, for these nonsense in between. F**k the youkai, amirite??? *looks at the tree spirit* (Go away from me please haha your comedic relief is here guys) So yeah, it has been 2 years in th story, so let's let Kotoko update what happened between the two. They... they were dating. Yeah, it's not a lie, but it's not true either. For the ex who knows everything, she knows for starters that he wouldn't date such a (cute) girl anyways, as seen from the photos the guy had to take with the new girl lol. And then, there's the shitting on each other. I'm so glad this isn't a Taiwanese drama where they quarrel for two episodes (worth 2 hours each btw) because I love this level of bickering all over the place even though we know they are both losers since one is the ex and the other isn't making the guy happy anyways lmao. "If you like him you let him go", I say. Is that how I never got laid? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Moving on, let's talk about Nanase's story. Ignoring the fact that a voice actress with a rack is acting an Anime character with one too (haha Sumipe, please), story goes that (I know I said I got bored from the murder by the lake but this one has tits, uh, I mean, is more interesting) Nanase rose as an idol picked up on the streets by an old geezer ugh (lol), she got her debut in TV which made her famous including giving us the audience a spectacular opening theme animation that no one will forget haha (I legit laughed out loud at the ice girl like opponent lmao) (And if you don't get the joke of why and I learnt this from one Jeff Dunham: it's the super normal ones around the super attractive one that makes the attractive one more appealing lol that opponent only had dots for eyes) (Edit: It's a God, as seen from the manga, and she is literally called washboard haha), she was great in front of the camera (well of course Sumipe would, uh, I mean), and... she killed her dad. Wait, what? Haha for someone who has everything it's hardly likely that she would kill her dad, so we know there's more to this. <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span> I shouldn't be building suspense here since the Anime did it already, but it has probably got to do with her sister, in case you didn't realise. Because not long after hiding from the press and being asked about the father's death, she was killed by a steel beam. I use the word "killed" instead of "died" because... it's likely not an accident. I guess we will know about that soon, but that's when Saki-san had to figure out herself after taking in all the clues from the police investigation department. And this, the God of Wisdom wants a piece of the action. To this, and since she can't ask for her favour directly because she can't resist shitting on her again (Saki-san too but you get the idea lmao), so... cue the next idol of the season probably, that Tree God Gen'ichirou. (Nanase has nothing on this guy; I assume he does stand-up comedy? lmao) He asks for her help in place of Kotoko-chan and requested a meetup to talk about it. You know, that eventuality where the police would cooperate with the one citizen haha. But then, at the meeting place, some youkai nearby told Kotoko that Steel Lady Nanase (the youkai) was around. And so she went to discover.. it's Kuro-san fighting her!? So I guess next episode, we get to find out more from Kuro's perspective. I assume he has spent the week investigating this out too. Hey Kotoko-chan may be cute but we have the smart guy here lol don't hit me Saki-san. The story is getting me down on my seat though, no joke. I did not regret giving this Anime another chance where we fight monsters and shit on women lol I'm not misogynist btw I like tits haha wait what<br />

Okay, another week, another bunch of releases to talk about, new and old. The actual release out this week was <b>Waki Azumi's debut single</b> so congrats, but apart from the first song I legit cannot give you anything else, to be honest. I think my initial impressions were right it might be hard to give Ajuju the right song to sing. Cute songs might be it for now though I await the next work to impress me further. I also revived my review on <b>Uso to Chameleon's new single</b> because heck I have to give the Anime now and I'd rather give this opening theme song because at second listen... it ain't bad. I mean, I must be tired from last month's dose of J-Rock lol no seriously.This weekend I came around finally to <b>Suzuki Aina's debut album</b>- wait, what? Yeah, this newbie is also getting her singer debut apart from acting main role in Anime "Hatena Illusion". Hey, the music video was released in November last year, by the way. Goes to show they just slotted this song in casually to make her have a good start in her solo music career. Seriously, Suzuki Aina... you're just like them. LiSA or whoever they are in the same subgenre. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Ignoring that, what the heck is with the excessive classical music is it like the music genre she's into? But then again I'll try to give a couple of songs if all goes well I think I give a couple. While searching for releases landing on my birthday because surprise surprise it's on a Wenesday this year, I came across indie(?) band... let me get their name, yes <b>Humbreaders</b>, these guys. They aren't bad. So yeah, will be reviewing their 1st full album since they started I think three years ago. Congrats, guys. You gettin' Klassic Note consent liao- oh this is not prestigious enough? Oh well haha<br />
<br />
Next week is idolism week in Klassic Note, ladies and gentlemen (lol) because we have <b>Fuchigami Mai's new single</b> which I'll probably only give the only topic song for Valentine's Day (I mean, why not since the others aren't doing it), and the showdown between <b>Touyama Nao's new single</b> and <b>Minase Inori's new single</b>... you try to find the former in tweets and compare with how many times I said I liked Inorin over the week, yes? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Don't mean to shit on your Naobou but they got Inorin a good song imo<br />
<br />
On a fantastic week of news we've not seen in months in Twitter (haha), <b>Q-MHz is on music subscription services</b> in which of course only Apple Music Japan is of importance to me (I also paid my yearly membership fee ugh should do it in summer when currency is weak lol), <b>SHE'S is coming up with a new album</b> somehow after the success that is the EP from last December I guess, <b>VELTPUNCH's new album</b> production is done which means we will get news about release real soon which means it's this year, and to compliment that <b>SPECIAL OTHERS is back with another album</b> after five years of not releasing new stuff. Them in acoustic 2 years ago does not count haha welcome to 2012 everyone where music (only) is king and alternative rock is awesome~!! The hype is real in this one haha the stars have aligned<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay I'm done I'm tired. If I miss something I'll fix it at work lmao. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I'm pretty sure you'll get two new posts by then, mainly a new Klassic Note Review which should've been done last month and... you know what it is. <span title="*giggles*">ðŸ¤­</span> Until next time then next week is going to be great I want work to not screw this up please don't Wuhan virus you too<br />
