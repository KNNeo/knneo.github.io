<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_OUg6qTwSNc/Xja-YuBZJHI/AAAAAAAA4UE/gGDWJZmQg0s_Syp3xEteBfyNbKSGsrfGQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/hanakokun04_bitten.gif"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>Well, hopefully this is the last week of the season I have to deal with FIVEshows on Sunday haha *yawn*<br /><br />Welcome back. It was a fruitful weekend haha well by my standards at least<br /><br />I can technically split by two-day weekend (I mean, whose isn't?) by spendinglike half the time sleeping (lol), probably 10% each on two games, about 5% ongetting meds from a TCM because if I don't I can't hear Anime (yep) and the reston this. I love this the most haha come on the gacha didn't even give me shitlol<br /><br />Okay let's start I dragged this too much, I didn't rest today and my eyes aretwitching while laughing when watching just now so let's finish this<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Babylon12">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "That's a woman, right?" YEAH NO SHIT ALEX you blind or what?? Haha I can    only make this spoiler-free joke  </div></blockquote>I mean, any rational human being who has watched this far would agree that weshould kill that b*tch, but you know, Alex doesn't feel that. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In thisfinal episode (#Babylon12) of this whole nonsense we have been going through,it's interrogation time. Just this time, it's on the top of a building. Itreally feels like this is a trap for Alex to talk to potentially Magase but it'snot, for starters. But what happened next probably will not change your opinionof this series. Well, at least for me. Firstly, the talk. Alex had to convince awoman to not take her own life upon a building and... it went well,surprisingly. They gotta find an interpreter for this though. And... Seizaki'sbuddy stepped in. I mean, "kill him whenever he does anything stupid" shall bemy final warning to him haha, but I guess we may not have to. Because besideslistening to the woman's tough story about whether to die after losing a kid shedid with another guy without getting married (lol everyday thing there and Ican't even get myself laid), the talk went successfully and Alex just said thesame thing: he still doesn't know. But after telling her that and letting herlive without killing herself, he then realised upon the answer. Okay, from heron this is literally the author's standpoint so spoilers if you haven't seen ityet... to live is to continue. Which technically makes sense. That's what lifeis about, yes? Only people who risk death are doing bad things, for most of thetime. Doesn't mean you can do risk-taking things like play with the stock marketbut, you get the idea. But then, as Alex realised this, he made the worstdecision of his life: pick up the wireless receiver to talk to the woman again,thinking that the same wearer would still be on after the talk. But hey,surprise surprise, Magase is on the line now. Which explains that the one on topof the building is just one of those people who want to die, not the evilitself. So, part two of this episode. Since Alex is a normal person like most ofthe guys who can get seduced by Magase's voice (yeah technically Seizaki isabnormal haha it's the power of his wife and kid man), he decided to take hisown life. Let's ignore the panic this has caused for a world leader who wants todie now as he climbs to the highest point of the building which probably won'tkill him it's like 4 floors lol, but Seizaki found him. Okay this one, I canargue with the author so let's do it. I'm not pleased. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Normally we havea proper ending like any other Anime even as weird as it gets like "Kara noKyoukai" as I would like to reference to be the weirdest psychological I'vewatched so far in Anime. No really, even that had some proper conclusion. But ifyou are expecting an ending or even a happy ending, don't even think about itbecause the author is not giving it to you. Well, at least this adaptationisn't. I'll focus on Alex's talk about talking to the woman which he convincedto not jump, and tie it back to the talk about good which we mentioned earlier.In essence, he said that he'll be telling her a lie, and that he'll not be doingsomething good. Remember that he mentioned that good in continuity? So if youflip this around, and as us as we are now, we will argue that she<u>should</u> die, but then be telling her a lie? So she should die if her lifeis that screwed up already? So yeah, here comes my argument. If good iscontinuity, then many people would have been evil accidentally by ending theirown lives. Think of the woman that he talked to just now. I like to quote on thepoor on this because they didn't have much of a choice, so what does that makethem? Poor people are evil now? Go read some articles on how some of them tookeducation and lived to see the revival of their village in Africa. THEN you cometell me if it's good or not. It is, isn't it? On the contrary, then why is evilending of life? Oh by the way, I'm not going to rant too much, and if you want areality check if you haven't been influenced by Magase at this point because Iassume you haven't... as much as people say living in a sin (I'm going to jumpoff a building after all this lmao no really I won't I promise),<b>life is all about finding a purpose</b>. If you fail to find one it's finejust live with it, but if you find it and it's "kill yourself" then you'ref**ked up, to be honest. And in the case of Alex the Thinker, it would becontinuous. And that's why you shouldn't die. Because I guess we can quote onNomaru again remember that debate? Yeah, human tendency is not to die. Even ifone has lost all hope in life. Because besides for the purpose of survival, wehave all the reason to live. To find another purpose in life. You think theanimals out there who barely have a brain will just die because they survived astruggle with another species? Hey come on that ant you stepped on probably onlylived for 2 days with purpose and you killed it. Isn't that evil?? So yeah, inthis case, the author is right: evil is ending things. Even one's life. I thinkwe mentioned on this on how it'll affect other peoples' lives if you die, so youget the idea. That doesn't mean it'll be good if you die naturally, but thenthat is not your choice. As you continue to fight to live probably because youhave a purpose even if it is for family, it's still a purpose. Think about it.The author, in conclusion, may have led us to a bad turn or even a trap (heyreal life Magase haha) to think about good and evil. There is no good and evilby the way, because we are both. To think of evil is part of our nature, and todo evil becomes natural as an instinct; I believe we mentioned this before too.The real question probably Alex needs to think about is then what is life?Because to think about life as a sin is itself a sin, since then we will thinkof the opposite ie. dying. Again, don't want to iterate too much but I hope youget the point. Continuity alone isn't everything. Seizaki of course, ending uptaking on his own life, as hinted by the ending where Magase is pretty muchalive. Because clearly, she is not at that location where the two people died.Bad ending, I guess. I thought we could expect a good one at least, but hey thisisn't local TV drama, they do whatever they want haha. All in all, quite aninquisitive show to think about life, but as I said, I've thought about it morethan Alex at a much younger age than him, and my standpoint is still valid:living in society is signing an invisible contract with the government, and<b  >not committing suicide and to live and contribute for the benefit of society  is your purpose in life</b>. So do not forget that. To die then is a sin. So go strip your citizenship andthen die haha I'm done with this shitshow I need some comedic relief<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zqKxhRd63NM/XjZE4F26D0I/AAAAAAAA4Sw/G4lEJp3lR_IT1rVh7MC756hy_s2NyRqHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon12_family1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This show is sad so here's a happy family (without Zen) (ugh)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jh_QLOe10xQ/XjZE47sk9EI/AAAAAAAA4S0/78xI0myAiNILHu4M-whOafVSIsAORh7QACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon12_evil.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I don't know what is not evil but I SWEAR watching porn isn't haha            I'm sorry I gotta          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

"At that time I'll die with you too" Man Alex, did you just betray yourwife and try to do a<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinjuu" target="_blank">shinjuu</a> withanother woman from across the globe? I can't kill him from here but can someonepush him off a building? haha *serious foreshadowing*<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion04">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    So wait, sir? You're not a real magician?? WHAT??!! Haha spoiler alert    "(Makoto) You're better than Father" GOT HIM lmao  </div></blockquote>Okay I gotta say it here, but I want this Anime to be awesome because theparents will be their last draw and is in a level different from the bad guyswho are tougher than the house without them. Well, at least, the mother will be.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#HatenaIllusion04) we have more issues,specifically with Yumemi. Hey, I did say it was somehow because of her that Icontinue this series, but as simplistic as this episode has shed a light aboutthe series, I still think this is nice compared to whatever intense thinkingstuff about suicide I'm watching this season lol. Let's talk about elementaryschool kids problems, yes? In a nutshell, Yumemi doesn't want to go to school.And it's not really because of the boys playing around with her which I must sayis a real turn off to anyone who has to go to school, but more of what the boysare insulting her of, that she doesn't look like her sister. For example, justthe hair colour, inherited from her parents. I mean, you can always dye yourhair brown. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Since the father came and left after praising Makoto aboutlast episode let's ignore him lol, but yeah it was a tough process to even talkto her about it, to say the least. Yumemi's friend in school and teahcer evenwent so far as to visit her at her place. And of course the sister and hisboyfriend are eavesdropping on them. I mean, what do you think they were doing,Yumemi-chan?? Ah, she doesn't understand that kind of stuff yet haha. Hatena wasconcerned about her and asked about what happened in school that made her notwant to go to the extent of having to fight their Artifacts over it. And nowYumemi you're asking about what to do now that you've upset your sister? Ahwell, she's only in elementary school so whatever you're forgiven lol. Even withall this, she still refuses to talk to anyone properly... besides Makoto.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, what did I say? The one who possesses the wand or whatever it'scalled... "smile stick"? Haha yes, whatever that meant, is the one who bringsjoy haha. At least, that's what <strike>the author</strike> Makoto thought istrue. Turns out, she doesn't want to go to school because she's too smart forit? But girl, do you know about Triple Integrals and Fourier Transform? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>That's... what I learnt in university lol and that's why you go. Anyways, she'sjust an elementary school student; We've all been there, something is making younot want to go to school mainly social issues because them kids all are d*cksbefore you can be one (lol), and they will never apologise but you still have tolive with it for 6 years. *getting intense primary school flashbacks* Haha, butin this case, the kids came to her place and apologised to her, and... she ranaway haha I gotcha girl I know you were going to run. But seriously man, if theyapologised, and as Makoto mentioned, just say it's fine. And again, if you aresmart, you could teach them a few tricks. Also tricks other than homeworkbecause I can use this word pun to talk about the magic trick she did to impressher classmates and maybe change their impression of her. Hey, if it works, itworks, author. I can't criticise on your now lol RIP btw. Anyways, nice episodeto watch though, as much as it is simple in thought, at least it made some sensebesides the fighting with Artifacts which I must argue is the animation'sstrongest point thus far haha. Next episode... we may have a troublemaker comingour way. Looks like some rich woman who doesn't know about magic asking forsomething probably from the parents, so... we shall see how this plays out. Canyou imagine the amount of sh*t the house has to deal with regarding the familyand Artifacts? I'm glad the butler and maid haven't resigned yet because I wouldlol okay maybe not for Yumemi-chan haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uq7Fm-ssEVk/XjZRB7hJb7I/AAAAAAAA4TE/Uto1QHMoOpAoZpa4JZ1P6nP-_gootYUxgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion04_pissed.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How you should not be treating life<br />            (Be angry at small stuff like skirt lifting haha ikr)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mUAZK59K_cs/XjZRCtiKPOI/AAAAAAAA4TI/djZst4Sp_8whXqmWrGQm0q8UCf2upkjMgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion04_mamoru2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How you should be treating life<br />            ("As a joke" haha ikr)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

That's the best quote I've heard so far this season haha    Nene-chan~  </div></blockquote>Okay wait, so this is an affair?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> No wonder the wife wants to killkids- Wait I can't say that this site will get banned haha. In this new episode(#HanakoKun04) to end the Misaki Stairs mini story, we have plenty of take intowith regards to the story behind, and it's most definitely not what I mentionedabove haha. Last week, we were left with the confrontation of the youkairesponsible for this fiasco of students missing all over the school, so the triocame in to piece up a body as the youkai requested from the phone. And... itlooks hideous haha. Then again, Yashiro's finds would not have worked though ifthey just built a normal person out of mannequin parts, but we'll talk aboutthat later. Because firstly, we have to fight the damn thing. Hanako alsorealised that the weakness is not up there in the world, but probably down below(come on author that youkai is a woman lol), so after Yashiro realises herfriend was one of the many in the (half dead) corpse pile amongst the stabbingscissors... Hanako threw her off the edge haha wow this change in mood. As funnyas that is, the story in which Yashiro later found out as she appears in anotherarea below the surface, is another thing in itself. Since for starters, Misakiis not the youkai they were fighting. It's a teacher in school.<strike>That youkai when she was "younger"</strike> Okay, this might not be agood explanation. Let's start with the diary. In the diary which Yashiroaccidentally found lying around, it dictates the times where some kid? Yeah,wrote a diary about his or her life with the sensei, specifically Misaki sincethe teacher's comment on every page is signed by him. Yes, Misaki is a him. Andas Yashiro figured out, it was a student falling in love with teacher scenario(and as usual the teacher cannot return the favour because "you're like 20 yearsbelow me kid" haha), but one day, the teacher died. After falling down thatflight of stairs. Now you know where this is going. And in the diary was a photoof a bunch of kids with the sensei. So... yeah, flashback!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In theactual tale, specifically mentioned in the diary too, Misaki-sensei gave her apair of metal scissors (this is probably some decades ago FYI) after helping herto cut her hair, the youkai's. And since she is one... she can hide, uh, I mean,disappear. In a story where one would expect it to be a story where similarsomeone turns into a youkai, in actual fact that was done in front of a shrine,so yeah, that kid who wrote the diary and the guys are already fighting, is afox God. That fox God fell in love with a human. Hey, that took a real turnaround haha. Misaki arranged for the kids to take a picture with her in it.That's how kind to the God he was. I hope she realised that haha he probably didhe pulled it out of nowhere. So all in all, it's some fox God dreaming aboutbeing with the sensei who died and in her effort to try to create him onceagain... I mean, can she? Surprisingly though, the plot line developing up tillthe end was gripping, to say the least. (Says lesser about Kyokou Suiri for thepast few weeks but we'll bitch about that later haha) In the end, Hanako had tosend out his powers to ensure this God's duties are removed because heck, youcan't date on duty lol. The kids were returned to normal by daylight, andMinamoto... he was a warrior haha I can't think of a doll joke lmao. The fox Godin its actual form is not kind though, but what the heck I may have destroyedyour love dreams but you know you can find love with another human, right? It'stime to move on haha. For next episode... we might have been revealed of theNumber One Wonder of the school. Not that she's the new school idol lol (wonder,get it?), but yeah, she seems to have something like Hanako-kun and his... I'mnot going to read that name hahahakujoudai (lmao), but she looks like an evilone to say the least. Remember the origami which stayed on Yashiro andaccompanied them in the past couple of episodes? I guess it's for observationpurposes and if it's similar in power Hanako would hardly figure it out, butthis is going to get interesting. In-fighting?

In this not new episode because remind me to fix back the episode numbers(#RikeKoi02) so it will fill up the gaps? Well, there isn't any since it stilllooks normal until... well the past few weeks have been rough lol watching thewrong order. In this episode, we have been introduced this episode to a new(?)character Ibarada, who just games all day even though I can hardly call her agamer Chio-chan is more of a gamer than her haha. So firstly, about the senpaiwho is older than everyone else around in the lab. She may have redeemed herselfby stepping into the love experiment the couple were practising on, talkingabout the couple's experiment misses, but otherwise you have literally a gamerscience student who can juggle between work and play more efficiently than anymachine around the lab haha. (And she has a childhood friend but we'll leavethat aside for now) She technically also proved that Yukimura gets aroused fromjust petting girls around the room.<a href="https://jisho.org/search/urayamashii" target="_blank">URAYAMASHII</a>haha please bro stop showing off how unsocial you are with females. On the otherhand, Himuro sure is pissed from not getting that love she intended to have byproving that literally just her would be enough to prove her love for him. Ohwell blame Ibarada for that then haha. The second half of the episode wasfocused on... love with cooking. Hey, if you need help understanding this oversignificant figures go get yourself a partner lol or just watch more romanceAnime tbh. So for those who have lived in a well like Yukimura, there is alegend that states that love cooked with passion and specifically love will makea dish taste much better. They should've tested this against cooking for someonewithout any emotions (say, cook for me) (haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>) and let Yukimura eat ittoo, but the couple actually forgot to remove the experiment control of cookingexperience as a factor to this test. So yeah, they stopped Yukimura from sciencecooking real quick lmao even I can't stand it. And as Himuro suggesting to testvarious ways to "inject love" into cooking (here's a secret it works best whenboth are cooking together haha don't tell Yukimura), and we kind of landed onthe psychological aspect. You know, from heart-shaped bentos to carefullydesigned dishes to even your grandmother's special... they all share a commontheme. And I swear in order to not get slapped by Himuro, Yukimura had to saythe one with that layer of love sauce all over it (haha sex joke) must tastebetter than the other one WHY THEY GOTTA SHOW RIPPED DUDES IN HERE haha. To endthis simple episode considering that there are complex topics mentioned in thisseries, is to talk about whoever is mentioning all the details ie. Kanade-chan.She is cute. I think I elaborated that real well over the past couple ofepisodes haha. But yeah, this lab is probably where she shines as she continuesher line of tsukkomi to the dumb senpais lol (fancy calling yourself a genius,Yukimura), gets used as reference material or experiment subjects (and I don'tmind tbh), and... gets tortured to read papers into the night. YUKIMURA YOUPIECE OF SHIT- Cya guys next week we should be on track by then haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m13vkwCbY2o/XjbMJMmIjgI/AAAAAAAA4UU/Q_No0LYYbEEK8V9ZjcYFBD6Kr43SZPjWQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi02_comparison.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This comparison is so different I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rLV3pVXL_DY/XjbMI-kARcI/AAAAAAAA4UQ/rDl-7jWg4PMURIzf3KDEp3KWkYPD8srJACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi02_dishes.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This comparison I can get around the left one is done by Kanade-chan            right?? lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri04) featuringSteel Lady Nanase... I guess we have to get through the love rival thing first,huh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yep, so rival whatever first. Hey, I think I'm staying, for thesenonsense in between. F**k the youkai, amirite??? *looks at the tree spirit* (Goaway from me please haha your comedic relief is here guys) So yeah, it has been2 years in th story, so let's let Kotoko update what happened between the two.They... they were dating. Yeah, it's not a lie, but it's not true either. Forthe ex who knows everything, she knows for starters that he wouldn't date such a(cute) girl anyways, as seen from the photos the guy had to take with the newgirl lol. And then, there's the shitting on each other. I'm so glad this isn't aTaiwanese drama where they quarrel for two episodes (worth 2 hours each btw)because I love this level of bickering all over the place even though we knowthey are both losers since one is the ex and the other isn't making the guyhappy anyways lmao. "If you like him you let him go", I say. Is that how I nevergot laid? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Moving on, let's talk about Nanase's story. Ignoring the factthat a voice actress with a rack is acting an Anime character with one too (hahaSumipe, please), story goes that (I know I said I got bored from the murder bythe lake but this one has tits, uh, I mean, is more interesting) Nanase rose asan idol picked up on the streets by an old geezer ugh (lol), she got her debutin TV which made her famous including giving us the audience a spectacularopening theme animation that no one will forget haha (I legit laughed out loudat the ice girl like opponent lmao) (And if you don't get the joke of why and Ilearnt this from one Jeff Dunham: it's the super normal ones around the superattractive one that makes the attractive one more appealing lol that opponentonly had dots for eyes) (Edit: It's a God, as seen from the manga, and she isliterally called washboard haha), she was great in front of the camera (well ofcourse Sumipe would, uh, I mean), and... she killed her dad. Wait, what? Hahafor someone who has everything it's hardly likely that she would kill her dad,so we know there's more to this. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> I shouldn't be building suspense heresince the Anime did it already, but it has probably got to do with her sister,in case you didn't realise. Because not long after hiding from the press andbeing asked about the father's death, she was killed by a steel beam. I use theword "killed" instead of "died" because... it's likely not an accident. I guesswe will know about that soon, but that's when Saki-san had to figure out herselfafter taking in all the clues from the police investigation department. Andthis, the God of Wisdom wants a piece of the action. To this, and since shecan't ask for her favour directly because she can't resist shitting on her again(Saki-san too but you get the idea lmao), so... cue the next idol of the seasonprobably, that Tree God Gen'ichirou. (Nanase has nothing on this guy; I assumehe does stand-up comedy? lmao) He asks for her help in place of Kotoko-chan andrequested a meetup to talk about it. You know, that eventuality where the policewould cooperate with the one citizen haha. But then, at the meeting place, someyoukai nearby told Kotoko that Steel Lady Nanase (the youkai) was around. And soshe went to discover.. it's Kuro-san fighting her!? So I guess next episode, weget to find out more from Kuro's perspective. I assume he has spent the weekinvestigating this out too. Hey Kotoko-chan may be cute but we have the smartguy here lol don't hit me Saki-san. The story is getting me down on my seatthough, no joke. I did not regret giving this Anime another chance where wefight monsters and shit on women lol I'm not misogynist btw I like tits hahawait what<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CEBnQnlCqK0/XjbY19i8HsI/AAAAAAAA4U0/d05-03oMRdMvkpL_uXYcM06mr-r2klGTQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri04_couple2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How you know you're having a good date lol that face<br />            (I'm going to look like this on blind dates soon, I tell you)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g1k4-YPtUNk/XjbY2NVBb4I/AAAAAAAA4U4/7BK1Pwv9VlM9c6LpCWcfL25wXQFcTHXBACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri04_food.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW I see good food<br />            (I like mostly fried stuff which I'm not eating now because meds            <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Theactual release out this week was <b>Waki Azumi's debut single</b> so congrats,but apart from the first song I legit cannot give you anything else, to behonest. I think my initial impressions were right it might be hard to give Ajujuthe right song to sing. Cute songs might be it for now though I await the nextwork to impress me further. I also revived my review on<b>Uso to Chameleon's new single</b> because heck I have to give the Anime nowand I'd rather give this opening theme song because at second listen... it ain'tbad. I mean, I must be tired from last month's dose of J-Rock lol noseriously.This weekend I came around finally to<b>Suzuki Aina's debut album</b>- wait, what? Yeah, this newbie is also gettingher singer debut apart from acting main role in Anime "Hatena Illusion". Hey,the music video was released in November last year, by the way. Goes to showthey just slotted this song in casually to make her have a good start in hersolo music career. Seriously, Suzuki Aina... you're just like them. LiSA orwhoever they are in the same subgenre. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ignoring that, what the heck iswith the excessive classical music is it like the music genre she's into? Butthen again I'll try to give a couple of songs if all goes well I think I give acouple. While searching for releases landing on my birthday because surprisesurprise it's on a Wenesday this year, I came across indie(?) band... let me gettheir name, yes <b>Humbreaders</b>, these guys. They aren't bad. So yeah, willbe reviewing their 1st full album since they started I think three years ago.Congrats, guys. You gettin' Klassic Note consent liao- oh this is notprestigious enough? Oh well haha<br /><br />Next week is idolism week in Klassic Note, ladies and gentlemen (lol) because wehave <b>Fuchigami Mai's new single</b> which I'll probably only give the onlytopic song for Valentine's Day (I mean, why not since the others aren't doingit), and the showdown between <b>Touyama Nao's new single</b> and<b>Minase Inori's new single</b>... you try to find the former in tweets andcompare with how many times I said I liked Inorin over the week, yes? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Don't mean to shit on your Naobou but they got Inorin a good song imo<br /><br />On a fantastic week of news we've not seen in months in Twitter (haha),<b>Q-MHz is on music subscription services</b> in which of course only AppleMusic Japan is of importance to me (I also paid my yearly membership fee ughshould do it in summer when currency is weak lol),<b>SHE'S is coming up with a new album</b> somehow after the success that is theEP from last December I guess, <b>VELTPUNCH's new album</b> production is donewhich means we will get news about release real soon which means it's this year,and to compliment that <b>SPECIAL OTHERS is back with another album</b> afterfive years of not releasing new stuff. Them in acoustic 2 years ago does notcount haha welcome to 2012 everyone where music (only) is king and alternativerock is awesome~!! The hype is real in this one haha the stars have aligned<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm done I'm tired. If I miss something I'll fix it at work lmao. Cya guysnext week then, and until then... I'm pretty sure you'll get two new posts bythen, mainly a new Klassic Note Review which should've been done last monthand... you know what it is. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Until next time then next week is going tobe great I want work to not screw this up please don't Wuhan virus you too<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
