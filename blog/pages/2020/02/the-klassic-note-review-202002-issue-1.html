New year, new release review that is delayed for about three weeks? Yeah you bet we're starting this year strong!<br />
<br />
Welcome guys, to the brand new Klassic Note Review of the year, where we kickstart this series off early with a single review just in the month of January! Man, this has got to be a record. Also, not because I prepared for this to celebrate the 5th year of reviewing songs and putting CDs on my shelf, but you know, I just happened to like another Anime theme song related single again. This time, I... may have gone full circle. How did this happen though? I guess we can talk about it.<br />

(I prefer close-ups considering she is kind of a cutie, but the magic-themed display on the Regular Edition cover is real cool too)<br />
<br />
Origin: If you wonder how it is a new singer again, you're not alone. Liyuu, in this case, is a Chinese cosplayer who can speak Japanese, which is why I said I may have come full circle in giving this single, by giving a Chinese since I left Chinese songs in the dust. Her debut in Japan in supplemented by the fact that this single is also for the opening theme song of Anime "Hatena Illusion", which, with professional Japanese music producers backing her up, may make this more appealing of a single than it should have. She's not the best singer out there in the Anime industry per se, but she can impress, and that's the kind of magic we are talking about here. Let's dive in further.<br />
<br />
(1) Magic Words<br />
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;">
"Chasing after, after seeing the traces of tears shining in the light</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
(Let me) catch, your voice</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
(Let it be, the) magic words only we know"</div>
</blockquote>
It's the Anime credit theme song, it's impressive at first listen when I watched the Anime, and it still hold up even after hearing it in full with the typically dreaded bridge part which was actually good, and this is considered a rarity, to be honest. Not only it has a catchy melody to remember by, the lyrics also bear resemblance to the Anime itself, talking about romance and magic, as if a maiden is falling in love. Production-wise I wouldn't say this technopop style is my thing, but at least it didn't get any worse, and it does make the song sound more appropriate to the Anime and does appeal more to the general audience, so I'm closing one eye on that. Otherwise, it's a song to like.<br />
Rating: 4 stars (Above Anime Average)<br />
<br />
(2) Mahou to Gum to Yuuki [Magic and Gum and Courage]<br />
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;">
"For (my) first love<br />
(I would like) a passport to convey (my) feelings<br />
Stretching into the pocket, and searching, (I) couldn't find anything"</div>
</blockquote>
As usual, this single'e deal-breaker is because of its B-side. This isn't exceptionally outstanding as an awesome song to be frank, but it easily left an impression, which is probably what made me decide to review this single in the first place. The style reminds me of various Anime artists that sing such melodies too, so that is already giving her an edge by following those examples. The melody is simple even up till the bridge part, the beats are good, and the lyrics once again, focusing on falling in love or more on the confession part, I guess. If this is how she confesses to someone I wish she'll do it in Japanese too, and I guess this song is it. The song is as cute as you can see her in.<br />
Rating: 4 stars (Simply Average)<br />
<br />
Conclusion: She's new, it might be her only music release in a while considering we're seeing an industry of such talent appear everywhere else in Japan, but she'll be someone to remember when you know of her origins. Still, she's sweet, the presentation of such a solo artist work can only get this perfect, and this is quite a prime example of it, in my opinion. Unless technopop is not your thing, give her a chance even if it's not for the Anime, and you will not be disappointed.<br />

It's not a crazily high budget as expected, so not surprisingly the inlet of the booklet isn't filled (when you open it up, where you see the section between the CD and the booklet) which is fine. The Regular Edition I had despite being a full on artist release (ie. showing off more Liyuu-san over the Anime, and now having an Anime Limited Edition release) did still provide an Anime back cover of Hatena-chan which is good, and the booklet is simple. It's no slack of a production here though, I would argue as this is the industry standard in Japan which already rivals many countries and their music releases.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D8_e5u5B4NQ/Xj5f5H--CLI/AAAAAAAA4fw/BeWEIhpT56EaX7g3dTwe9S8OQ69ARu4QwCEwYBhgL/s320/IMG_20200208_143327.jpg" width="240" /></div>
As for the special gift, I was stuck between two generic choices, between the artist herself and... her cosplaying, of course. She'a a cosplayer anyways, what makes you think that won't be a choice? It's her cosplaying Hatena-chan, and it looks real good, which made me kind of regret my choice to go for an artist based photo instead of an Anime one, but hey, first time getting from online store of Sofmap so that's new. Other choices I made include the <div class="popup">
<span class="normal">
Gamers
</span>
<span class="pop">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lantis.jp/_maintenance2/data/1912040101-Liyuu.jpg" />
</span></div> one which is literally the cosplay, with a full on set of a artist bromide, a badge and an Anime bromide (I know I am already regretting not choosing this) and <div class="popup">
<span class="normal">
Chara-Ani
</span>
<span class="pop">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lantis.jp/_maintenance2/data/19120406-Liyuu.jpg" />
</span></div> store which is a different variant of the <div class="popup">
<span class="normal">
Sofmap
</span>
<span class="pop">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lantis.jp/_maintenance2/data/19120404-Liyuu.jpg" />
</span></div> one which I got because I think Liyuu-san looks best in that, despite there being <div class="popup">
<span class="normal">
another artist outfit
</span>
<span class="pop">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lantis.jp/_maintenance2/data/1912040201-Liyuu.jpg" />
</span></div> amongst the designs.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
This is it for now. If there are anything I need to add on for example her profile for those interested, I'll do it later I guess. For now, I'll wrap this up so I can finish the one photobook review (the last, to be frank) before the sun sets which is unlikely but I'll try. I need the sunlight to take better photos haha Akarin~!! I know right Liyuu-san pales in comparison even having a circle for a face lol I'm sorry girl I'm into Japanese hehe cya soon<br />
<br />
P.S. Oh yeah, lyrics... yeah I'll do that too haha maybe tomorrow<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Klassic Note</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
