Dammit haha that'swhat happens when you have a working life now. (Audience: But you took workleave over the new year.) <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> MOVING ON!!<br /><br />On other news that is Klassic Note, I'm testing other ways of presenting Hall ofFame and statistics about the song awards, mainly hosting it instead of througha PDF document and including new categories but I'll need to finish thatdatabase integration soon to get more accurate data. Funny thing is, the newversion of Office didn't make this any easier haha I still have to redo thecharts to make it work my way <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span><br /><br />Okay, let's talk about entertainment, I guess. My mind is just filled withAnimal Crossing and that Nintendo Direct now I feel the urge to take work leaveor off just to play this on a Friday haha I'll think about it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    We're skipping <strike>Yumemi-chan</strike> Hatena this week (lol) because    it's your half-season recap episode. We'll come back to it next week.  </div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HanakoKun07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I spend every day cleaning (your) bathroom, a Cinderella whose prince never    comes" Man, why is Yashiro describing her reality more accurately with every    episode? lol  </div></blockquote>"I shouldn't be friends with Hanako-kun... because, he is already dead!" ManYashiro, you can't be friends with a dead person? Won't say too much of myfriendship with my grandmother but. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#HanakoKun07),we, uh, stumbled upon a confession, I suppose. Didn't expect this, but you know,Yashiro be a hopeless romantic she will take a ghost for a boyfriend lol. Okay,that might just be part of the episode, but probably still the best. The restmight be too deep in lore I don't even want to pick on it but we have to, solet's talk about it. But firstly, about Yashiro. Last week we got a good amountof flashback as to Hanako's past ie. him as a student named Amane, and heprobably died at some point. While killing someone though? That we might notknow, but Yashiro wants to know him more so that you know... actually, I don'tknow. I guess Yashiro is in it now, so she deserves to know. Problem is, to howto ask him for the truth. I guess that's hard in itself, so Minamoto (Kou) askedto make donuts with him, so to give that ghost some stuff to eat and make it upagain. Obviously, Kou is good at cooking (he told her how to mix using the bowl)and the ingredients were bought by the brother as mentioned by the brotherhimself who just kept quiet and be stuffed with donuts lol, but suffice it tosay Kou might be trying to be nice. Again, if it were the brother Hanakowould've eaten one and dropped dead haha didn't happen though. What DID happenwas one of the Mokke (those cute things) was... Man, that one Mokke... youtraitor!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, within a small community inside of a small community westill will have traitors, don't we? So yeah, that one just left without beingobserved? I mean, the older Minamoto is looking, to say the least. And whenthings go down he will strike, hopefully. And then, there's the confession.Abrupt, but I guess everyone will feel indifferent even if it is fromHanako-kun. Still, thanks to the donuts, Hanako met his evil self so to speak (Imean, we don't even know anything), mentioned about how he was killed by theother self, and then left. So this gives us a little more insight into the truthbehind the murder. Not much, but we can speculate on it now. From what I canthink, there can only be two ways, if we assume for now, that Hanako killedsomeone who looked just like him. Amane, I mean. Since so far we only know thateveryone can see the evil one as one who looks exactly like Hanako. So either(1) he killed a twin of himself ie. another person who then with rumours can berevived into its rather weak state as of now (and found a human friend), or (2)he killed his evil self. How he knew of this might be bad but considering heknows of a teacher who can see the future... maybe not impossible after all.Then, we now know about the bad guys in this Anime series. With Sakura thebroadcaster and probably servant to evil Hanako (as I would call him from nowuntil we know a name) who has been spreading all the rumours, and Natsuhiko whomight actually have powers to protect the girl ie. he's likely a Seven Wonderbecause any more powerful he would have already be dealt with even by Minamoto(Teru) in this school. The days went as normal as Sakura continues to spread newrumours through the broadcast room (which is the same voice you heard sinceepisode 1), and... something weird might happen if you tie your shoes at theschool entrance within the lockers. Minamoto (Kou) caught the suspect, butinstead of exorcising it he asked Hanako for advice and... decided to clear thespirit of its sins? I mean, if it's spawned from a rumour likely it doesn't havemuch to fulfil but man does it sound like a Japanese millennial with the talkabout porno lol. (Is this what it's like there? Haha) Oh, so that's what theywere talking about on Twitter about "<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/erobideo"  target="_blank"  >ero-video</a>" lmao next episode we get hardcore sex scene-!!! Yeah right haha cya for notsex scenes next week that spirit sounds like a gay lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mG2bCbfr4ts/XlHzX-K_R0I/AAAAAAAA5Vk/HM1YQM134XMkM_bcXOn_F6UjtdZgJF9pQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun07_yashiro5.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Oh so THIS was what they were talking about on Twitter about            ero-video lol not true but          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gC3RjKmIg_k/XlHzYxbsQnI/AAAAAAAA5Vo/uf5u_1m6L4knCfDAwR3dfvZZUHjni8g5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun07_couple4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is pretty wholesome, I must admit.

"Traffic safety? Was there a crash in your brain??" I wanted to make thejoke from the start tbh, but hey the story did it by itself haha good jobauthor<br />[TL:DR; Hanako is GAY!!!

My mind be like YUKIMURA    TRIGGERED and this show didn't disappoint haha  </div></blockquote>Is that what Kanade-chan's impression of a drinking party is like? You bet I'mon the same side as those nerds on this ie. zero experience lol oh it's just me?<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this f**ked up episode (#Rikekoi07) where NO ONE gets drunk Ipromise you (Aw, not even Kanade-chan?? But I wanna f-), only Yukimura is awakehaha I wonder why. And that's why like him I don't get myself drunk. Sadly he'sgoing to be the only guy standing on my side on this lol. And yeah, watchingeveryone else get wasted haha. Anyways, the party. It's not the kind Kanade-chanimagined, and like her, we get to see for the first time what it's like having a<a href="https://jisho.org/search/nomikai" target="_blank">nomikai</a> in IkedaLab. Well, in summary, everyone got drunk, but hey, they gotta set it up.Yukimura doesn't drink because he doesn't want to act dumber than he has to(lol, can't help but agree), Himuro needs to reach a tipping point before sheloses her composure as a woman and turns into a kid whose voice is probablyTen-chan's cutest voice acting yet haha, Torasuke literally goes back to hischildhood upon being drunk despite having crazy drink parties in the soccerclub, and I guess Ibarada can drink a lot before falling asleep since sheprobably bought the drinks lol. Man, it's a real relief you can see the senseidrunk and asleep in the background because with Kanade-chan and the sensei leftI wouldn't want anyone to imagine what might happen between the remainingcouple. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> *sees drunk Kanade* Oh well haha. Although unlikeYukimura maybe I would be interested in Kanade-chan's past Yukimura DON'T YOUDARE GET INTERESTED IN HER GO HUG YOUR HIMURO haha okay I'm done. (Kanade-chanthrow me around as much as you like just don't throw up on me after you drinklmao) Next up... a science-type Cinderella story?? WTF? I mean, I can interjectat this as many times as I want since Kanade-chan is not here lol, but man, canwe not? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So the guys thought it would be a great idea to find morereferences to prove love in science, but you know, asking for surveys might be alittle challenging. And thus, Ibarada and Kanade suggested fiction. I mean, wedo know some of the many stories out there are based on real life stories,probably written to a happier ending (unless you're Anime "Attack on Titan" or"Babylon" lol FUCK YOU MAGASE haha) to spice things up for a romance story soprobably not accurate already, so I SWEAR this is a filler portion of the Animewhere the Anime scriptwriters and producers alike start thinking of how toscience-type all fiction stories as much as they can lol. It's more than justmildly irritating considering I don't even know the Kaguya-hime story wellenough (I should go watch the Studio Ghibli version like I told myself yearsago), so I can only relate with the Cinderella one which is nothing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Imean, I legit thought "conservation of mass" is that boob joke I heard of beforebut, uh, nuclear reactions are funnier haha. They even threw in an omake just sothey can write another science-type fiction story- They should just try thisstyle on modern stories they can't even use science in whatever century thestories were from lol. I had a great laugh in this episode though, although Iwould argue even Kanade-chan kind of got tired of doing the<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a> andthis is why I'd rather get drunk with the lot of them in a drinking party hahabecause I rather not end up talking about the largest prime number with Yukimuralol. (Hey,<a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number"  target="_blank"  >still accurate as of the episode</a>) Next episode... I guess we're right on track to finding proof for loveinstead of being about (0.2335 +/- 0.001)mm off track since 23.456 days agorounded up lol I'm done being smart for the week<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6_JKgiS5g-U/XlIfKSvUV3I/AAAAAAAA5WE/99ayM4S178kZO8l6hXzwGpACFRIja_BDACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi07_himuro3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Come to me Himuro I'll buy your drinks AND kiss the shit out of you            haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oCXPtz7T1ss/XlIfKQfvQsI/AAAAAAAA5WI/q-aQFtnd0Vw5eZCcbPJZBvvwN3w1Q3N7wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi07_kanade2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            My opinion of this episode as with every episode lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Okay Kotoko-chan your boy hardly knew that    woman lol maybe he did touch them during the fight haha we don't know  </div></blockquote>Oh yeah Terada I almost forgot you sacrificed for the greater good but seriouslyman, rest in peace. In this probably mellow new episode (#KyokouSuiri07)Saki-san can you not lie to your own police? But then again haha she can'treally put the alibi as "I was visiting the scene where Steel Lady Nanase died",huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, remembering that this is still reality where your can't seeany youkai, Saki-san can't really tell the police who are investigating now thatTerada was killed... by a ghost. I mean, tell me that and I probably won't evenbelieve it even though I'm watching two youkai shows this season haha. And so,after a day of rumours and speculation, the trio had to sit down and think of asolution as soon as possible. Kotoko might not be wrong in thinking that it'llonly get worse since the police will not be able to find evidence of someonegetting killed and even if they release such information then it'll onlysolidify Nanase's position of being culprit within the online community whichwill infinitely make her stronger, thus going down a route with no return.Eventually, Kuro-san did suggest something that made Kotoko-chan click, so weshall see what happens next episode, I guess. Meanwhile, the guys are preparingfor the onset where Nanase might strike at any time, killing more humans in theprocess and strengthening her existence as a youkai. If you really want to guesswhat Kuro suggested to Kotoko-chan about having a bunch of people involved inthe incidents involving Nanase ie. a group of people behind such stuff, it mighttake a lot more maintenance to keep this truth alive, and yeah, Kuro-san isprobably going to die a lot more times than he may have to to turn the tidesaround every corner in the future. Or he can just fight Nanase every night andnot sleep lol this is his part-time job now. And since it'll take anotherepisode or two before we can conclude this, so next week... I guess we'll betalking about this Rikka whom we have no idea is yet, as far as it's mentionedas Kuro's cousin. I mean, we gotta believe she's also a victim of thefuture-predicting experiments of the family right? Just like Kotoko mentioned?No one said she was dead even though she was on a hospital bed, yes? We shallsee then, I guess. If they have to talk about it like this then it's not justKuro who can predict the future now, to be honest. I don't really have the moodfor mystery-solving but this show got me though. Haha Kotoko-chan too but weonly talk about her fantasies off season, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To end this, I wouldlike to emphasise on what the guys have been predicting even without resortingto any methods, how Nanase's popularity would increase over time. Consideringnow, and if she continues to kill and people believe it was her doing, thenpeople will be scared of her. However, despite being scared of her it's alsobelieving in her existence (I mean, I have to believe she exists to be scared ofit, yes?), so this fever will never subside. However, people will eventually notbelieve in her existence in resistance to such a reality and also due to fear,which will comparatively make her weaker in power over time. Sadly, this is overa very long time, and many would have to be sacrificed for that eventuality tohappen. To be frank I thought Saki-san would be a great scapegoat for all thishaha think about it I shall stop here<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-27Z2st6AeVw/XlIs3FzolHI/AAAAAAAA5W8/OdrOx4xPqcIfaVQtT-L2QaQ69c8MOpNXQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri07_ayakashi.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Which is cuter?

"Did an immortal just talk to me about health?" Wow lol this is such aninside joke for this Anime I can't even<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Hey it's birthday week! So let's see what we've got for me.<b>Humbreader's 1st album</b> is... under TOYS FACTORY so we get nothing somehowfor an indie band so sadded already, but not like the impression got better withthe number of music videos I hear online and... am not impressed with so I guesswe'll review this again as and when it appears.<b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</b> is probably the focus of the week and Iwould argue, THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT here in Klassic Note, as it's great of asong and also a song for me to think about, sort of like a wake up call. Don'task me if I gave the amazarashi cover B-side because I didn't give it 4 yearsago I won't suddenly do this now lol. <b>yanaginagi's new single</b> had adisappointing topic song thanks to one Kitagawa who writes Anime theme songs forhe, but the B-side which is written by her is more of my taste. Again, half thereason why she's a Collection Artist today. The other half is her brush inchance of good Anime theme songs haha<br /><br />Next week I might spend more time going through<b>Numakura Manami's best album</b> in which I haven't because I just gave thenew and last song from last week, and we're giving Anime "Hanako-kun" themesongs with <b>Jibaku Shounen Band's single</b> which is basically two singers(one of which we know from Anime "Tada-kun" who is basically a composer himself,Oonishi Masayoshi) and a producer behind the scenes of which I would say itisn't great from the music video online now, and<b>Kitou Akari's 2nd single</b> which... man did we not get much out of thetopic song and again, placing the Anime theme song on B-side isn't making theending theme any better in my opinion.We shall see about it then. I'll end upgiving Akarin more songs than I want anyways haha<br /><br />On news from the Internet and beyond mainly Twitter,<b>Aimer's new single</b> slated for end March is... probably worse than theClariS and TrySail theme songs somehow so I might just skip it,<b>SHE'S new music video</b> for their upcoming album ain't bad it is rathermellow in tone but I hope that is not it for their album overall haha it's stillgood though, and <b>UNLIMITS is releasing a live event single</b> on an upcomingevent in March which I'll probably not get to hear, but good to know they mightbe back for new songs and that'll get me hype for them sooner than later.<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new music video</b> for their upcoming album is... okay,but not something I like, <b>SID's new music video</b> for their upcoming singlenext month is probably indicative of their uprising again despite the likelyoutdated style so I hope they try to keep up, and<b>sphere's radio livestream</b> just in the evening hours ago announced adocumentary Blu-Ray from their 10th year anniversary live event from last week,and yes Kotobuki Minako made it official with her departure for furthereducation as a way to (selfishly, lol) do something for herself. It makes me sadto see you go for a year, Mina-chan, but you can treat yourself.<strike>We got the newbies to cover you anyway</strike>&nbsp;No one can replaceyou my dear so please come back soon hehe<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm done for the week. Is is just me or can I not see my mouse on the PC with mymonitor brightness down? Maybe that's why, but I also don't want to just turn upthe brightness and blind my eyes for the long term to be honest, but enlargingthe cursor or changing it to one of the other presets in Windows 10 isn'thelping much it doesn't work in games. Then again my mouse still has scrollingproblems and I can't get used to changing wallpapers in a slideshow because Ican't choose a couple and have to choose a folder now... Windows 10 sucks fiveyear into beta haha. Cya guys next time, and until then... I might have decidedon whether to pre-load the Animal Crossing game and take time off to play thishaha or maybe I should do a photobook omake now that Hanazawa Kana is releasinga new one with her almost half-naked?? Haha swimsuits or it doesn't countKana-chan lol I probably won't but if my friend wants to gift it who knows? Hehebye for now<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
