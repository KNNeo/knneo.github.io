Just a head's up, I'm not attached yet, so noplans at all, from Friday to the weekend. Or else, how do you think I have timeto watch Anime? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I want to stop shitting on myself but I can't I need tofeel the burn that is the flirting of others on other people who are not me haha<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span><br /><br />On the other hand, I'm having good luck on getting laid (lol) in the THREE girlgames I'm playing thus far haha that's the problem I guess. Aside from gettinganything from event gacha in DOAXVV (but even then I've been getting SSRs daily)I've gotten good streak from Alternative Girls (couple a love song with the newevent characters, it's perfect) and Kirara Phantasia (Koufuku Graffiti joins thepublisher based RPG) which I've lovingly posted in my Twitter profile inJapanese so be sure to share those or otherwise you'll have bad luck on romanceall year around- Isn't that how they jinx you on your Facebook wall now? Hahajust trying to get more likes lol let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "No, she (Ema-san) tried to forcibly undress me" Well well maybe that'll be    a good omake episode haha just joking Yumemi  </div></blockquote>I think I just realised something: There might not be any more action in thisseries because the author may not have lived long enough to write them. RIPauthor, by the way; it's still a good story otherwise I wouldn't be here. But inthis new episode of family issues lol (#HatenaIllusion06), we... okay there issome action haha is it though? I feel like I've been watching a porno this weeklmao okay let's talk story first. Remember last week Mariah-san talked to Hatenaover the mirror INSIDE of the mansion? Hey, you still don't think your<strike>aunt</strike> mother's sister is not evil? Anyways, that gullible girlmet up with the woman, and she told the girl that the one in the gallery we haveseen a couple of episodes ago is a real thing. Even though that's all theinformation we got, Mariah wanted Hatena to retrieve it for her, but the girldidn't even question the validity of this mission. I mean, it could all be atrap, girl, why would you promise such a thing like that? And so she did it(ugh), because apparently she thinks the mother won't be coming back for thetime being and wants her back earlier?? Oh you dumb b*tch REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENEDIN EPISODE THREE??? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> I can't even trust Jeeves now and you cantrust Mariah? Good on you, Hatena. Anyways, ignoring middle schooler commonsense lol, she went to scout with the other middle schoolers in the gallery andthinking that no one will notice them in such a disguise, but yeah, didn't takemuch for the fat b*tch (haha, okay I'll call her by name) to know of herpresence, and you know, ambush her the night someone wants to come steal herArtifact... okay, we'll talk about how it's actually hers later, but first,Yumemi. She still doesn't want to go to school, and in an effort to learn how tocontrol her powers, Ema-san has witnessed a couple of things that would not havehappened to this<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hikikomori" target="_blank">hikikomori</a> ifnot for Makoto, that is to go bath willingly, and go outside of the house. Yeah,that's me in a nutshell lol. But it's also because they went to the nearbytemple to meditate and learn to control her powers that the two met the otherkids, who of course, told them about Hatena's not plans because we don't need toknow them to know that Hatena is dumb enough to do this stuff alone. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Again, no prior training from the mother, as far as we know. Hatena is a reallife risk taker, this girl. Haha anyways, Hatena gets caught, and it's notbecause she can't fight a fat bi- Okay, Tominozawa. It's not just becauseTominozawa is powerful, but hey, it's a trap. What can I say? So yeah, there's alot of suggestive content in this haha, but suffice it to say, she owns that oneArtifact somehow (probably learnt it from the family itself, whoever taught herit), and manages to capture Hatena with it, forcing her to hand over Muff-kun toher or else she would likely die of a heat stroke haha I thought that was anarmy thing. I mean, surprisingly for a 12-year-old Hatena can last this longbefore the others can prepare for an infiltration with somehow Yumemi comingalong for the ride for the first time, and disabling Tominozawa off control ofher Artifact within seconds, thanks to Makoto, of course. That's it, actually.Things to talk about probably are why (1) this is likely going to be familyrelated problems for a good amount of time because we still technically letMariah go because she thought this will be a good test for a kid who doesn'teven know how to plan for a heist like her mother lol, (2) how straightforwardthe action is in this series which is passable to say the least, and last butnot least (3) what Ema-san is wearing that is actually an Artifact which willexplain how she can be so physically formidable up till now. Hey, learning newstuff from this series every week, as they say. What's for next week though?Well, at least we'll get to see Yumemi at school with underwear haha why makethese jokes<br />[Okay we can't really show the porno part lol so here are some cleaner oneshaha]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sC04xXwmGoA/Xki4yYwENPI/AAAAAAAA5M0/i-lt9zdYsrwlu4IRBse2h5ilSl64OdK0QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion06_ema1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW they say they gonna tie her up and make her hot haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-keEW6CNcMWc/Xki4ybCszUI/AAAAAAAA5Mw/UgkGdvym0jwxvU8UI8aZcK3ge2xWbXOLACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion06_yumemi4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Again, I need a Yumemi superhero side story series real bad Anime            production do something about this          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "I think nee-san has trouble dealing with me" NO Yumemi-chan Hatena hastrouble dealing with herself haha YOU'RE 12 GODDAMMIT THINK LIKE A GROWN UPlol<br />P.P.S. Wow that's some detail in animation that's some dried lips if I've everseen it also Hatena-chan is technically hot right now haha okay<br />[Okay someone make a porno where Ema-san's Artifact which is her maid uniform isgoing to rape her within hahahahaha fap fap fap]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HanakoKun06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "If Hanako's book is there, I would like to read it..." And then inside it's    just all the lewd things he did in school? Ooo boy this gonna be a good    episode haha  </div></blockquote>Haha I like how the future for Yashiro is till "we're not going out togetherbecause your legs are too fat" lol hey you gotta slim those legs down girlotherwise no guys will want you. In this surreal episode (#HanakoKun06) weventure into the 4PM library, as I would like to call it differently from thesubtitles because those things are dumb haha then why am I watching it. Anyways,we did more than venture into another apparition's world, so let's talk allabout it. Firstly, it was peaceful. Yashiro just decided to go into the libraryat four with Minamoto because she's worried about going alone also Minamotocould learn a thing or two of Hanako's weakness haha, but yeah, they went inwithout much trouble. Yashiro accidentally read a red page of the book which Iassume all futures should be red since one shouldn't be knowing of the futuresof anyone even themselves, so... well it wasn't that interesting anyway forYashiro haha. (Although I would argue besides knowing of Seven Wonders thatfirst date though we gotta see in this adaptation hehe I just want to see it)The monster in the world which came in and looked like the person in whicheverbook you read appeared but was quickly dealt with by Hanako since... he knowsthe Fifth Wonder of the school. I mean, he knows all seven of them includinghimself but yeah, took a while for introductions haha. And so they gatheredbecause Hanako believes someone is behind all this rumour spreading and makingthings up for their own benefit, so he as the boss decides to disband the SevenWonders so we can know who's the culprit. I mean, it's literally anyone whodoesn't cooperate haha. So, that's the peaceful part, unless you want to countthe embarrassing stuff the trio mentioned which... okay Yashiro wins haha andshe scored a 3 btw the others are not even graded lol. Next, is the story ingeneral not including Hanako's story. Basically what Hanako has described, buthe dictates who gets to live in this school as an apparition, I assume. And tothat, he probably should know about the other Wonders in the school, includingthe culprit who has somehow, also recruited a human assistant to falsify somerumours to their advantage? Haha this one we will not know for now. And the bestthing is it... might be a splitting image of Hanako himself. Not going toquestion this further considering we don't know much yet (getting yin yang dejavu here though), so let's talk about what we actually know now we're halfwaythrough the series, is Hanako's past. Since the youkai in question this week isan actual teacher in school, and we kind of have to destroy that Yorishiro thingwhich I would just argue is like an appointment letter for being a Wonder inthis premises lol, the teacher chose to only let Yashiro do the job ofdestroying it. Why? And how Hanako-kun would have accepted this conciliatoryrequest without much objection? Well first, it was peaceful, mind you. Probablybecause they know each other. Then, it's the story behind the Yorishiro, becausewhoever destroyed it has to watch all of it, just like that fox one from twoweeks ago. So you think the sensei is going to let his boss (not true, but yeah)see all his secrets?? Haha, read on for answers, by the way. Story goes... majorspoiler alert from here on because it's about time, it was when Hanako wasalive. Back then, he was a student. Obvious enough, but he was the teacher'sstudent. So you can kind of guess how old this story might be already. And asshared by the teacher... he knew all about the kid. This one might have lacked alot of explaining, because how would anyone have access to such foretellingbooks is in the first place itself a mystery, but suffice it to say, he knewabout Hanako. All the way. Yahsiro wished she knew that much about him. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Well, they know about the donuts thing so I guess there was development haha.Anyways, story goes that it was around the time of the moon landing, and Hanakosomehow got his hands on a moon stone from the orbiting satellite itself? Highlyunlikely story, but this kid the teacher taught had plans for the future. He wasobsessed with science and astronomy, and probably would be a teacher himselfteaching at this very school in the future which is now. But... You know. Imean, you should've noticed, he's dead. So... how? What happened? The teachermay have told us the origins, but left us with the empty space in between as hetells the story to complete Yashiro's thoughts after seeing the Yorishiro.Hmm... I don't know what to make of it either, because seriously? We still don'tknow much. From the start and specifically from Minamoto, we only know he was amurderer, and he killed someone (probably heard this from the brother), and thushis weapon as a knife. And we now know that his future has been changed by thesensei at some point, to shorten his life. That's all we know though, by theway. I guess we will know sooner or later, since the future episodes areprobably going to be narrowing down the suspects and getting to that girl whochatted up to Yashiro last episode at some point. What might be their impendingfate though? From what we have seen so far? It might not be pretty. No really,Hanako's past is for sure, not a happy one. Hey, at least Yashiro is cuteamirite?? Haha I'll take sex jokes too lol bye<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q_D7CGxnPE4/XkjGnwEKHII/AAAAAAAA5NM/xfZ49PcqXWkgGHPcnkj9Jao8HPRJd0u5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun06_hug.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Find yourself someone who can hug you like how Hanako hugs Yashiro            haha happy Valentine's Day          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dqV_wBaFrBY/XkjGnr5HKXI/AAAAAAAA5NI/3Udzdzi-rfYMW4TqLV2I4co3MqcT_oeOwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun06_peek.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW there's has a ladder holding scene and I can't look lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Haha sorry gotta make a period joke here<br />[I hope I haven't read the book for this series (not from the library, butliterally the manga lol) to say this, but I feel serious Assassination Classroomvibes from this story of Hanako. Really, everything that did not make senseslowly making sense... I want to see this replace that as the best build-up toan origin story haha]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoi06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;">      Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita.</span    >  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "When people are in the dark, they start thinking of naughty things-" Remind    me to not be in the dark with anyone else besides myself haha  </div></blockquote>"I thought you loved me!" Yeah not when you're measuring whatever angle we'rekissing at!! In this "hurry up and kiss already" episode (#RikeKoi06) which I'vesaid probably since episode 1 lol, we finally get back on track to watchingepisodes in sequence haha. That, and kissing. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yeah, it's going to be awhole episode on kissing, so I hope you're ready for... scientific analysis!!Yes, what do you think this show was, your usual romance Anime?? Hah, we don'tneed <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">riajuu</a> herelol. Anyways, analysis first. (Somehow this sounds like my job but I'm onlydoing programming which is a joke compared to this haha) Yukimura and Himurogotta determine how to kiss, because some Ibarada decided they should do it. So,this is going to be theory heavy, so I'm going to skip all that, because besideshaving the most exciting episode on the line thus far, this... this might be themost equation heavy episode we have seen yet thanks Kuma for going through thesewith us is this what it feels like to learn math with Mocho?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways,the five criteria for mood for kissing in terms of location can be summarised byinverted charts and what we call... I need to dig up my textbooks to rememberthis, where you have to chart based on conditions (Edit: Piecewise functions),and of course through knowledge of graphing equations will get you the stuffthat these scientists are real good that, but that's just on the surface. Sincewe're talking about kissing, we also should talk about the quality of the kiss?I guess not since most of them can't do it on the lips (I mean), but even then,we'll need a control of kissing someone who is not Himuro so then Yukimura justgo kiss a slut- Okay no one will do this with this nerd lol. Even so, they hadto do experiments between themselves as unwilling as they are, and... I think wegot most of the 15 pairs to do this experiment as we mentioned from last episodelol okay maybe not the sensei, so lesser. Many are dumb, some are weird, someare breaking the fourth wall saying Ikeda lab is weird lol, some may have peoplelike Ibarada looking at the couple from the nearby stairs haha yes she probablywas there when it's Kousuke vs Yukimura, and some are heartbeat racing like howIbarada and Yukimura ran around the rooftop for 5 minutes haha. And then, wereached the end. If you are expecting a perfect ending then this would be thelast episode already haha. Of course we're going to talk about the last one in amore detailed manner, yes? So, Yukimura is at the location, Himuro walks in,they get to stare at each other for a <i>generous</i> 30 seconds lol, the sunsetis beautiful, the place is quiet without anyone interfering them... IT'S TIME TOKISS BABY!! Happy Valentine's Day, by the way. Haha I gotta get over this jokebecause... they didn't get it. That mood value all went crashing down which wehoped that helicopter flying above them would too (lol no jinxing in this blogplease), pretty much going against all they have set up for, but in the end,Himuro got desperate. I mean, if I had someone who I want to kiss with and hasbeen playing around for weeks you think I'll care if the building staff and mylab mates AND my lab professor is looking?? Okay, Yukimura kind of cares, so heend up just kissing her hair. Cheh, boring. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay I gotta admit the endquote from Yukimura is as cool as he will get haha "I'll kiss you with thehighest mood value" that might be too cool even for him lmao. The results? Imean, and that's why you shouldn't test heartbeat rates only remember when twopeople were running around the rooftop?

"It's the same action what's the difference?" "Because it's overwhelmedwith muscles?" Haha this show in a nutshell<br />P.P.S. I mean, from a logical standpoint, there isn't anything else to do in thesilence between a male and female, right? So why not kiss- Haha if that's thedefinition I would have been laid a long time ago haha<br />[FYI the hardest I've laughed this episode is if you remember from thebeginning, but when the sensei appeared at the last experiment and Yukimurasaying "abundance of muscle" lmao]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KyokouSuiri06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kyokou Suiri</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "If it's possible, I'm going to grab a future where it's okay for me to    break up with you (Kotoko)" ahahahahaha Kuro-san I get you bro I'll do the    opposite btw  </div></blockquote>Yeah, so just in case you wonder, the Japanese title is "<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/kyokou"  target="_blank"  >kyokou</a><a href="https://jisho.org/search/suiri" target="_blank">suiri</a>" ie. fictionreasoning, and I think it's pretty well explained with this new episode(#KyokouSuiri06), amongst many other things that were explained. Man, this isliterally episode 2 all over again, huh. An adequate title for this seriesthough, I would admit. So, to clarify what we have been talking thus far. Let'stalk about what we are NOT going to do to resolve this crisis of Steel LadyNanase. Firstly, we are NOT going to close the wiki page. No, it will neverwork. Doing it will only trigger a circle of influence that will probably goagainst the government or police on, in this case, the entertainment industry,so it will never work. Second, we are NOT going to just override the forums withanother rumour to belittle Nanase's rumour which is currently making her strongas heck to the extent of being immortal. Since people can believe whatever theywant, it will be hard to talk about what is right, and even if it stems from thetruth it will not be able to work as convincingly as like, a media scoop wherethings are exaggerated and click baits are made so websites can earn some shitlevel ad money lol #RealityCheck for a bit haha. Lastly, we are NOT going tojust come up with a story and hope that it works. Even if it's the mostconvincing story out there, as Saki-san said, it might not be able to movepeople around that easily. And in contrast if people still fall back on theNanase rumour of her ghost being around, then we are going to be even morescrewed by that point. So, according to Kotoko-chan since Saki-san can't reallydo much besides providing investigation information from the police, we aregoing to come up with a rumour to show the other side of Nanase's death which isaccidental death bordering suicide, and then make the rumour believable bymaking something happen. You might wonder how that "make something happen" phasecan work, and that's why we have Kuro-san. Remember he ate some weird kudan meatand can predict the future? He's like "I'm going to die for you any amount oftimes" to get rid of Nanase haha that's literally a quote from him lol if youneed a Valentine's Day quote there you go lmao. As sad as it sounds, it's alsonot that easy. Not only because you can die from doing it, but the doing processis rough. Instead of picking an ending or seeing one of the endings happen intypical foretelling powers (I assume), a kudan (in this series) actually choosesone and condenses it by removing all the other possibilities of futuresavailable. So, one can say "you'll get a good harvest this year" and get rid ofall the other ones like "there's a flood" or "yield is low" or whatever inbetween. By saying that, of course, one has to die for it. Since Kuro-san iskind of a mixed breed, his "prediction" is not absolute, and he can't choosejust any, but just the most likely one. So yeah, observer's perspective, Iguess. Even so, that'll make making a rumour happen a lot easier as long as westay close to the future as viewed by Kuro-san. Even then, it'll take a lot ofeffort to even let Kuro-san make that likely ending a reality, because he howhas to condense the endings together into one confirmed outcome. As fun as thissounds, seems like the hard part if still thinking of a good enough rumour forpeople - especially the ones from the forums - to believe. That, and no wonderKotoko-chan is the God of Wisdom. I mean, she managed to convince the oneserpent God to believe her story about the one murder and corpse thrown in tothe river, so... I guess she's smart haha hey she got that university acceptancethough. (The serpent was scared of Kuro-san, we know that already haha but) Whatwill happen next, we don't know. But we know that this will have to happenfaster than ever because... we got our first victim, guys. (Not coronavirusjoke) So that's going to be a problem. Aw man RIP Tereda you will be missed hahaman have I gotten bored of deaths since I've seen a couple dozen of them inAnime "Babylon" lol but still.

RIP btw]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week was quite a week in Klassic Note, so let's talk about it.<b>SCANDAL's new album</b> is not going to restore my already weak confidence intheir music, but then again the many topic songs they had over the past fewyears aren't bad, so I decided to give as many as I can. Again, I'm still intothe J-Rock part of them; the Pop part I'm not too keen. I guess this is the "Ijust need to like one of your many styles to give you" kind of judgement then.<b>yucat's latest mini-album</b> released last year is... passable at best, as Ican't identify with any refreshing styles and/or melodies from the releaseitself besides hearing steampunk style music, and that might get boring if shegoes on this direction. I remember Dr.Code so well, and that is just LIT haha.<b>SpecialThanks are back</b> after keeping quiet for some time with a slew ofmonthly new songs (still going on this month, for Valentine's), and hopefullywe'll reach a new album that I can give formally. After some time, I decided togive <b>Miyano Mamoru's new single</b> a chance hoping to give male idolism achance in Klassic Note... those Kuroshitsuji character songs featuring OnoDaisuke were better haha. And yes, if you haven't noticed, Nu-chan wasn'tmentioned here, so that will be reviewed next week.<br /><br />Talking about next week which is in my opinion, THE BEST WEEK mainly because mybirthday is right smack on release day, we're still giving indie band<b>Humbreader's 1st album</b> a listen consdering I can give at least one songwhich I heard last month, <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</b> for Anime isalready winning whatever is mentioned in this paragraph, and<b>yanaginagi's new single</b> is going to be for obligation purposesconsidering from the preview it isn't great. Not even for an emotional song. Andyes, <b>Numakura Manami's best album</b> will be reviewed to give her lastchance of leaving more of an impression on Klassic Note. Music subscriptionservices did not help her appear on time so I can give this last week, to behonest. I think this delay will continue to happen, hopefully not as bad asAimer's because her's is only releasing the latest release on a new release.Yeah, I found that out somehow.<br /><br />In the news from the Internet Twitter and beyond,<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES revealed their new album details</b> including a newtopic song music video which is dope I guess,<b>FLOWER FLOWER is releasing a new album</b> due March with a new music videopreview I can't get into somehow, and<b>nano.RIPE is going to release a new single</b> for Anime "Shokugeki no Souma"once again since last year which I'll probably not listen somehow. Man, thefuture is bleak haha we know the topic songs are a farce to the awesome songsinside those releases. Come on, ask my B-side Survey for evidence that topicsongs don't matter. Music videos are a distraction man I wished I wrote thatpost I've reserved for this for weeks to prove my point.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay we are done. Still thinking of whether to write that survey down from KitouAkari's 1st photobook, but I'll probably not do so due to my lack of confidencein... everything. I mean, I know the stamp is cheap probably a few bucks, but Irather treat myself to a cup of Starbucks just joking Akarin you come toSingapore I'll treat you to some bubble tea haha go see my review again to seecleavage hehe. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I should find sometime to do the stuff I want. They don't earn money but I can make myself happydoing things I want on my day. Until next time, I guess. Maybe I should continuewriting APoL before I die of the new coronavirus haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
