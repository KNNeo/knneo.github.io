Happy Valentine's Day, everyone. Just a head's up, I'm not attached yet, so no
plans at all, from Friday to the weekend. Or else, how do you think I have time
to watch Anime? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I want to stop shitting on myself but I can't I need to
feel the burn that is the flirting of others on other people who are not me haha
<span title="*sigh*">😩</span><br />
<br />
On the other hand, I'm having good luck on getting laid (lol) in the THREE girl
games I'm playing thus far haha that's the problem I guess. Aside from getting
anything from event gacha in DOAXVV (but even then I've been getting SSRs daily)
I've gotten good streak from Alternative Girls (couple a love song with the new
event characters, it's perfect) and Kirara Phantasia (Koufuku Graffiti joins the
publisher based RPG) which I've lovingly posted in my Twitter profile in
Japanese so be sure to share those or otherwise you'll have bad luck on romance
all year around- Isn't that how they jinx you on your Facebook wall now? Haha
just trying to get more likes lol let's start<br />

I think I just realised something: There might not be any more action in this
series because the author may not have lived long enough to write them. RIP
author, by the way; it's still a good story otherwise I wouldn't be here. But in
this new episode of family issues lol (#HatenaIllusion06), we... okay there is
some action haha is it though? I feel like I've been watching a porno this week
lmao okay let's talk story first. Remember last week Mariah-san talked to Hatena
over the mirror INSIDE of the mansion? Hey, you still don't think your
<strike>aunt</strike> mother's sister is not evil? Anyways, that gullible girl
met up with the woman, and she told the girl that the one in the gallery we have
seen a couple of episodes ago is a real thing. Even though that's all the
information we got, Mariah wanted Hatena to retrieve it for her, but the girl
didn't even question the validity of this mission. I mean, it could all be a
trap, girl, why would you promise such a thing like that? And so she did it
(ugh), because apparently she thinks the mother won't be coming back for the
time being and wants her back earlier?? Oh you dumb b*tch REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
IN EPISODE THREE??? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> I can't even trust Jeeves now and you can
trust Mariah? Good on you, Hatena. Anyways, ignoring middle schooler common
sense lol, she went to scout with the other middle schoolers in the gallery and
thinking that no one will notice them in such a disguise, but yeah, didn't take
much for the fat b*tch (haha, okay I'll call her by name) to know of her
presence, and you know, ambush her the night someone wants to come steal her
Artifact... okay, we'll talk about how it's actually hers later, but first,
Yumemi. She still doesn't want to go to school, and in an effort to learn how to
control her powers, Ema-san has witnessed a couple of things that would not have
happened to this
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hikikomori" target="_blank">hikikomori</a> if
not for Makoto, that is to go bath willingly, and go outside of the house. Yeah,
that's me in a nutshell lol. But it's also because they went to the nearby
temple to meditate and learn to control her powers that the two met the other
kids, who of course, told them about Hatena's not plans because we don't need to
know them to know that Hatena is dumb enough to do this stuff alone. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
Again, no prior training from the mother, as far as we know. Hatena is a real
life risk taker, this girl. Haha anyways, Hatena gets caught, and it's not
because she can't fight a fat bi- Okay, Tominozawa. It's not just because
Tominozawa is powerful, but hey, it's a trap. What can I say? So yeah, there's a
lot of suggestive content in this haha, but suffice it to say, she owns that one
Artifact somehow (probably learnt it from the family itself, whoever taught her
it), and manages to capture Hatena with it, forcing her to hand over Muff-kun to
her or else she would likely die of a heat stroke haha I thought that was an
army thing. I mean, surprisingly for a 12-year-old Hatena can last this long
before the others can prepare for an infiltration with somehow Yumemi coming
along for the ride for the first time, and disabling Tominozawa off control of
her Artifact within seconds, thanks to Makoto, of course. That's it, actually.
Things to talk about probably are why (1) this is likely going to be family
related problems for a good amount of time because we still technically let
Mariah go because she thought this will be a good test for a kid who doesn't
even know how to plan for a heist like her mother lol, (2) how straightforward
the action is in this series which is passable to say the least, and last but
not least (3) what Ema-san is wearing that is actually an Artifact which will
explain how she can be so physically formidable up till now. Hey, learning new
stuff from this series every week, as they say. What's for next week though?
Well, at least we'll get to see Yumemi at school with underwear haha why make
these jokes<br />
[Okay we can't really show the porno part lol so here are some cleaner ones
haha]<br />

Haha I like how the future for Yashiro is till "we're not going out together
because your legs are too fat" lol hey you gotta slim those legs down girl
otherwise no guys will want you. In this surreal episode (#HanakoKun06) we
venture into the 4PM library, as I would like to call it differently from the
subtitles because those things are dumb haha then why am I watching it. Anyways,
we did more than venture into another apparition's world, so let's talk all
about it. Firstly, it was peaceful. Yashiro just decided to go into the library
at four with Minamoto because she's worried about going alone also Minamoto
could learn a thing or two of Hanako's weakness haha, but yeah, they went in
without much trouble. Yashiro accidentally read a red page of the book which I
assume all futures should be red since one shouldn't be knowing of the futures
of anyone even themselves, so... well it wasn't that interesting anyway for
Yashiro haha. (Although I would argue besides knowing of Seven Wonders that
first date though we gotta see in this adaptation hehe I just want to see it)
The monster in the world which came in and looked like the person in whichever
book you read appeared but was quickly dealt with by Hanako since... he knows
the Fifth Wonder of the school. I mean, he knows all seven of them including
himself but yeah, took a while for introductions haha. And so they gathered
because Hanako believes someone is behind all this rumour spreading and making
things up for their own benefit, so he as the boss decides to disband the Seven
Wonders so we can know who's the culprit. I mean, it's literally anyone who
doesn't cooperate haha. So, that's the peaceful part, unless you want to count
the embarrassing stuff the trio mentioned which... okay Yashiro wins haha and
she scored a 3 btw the others are not even graded lol. Next, is the story in
general not including Hanako's story. Basically what Hanako has described, but
he dictates who gets to live in this school as an apparition, I assume. And to
that, he probably should know about the other Wonders in the school, including
the culprit who has somehow, also recruited a human assistant to falsify some
rumours to their advantage? Haha this one we will not know for now. And the best
thing is it... might be a splitting image of Hanako himself. Not going to
question this further considering we don't know much yet (getting yin yang deja
vu here though), so let's talk about what we actually know now we're halfway
through the series, is Hanako's past. Since the youkai in question this week is
an actual teacher in school, and we kind of have to destroy that Yorishiro thing
which I would just argue is like an appointment letter for being a Wonder in
this premises lol, the teacher chose to only let Yashiro do the job of
destroying it. Why? And how Hanako-kun would have accepted this conciliatory
request without much objection? Well first, it was peaceful, mind you. Probably
because they know each other. Then, it's the story behind the Yorishiro, because
whoever destroyed it has to watch all of it, just like that fox one from two
weeks ago. So you think the sensei is going to let his boss (not true, but yeah)
see all his secrets?? Haha, read on for answers, by the way. Story goes... major
spoiler alert from here on because it's about time, it was when Hanako was
alive. Back then, he was a student. Obvious enough, but he was the teacher's
student. So you can kind of guess how old this story might be already. And as
shared by the teacher... he knew all about the kid. This one might have lacked a
lot of explaining, because how would anyone have access to such foretelling
books is in the first place itself a mystery, but suffice it to say, he knew
about Hanako. All the way. Yahsiro wished she knew that much about him. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
Well, they know about the donuts thing so I guess there was development haha.
Anyways, story goes that it was around the time of the moon landing, and Hanako
somehow got his hands on a moon stone from the orbiting satellite itself? Highly
unlikely story, but this kid the teacher taught had plans for the future. He was
obsessed with science and astronomy, and probably would be a teacher himself
teaching at this very school in the future which is now. But... You know. I
mean, you should've noticed, he's dead. So... how? What happened? The teacher
may have told us the origins, but left us with the empty space in between as he
tells the story to complete Yashiro's thoughts after seeing the Yorishiro.
Hmm... I don't know what to make of it either, because seriously? We still don't
know much. From the start and specifically from Minamoto, we only know he was a
murderer, and he killed someone (probably heard this from the brother), and thus
his weapon as a knife. And we now know that his future has been changed by the
sensei at some point, to shorten his life. That's all we know though, by the
way. I guess we will know sooner or later, since the future episodes are
probably going to be narrowing down the suspects and getting to that girl who
chatted up to Yashiro last episode at some point. What might be their impending
fate though? From what we have seen so far? It might not be pretty. No really,
Hanako's past is for sure, not a happy one. Hey, at least Yashiro is cute
amirite?? Haha I'll take sex jokes too lol bye<br />

P.P.S. *sees blood dripping from on top of the ladder onto Minamoto* Uh... she's
having her period? Haha sorry gotta make a period joke here<br />
[I hope I haven't read the book for this series (not from the library, but
literally the manga lol) to say this, but I feel serious Assassination Classroom
vibes from this story of Hanako. Really, everything that did not make sense
slowly making sense... I want to see this replace that as the best build-up to
an origin story haha]<br />

"I thought you loved me!" Yeah not when you're measuring whatever angle we're
kissing at!! In this "hurry up and kiss already" episode (#RikeKoi06) which I've
said probably since episode 1 lol, we finally get back on track to watching
episodes in sequence haha. That, and kissing. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, it's going to be a
whole episode on kissing, so I hope you're ready for... scientific analysis!!
Yes, what do you think this show was, your usual romance Anime?? Hah, we don't
need <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">riajuu</a> here
lol. Anyways, analysis first. (Somehow this sounds like my job but I'm only
doing programming which is a joke compared to this haha) Yukimura and Himuro
gotta determine how to kiss, because some Ibarada decided they should do it. So,
this is going to be theory heavy, so I'm going to skip all that, because besides
having the most exciting episode on the line thus far, this... this might be the
most equation heavy episode we have seen yet thanks Kuma for going through these
with us is this what it feels like to learn math with Mocho?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways,
the five criteria for mood for kissing in terms of location can be summarised by
inverted charts and what we call... I need to dig up my textbooks to remember
this, where you have to chart based on conditions (Edit: Piecewise functions),
and of course through knowledge of graphing equations will get you the stuff
that these scientists are real good that, but that's just on the surface. Since
we're talking about kissing, we also should talk about the quality of the kiss?
I guess not since most of them can't do it on the lips (I mean), but even then,
we'll need a control of kissing someone who is not Himuro so then Yukimura just
go kiss a slut- Okay no one will do this with this nerd lol. Even so, they had
to do experiments between themselves as unwilling as they are, and... I think we
got most of the 15 pairs to do this experiment as we mentioned from last episode
lol okay maybe not the sensei, so lesser. Many are dumb, some are weird, some
are breaking the fourth wall saying Ikeda lab is weird lol, some may have people
like Ibarada looking at the couple from the nearby stairs haha yes she probably
was there when it's Kousuke vs Yukimura, and some are heartbeat racing like how
Ibarada and Yukimura ran around the rooftop for 5 minutes haha. And then, we
reached the end. If you are expecting a perfect ending then this would be the
last episode already haha. Of course we're going to talk about the last one in a
more detailed manner, yes? So, Yukimura is at the location, Himuro walks in,
they get to stare at each other for a <i>generous</i> 30 seconds lol, the sunset
is beautiful, the place is quiet without anyone interfering them... IT'S TIME TO
KISS BABY!! Happy Valentine's Day, by the way. Haha I gotta get over this joke
because... they didn't get it. That mood value all went crashing down which we
hoped that helicopter flying above them would too (lol no jinxing in this blog
please), pretty much going against all they have set up for, but in the end,
Himuro got desperate. I mean, if I had someone who I want to kiss with and has
been playing around for weeks you think I'll care if the building staff and my
lab mates AND my lab professor is looking?? Okay, Yukimura kind of cares, so he
end up just kissing her hair. Cheh, boring. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay I gotta admit the end
quote from Yukimura is as cool as he will get haha "I'll kiss you with the
highest mood value" that might be too cool even for him lmao. The results? I
mean, and that's why you shouldn't test heartbeat rates only remember when two
people were running around the rooftop? Haha let's get drunk next week<br />

P.S. "It's the same action what's the difference?" "Because it's overwhelmed
with muscles?" Haha this show in a nutshell<br />
P.P.S. I mean, from a logical standpoint, there isn't anything else to do in the
silence between a male and female, right? So why not kiss- Haha if that's the
definition I would have been laid a long time ago haha<br />
[FYI the hardest I've laughed this episode is if you remember from the
beginning, but when the sensei appeared at the last experiment and Yukimura
saying "abundance of muscle" lmao]<br />

Yeah, so just in case you wonder, the Japanese title is "<a
  href="https://jisho.org/search/kyokou"
  target="_blank"
  >kyokou</a
>
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/suiri" target="_blank">suiri</a>" ie. fiction
reasoning, and I think it's pretty well explained with this new episode
(#KyokouSuiri06), amongst many other things that were explained. Man, this is
literally episode 2 all over again, huh. An adequate title for this series
though, I would admit. So, to clarify what we have been talking thus far. Let's
talk about what we are NOT going to do to resolve this crisis of Steel Lady
Nanase. Firstly, we are NOT going to close the wiki page. No, it will never
work. Doing it will only trigger a circle of influence that will probably go
against the government or police on, in this case, the entertainment industry,
so it will never work. Second, we are NOT going to just override the forums with
another rumour to belittle Nanase's rumour which is currently making her strong
as heck to the extent of being immortal. Since people can believe whatever they
want, it will be hard to talk about what is right, and even if it stems from the
truth it will not be able to work as convincingly as like, a media scoop where
things are exaggerated and click baits are made so websites can earn some shit
level ad money lol #RealityCheck for a bit haha. Lastly, we are NOT going to
just come up with a story and hope that it works. Even if it's the most
convincing story out there, as Saki-san said, it might not be able to move
people around that easily. And in contrast if people still fall back on the
Nanase rumour of her ghost being around, then we are going to be even more
screwed by that point. So, according to Kotoko-chan since Saki-san can't really
do much besides providing investigation information from the police, we are
going to come up with a rumour to show the other side of Nanase's death which is
accidental death bordering suicide, and then make the rumour believable by
making something happen. You might wonder how that "make something happen" phase
can work, and that's why we have Kuro-san. Remember he ate some weird kudan meat
and can predict the future? He's like "I'm going to die for you any amount of
times" to get rid of Nanase haha that's literally a quote from him lol if you
need a Valentine's Day quote there you go lmao. As sad as it sounds, it's also
not that easy. Not only because you can die from doing it, but the doing process
is rough. Instead of picking an ending or seeing one of the endings happen in
typical foretelling powers (I assume), a kudan (in this series) actually chooses
one and condenses it by removing all the other possibilities of futures
available. So, one can say "you'll get a good harvest this year" and get rid of
all the other ones like "there's a flood" or "yield is low" or whatever in
between. By saying that, of course, one has to die for it. Since Kuro-san is
kind of a mixed breed, his "prediction" is not absolute, and he can't choose
just any, but just the most likely one. So yeah, observer's perspective, I
guess. Even so, that'll make making a rumour happen a lot easier as long as we
stay close to the future as viewed by Kuro-san. Even then, it'll take a lot of
effort to even let Kuro-san make that likely ending a reality, because he how
has to condense the endings together into one confirmed outcome. As fun as this
sounds, seems like the hard part if still thinking of a good enough rumour for
people - especially the ones from the forums - to believe. That, and no wonder
Kotoko-chan is the God of Wisdom. I mean, she managed to convince the one
serpent God to believe her story about the one murder and corpse thrown in to
the river, so... I guess she's smart haha hey she got that university acceptance
though. (The serpent was scared of Kuro-san, we know that already haha but) What
will happen next, we don't know. But we know that this will have to happen
faster than ever because... we got our first victim, guys. (Not coronavirus
joke) So that's going to be a problem. Aw man RIP Tereda you will be missed haha
man have I gotten bored of deaths since I've seen a couple dozen of them in
Anime "Babylon" lol but still. Cya guys next week<br />

  </div>

This week was quite a week in Klassic Note, so let's talk about it.
<b>SCANDAL's new album</b> is not going to restore my already weak confidence in
their music, but then again the many topic songs they had over the past few
years aren't bad, so I decided to give as many as I can. Again, I'm still into
the J-Rock part of them; the Pop part I'm not too keen. I guess this is the "I
just need to like one of your many styles to give you" kind of judgement then.
<b>yucat's latest mini-album</b> released last year is... passable at best, as I
can't identify with any refreshing styles and/or melodies from the release
itself besides hearing steampunk style music, and that might get boring if she
goes on this direction. I remember Dr.Code so well, and that is just LIT haha.
<b>SpecialThanks are back</b> after keeping quiet for some time with a slew of
monthly new songs (still going on this month, for Valentine's), and hopefully
we'll reach a new album that I can give formally. After some time, I decided to
give <b>Miyano Mamoru's new single</b> a chance hoping to give male idolism a
chance in Klassic Note... those Kuroshitsuji character songs featuring Ono
Daisuke were better haha. And yes, if you haven't noticed, Nu-chan wasn't
mentioned here, so that will be reviewed next week.<br />
<br />
Talking about next week which is in my opinion, THE BEST WEEK mainly because my
birthday is right smack on release day, we're still giving indie band
<b>Humbreader's 1st album</b> a listen consdering I can give at least one song
which I heard last month, <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</b> for Anime is
already winning whatever is mentioned in this paragraph, and
<b>yanaginagi's new single</b> is going to be for obligation purposes
considering from the preview it isn't great. Not even for an emotional song. And
yes, <b>Numakura Manami's best album</b> will be reviewed to give her last
chance of leaving more of an impression on Klassic Note. Music subscription
services did not help her appear on time so I can give this last week, to be
honest. I think this delay will continue to happen, hopefully not as bad as
Aimer's because her's is only releasing the latest release on a new release.
Yeah, I found that out somehow.<br />
<br />
In the news from the Internet Twitter and beyond,
<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES revealed their new album details</b> including a new
topic song music video which is dope I guess,
<b>FLOWER FLOWER is releasing a new album</b> due March with a new music video
preview I can't get into somehow, and
<b>nano.RIPE is going to release a new single</b> for Anime "Shokugeki no Souma"
once again since last year which I'll probably not listen somehow. Man, the
future is bleak haha we know the topic songs are a farce to the awesome songs
inside those releases. Come on, ask my B-side Survey for evidence that topic
songs don't matter. Music videos are a distraction man I wished I wrote that
post I've reserved for this for weeks to prove my point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay we are done. Still thinking of whether to write that survey down from Kitou
Akari's 1st photobook, but I'll probably not do so due to my lack of confidence
in... everything. I mean, I know the stamp is cheap probably a few bucks, but I
rather treat myself to a cup of Starbucks just joking Akarin you come to
Singapore I'll treat you to some bubble tea haha go see my review again to see
cleavage hehe. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I should find some
time to do the stuff I want. They don't earn money but I can make myself happy
doing things I want on my day. Until next time, I guess. Maybe I should continue
writing APoL before I die of the new coronavirus haha bye<br />
