  A princess from Ethiopia? Now where have I heard of that story before...
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Inspired by the past couple of episodes apparently Laurent why you
  steal other people's ideas (lol), this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER20) I guess we're
  going full on China again- Hey remember some people got sent down the ocean
  floor after trying to save a bunch of kids out and now Laurent has to save all
  of them? Hopefully you can recall what has happened so far because I can't even. So,
  finally, we have the full backstory, all in one episode. God, that ending with
  Makoto giving Laurent the wallet is so meta I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay,
  let's talk story. Story from when we took a break since two weeks ago,
  Dorothy's gang was about to do a final heist, but on to the Chinese mafia, and
  the plan now is to abduct a descendant of the African nation, give it to them
  for 10 million USD, and then save Dorothy out. Simple enough right? Yeah, and
  if you don't think this is also deja vu because yes they did use it on the
  Japanese mafia too but since they don't know about the story in China
  technically we can recycle this approach lol. Hey, who says scams can't be
  used more than once. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Moving on, Obviously there is a drop, because if you are
  waiting for it like me and know that this heist failed, is that that very princess who was supposedly studying
  in Japan or whatever, appeared in the papers. China papers, that's right. So
  yeah, got found out I guess freaking OZ WHAT DO WE DO NOW haha. And so,
  surprisingly, they did the similar approach to the Japanese mafia as we have
  seen, sending them down to the ocean floor. I suppose that's how this time
  around travelling back to present time, Cynthia and the others would have
  survived since they likely have a contingency plan now. Because for Dorothy, they
  didn't. Well, Oz did kind of draft up a last-minute plan to save them, but hey
  dear girl, you really shouldn't have insulted the head of the Chinese mafia
  haha. Like seriously, that's really what got her a bullet to the chest, she could have been saved. So yeah, that one's dead dead though. And as Laurent gets
  sad about all this and them 10 million dollars flying past them as they try to
  recover from their lives, including Oz having to sacrifice himself because
  technically he was the middleman in the incident... by committing crime lol
  wow Makoto's dad has got everything in his sleeve it seems. I guess his idea
  was to use jail as a cover for himself lest Liu comes for him which I guess is
  smart, and alternatively, as Laurent woke up from his dream of a Dorothy-less
  life after leaving China... Yes Laurent left China. And never came back. Ever.
  Yeah okay if you have watched this far you know that's not true but still. He
  wrote a tender note to Oz, asking for a revenge plan against the Chinese
  mafia, for Dorothy. I mean, it's for revenge and she did say not to do it so
  whatever haha. Then again, we haven't actually got the 10 million yet so I guess. And
  to the ending, we got the storytelling on various parts where all the other
  members have been found. They are namely why Cynthia isn't the big boss here
  but she's got big boobs and that's how she got hired by trying to scam Laurent
  I guess haha (which I assume after her breakup with Thomas), Abbie who got found
  on the streets dealing with thugs good one (and yes we need a Dorothy
  replacement, but as in figure only), Oz went back to the Chinese mafia to
  plead for guilty because Laurent asked him too technically (and of course,
  kept mum about it from the kid and even still visiting the mother until her death in
  silence), and Makoto joined because just watch Episode 1 haha. To conclude,
  that's a lot of info to absorb, but we'll talk about likely happenings after
  this week. Firstly, the fates of all the people involved in this heist. Now we
  know how Laurent can come back to visit Liu. Because, as he has not stabbed
  the dude and told him his mother in France is almost dead lol (Didn't he leave
  her alone I think? Watch back I forgot), he can technically "go back" to Liu
  because he was still one of his underlings at some point, helping him as a
  translator. So yes, as I said before, it's probably a favour out here, and
  that will save all their butts I think. What specifically though, we
  shall see to know. Then, how the history ties everyone up together. So, "confidence man" here has been holding on to the same philosophy for years on,
  that is, to scam the rich and not kill, out of anything goes I guess. From
  Dorothy being head to now Laurent, even without Oz on the hand (or maybe he's
  behind all along which will explain how Laurent isn't that smart lol) the team
  still kind of is able to pull things together. Again, don't ask Cynthia to do
  the seducing thing we know it doesn't work in some cases lmao. And lastly, how
  it all stands now. I'm going to watch closely on the episode timeline here,
  trying to follow TV simulcast here like most Anime do even nowadays (F**k
  Netflix okay?? Thanks for the videos anyways lol), but yeah, moving on I think
  we will see how this arc gets concluded. Yes, there will be a season two in
  place apparently, but we gotta see this off right? And we shall. Cya guys next
  week.

  P.S. *sees Laurent stab Liu* AWWWW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO GOOOODDD!!! Dammit
  why past Laurent why "We never kill." Well said, Shi Ohn, well said.
</div>
<div>
  P.P.S. I think we're on par now, and looking at the preview for the last part
  for this season on their official Twitter... I think we only get to see Makoto
  say "we've come here to say our goodbyes" and stabbing someone haha I hope no
  one's dead remember we don't kill here
</div>
<div>
  [Just my own words here: But yes the flashback does seem weak in convincing us
  about Dorothy's death because look how successful the first three arcs turned
  out. Really brought down the endings for the flashback as Laurent cries over her
  death because yeah, I don't even know if she's dead or not at that point, like seriously.
  Hard to trust that now you've seen so much tbh the Anime didn't take some time
  to play down the power of success in their heists enough to give this arc
  impact]

  </blockquote>
  Wow with that adult content warning in the intro it took you this long to tell
  us that, huh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this unhealthy new episode because it must be the sausages
  on screen lmao (#MajoTabi09), I think the flyer is a job offer for being a
  "confidence man" lol hey someone's going to get duped with this loli magician
  as a potential hire amirite Laurent?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Moving on from that lie of a
  series haha, yes Elaina needs to earn some money otherwise just like the adult
  content warning up front we might have to see her earn money using her body-
  Okay thank goodness it's a fellow magician. Oh yeah, and spoiler alert? The
  supposed "adult content" here is not sex. I promise you. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> It's blood.
  You'll get what I mean in a while. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤®">*pukes*</span> Okay, story time, <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Wow,
  they even skipped the opening and removed animation for the ending lol. (*they can't credit rated content is what they meant*) So,
  story goes that Elaina run out of funds, surprisingly way longer than how Saya
  can hold out which I also don't assume they left house with the same starting
  funds, but you know, no surprise because it's going to happen someday. Haha imagine if it happened
  when she meets Saya again that'll be a problem lol. Thankfully, she found a
  flyer who will give her money. Like, for work. The premise is simple: It's from a Lavender Witch, she wants to travel back in time to save her childhood
  friend, and she needs somebody to accompany her. I mean, what could go wrong,
  amirite?? But considering the series, we shouldn't be too optimistic but at
  least we know Elaina won't die from this haha serious foreshadowing her also
  spoilers if you read this far. Anyways, the witch was prepared, the plan is to
  go back a decade and save the parents from being killed which
  <strike>Estella</strike> Estelle here thinks, is the source of her friend
  Selena being a murderer after she moved in with her uncle. Ugh, I feel bad
  telling this story again. Hey, welcome to this #Minikui series man, been a
  while since we used that word we have been getting lovely stories the past few
  weeks lol. Moving on, the plan worked, they travelled back to what the city
  was 10 years ago, and despite Elaina's concerns about time manipulation
  affecting the current present they live in... okay so you can't save the
  present then ok ok haha thank goodness this Anime still has some logic lol I
  mean, look at those time-travelling Anime out there and tell me which one of
  them made sense. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> ANYWAYS (haha) (this won't make much sense too so)
  Estelle managed to get her bestie's parents out of their house so the killer would
  appear and stab nobody because... it didn't appear. Oh? Logical loophole here?
  And as Elaina waited not for long since they only had an hour to do this, she
  then found out that her magic has been drained, so she knows the Lavender
  Witch is in trouble. Okay I may have exaggerated thinking that the murderer
  may have known of magic because maybe that's why the parents' death may be
  inevitable nonetheless, but hey, you forgot there's someone else in this
  specific household besides the parents who can kill the parents. Yes, it's her. It's Selena. Ugh.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yes, to fill us in on the blanks and probably Estelle herself, the
  abuse has happened before Selena moved in with the uncle. The dad's a rapist
  (ugh), and the mother's a bitc- So she killed them. Yes, as a 10-year-old.
  Again, as I've watched Anime series like "Babylon" and "Kara no Kyoukai", if
  you kill people as a kid you're fucked up, no matter what the reason. I mean,
  leaving and living on the edge would have been a better option. So, Selena got
  found out, and Estelle, with the last of her breath and magic even without
  Elaina's magic as she took the ring off (I saw that from a mile away tbh, that
  her magic would be used for Estelle out of her will) (I mean, you wouldn't
  think? Or else how you get the fat pay check that she didn't keep), killed her
  "best friend" once again, as she did counting from current present, 3 years
  ago. Hey, I'm getting so much deja vu I'll need a heater to warm me up later
  from this episode. In the end, Estelle sacrificed her 10 years of memories
  with Selena I assume, to kill her. Hey, and all is well lol why are you crying
  Elaina but seriously though, as much as this is hard to watch, it's also
  pretty revolting. And it's not because of the blood, trust me you haven't
  watched much Anime yet if you think this freaks you out lol I'm not a murderer.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Still, pretty impressed the Anime will go that far to do this type of
  content to be honest. I thought the past 8 episodes is what they have to offer,
  and we'll probably get more "This and That Village" stories instead lol. I'll
  say for one thing though for this episode: Estelle did do what was needed to
  save herself, that's more important. Because seriously, you wouldn't want to
  remember what dumb things you did just so you can gain nothing out of it haha
  that's literally for all the characters in this series other than maybe Elaina
  and Fran haha bye

  P.S. "Are you making fun of me?" And THAT is how you do a job interview haha
  you can leave now Elaina-san lmao but seriously though don't do this "And
  what's the payment?" Yeah also not this haha imagine you try to waltz into an
  interview doing these ugh you will not last long<br />P.P.S. "The magic I
  created to go back in time was not simple. It wasn't something I could make
  without sacrificing something" Well no shit dude I think we've heard this many
  times, like when someone lost her voice for a sword without lies remember that
  stupid thing? lol oh yeah memories too to make your dad a dragon
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I guess magic doesn't hurt lol how much does it take to kill someone
  with it man?? I thought magic should be able to kill people cleanly or
  painlessly I wonder how Estelle did it to Selena 3 years ago lmao]

  remember that episode?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, ignoring that, they have to make
  arrangements now, for their future accommodation. And while Nasa-kun is
  thinking about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha" target="_blank">ichaicha</a> with
  his wife for at least a week in a (not love) hotel lmao, I guess we have a new
  place to stay for now, ignoring real estate complications. We've got a lot (of
  jokes) to cover this episode so let's do it! Firstly, about accommodation. The
  obvious choice is of course in the bathhouse with the family who Nasa-kun
  literally saved when they were in a pinch, so yeah, this much is little to pay
  for, so you're welcome Nasa-kun. Helping each other out man, that's called
  insurance. Seriously, cheaper than actual insurance companies lol. And
  everyone in the house agreed to it too, including, and yes you should've seen
  it coming, Aya-chan, who we know of, likes the dude so you would wonder why
  she hasn't known of the marriage yet. Well we haven't been covering it so far up
  till now anyways too so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And so, we have to deal with this Aya-chan who has a
  processor of like an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron" target="_blank">Intel Celeron</a>
  from early 2000s so <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> God, this is so dumb I can't wait for the day
  they have to tell her the truth. The wholesome truth- Ah. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Man, the
  mother with the drop from the top of the atmosphere to her daughter's head.
  And dude, the future predictions too? Mom, can you not be smarter than the
  author?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Aw this series is just amazing thanks author. And so, we gotta
  wrap things up eventually here, and man I wished we had a complete flashback but I
  know Anime production or the author himself knows it's funnier to not, so welp
  I guess Aya. You not main girl anyways TALKING ABOUT MAIN GIRL!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
  (Also, the shitting on the mom also is good haha if you can remember the
  father left the house for the bathhouse's hired idol lmao) Then, we talk about
  laundry. And yes, when you wife asks you to not bring it to the nearest
  laundromat, there is a reason that... I say you should know. Yes, something
  others shouldn't feast their eyes on. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, so long as it's not a
  thong or it's wet we're good. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And of course, Tsukasa is totally right
  because like most girls, they wouldn't want to see men in their house with
  their underwear. Funny how as males why we don't care though lol. Anyways, she
  washed <em>everything</em> so Nasa-kun is also thinking about everything lmao
  can you stop. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> At this point, I would say, is the time to protect, uh,
  I mean, protecc. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also why does she look fat- MOVING ON!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
  (Yeah start counting how many times I laughed because watching it first round
  I lost count) And also, Kaname suggested to go shopping with her because you
  know, some of them got burnt up. In the fire, in the fire. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ironic why
  Nasa-kun doesn't have to buy clothing but hey, who gives a shit about the guy.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And so lastly, we talk about shopping for clothes. For a woman. Yes,
  if you need life lessons now is a good time to listen up haha and I don't even
  have a wife. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Man, someday I would like to do that too, for any woman.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> My life aside, let me drop a little truth on you guys. Firstly, the
  price. Yes, Tsukasa wasn't joking. And Harajuku is your local famous shopping
  district, in my case Orchard Road if it wasn't filled with Filipino maids now
  lol. Ignoring them, the clothes girls buy are not cheap. Trust me, don't shop
  with your mom for a while and you'll notice. Also, follow Instagram girls.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Really, there are fans who will research on what voice actresses
  wear on camera, no joke) Because clothing is expensive, thankfully they are
  also of real good quality, so at least you don't have to worry about using
  them for long. I've tried myself out on clothing which are higher priced, and
  can confirm, and I'm sure you realised that too, if you have the ability to
  spoil yourself on clothing, and underwear of course. Sadly, this is where the
  happy stuff ends, because for women to have satisfaction over variety of
  clothing unlike guys (Tsukasa is a rare exception who can understand the
  situation but) girls gonna need a lot of clothing for switching it around when
  going outdoors. My mom be a great example because she has a mini wardrobe that
  is not ours in every single bedroom in the apartment. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Including the
  bathrooms. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the embarrassment is top tier (lol), Nasa-kun is
  totally sick in the mind turns out, and Kaname be MVP every episode she
  appears because no one does
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a>
  better than her already in this series. Well, she's the only one that isn't
  f**ked up so <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Stay tuned for more laughs in upcoming episodes. Man,
  this series is the best so far no sad stories so feel bad or puke about lol

  Well, more songs this week, and I swear I wasn't spending more time again
  because it's time to wrap up for the year, but we'll learn soon enough that we
  haven't, as there are more releases to listen.
  <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/torch-of-liberty-single/1539133582?l=en" target="_blank"><b>KANA-BOON's new single</b></a> is totally not great considering I've given
  songs from their best album this year so... next year guys I guess.
  <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/doors-ep/1534836673?l=en" target="_blank"><b>Sayaka's new EP</b></a>&nbsp;from a month ago was actually not bad (if you
  remember her from Goose house), but sadly fall short mostly due to melodies,
  so I think I only ended up giving the one song because her English in singing
  be good haha also the lyrics. I also took some time (as in just now lol) to
  give some chance to <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9A-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A0-ep/1540734378?l=en" target="_blank"><b>Liyuu's 2nd single</b></a> where she debuted this year, and
  uh, I kept being reminded of Chinese songs and those suck so <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well,
  I'm not in the mood to give technopop anyways so you're not welcome.<br />
  <br />In news concerning Twitter and music mostly because there is a lot to
  talk about this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1331221144595140608?s=20" target="_blank"><b>cinema staff's new song</b></a> is a serious meh so I'm
  not giving until they have a full on release,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1330798247737167873?s=20" target="_blank"><b>SID's new music videos</b></a> are likely setup to (1) their new single
  releasing end of December which I'll listen because the MV ain't bad and (2)
  their upcoming 17th anniversary live early next year so I hope you guys have
  money to give them lol (also I should follow them on Twitter haha why haven't
  I), <a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1332971064800862208?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Scenarioart's YouTube live</b></a> from physical event the last of this
  year is acoustic and it's great and in and because I don't want to live with
  regrets and unlike VELTPUNCH's live I can donate in yen with a better exchange
  rate" I gave them some money because independent labels be hard to live with
  now, <a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1332295108394319872?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Aimer announced her new album</b></a> releasing April 2021 following her online
  live, <a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1331211033508073474?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Fuchigami Mai's new music video</b></a> is great if I liked the song lol
  (that's idolism in a nutshell), and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/PHONOTONES/status/1332158787457744897?s=20" target="_blank"><b>PHONO TONES' 1st mini-album is finally on streaming services</b></a> haha
  seriously though that was my 2012 year end fuel. In news not concerning music
  but on Twitter still, <a href="https://twitter.com/kyokou_suiri/status/1332157196541579265?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Anime "Kyokou Suiri" announced a second season</b></a>.
  Yay. I can see the joy in the dude's eyes already lol that face but seriously
  though yay for more Kotoko-chan and b*tchy drama haha the mystery-solving is
  not even important anymore
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So for next week, well next month, looks like we have all lined up fresh new
  releases for the month of December, one release every week haha good I thought
  we're done. So first up next week is <b>Minase Inori's new single</b> for her
  5th anniversary and I've said the topic song ain't bad anyways, followed by
  yanaginagi's new album which previews aren't that bad I can identify a couple
  of new hits I'd like, followed by Polkadot Stingray's new album since their
  slew of digital singles and mini-album since start of the year, and SID's new
  single will end the year in Klassic Note. Ugh, I still haven't came up with a
  good list for everything yet haha I should get to it
</div>
<div>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Ooo now that I'm worried about what ending to write, I saw Twitter just now and saw Earphones online show that I've watched (last week) <a href="https://twitter.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1332972667872321536" target="_blank">selling live bromides</a> starting tomorrow? Hey, why not. Haha it's not going to have pink somehow lmao. Good, now that I have an ending to my boring weeks now lol cya guys next week, and until next time... Capitalism will keep me going haha I'm going to attempt again migrating this blog with all the posts we have so far updated to the new elements respectively. Yeah, that'll take a lot of testing but it's a lot like what I've done at work so far with system migration so I'll deal with it time is the issue here probably will be good by next year maybe haha bye<br />
