  </blockquote>
  Well isn't that the most useless intro ever for this series lol okay that dude
  literally got left out for the ride to the hospital whatever haha. In this new
  episode (#GREATPRETENDER19) where younger Laurent is running away from his
  issues just like how I am too lol, looks like we are going to find out how the
  term "confidence man" came about. Seriously, how can I forget there was a Laurent's
  team before Laurent's team, how foolish of me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, man, this is
  really quite an episode to talk about after all this while, so let's get to
  it. Story first because I promise you I have more things to say than what is
  in this flashback, if you recall, as started by Makoto's dad from previous
  episode. Story continues where Laurent tried to stab a rich guy but ended up
  stabbing that dude's girl... which then turned out to be Dorothy, our lady in
  question, in relation to Laurent. So turns out, she leads a group of&nbsp;
  "confidence man", scheming scammers and liars, who steal from the rich. Well,
  help the poor probably not, but I suppose they will be doing that from time to
  time lol. Anyways, Laurent was invited to help just like how Makoto was
  invited to join when Laurent is in charge, and they, uh... continued to scam
  people lol. And so, Laurent dropped his... whatever he was doing for a living
  back then lol, to help them out. One after another, one night after another,
  and they made a lot of money and love at the same time. Hey, can't say Laurent
  is a lover, but Dorothy sure isn't. Well, as long as you bring her up to the
  mountains to see some "lights" (aurora borealis be the official term), she'll
  be with you forever, and as we continue down the path of meeting the Chinese
  mafia selling kids (ah this is where they started lol) and them trying to buy
  them back while taking their money, we have to consider many things that will
  change the path of this story so far. Firstly, Dorothy's status as of now.
  Just in case no one noticed, she isn't around so let's assume she's... dead?
  Well, in trouble, since no one dies in this game lol. But yeah, how and why?
  Did they then, probably in the next episode, lose to the mafia? Probably,
  considering this is going to be their last heist and they, uh, tried too hard
  and went over the line? Yeah, that can happen. And seeing that
  Laurent kind of took a knife for Liu (probably faked but you know), for this
  arc specifically then, he might be asking to, mark my words, ask for a return in favour.
  Secondly, Oz' relations with the "confidence man" group. So yes, as Makoto
  figured out at some point and I second-guessed it last week, yes the father's
  with the group. Along with Laurent probably for a while, mind you. Not that
  the timeline here is stated at any point so far, but my guess has changed from
  this was Oz AFTER the jail term to Oz BEFORE the jail term. If that made sense
  to you things will become clear to you by now. So yeah, Laurent has already been, sorry Oz, a bad influence on Makoto if they meet. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Fast forward to today,
  and you can see how deep Oz is into currently Laurent's team than into those
  mafia guys, just so you are aware. Finally, Laurent's rationale in this whole
  arc considering the flashback. Not that he wants to settle down because I
  swear he does want to at some point, but I&nbsp;think, as much as Dorothy
  mentions not to do revenge, this arc might turn out to be ironically, if you haven't taken a
  hint, meant for revenge. If you wonder how I took the hint, tell me where
  Dorothy is (and don't give me the "in Laurent's heart" bullshit lol) and why
  this last resort so far to talk to Liu after pretty much Oz and the others dropped down the
  sea and Makoto got into deep trouble with the mafia, would let Laurent -
  clearly the big boss as of now - take over the situation and confront probably
  one of his biggest woes in his history of scamming people. To be frank though?
  We still don't know what's the true stance of the Chinese mafia, by far. We
  only know they are big enough to play with the mafia in Japan, and Liu
  probably still owes Laurent something. That's all we have to work with right
  now. I suppose there will be a grand entrance of Oz with a solution to resolve
  this before the arc ends considering he was the strategist, but we need to know now, that this is going to be
  rough. And as we see the true face of the past and meet the present, this
  might still be the most twisted arc yet. Man, and they doing a season two?
  What content they got by then? Haha cya guys next week while I find the new
  insert song lol not as impressive as Cynthia's imo

  </blockquote>
  Did someone mention the wall?? lol okay no more America stuff please I'm
  watching Anime haha kid Elaina kawaii!!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
  (#MajoTabi07) where I swear if someone on the streets asked me for a knife I
  better take three steps back lol Elaina no!!! I mean, she can just kill with
  magic the weapon is not necessary haha. And this week, besides Elaina trying
  to die lol, we're talking about borders. Welp, dear author, I hope you're
  ready for a lawsuit haha hey it's all fictional guys you can't sue whatever.
  Also, welcome to the lamest episode ever in this series haha I'm calling it here
  first just in case. Firstly, about a wall. I know it's hard to talk about
  this, but considering Anime like "Attack on Titan" having walls upon walls...
  you can think of it as those walls instead haha. So, story goes that - I like
  how this involves witches we already know as they are making grounds - a witch
  from the Association as I will refer to now (yes it's Saya shut up) (haha)
  passed by the countries separated by a wall because they couldn't agree on
  each other. I would argue though, as a form of politics, that if really two
  factions can't agree it's better to set up borders, really. Look at most of
  Africa today and you'll get the point. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, that witch, who also wrote
  the book that Elaina read as a kid, gave a story to both sides of the wall and
  since they won't know of it through each other, they sincerely asked
  travellers to carve their thoughts about the country on their side as they
  pass by. Like, really, just praises? What if I wrote this country's bad
  points? Will I get executed immediately? Ignoring that haha, the one from the
  Association, in this case, was asked to do something about this wall ie.
  promote it? Okay, boss, what do you want, a prop plane dropping pamphlets? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And
  surprisingly, she did the bad thing by letting anyone carve whatever they want
  on the wall, and through time, ended up destroying the wall because people
  could write whatever they like. Or dislike, which is probably more dangerous
  to do so... Okay, Saya, good job tearing the wall down so that Elaina got to
  see nothing lmao is this the most stupid follow-up to a story ever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
  It's like when we get space travel in the future and then you discovered that
  what you see in the planets aren't exactly what it is through satellite
  images... *conspiracy theories arise* Okay I'm making stupid jokes now but you
  get the idea. And yes, there wasn't a winner because since the witch in the book Elaina read told both
  sides the same thing, travellers will just write on the wall on both sides.
  And then, the lamest story yet most relevant story you have ever heard of if
  you aren't in the first place: fetishism. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Uh oh, did I trigger
  someone? I'm sorry. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Story goes that there are two villages in this
  case, separated by a road, who can never agree on each other about the quality
  of wine they have produced. However, because Capitalism also exists in the
  past, "That Village" (this name is so stupid haha) to drive up sales that side
  (let's take sides for now, so this side for "This Village") the guys that side
  (lol) chose the most enticing of marketing strategies ever: a woman. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
  Hey, don't laugh at me, ask yourself when's the last time you bought something
  because of a woman. *recalls 11.11 sale* (haha that's you I don't buy stuff on
  Singles'... Day <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>) Anyways, so clearly there is a winner now, but this
  side had to live with it until some witch arrived and promised to help out.
  And guess who is this helpful traveller who is also beautiful and smart and a child prodigy lmao this is already going great. It
  was a hard call, and I agree with Rosemary that Elaina isn't as... attractive
  as she is, but hey, we can get the lolicons in I suppose. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Thank
  goodness this is not real life or else I can already imagine Elaina stepping on me
  now haha please do. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, jokes over, let's talk story alright? Ugh.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> "Fuelled by hatred" Ah yes, this was part of my script lol, Elaina
  went ahead and agreed to this competition, I guess. Again, assuming both sides
  are equally good similar to the previous story with the wall, no one is going
  to win unless they employ different strategies to win. And after a day of hard
  work, Elaina then realised that she can't be doing the stepping all by
  herself, not to even say that Rosemary woman who now has not grown legs thicker than her bust size lmao. And because people in this side are dumb,
  they then now found out that you know, just like idolism, she can't be doing
  all the hard work herself. Except for Nan-chan, she edited her own videos on
  YouTube haha you're welcome to go check it out lol. (With the power of Internet you can also mass produce wine-) So, confrontation time, as
  the two sides then realised how silly this has been to fight for the wrong
  reasons, and in a sea of bullet-powered grapes... haha Elaina drunk is the best,
  they learnt to take this as a lesson... and thus the Grape-Throwing Festival
  is born. Wow, such wholesomeness haha is this how Thailand had that festival?
  Oh wholesomeness be me talking about Rosemary lmao okay joke's over. All in
  all, refreshing I must say, for two stories with a similar theme, but as you
  can guess earlier than Elaina can fly to the wall after reading the story
  about it as a kid... this is as smooth as it gets. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I don't know where
  I was going with that haha but one thing to agree on is how the aesthetic now
  is the witches we know of now that are influencing the world around them as
  they continue to carve out (get it?) stories of their own.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Wait, Elaina did not have a hangover after drinking so much wine? Haha
  oh yeah she can cure herself of it lol I thought I could see her puke like
  Uzaki-chan]

  about it. Firstly, about the issues in marriage. Yes, I did talk about how
  things will go wrong after marriage and that a couple has to experience before
  that happens, but you know, these guys had a shotgun everything so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
  Okay, not in that context but you get the idea. And so Chitose here is bent in
  seeing the drama happen in between them because you know, more exposure, more
  problems, amirite?? Yeah, so first up, about food found on unfamiliar ground,
  branded foods vs new stuff. There are people who will do the norm by finding
  the familiar names when travelling OR (hear me out) trying out new things when
  arriving on a new place, but hey, they both have their strengths and
  weaknesses. Trying out familiar stuff makes you boring, but trying out new
  stuff has a chance of it being real bad as shown in the episode, so yeah,
  there isn't exactly a win-win for these stuff, I would argue. For me
  personally, I hardly find any familiar stuff when travelling so I just eat
  whatever lol I'm already picky in my diet I just choose whatever I can haha.
  Anyways, instead of flaring up at this though as Chitose did not expect,
  Tsukasa flared up instead when the husband keeps taking photos of her. Hey, in
  Nasa-kun's defense... I would buy a better camera for this purpose. And then link it with my mobile data. And then
  post them immediately to Instagram. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay now that we have angered the
  wife enough to make Chitose our second wife happy... (lmao what this isn't those
  stories about concubines?) But as soon as Nasa-kun has realised whatever his
  mistake was, he immediately apologised and offered to let her take charge in
  return, buying her favourite food. Again, ice cream would be better you guys
  can share just one lmao. And thus, Nasa-kun is forgiven- Is this what it feels
  like to be dating Akarin? I don't know man someone else please tell me haha. Since
  the couple hasn't been making much progress ie. on the verge of breaking up or
  getting a divorce lol, we gotta bring the heavyweight in so Chitose came in
  between them. Insisting that they weren't meant to be together, and asking for
  answers for their bonding, there did come a point that even Nasa-kun was
  worried that he needs to convince the people around his life (say, around
  Tsukasa's life too) that he was married to the cutest girl in the universe lol
  how hard can that be. Next up, about going places. You know, if you watched
  enough high school Anime school trips you should have familiarised yourself
  with Kyoto, the ultimate travel destination. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And the norm - even though I'm on Tsukasa's side here - is to visit historical artefacts, from
  shrines to towers to whatever in between. So yes, as Chitose has wanted,
  Tsukasa went along with the husband so to avoid a divorce lmao turns out
  Chitose was right. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And thus, the wife rented a kimono as one could do
  there FYI, she be cute but the camera wasn't out lol, and... they were once
  again stopped by Chitose. And in order to prove to the girl such that she
  would approve of this marriage...&nbsp;I guess we're switching strategies to
  infidelity this time now lol this is going to happen at some point even
  without the edited photos lol. And lastly, about love. Yes, this is a bit
  cheesy, we know this will happen at some point including the last episode of
  this series probably in a month, but suffice it to say that Professor Nasa
  here (lol) did come up with more concrete reasons than Tsukasa being
  questioned by the maids because why not, on their pursuit of true love. On the
  lighter side, we see Tsukasa just you know, describing what she likes about
  the husband, and the guy just being... cute. Yeah, no joke. On the other
  hand, you see meticulous journey planner Nasa-kun taking Chitose out on a date
  she would dream of having lmao, but then landed on his philosophies of love
  which I'm not boring you with, but suffice it to say that the most relevant
  explanation I can agree with him is the chances of fate. It's not because I'm
  liking all these idols today that made me twitch because all these are fated
  to be my idols and I'm fated to spend money on them lol (hypothetical example
  by the way),&nbsp; but that you know it's here you want to be together the
  moment you saw them. I don't know about those who have had say, dozens of women in
  their lives but, I understand the idea of "the only one" appearing in your
  life, once in a lifetime, especially the first. Shout out to my reinforced middle school memories
  for this haha someday man. And yes, that marriage is about proving love there
  forth *gets RikeKoi flashbacks*, not because you have proven. Well mainly
  because we can't do that forever, so we might as well tie the knot first. I
  guess that's how you explain Western marriage ideals and how they get divorced
  faster and more often than Easterners huh haha oops. To end this, yes in case
  you didn't take a hint because they made such a dumb joke you were rolling on
  the floor laughing throughout this episode (aka ROFLMFAO), Tsukasa hints that,
  to Chitose, she has always been... a 16-year-old. Think about it, and cya guys
  next week for more not truths behind Tsukasa's past because WHO CARES!!! Haha
  bye

  [TL:DR; "I suppose marriage isn't just about the people who get married"
  Tsukasa you cannot be more right]

  Okay, about music this week. To be honest? Yeah, I forgot that Mocho had a
  single until I watched the livestream featuring her on Monday and then I'm
  like "oh yeah the topic song kinda sucks but I still have to review it" lol
  that sounds so forced. But for <b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> I would argue
  that I can still give the topic song despite its... its unusual melody but
  hey, I could use some consolation after or even during work here, so thanks
  Mocho. <b>Tomita Miyu's new single</b>, on the other hand, was the one I have
  initially rejected the heck out of from the music video and then after this
  week... probably won't get into my list this time around because even like
  <b>SPYAIR's new single</b> which I was reminded of because I follow them on
  Twitter, I... don't even know where to start talking about their release
  editions because on Apple Music the digital version which has a B-side is just
  music lol, had a physical limited edition for the Anime that had other own
  songs which were theme songs for the Anime series. Yes, "Haikyuu", that one. I
  did not give the topic song by the way. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> To top it off, I'll mention
  it later anyways, but due to listening on a livestream... more like video
  premier on YouTube, I'm giving the one song from <b>Co Shu Nie</b> which I'll
  not bother to do special characters just like how I deal with fhana anyways,
  but yeah, probably won't have to do it anymore because of their occult style,
  I'll probably be only giving this one Anime theme song. Trust me, I listened
  to all their music videos before delivering this judgement haha
</div>
<div>
  <br />On news concerning music on Twitter this week I'll try not to overlap
  with last week's stuff, I listened to
  <b>the one audio diary of Kayano Ai</b> (in case you didn't know context is
  she's doing one every day until her 10th anniversary album release around
  March 2021) where she talks about Anime "Servant x Service" and their theme
  songs and damn did I miss that series haha yeah in a nutshell it's because of
  a name haha and also tsundere Ookubo Rumi because I love her for that lol.
  Moving on, turns out I'm not the only one who remembers
  <b>Komatsu Mikako's birthday song</b> because literally, it's called "Angel
  Number" but if you know the lyrics you'll sing it on her day every year haha
  Mikami Shiori I saw you there,
  <b>SPYAIR released an oldie of a music video</b> to celebrate the new single
  so yay I gave that song, N<b>atsukawa Shiina's new single is upcoming January</b>
  as announced in her new YouTube video but also it's composed by yours truly
  from UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's bassist (goddamn the hype), I did tune in to
  <b>THE FIRST TAKE FES</b> featuring - because everyone wouldn't stop talking
  about it you know how it makes the other 3 artists feel? - YUI in her revival
  live to sing 2 songs that got the world crazy over her sure whatever, and
  <b>KANA-BOON's new music video</b> is... give me a minute *listens* (haha) not
  too bad it might be their best new song this year so yeah, it's going to be
  out in 2 weeks for an Anime so sure I'll review it then. Hey, there aren't
  many stuff releasing throughout the last couple of months this year so I'll
  listen to anything if I have the time haha<br />
  <br />So next week, I've been waiting for this for a while so let's hope it'll
  be good or else I'll just take the topic song and leave,
  <b>Takigawa Alisa's new EP.</b> Yeah, she hasn't been known well in Klassic
  Note, so let's hope I can give more of her this time around. So far it's only
  the single for Anime "DomeKano" (which I Reviewed) and the first album, right?
  Yeah, she isn't that easy to give anyways imo<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Hmm, it would seem like I've skipped forward according to the official Twitter
  of GREAT PRETENDER since they are still talking about Episode 18. Hmm... I
  really wonder if I should take a break for a week so that we can align with
  broadcast and then I realised that I don't really talk about this with any
  community or even anybody so I guess not haha. Hey, didn't take long for me to
  realise that I don't like to talk to people, even though people do tell me
  that I'm capable of doing that. Oh well, just... you have to take my sarcasm
  and everything if we have to talk haha I have no qualms just like how I type
  here to be honest. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... uh, it's
  the end of the year soon, I got my leave approved for the last 2 weeks of the
  year so we can Klassic Note again (see, this is also personal interest here),
  so maybe it's time to think about what to give for this year's song awards
  while enjoying my leave tomorrow!!! WOOOOOOOOOO~!!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay so if you
  would excuse me, I would like to enjoy more YouTube videos and sleep late and
  have late breakfast tomorrow again haha goodbye<br />

  P.S. Note to self: Please sleep early like your many doctors have advised you
  you may not look tired but you actually are don't push yourself &lt;= It's
  what I wish some girl who likes me will say someday
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>P.S. *fantasises some girl saying this to me* I'm tired... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span></div>
