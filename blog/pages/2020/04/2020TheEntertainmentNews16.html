Welcome back. My weekend... is practically today only haha workman...<br /><br />Anyways, first time in like, many weeks I'm ACTUALLY listening to the latesttunes while writing this intro. No livestreams (not that there aren't any), nonew videos, no old videos as background... I'm trying to give new songs here,man. But as you have known, the world isn't doing too well Japan included, butsuffice it to say many are either delaying their releases or not announcingrelease dates at any point. I mean, it's not that important, but we may be leftin the emptiness for a good time. Time to listen that Nu-chan best album haha AHSEE WHY NOW?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Okay, Anime this week was great, so let's talk about them first.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Kakushigoto03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kakushigoto</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "The floor was nice and cool, so I was just sticking my body onto it" Now    THAT is how we save on those electricity bills haha this girl knows  </div></blockquote>"Hime-chan... are you poor?" Hey kid, your sensei didn't teach you not todiscriminate? "Then I like being poor" Hime-chan no~!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this newepisode (#Kakushigoto03) where we find out at least one of the three friends ofHime-chan is a rich guy's kid lol, Hime-chan should really know that if you havethe capacity to move house especially to another plot of land in Japan, you areprobably well-off. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I mean, some don't even get to move house now THATis called poor lol. Okay, let's ignore that for now, and continue where we leftoff. With Hime-chan grown up, in the place she grew up in. First things first,and since she saw her old place, is that, her current abode looks the same asthis one. Yeah, the father replicated the house, probably in honour of themother, I would assume. For a modern setting, this obviously does not blend in,which also kind of leads Hime-chan into thinking they are not well off enough,even without the friend influence. Focusing on less of the house but on the poorpart, Hime-chan then thought the father is really not working much for money(she's not wrong though haha manga artists do not have stable income compared toa salaryman), and starts saving money like what my mother does when she startspicking up stuff I throw away haha. So yeah, he told the girl they aren't poor,but not like he explained why the house still looks traditional. To save moremoney, Hime-chan also skipped the house cleaning service the father normallytells her to call to clean the place, but you know. I would argue that10-year-old may be too young for cooking and/or housework, but the fathershouldn't be stopping her from doing so. And that's why we call these guysprotective of their kids haha. So, they got that Indo maid to cook for themhaha. Boy, is Indonesia getting references two many times (get it, two?) fortheir own good haha feels at home now considering I live in Southeast Asia haha.For a plot twist, as Kakushi talks about his situation to the other co-workersat his workplace, they then decided that keeping up with technology on his lineof work would be beneficial to their operations RIP the editor and eraser jobslol does that even exist. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next up, it's the sports festival. Don't askme how Kakushi managed to be in a harem in just like, the second half of thisepisode, but I think he did haha. Besides picking up all the women in town lmao(we'll get to why that later) including the sensei (lmao), since he thought hemight have to participate in the school event, he has been training. Yes, thismanga author. This weak, skinny piece of bamboo (lol), has been training. WithHime-chan too? Oh no Hime-chan we can't have you having muscles- That's whatmost online personalities looks like now so whatever our future generations aregoing to admire this generation of fakers haha. Coming back, he was thenreminded that the most important part of parents attending the sports festivalis... giving their kids their lunch. Yep, like a bento. And not like Kakushiknows how to bento. I mean, he can cook, but it takes a woman- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Hime-chan won the relay race yay, she got to eat lunch with many women shedoesn't know of (that's what we call "socialisation" lol), and... she didn't gohome with a new mother haha. To end this, the "kin" in<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kinniku" target="_blank">muscles</a> isdifferent when said as "<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/shakkin"  target="_blank"  >shakkin</a>"; look it up. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />[HOUSE COMPARISON SPECIAL!!

You know you taught your daughter well when she puts down the usual phoneline to call for house cleaning service and cleans the house herself now THAT'SWHAT I CALL A WOMAN!!

Imean, I don't not when we have to #StayHome haha. Again, Haru-chan<i>is</i> cute. <i>Dammit</i>, she's cute. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, in this new episode(#YesterdayWoUtatte03) where we carry on the story of Rikuo not getting his lovefrom Shinako, well at least he's getting it from this other girl. Hey, I'll takewhatever I just don't have one BOOM GOT ME lol. And so, we move on to talk about"mysterious Haru-chan" lmao. Her image though? Again, we don't know much abouther. Yet. What we do know though, is that it doesn't pay to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Can't you see I'm writing this as I watch- Okay let's talk about it, everything.Before we start, finally looked up on context, and yes, it's 1998 when theauthor started. So yeah, 1998 Tokyo, by the way. So... no iPhone, basically.Hand phones aren't really a thing then too, so payphones are all you see in thisepisode, by the way. So take note, kids, we're going to talk about that in aminute. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (I feel old now lol) So, firstly, about Haru-chan. Before theend of this episode, we know she's a girl (duh), she dropped out of high schoolbecause she was suspect to work part-time during her studies without good reason(we'll get to that in a while), and likes Rikuo. Hey, that's good enough forstarters haha I don't even- Okay, (haha) but this episode, we learnt the reasonsbehind her current situation. She probably worked part-time at that time tosupport her family, considering she got introduced to a new stepdad from themother. So yeah, you can think about it yourself. Shinako may have felt badbeing her teacher back then, but that's not to stop her from living her lifeanyways. It's also quite a good reflection of society to where studies can bringyou, because compare Rikuo to Haru-chan and their only difference is<strike>their gender</strike> one graduated from high school. So yeah, veryshowing of Japan's education and job system in their country too in the '90s, Isuppose. Then, what happened. Haru-chan got stood up. I would say that whoevereven DARES to stand up to her in a date should be killed (lol), but hey, it's agood setup. Mainly due to the flu virus going around which is not as bad as theone going around in 2020 right now (lmao), but hey, from Rikuo to his buddy atwork and to Shinako, the rainy season has gotten many people sick, I guess. It'skind of obligatory though, I would argue, for Shinako to share concern to Rikuoas much as she has been all these years, and of course, for Rikuo to also do itin return considering (1) he's not a kid anymore and (2) he can actually feelwhat it means to do so, to Shinako in this case. Sadly, well not really butunfortunately, he missed the meetup he had with Haru-chan becuase someone got apair of movie tickets and would love to have a date with him. I mean, 1998 mewill NOT have chosen to take a nap even if I've taken care of my friend till5am. NEVER. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> That or, I'll have an alarm ready, to say the least. Still,Rikuo's not an a**hole for standing her up, but you know, damage has been done,so... haha. I really enjoyed such a simplistic yet strong, or shall we say,emotional touch on such a timeless thing we call relationships after all theseyears. So yeah, it's a wonderful episode. What was of course, icing on the cakethis episode, if you have not noticed, is how they lack communication other thanphysical contact. Yep, this might take nottalgia trip to find out, but sufficeis to say that since phones aren't really convenient back then, people can onlygo to fixed communication facilities and hope someone won't stand you up. Now in2020 with everyone with a portable phone in their hand, if you stand me up I'lljust b*tch about it on you on the phone haha. Or WhatsApp, typically. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>So yeah, it was quite a time back then. Even so, if you haven't felt it, theemotions flowing through this episode is really good, from Shinako's subtleentrance to see Rikuo (hey, we know you still concerned about him after yourdumped his confession in the trash haha), to Haru-chan's initiative to<strike>date</strike> go watch a movie with the guy, to Haru-chan trying to getover the fact that she is less important than someone who is technically unwellbut she could have been accounted for at some point... Hey Haru-chan just wantsto be friends, bro. You have to be so bad on her? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Good people are hardto find. To end this, as a final advice Haru-chan? If you're used to white lieslike (how your mother probably lied to you about her marriage with your fatherBOOM GOT HER haha) these, then too bad this honest guy will take you nowhere.Start liking honestly, girl. Being honest is already a rare trait in many peoplenowadays, I feel like I should still be awarded for NOT being able to lie.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Maybe that's what made me alone today haha DAMMIT RIKUO lol cya guysnext week.<br />["Haru-chan kawaii kara Haru-chan dasu" haha not talking about you Futon-chanlol]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S-gm1Xj0nMs/XpwScynEuHI/AAAAAAAA6h8/DQNX8tbIyRw-04nUDdnxHZjy6WTZL8YVACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday02_haru2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            She ask<br />            (ooo yeah)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NvFWuIxaNBY/XpwSc1_ActI/AAAAAAAA6iA/bCvtf7eg1gYizQHloeCR94j-l7dNlJ-0ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday02_haru6.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            She dress<br />            (haha o~kay)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Firstly, windowshopping. Well, they spent money so I wouldn't say that now, but yeah, this isfor compensation for when the father LITERALLY stopped her from going out withother people. Okay, with guys it's understandable but with girls? Come on, dad.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Kaguya's objective here is to, since Miyuki's birthday isnear, prepare something for him by asking from the<a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>. Sadly, aswe have found out, their relationship might not be too great to even know ofanything that would give Kaguya a good clue, so that was kind of a waste.Ignoring the objective though, I don't think that Kaguya is into Miyuki, butmaybe she can try dating the father and she'll think he's like the son too justjoking Kei-chan is pretty awesome haha you're second to Hayasaka right now imohaha. And yes, thanks to the sis now, we also know how much of a man Miyuki ishaha, which probably resembles the father because I think in season 1 we gotsuch an insight too haha. Well, so long as Kaguya likes him for it I don't carelmao. Then, the day arrives. Earlier on though, angel side Kaguya prepared a(literal wedding sized) cake for his day, but man, she then realised what shedid before actually giving it to him at the end of the school day. Hmm... I knowit's kind of for dramatic effect to show her own inner fighting, but yeah, maybea bit of a stretch (lol a kid for a judge in court), but suffice it to sayKaguya did the most matured thing ever by<strike>  telling him to not open the cupboard</strike>cutting him a piece of the action. Get it, cake? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also, he can cut herup too if she presents herself as a birthday present- And a birthday presenttoo? (Don't tell her that in Chinese culture giving someone a fan is asking forthem to separate with you haha) Haha you don't know how happy that guy is nowlol. Despite all this, Shirogane himself is still in disbelief that Kaguya didall these for him on his day. I mean, the narrator is literally laying the truthon him and he thinks is a dream?? Come on. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, he gotta know, sosomehow he has to use his wits to find out for himself. Sadly, the seeds havebeen planted, as Kaguya walked in with Chika-chan only to realise she doesn'tknow of his birthday? Yes, apparently her haha. If not for Ishigami's intrusionto the room and telling about his birthday present to him (what a creep, likingguys) (haha), we might see a Kaguya break into pieces and probably die ofhappiness from seeing the guy he likes with the gift she gave him. Hey, ladies,say that isn't the best thing you want to see in a relationship EVER haha she islearning. All in all, fantastic episode, it may have been dragged out at somepoint I don't know, but you know, all is fair in love and war. Fair as in,Kaguya as a personal assistant and Shirogane only has his wits or maybe hissister to throw him off his usual image lol bye<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YDwvcgJte7w/XpwSMWjIjpI/AAAAAAAA6h0/MHGxFg1qCLo9Tz_vaDcjG2JJZ8aq5tkNgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kaguyasamaS202_chika2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Also an animation drawing demo haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nM8S0FE8PR8/XpwSMYEkcII/AAAAAAAA6hw/SwsvEVDhHd43u5HOF6C3_9v0ld5KTvgAQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kaguyasamaS202_kaguya5.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Nice haha Shirogane may you never get laid          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. If you read the monologue of Kaguya when Chika-chan pounces on Kei-chanyou'll notice it's very similar to when Chika-chan (sort of) "pounces" onShirogane haha not even joking go back season 1 and compare (yes the narrationsaid it: the joke is Kei-chan is not a man)<br />P.P.S. "If it's a question of feelings, that's easy" And Hayasaka is that arope?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> No this is not the hentai genre what are you doing toKaguya-sama~!!... haha<br />[<strike>Koga Aoi</strike> Kaguya is great so here's a GIF hehe]<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M1kmXwTvvrc/XpwR2L1lZrI/AAAAAAAA6ho/alL3YNf3JHc9H3KAILQ_S4MZzWtSlkyUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kaguyasamaS202_frantic.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Perfection haha</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>As I'm listening now, <b>Scenarioart's new album</b> is... not exactly awesome,but man is it awesome when you start forgetting all the previews you've heard sofar haha. Again, which is still justifying me listening to previews immediatelyand forgetting all about them so I can still like the new songs- they are greatbtw. It depends on what type of Scenarioart you like more, I guess. I can takeconventional Rock music them, but we know we aren't here for that, so I don'tknow why they still have a lot of songs on that aspect. Hey, maybe I'm not intothem yet. Maybe. But I'm giving a lot than a couple more, so we shall see.<b>Suzuki Masayoshi's best album</b> which includes Anime "Kaguya-sama" openingtheme songs this second season is... I didn't review it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, convinceme to listen to like 40+ songs sung by someone many generations back then mehaha. So yeah, only just giving the one. On the topic of giving theme songs, I'malso giving <b>Anime "Yesterday wo Utatte" theme song</b> (yes there is notopening or ending it's just the one, but I suppose changing over the series)from yourness' new digital single which released last week, and... I think I canused to them. But again, not buying them just yet because we know people who canwrite better melodies then them haha I'm just here for the mood. I haven'tgotten time to go listen to Anime "Kakushigoto" theme songs but the ending themeis coming in a special release end May so I guess I'll wait for that instead ofdig another old singer's best album HAHA SUZUKI-SAN GOTCHA lol okay (in case youdidn't catch that joke the above ending theme song is sung by veteransinger-songwriter Ootaki Eiichi)<br /><br />On news in Twitter and beyond that is still music related because everyone isonline now,<b  ><a    href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1251502061125959681"    target="_blank"    >GLIM SPANKY</a  >,  <a    href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1251137009210413056"    target="_blank"    >Ryokuoushoku Shakai</a  >,  <a    href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1251708585534357504"    target="_blank"    >cinema staff</a  ></b>are among many who released new videos (from themselves or not) (okay cinemastaff was a tour documentary not live performance) to give a little ofthemselves online in this tiring period, so I'm only nothing but thankfulbecause you know, they aren't famous enough to reach here lol.<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new song</b> is... meh haha, and I'll probably givenano.RIPE's new single a chance since I'm not listening to much liao haha<br /><br />Talking about next week, there's <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new album</b> whichwon't come out on physical for now because Sony Music but we can still listen toit, and still slated for release is <b>SpecialThanks' new album</b> that'scoming soon so yay for new band formation since their hiatus like two years ago,and yes <b>nano.RIPE's new single</b> for Anime. Tell me when they don't doAnime so I can actually give them songs haha like really. Also, my life? Tell mewhen I'm not busy with work from home so I can actually listen to a couple ofreleases that have been sitting there for like, momths. Nu-chan I'm sorry~!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: Lol just realised I didn't even write an outro. Well it's Monday now so Ihope you have a "beautiful Sunday" haha that's a Scenarioart new song title hahabye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
