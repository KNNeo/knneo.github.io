Hey, everyone. Welcome back. My weekend... is practically today only haha work
man...<br />
<br />
Anyways, first time in like, many weeks I'm ACTUALLY listening to the latest
tunes while writing this intro. No livestreams (not that there aren't any), no
new videos, no old videos as background... I'm trying to give new songs here,
man. But as you have known, the world isn't doing too well Japan included, but
suffice it to say many are either delaying their releases or not announcing
release dates at any point. I mean, it's not that important, but we may be left
in the emptiness for a good time. Time to listen that Nu-chan best album haha AH
SEE WHY NOW?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />
<br />
Okay, Anime this week was great, so let's talk about them first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Kakushigoto03">
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span
    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kakushigoto</span>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "The floor was nice and cool, so I was just sticking my body onto it" Now
    THAT is how we save on those electricity bills haha this girl knows
  </div>
</blockquote>
"Hime-chan... are you poor?" Hey kid, your sensei didn't teach you not to
discriminate? "Then I like being poor" Hime-chan no~!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new
episode (#Kakushigoto03) where we find out at least one of the three friends of
Hime-chan is a rich guy's kid lol, Hime-chan should really know that if you have
the capacity to move house especially to another plot of land in Japan, you are
probably well-off. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I mean, some don't even get to move house now THAT
is called poor lol. Okay, let's ignore that for now, and continue where we left
off. With Hime-chan grown up, in the place she grew up in. First things first,
and since she saw her old place, is that, her current abode looks the same as
this one. Yeah, the father replicated the house, probably in honour of the
mother, I would assume. For a modern setting, this obviously does not blend in,
which also kind of leads Hime-chan into thinking they are not well off enough,
even without the friend influence. Focusing on less of the house but on the poor
part, Hime-chan then thought the father is really not working much for money
(she's not wrong though haha manga artists do not have stable income compared to
a salaryman), and starts saving money like what my mother does when she starts
picking up stuff I throw away haha. So yeah, he told the girl they aren't poor,
but not like he explained why the house still looks traditional. To save more
money, Hime-chan also skipped the house cleaning service the father normally
tells her to call to clean the place, but you know. I would argue that
10-year-old may be too young for cooking and/or housework, but the father
shouldn't be stopping her from doing so. And that's why we call these guys
protective of their kids haha. So, they got that Indo maid to cook for them
haha. Boy, is Indonesia getting references two many times (get it, two?) for
their own good haha feels at home now considering I live in Southeast Asia haha.
For a plot twist, as Kakushi talks about his situation to the other co-workers
at his workplace, they then decided that keeping up with technology on his line
of work would be beneficial to their operations RIP the editor and eraser jobs
lol does that even exist. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next up, it's the sports festival. Don't ask
me how Kakushi managed to be in a harem in just like, the second half of this
episode, but I think he did haha. Besides picking up all the women in town lmao
(we'll get to why that later) including the sensei (lmao), since he thought he
might have to participate in the school event, he has been training. Yes, this
manga author. This weak, skinny piece of bamboo (lol), has been training. With
Hime-chan too? Oh no Hime-chan we can't have you having muscles- That's what
most online personalities looks like now so whatever our future generations are
going to admire this generation of fakers haha. Coming back, he was then
reminded that the most important part of parents attending the sports festival
is... giving their kids their lunch. Yep, like a bento. And not like Kakushi
knows how to bento. I mean, he can cook, but it takes a woman- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
Hime-chan won the relay race yay, she got to eat lunch with many women she
doesn't know of (that's what we call "socialisation" lol), and... she didn't go
home with a new mother haha. To end this, the "kin" in
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kinniku" target="_blank">muscles</a> is
different when said as "<a
  href="https://jisho.org/search/shakkin"
  target="_blank"
  >shakkin</a
>"; look it up. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />
[HOUSE COMPARISON SPECIAL!! So yes, three sets of thumbnails btw if you don't
know why Hime-chan it's because of the wife lmao]<br />

P.S. "I'm called
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/attoiuma" target="_blank">Ato Yuuma</a>" I
mean, if you know what the name of this temp is for... haha this show has too
many word puns (Basically, it flies by so fast because he's too good, which
means this person is likely good enough to draw his own stuff ie. be a manga
author himself; the name is describing his existence in Kakushi's workplace)<br />
P.P.S. You know you taught your daughter well when she puts down the usual phone
line to call for house cleaning service and cleans the house herself now THAT'S
WHAT I CALL A WOMAN!! Okay the misogyny in me it's not funny you can go to hell
haha Hime-chan

You know, it's not everyday you have a woman (or girl) chasing after you. I
mean, I don't not when we have to #StayHome haha. Again, Haru-chan
<em>is</em> cute. <em>Dammit</em>, she's cute. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, in this new episode
(#YesterdayWoUtatte03) where we carry on the story of Rikuo not getting his love
from Shinako, well at least he's getting it from this other girl. Hey, I'll take
whatever I just don't have one BOOM GOT ME lol. And so, we move on to talk about
"mysterious Haru-chan" lmao. Her image though? Again, we don't know much about
her. Yet. What we do know though, is that it doesn't pay to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
Can't you see I'm writing this as I watch- Okay let's talk about it, everything.
Before we start, finally looked up on context, and yes, it's 1998 when the
author started. So yeah, 1998 Tokyo, by the way. So... no iPhone, basically.
Hand phones aren't really a thing then too, so payphones are all you see in this
episode, by the way. So take note, kids, we're going to talk about that in a
minute. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (I feel old now lol) So, firstly, about Haru-chan. Before the
end of this episode, we know she's a girl (duh), she dropped out of high school
because she was suspect to work part-time during her studies without good reason
(we'll get to that in a while), and likes Rikuo. Hey, that's good enough for
starters haha I don't even- Okay, (haha) but this episode, we learnt the reasons
behind her current situation. She probably worked part-time at that time to
support her family, considering she got introduced to a new stepdad from the
mother. So yeah, you can think about it yourself. Shinako may have felt bad
being her teacher back then, but that's not to stop her from living her life
anyways. It's also quite a good reflection of society to where studies can bring
you, because compare Rikuo to Haru-chan and their only difference is
<strike>their gender</strike> one graduated from high school. So yeah, very
showing of Japan's education and job system in their country too in the '90s, I
suppose. Then, what happened. Haru-chan got stood up. I would say that whoever
even DARES to stand up to her in a date should be killed (lol), but hey, it's a
good setup. Mainly due to the flu virus going around which is not as bad as the
one going around in 2020 right now (lmao), but hey, from Rikuo to his buddy at
work and to Shinako, the rainy season has gotten many people sick, I guess. It's
kind of obligatory though, I would argue, for Shinako to share concern to Rikuo
as much as she has been all these years, and of course, for Rikuo to also do it
in return considering (1) he's not a kid anymore and (2) he can actually feel
what it means to do so, to Shinako in this case. Sadly, well not really but
unfortunately, he missed the meetup he had with Haru-chan becuase someone got a
pair of movie tickets and would love to have a date with him. I mean, 1998 me
will NOT have chosen to take a nap even if I've taken care of my friend till
5am. NEVER. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> That or, I'll have an alarm ready, to say the least. Still,
Rikuo's not an a**hole for standing her up, but you know, damage has been done,
so... haha. I really enjoyed such a simplistic yet strong, or shall we say,
emotional touch on such a timeless thing we call relationships after all these
years. So yeah, it's a wonderful episode. What was of course, icing on the cake
this episode, if you have not noticed, is how they lack communication other than
physical contact. Yep, this might take nottalgia trip to find out, but suffice
is to say that since phones aren't really convenient back then, people can only
go to fixed communication facilities and hope someone won't stand you up. Now in
2020 with everyone with a portable phone in their hand, if you stand me up I'll
just b*tch about it on you on the phone haha. Or WhatsApp, typically. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
So yeah, it was quite a time back then. Even so, if you haven't felt it, the
emotions flowing through this episode is really good, from Shinako's subtle
entrance to see Rikuo (hey, we know you still concerned about him after your
dumped his confession in the trash haha), to Haru-chan's initiative to
<strike>date</strike> go watch a movie with the guy, to Haru-chan trying to get
over the fact that she is less important than someone who is technically unwell
but she could have been accounted for at some point... Hey Haru-chan just wants
to be friends, bro. You have to be so bad on her? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Good people are hard
to find. To end this, as a final advice Haru-chan? If you're used to white lies
like (how your mother probably lied to you about her marriage with your father
BOOM GOT HER haha) these, then too bad this honest guy will take you nowhere.
Start liking honestly, girl. Being honest is already a rare trait in many people
nowadays, I feel like I should still be awarded for NOT being able to lie.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Maybe that's what made me alone today haha DAMMIT RIKUO lol cya guys
next week.<br />
["Haru-chan kawaii kara Haru-chan dasu" haha not talking about you Futon-chan
lol]<br />

From the sister, I think we can determine that something is wrong with the one
guy hey happy birthday Shirogane, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Haha Kaguya-sama you want
to date his sister now? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS202) we... are
heavily involved with the Shirogane family haha not the father. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay,
stop laughing so much like Kaguya we got story to talk about. Firstly, window
shopping. Well, they spent money so I wouldn't say that now, but yeah, this is
for compensation for when the father LITERALLY stopped her from going out with
other people. Okay, with guys it's understandable but with girls? Come on, dad.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Kaguya's objective here is to, since Miyuki's birthday is
near, prepare something for him by asking from the
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>. Sadly, as
we have found out, their relationship might not be too great to even know of
anything that would give Kaguya a good clue, so that was kind of a waste.
Ignoring the objective though, I don't think that Kaguya is into Miyuki, but
maybe she can try dating the father and she'll think he's like the son too just
joking Kei-chan is pretty awesome haha you're second to Hayasaka right now imo
haha. And yes, thanks to the sis now, we also know how much of a man Miyuki is
haha, which probably resembles the father because I think in season 1 we got
such an insight too haha. Well, so long as Kaguya likes him for it I don't care
lmao. Then, the day arrives. Earlier on though, angel side Kaguya prepared a
(literal wedding sized) cake for his day, but man, she then realised what she
did before actually giving it to him at the end of the school day. Hmm... I know
it's kind of for dramatic effect to show her own inner fighting, but yeah, maybe
a bit of a stretch (lol a kid for a judge in court), but suffice it to say
Kaguya did the most matured thing ever by<strike>
  telling him to not open the cupboard</strike
>
cutting him a piece of the action. Get it, cake? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also, he can cut her
up too if she presents herself as a birthday present- And a birthday present
too? (Don't tell her that in Chinese culture giving someone a fan is asking for
them to separate with you haha) Haha you don't know how happy that guy is now
lol. Despite all this, Shirogane himself is still in disbelief that Kaguya did
all these for him on his day. I mean, the narrator is literally laying the truth
on him and he thinks is a dream?? Come on. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, he gotta know, so
somehow he has to use his wits to find out for himself. Sadly, the seeds have
been planted, as Kaguya walked in with Chika-chan only to realise she doesn't
know of his birthday? Yes, apparently her haha. If not for Ishigami's intrusion
to the room and telling about his birthday present to him (what a creep, liking
guys) (haha), we might see a Kaguya break into pieces and probably die of
happiness from seeing the guy he likes with the gift she gave him. Hey, ladies,
say that isn't the best thing you want to see in a relationship EVER haha she is
learning. All in all, fantastic episode, it may have been dragged out at some
point I don't know, but you know, all is fair in love and war. Fair as in,
Kaguya as a personal assistant and Shirogane only has his wits or maybe his
sister to throw him off his usual image lol bye<br />

P.S. If you read the monologue of Kaguya when Chika-chan pounces on Kei-chan
you'll notice it's very similar to when Chika-chan (sort of) "pounces" on
Shirogane haha not even joking go back season 1 and compare (yes the narration
said it: the joke is Kei-chan is not a man)<br />
P.P.S. "If it's a question of feelings, that's easy" And Hayasaka is that a
rope?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> No this is not the hentai genre what are you doing to
Kaguya-sama~!!... haha<br />

As I'm listening now, <b>Scenarioart's new album</b> is... not exactly awesome,
but man is it awesome when you start forgetting all the previews you've heard so
far haha. Again, which is still justifying me listening to previews immediately
and forgetting all about them so I can still like the new songs- they are great
btw. It depends on what type of Scenarioart you like more, I guess. I can take
conventional Rock music them, but we know we aren't here for that, so I don't
know why they still have a lot of songs on that aspect. Hey, maybe I'm not into
them yet. Maybe. But I'm giving a lot than a couple more, so we shall see.
<b>Suzuki Masayoshi's best album</b> which includes Anime "Kaguya-sama" opening
theme songs this second season is... I didn't review it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, convince
me to listen to like 40+ songs sung by someone many generations back then me
haha. So yeah, only just giving the one. On the topic of giving theme songs, I'm
also giving <b>Anime "Yesterday wo Utatte" theme song</b> (yes there is not
opening or ending it's just the one, but I suppose changing over the series)
from yourness' new digital single which released last week, and... I think I can
used to them. But again, not buying them just yet because we know people who can
write better melodies then them haha I'm just here for the mood. I haven't
gotten time to go listen to Anime "Kakushigoto" theme songs but the ending theme
is coming in a special release end May so I guess I'll wait for that instead of
dig another old singer's best album HAHA SUZUKI-SAN GOTCHA lol okay (in case you
didn't catch that joke the above ending theme song is sung by veteran
singer-songwriter Ootaki Eiichi)<br />
<br />
On news in Twitter and beyond that is still music related because everyone is
online now,

are among many who released new videos (from themselves or not) (okay cinema
staff was a tour documentary not live performance) to give a little of
themselves online in this tiring period, so I'm only nothing but thankful
because you know, they aren't famous enough to reach here lol.
<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new song</b> is... meh haha, and I'll probably give
nano.RIPE's new single a chance since I'm not listening to much liao haha<br />
<br />
Talking about next week, there's <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new album</b> which
won't come out on physical for now because Sony Music but we can still listen to
it, and still slated for release is <b>SpecialThanks' new album</b> that's
coming soon so yay for new band formation since their hiatus like two years ago,
and yes <b>nano.RIPE's new single</b> for Anime. Tell me when they don't do
Anime so I can actually give them songs haha like really. Also, my life? Tell me
when I'm not busy with work from home so I can actually listen to a couple of
releases that have been sitting there for like, momths. Nu-chan I'm sorry~!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Lol just realised I didn't even write an outro. Well it's Monday now so I
hope you have a "beautiful Sunday" haha that's a Scenarioart new song title haha
bye<br />
