<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vvgD174LcwE/XqUOQgUmouI/AAAAAAAA6pk/iDNa4xay1oUr63NHeGZlqw_8sewXkXY1gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto04_spirits.jpg"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>In case you didn't notice the spelling mistakes here and there (if any) over thepast few weeks, it's because I did not have those travelling times betweenoffice and home to be able to spell check my blog posts now which is what Inormally do otherwise, so... I'm trying to not screw things up here haha restassured<br /><br />Another week, another set of new episodes, I guess. Somehow had an urge to watchmore Shinako or Kana-chan if you're into her instead of her role in the showhaha time to get more bromides lmao shut up I gotta spend money when cooped athome okay?? Haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Kakushigoto04">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kakushigoto</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Apparently artistic jobs aren't your thing" BURN haha Hime-chan don't mind    us your dad is DEFINITELY not doing an art-related job  </div></blockquote>Wow this guy had to use an alias in public so that his real name wouldn't betied to the manga artist so that his daughter wouldn't find out about it lol ifyou're daughter is a detective then she will bro haha. (By the way my alias inJapan is "Aozaki Shouhei", no joke, just look at my Twitter now) In this newepisode (#Kakushigoto04) just like every episode, a good analogy is like someonetrying to grind the ink tablet to write calligraphy, but just that you neverstop grinding until the ink gets so thin and dry but you're still doing it.That's... how resilient the jokes are in this series haha. Okay, plot. Firstly,fortune telling. Hey, them girls gotta do it, and people do it around the world,and I paid thousands to change my phone number because my mom believed is in it,so... it's a woman thing man, just saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Hime-chan got intofortune telling with names, in which we also found out that Kakushi debutted asa manga artist with his real name so that's a problem when he starts using it inpublic eg. his credit card purchases but hey, the name he gave himself is tenthousand times worse which is probably why then his manga is selling likehotcakes. Thought to be influenced by fortune telling though, is the new editorand everyone in the editing studio, though it's more like an coincidence whenthe maid Nadila introduced to Hime-chan her native way to doing fortunetelling... lol the new editor liked it though haha. Next, Kakushi gets to drawstuff. I know it sounds normal but hear me out (lol), it's for Hime-chan'sassignment. Yeah, now that's a problem. So Kakushi is apparently stuck betweenafraid of being too good for the daughter's standards as a kid (if you wouldrecall her making curry that was too professional haha "Namaste!" lmao) and hispride as a manga artist for not showing off his skills lol thought I would arguein this case the latter took more attention since he was asked to draw sceneryand... he isn't great at it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So you know, he wouldn't be found outanyways. Still, with his pride back in place, he still kind of wants to bebetter (even though we know art style doesn't matter in manga because really,shit drawing manga get their Anime adaptation too just watch any number of showsin my Anime List haha), so... he takes on a (kids) art lesson lol. Taught bynone other than the one young idol high schooler he found on the streets a whileago haha what a coincidence. So cue HAREM PART TWO!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This series isgreat haha Kakushi just NEVER explains his intentions for doing anything to themanyways lol. Besides accidentally picking up Naru-chan, he also picked up thesensei once again (lol) by proving to her that he did not participate inHime-chan's assignment so she wouldn't get flagged for it haha she probablywon't even if you help. Anyways, the two go to the zoo, and the sensei gets towatch. Haha that might sound cliche for a date lol, but what's more of a clicheis when she gets found out by the other kids from school alone, and thought shewas solo dating ie. going out alone while missing his/her (probably) deadpartner haha this show is great. To conclude, I would like to bring yourattention to whatever Hime-chan was recollecting about at the start, and at theend, as a grown up. So we now know that the mother played a real improtant partof her life as a kid, from making the boxes for each year (the ones after 17 isstill a mystery maybe) (Haha did I hint it was from the dad? I, uh, did somefortune telling for this series lol no I didn't read the original work at all)to their trip with the mother to the zoo when Hime was younger... ah, it wasn'timagination after all girl, you have seen it before as a photo. As the singlefather family memories surface episode after episode, we might ever be closer tothis confrontation at some point, and boy would I be ready with<strike>manuscript paper</strike> tissue paper to cry when it happens haha.Meanwhile, we can still enjoy a good amount of episodes worth of jokes,misunderstandings (mostly from the "women of the streets" lmao) and Hime-chaninnocence while we still can. We can, I assure you. I don't want the reality hitto happen this quickly, really. Hime-chan is still cute let her stay like thisin this series for as long as we can hehe<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vvgD174LcwE/XqUOQgUmouI/AAAAAAAA6pk/iDNa4xay1oUr63NHeGZlqw_8sewXkXY1gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto04_spirits.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            They be trying to summon the mother back haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yH1Y_RGqpkI/XqUORIj_51I/AAAAAAAA6po/NM04WTG7mU8MQESKRKBBxgT7g2OHDL0-wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto04_family.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Talking about the mother... lol can't see her face          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. I swear in the 16 years old box is definitely a porno mag, I tell you.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. "You haven't even debutted (as a manga artist) yet? How dare you (thinkof an alias) already!!" I mean, why can't we? Haha also bantering with SakuraAyane (who voices the one girl) sounds like something I would dream of lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="YesterdayWoUtatte04">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Yesterday wo Utatte</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "And once you get decent, it gets kind of boring" Yeah, he's not wrong haha  </div></blockquote>Man, did I jump into this faster than I wanted maybe because I'm thinking of<strike>Kana-chan</strike> Shinako haha okay let's talk about not her first lol.But seriously Shinako stop trying to date his brother!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay in thisnew episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte04), we talk mostly about Rou-kun. Rou... he'syour <a href="https://jisho.org/search/wakai" target="_blank">wakai</a><a href="https://jisho.org/search/dansei" target="_blank">dansei</a> type ofproblems, all of them. He's young, he's motivated to pursue his dreams, he...can't get relationships. Hey, aren't we all? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Okay maybe not themotivation for me but) So yeah, we talk about why Rou-kun matters in thisseries. Firstly, what we know thus far. He's the brother also technicallychildhood friend to but not really, to Shinako who is his neighbour back inKanazawa. Problem is, Shinako is only here to take care of the brother Yuu, andyeah probably regards Rou as like a brother or something. Like family, thanlovers to any extent. Is that good though? For Rou, it might not be good enough.Between juggling his current art school goal and dealing with living outside ofthe old house back in Kanazawa, he has a lot of things going on while stillremembering the past. I mean, like Shinako, he also can't get over the fact ofhis brother's absence. However, compared to hers which is affection throughcare, his is snatching the spotlight through Shinako herself. You see, if youlike someone... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, but we already know Shinako is probably aroundthe grey area but slightly towards the love side between sympathy and love inthis case, so Rou you already lost in this aspect, bro. It is hard to move on,as we can see in Shinako's case of rejecting Rikuo, and whatevermisunderstanding of rivals there is at the convenience store lol, but suffice itto say that Rou at this point still thinks that he has a chance with Shinako, Iguess. That ambiguity, is his presence, and probably his drive to screw thingsup between the lot. Again, as we know so far, Rikuo got rejected, but not likethat boy knows about this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To be honest? I don't have such problems soI don't really get how it feels to be in this, but I would argue like Shinako,Rou is also stuck with this past that he rather forget. Though obviously Shinakois getting a harder time in doing this compared to him, as the boy tries to pickup his life altogether so he can, at least, prove to Shinako that he's grown upafter all. (I mean, being an a**hole kid by leaving your bro at home in bedwhile asking the girl to go see fireworks? DUDE WHAT THE F-) Maybe it's thislack of a grown up story, is what will drag him down to whatever he wants in hisrelationship between Shinako haha. I don't care personally because you know, Idig the Rikuo x Haru-chan ship now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I hope for the sake of the series,the Anime is still throwing us character focus episodes so we can actually cometo some confrontation (or probably misunderstanding clarification, with mostromance shows like this they gotta) after giving us this much context behind alltheir stories and their motives within this love... rectangle? Should we evencount Haru-chan in? Haha we will once Rou-kun starts liking her haha oh thefourth guy is me? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah I like Haru-chan and Shinako too but I'm notreally into shorties so... *gets punched by Haru*<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mOjCZkRU9Cw/XqUBI3lB1gI/AAAAAAAA6pQ/dYtY4KsHtHIaWr2zoXljQ1Q9iiqtE4y3QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday04_shinako3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Since kid them is so cute then might as well<br />            (Kana-chan is cuter hands down haha)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EbGzf5AM47s/XqUBJhbKEMI/AAAAAAAA6pU/GmzyQdvvq6Q1BIpzBqJFO3QUDACF0H7MgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday04_rou4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Since kid them is so cute then might as well<br />            ("Too pure pure boy" lmao)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "Are you never going to get over my brother?" BOOM GOT HER man that is thebest burn this series by far haha<br />P.P.S. "Could you wear a maid outfit?" Man, the cafe manager knows Haru-chan haspotential haha <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bqanime" id="KaguyaSamaS203">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "They say nothing pleases a man more than a woman being interested in his    interests" Sadly for Kaguya-sama, this will not turn out well like most    other cases haha hey what do I know  </div></blockquote>Ah, now I see where this is going, with such an abrupt "end". Hey, finally newcharacter next episode? We sure hope it happens. Man, at this rate we might beable to get season three- Okay in this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS203) we... get alittle sad. Hey, probably the saddest of episodes in this series so far, so I'lltake one once in a blue moon. Talking about the moon, (I call that perfectcomedic timing haha) we start with watching the full moon. Well, the fullest ofmoons. Yes, if you need an astronomy lesson here because I took one inuniversity, there is one time of the year that the moon will be particularlyclose to any part of the planet, and that is normally where many like to gatherto look at the moon, amongst the 11 other times the moon lights up in fullbrightness. So, didn't know Shirogane is a fan too (I mean, I sort of became onefor a while after going through those lectures too tbh), but yeah, he may be toomuch of a fan. So much so he is so distracted about it, he doesn't even carewhat he does to anyone. And sadly or not, Kaguya set herself to be his target.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I say that as a joke but, you see all those lovey-dovey stuff theydid? I mean, I've never been that enthusiastic about anything to do this towomen or maybe I did, but hey, I'm not Shirogane. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this battle alone,Kaguya probably lost to the moon until the guy realises what he did but notuntil you hear the story about<a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter"  target="_blank"  >Kaguyahime</a>(if you need a summary and don't bother clicking on the wiki page OR if youmissed watching "RikeKoi" story goes woman on moon gets born on Earth taken upby a man who cuts bamboos and they eventually fall in love with each other, butshe has to go back to the moon, rejecting all suitors so that one day she can goback to her true love) and think, hey maybe Kaguya-sama is like her too. Well, Iguess so. Shirogane is right though; the guy did not take the hint. Besides,I'll live forever as long as I don't live forever as an old man haha please keepme young immortality pill just like Kuro-san from "Kyokou Suiri" haha. Then, wemove on to the epic conclusion (okay just joking but it's) of the studentcouncil of the school year. Yep, The President is done. He got tired. Doing thatwork for two years relying on caffeine to survive (lol), he earned his rewardfor carrying out his duties way more than he worked for it, so he deserves abreak. And thus, the Council is disbanded. Well, I guess that's the end then cyaguys next week for the other two shows <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, obviously that did NOThappen, because Kaguya wanted it. Hey, somehow I feel that she is being moredesperate than usual in this season, but seeing everyone pack up stuff whichbrings back our memories too maybe not Ishigami lol like for example the Frenchexchange (Sally-chan you will be missed haha you can follow her on Twitterthough not like I do lol) and Ishigami being hit to Shirogane wearing rabbitears (kyawawawa haha MARRIAGE) to everything else Kashiwagi related... lol thosewere great memories. (I would argue that Kaguya's suggestion for Student Councilis *chef kiss*) And as they end, Kaguya felt empty. Yeah, not just for Myu-kun(lmao), but also for the rest of them okay maybe not Chika-chan haha lmao Kaguyaplease she got this Anime millions of views on YouTube with that one endingsong. So yeah, another year then, I guess since high school is 3 years long. Butin this case though, and that's where the new character will pop in, iselections for the Student Council, and now that Shirogane has to do this allover again, he might either have some competition or maybe have some more helpsince he's working his a** all the time anyways. Which one might it be featuringthis love rival though?

I'm skipping nano.RIPE's new single since I'm really not into themanymore now so next album maybe? Haha meanwhile<b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new album</b> is great, but not as great as I expectedfrom their first album (this is the second), but you know, I'll try to give afew. Okay maybe only just the one topic song since I'm only trying to find songsto get hype now. <b>SpecialThanks' new album</b>, however, is raking in all thesongs in Klassic Note so I'm giving them as much as I can, those short but sweetsongs, happy and sad. It's their new band formation, and I'm glad I can get intosome punk rock once in a while. Thank goodness that's not all of them otherwiseI might just leave haha<br /><br />On news on Twitter and beyond if any, <b>VELTPUNCH's new music video</b> isonset to the three-part music video release every month until I guess an albumis announced so HYPE!! (Mostly because of that like on the tweet hehe)<b>Aimer releases live music performance videos</b> on her YouTube channel so besure to check them out (orchestra anything emo from Aimer is weird imo)<b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai did another video</b> for "FIRST TAKE" who strives toonly give artist one chance to make it good (and it is good),<b>SpecialThanks released more music videos</b> in view of their album releasethis week, <b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new music previews</b> as I'm constantly trying toavoid them to not ruin the first impression experience I so desire,<b>UNLIMITS released their library of songs</b> since they left major to musicsubscription services which includes of course Apple Music Japan, and<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES pumped out a new music video</b> because you know, theycan. Again, not a fan of music videos because the music matters more thanwhatever the video can present. Nothing beats the beats of imagination, bro. AskVELTPUNCH how they imagined their songs that music video is really good hehe<br /><br />For next week... FINALLY we get to <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new album</b> (let mecheck the date) (yes I think so haha that virus man killing all those releasedates) and I hope for their sake I like their songs because if you have beenlistening to their slew of music videos which covers like half the album by nowthey are... very different to what I have heard so far. It's great, I must say,but man, it's not appealing to me right now. Hope that will change next week.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay boy am I glad I have some creative time to myself so I can write some codeto make myself happy like create an<a  href="https://knneo.github.io/image-gallery/image-gallery.html"  target="_blank"  >image gallery</a>&nbsp;(go ahead and fork that and slot in web images if you want) so I can viewma girls anytime without Pinterest haha yes I do use that to see pirated imageslol. Talking about those, I got myself another batch. And mainly because I havenot been spending anything for the last month besides on bubble tea which mylocal government just banned exclusive shops on selling (sigh) I thought Ishould burn a hole in my wallet to celebrate... my pay raise. Haha yeah, it'shappening. Now that I have more responsibilities including having to deal withrandom shit on the weekends in case any of the hundreds of clinics which arestill operating have a malfunctioning server, I hope I still have some time formyself haha. Cya guys next week, and until next time... let's see if 50 imagescan make me happy. It cannot because instead of clicking it yesterday I did it aday later which some of them already are sold which include some good ones fromKotobuki Minako's photobook Mina-chan no!~ I hope she's well in England haha byeand take care guys<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
