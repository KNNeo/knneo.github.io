LOLZ<br /><br />Okay serious talk, that doesn't mean I can watch Anime day and night orwhatever, and I tell you, it's more stressed not knowing what to do at home thenbeing at work, which is why I rather go to work. Then again, might be good timeto chase after the Easter event in Animal Crossing now since I'll be playingmost of the time instead of working- Just joking!! And stop reporting me to myboss!! Geez, I thought you were on my side...<br /><br />Sorry about the drama, but it sounded so drastic of a change, I thought I'demphasise on it. Speaking about Anime, we have new shows coming up! Not"Kaguya-sama" though, that one is next week. Still, let's see how this seasonholds up. As per last week I'm giving two first, but man do I want to give thatMikakoshi as main girl Anime so bad. What is it, "Arte"? But women empowermentisn't a topic I'm interested in THEY SHOULD BE AT HOME DOING CHORES okaymisogynistic me let's move on okay? lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    To be honest?

Yeah man, that nurse really said it, huh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>I SWEAR if people ask about your dad's job and you say you don't know it'll besomeone's flag to insult or bully you in school haha now where have I seen thatbefore... anyways, in this nice shot (not the balls, no) of a first episode(#Kakushigoto01), things are picking up. Again, not talking about balls becausethis is a family friendly site lol, but hey, new editor? You're fired. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>If you get this joke you'll love this episode and this series in general,because to summarise this show, it's someone having a panic attack all day long.It's famous (hentai) manga artist, Goto Kakushi, (Yes, the title's joke is alsoin his name, but we'll talk about that later), and his secret to his daughter,Hime. That's enough for a bunch of jokes, to be honest, and I think I can givethis. Here's why. Firstly, story. In a sort of time travel forward, I assumewhen Hime is in high school the father decided to tell her the secret, that he'sa manga artist. Yeah, it's not even about the hentai portion; he just thinks hedoesn't want to give the impression for the kid that he draws for a living,hence the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kaku" target="_blank">kaku</a>"&nbsp;"<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shigoto" target="_blank">shigoto</a>"joke compared to "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kakushigoto" target="_blank"  >kakushigoto</a>", for those who don't Japanese out there. I mean, the subs could have done itbetter but hey, if you know of Jisho.org you're already a genius haha. So, abouthis job. It's not much of an issue if you aren't famous like some of the doujinartists out there who, probably because of the pandemic out there, is sufferingbecause there is no Comiket now ie. physical events where they sell their work.But Kakushi here, he is famous. His work "Balls of Fury" is a bestseller, somuch so that everyone around his life knows about it: from the nurse in thehospital, to the teacher in school (who, obviously, did not tell Hime about hisjob), to that new editor... oh yeah, <i>that</i> idiot. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, that neweditor's visit to his place. Which is why Kakushi was worried about that guy notaliasing with the previous editor to know that (1) do not visit his place in anycapacity and (2) to never reveal anything along his line of work. That jerk didboth. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Kakushi ran back home fast (whilst changing back to his suitdisguise) (man, he's efficient) to see that one guy wearing the new merch forhis manga at his place and Hime... thought that guy was the CEO. Haha, I'mliking the vibes of this already, to be honest. Then, the show gave insight intotwo things you should mind about if you want to continue watching this series,which are the kids themselves as they find things to play around, for example inthis episode, explore the town to find the one hero like they are someinvestigation squad (lol), and Hime's relationship with his father. In thisepisode however, Kakushi gets to live another day despite being a hero like,twice: one at the river and one at Star- Anyways, (Haha I like how Hime-chan canonly say it that far too) and also what Hime wrote as her wish for her father:to be someone<a href="https://jisho.org/search/erai" target="_blank">important</a>, I assume,at work. Because yeah, even till now she doesn't know what her father works as.Again, not that she needs to know because thanks sensei for making thatunimportant (lol), but yeah that's when the father keeps thinking about how to,you know, be more important in his job. Just so you know, there's no promotionsas manga artists unless you're a mango- Sadly, it requires him to eventually befamous (lol mango) (Also, word pun from me by the way, but you guys should knowabout the "mango" that grows on trees- Oh that's an English joke. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>), andif he's famous as a (hentai) manga artist Hime-chan will know. Ah, the agony.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> It is as of these incidents that he is more worried about the daughterknowing he's a manga artist even without the hentai label, which is why Ibracket that word every time I mention it. We shall see if that works for him inthe end haha. Then again, I imagine this series is a lot of these jokes where hegets close (but not close enough) to letting the daughter know about the work,and I think I'll enjoy a dozen episodes of this to be honest considering theyare relatively short so there's a couple every week instead of dragging contentout. Next, the animation. If Hime-chan isn't cute enough for you to refer to as"-chan", go away. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In a nutshell, the animation might be simplistic, itmight be a little crude, but it can display all the characters very well, and Ithink that is good enough. It kind of needs to be a little sketchy for theseries to make jokes like how the father can run quickly back home, for example,and so because the drawings are sketchy to make it look fast- Okay I don't wantto talk too much on Anime production, just so you know. Lastly, the drop, whichbrings us back to the plot. If you didn't have a hunch about what will happen inthe near future about this story, then you need to watch more shows like thislol. Even if you don't watch stuff like "Usagi Drop" (no word pun intended, justlisting the most stereotypical of such a genre) you would realise such a singlefather and daughter relationship show will require him at some point to explainthings to the daughter about his work. I mean, I think she will forgive him,even if she knows what it is. Her reactions will definitely not be like what hethinks, because that's what he is good at, it's his job. And if he makes aliving off it, that's a job. Think about Twitch streamers and ask yourselfwhether his job is legit again haha. All in all, I might just give flumpool myfirst song from them lol (they sing the opening theme),<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/34785/Rie_Takahashi" target="_blank"  >Rieri</a>is kawaii haha, and I can use more jokes until I have to cry when they end thisseries. Yeah, it's as funny as you can get with such a genre, and I think I'llenjoy this every week.<br />[HIME-CHAN GALORE!! I'm not into elementary school kids haha]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tD5Ebr_78Ps/XolTNJQ8RRI/AAAAAAAA6Pw/nEMyp0WW42M5r4tp83jWU3T9RFqa-oAbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto01_hime2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            If this didn't get you to watch this series I don't know what will          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zug9mxMTR0E/XolTNImKRnI/AAAAAAAA6Ps/h9watpmmcVsJ44zs6zYsk_4gtLmJt8IeACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto01_hime3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Your daughter if she finds out you were writing erotic comics about            her-          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I know it's ecosystem but you're raising it to ruin ourlives, so please stop. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, this series, I think I can watch. It'sdrama, so prepare yourselves a bit before you even start to watch this, to behonest. And as it is a little shallow in impact, you may have to feel more inorder to like this, and I think I can. In this first episode though(#YesterdayWoUtatte01), we are already setting premises more than you canimagine. It's got sad plots, it's got reality checks, it's got maybe somesparks, it's got... everything about life. Let's talk about it. Firstly, aboutRikuo. Thanks Hana-chan for revealing his name to us by asking for a leftoverbento ie. you don't have money to even pay for one and you take those that aresub par standard and feed it to a woman instead of the birds lol, but suffice itto say it is not without some history. Rikuo's life... let's say it's kind ofrough. He graduated from high school, but instead of going to university likemany of his classmates probably or going to get a full time job like his crushShinako as a high school teacher (probably apprentice), he works part time at aconvenience store. Wouldn't say that's a glorious achievement, but I think likehim too, that if it doesn't give me much pressure, and I can still live life,I'm okay. Which probably also explains why I'm still at my first full time jobfor almost two years but, uh, let's talk about Hana, haha. She's cute. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>(Voice totally reminds me of Sakura-chan from "KimiSui" btw) She's young, she'sin university now (yep yep), and... she probably likes the guy. Story goes thathe probably liked him at first sight from five years ago while helping him pickup a dropped item, but hey, who knows what happened in between. Not like we'regoing to get a confession anytime soon because this is not how it works (lol),so we can wait for that to happen someday haha. She's weird, she likes crows andeven is friends with one called Kansuke (who probably tipped on his location forfood earlier lmao), she lives alone, and is a student of Shinako? Okay this isgetting confusing. As far as I can understand from their conversation when theymet, it sounds like Hana dropped out of high school and somehow got herself intouniversity? Hey, just so you know, dropping out of high school is unlikelygetting you anywhere in life so... I don't know. We may need more explanationsdown the line. Meanwhile, she is what Japanese would refer to as "<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/sekkyokuteki"  target="_blank"  >sekkyokuteki</a>", but hey, I've never gotten those in my life so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> She talksto Rikuo often, they talk often... you know, basis to forming a relationship.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, his part time colleague is already pissed off why he can't getlaid playing music haha. (Maybe because it's punk rock? BOOM GOT HIM lol) Then,there's Shinako. (It's<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa" target="_blank"  >Kana-chan</a>in her 30-year-old voice?? OKAY haha) (Come on it's 31 lmao *gets punched*) Iwouldn't say she pops out of nowhere, because she and Rikuo are friends, realgood friends.&nbsp;Yeah, the guy's feelings for her is like, not much. Not "atruck load" much to say the least. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Ugh "Kaguya-sama" please come soonhaha it's next week btw) But she's kind, she kind of likes him but not in thatway, and she rejected the heck out of him. Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, should've doneit during graduation but, you know, psychological complications haha. Also, mustbe status level issues lol okay we will not touch on societal issues here we cantalk about that in the next three months lol. They end the episode with talkingabout Rikuo's hobby probably prospective job scope, photography. Thinking on howcrows would work well with punk lol, he tells Hana-chan to take a pose. So farso good, I suppose. It's not something to get super hyped about, I am ratherdigging on this love triangle that might happen at some point hehe, and there'sa cute girl albeit with a crow, so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We shall see how this develops.Probably not crazy, but it will touch hearts. If you can feel it, you can watchit. I can, so I will. The quotes in this series sings a lot to me to be honest,and I'm not making a word pun of the title haha I wonder what it means... cyanext week haha<br />[Wow all these screenshots are all single shots because they are not togetherHEY YO!

It's when you put another guyinto the mix haha that's for next week probably]<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Sorry Nu-chan. I mean, really. I'm sorry. I have failed to, for the past fewweeks, listen to your best album again even if it appeared on streaming. Nowwe're done with this week and next week onwards I'll have more new songs tolisten... I'm feeling bad already. Again, I'm sorry, it's all because of AnimalCrossing (haha), but really, someday I want to revisit your best album,hopefully within this year. I also just heard<b>FINLAND's new digital single</b> and... it isn't bad. Again, if you can givethe vocalist you can give all their Rock music styles because it's good. If youcan give the high frequency scratches of her voice, that is.<br /><br />On news from Twitter and beyond,<b>GLIM SPANKY's new song is out on May</b> (not single/album release yet), Isuppose <b>Horie Yui's music website got revamped</b> as an April Fool's Dayjoke haha, <b>yanaginagi's new single is releasing in May</b> as she sings forthat one Anime again (go find out yourself you idiot lol),<b>Asakura Momo's new album previews</b> are... I'm trying to ignore them rightnow to get a clean slate of giving her new songs including the topic song too sodon't ask if I liked them, and yes as you can see above,<b>FINLAND's new single released last Sunday</b>. This year's April Fool's Dayjokes aren't as good as last year's haha I'm not referring to music artists theycan't joke even at a time like this<br /><br />For next week however, we listen to two long-awaited releases which hopefullyI'll get to listen to the latter hopefully, which are namely<b>Asakura Momo's 2nd album</b> with a distinctive topic song as I havementioned my affection for it, and <b>Kugimiya Rie's new mini-album</b> which isa first since 2012 where I liked it back then. Really, didn't expect Shana tosing this well lol. Anyways, since she's under music label Lantis, good chanceswe might not be able to see it appear on streaming, so I'll rely on the Internetprobably to make this happen. Fingers crossed though. Mocho's album however, wedon't have to worry too much. Thanks, MusicRay'n! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Š">*smiles*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is it then. As you would have seen from the intro here lol, I'm going to beworking from home starting next week so hopefully I'll get to<strike>play more Animal Crossing</strike> spend more time during breaks doingup the menial stuff on this PC which mostly include clipping of live performancevideos for now as far as I can remember it staying on my Downloads folder andnot going anywhere haha. You know how much time I can save just by having aquick lunch or not travel and play Animal Crossing- I mean, you can play on thetrain though, just saying. Also gonna be wearing a (reusable) mask since I don'tknow when on public transport just for tomorrow since I still have to go to theoffice for a bit tomorrow, but after that we might be over here for a while.Doesn't mean I'll listen to Nu-chan's album though, no promises haha. Cya guysnext week then, and until then... #StayHome, people. It's safer than sufferingfrom hearing disabilities from the renovations that might be happening at yourplace and your mom playing the radio louder than you can hear yourself yawn whenyou wake up. Yeah, that's my life for now haha I rather go to work the viruskeeps my noisy mom at home I can't even- Go check out the new Klassic NoteReview once you get bored of me talking here, yes? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
