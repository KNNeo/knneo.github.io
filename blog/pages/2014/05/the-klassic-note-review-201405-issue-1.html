KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />fumika – Endless Road [Single]<br />

(Simple cover, isn’t it?)<br /><br />Origin: As you guys know, I’m not
unfamiliar with fumika-san. Ever since listening to her debut single from Anime
“BLEACH”, I’ve been following her on her new songs, with a breakthrough in 2012,
where she sings the three-parter duo songs followed by her album, which created
an impression, at least for me. Since her shift out of Sony Music Japan, she has
been actively singing original and cover songs too, with this being an original
production. Without cover songs. Her previous two songs are not the case.
<br /><br />(1) Endless Road<br />This song is about love, and more than that.
It’s about happiness and bliss. Besides, the topic is about marriage anyway,
shown in the PV. Nice song though, like I’ve not been hearing a good song from
fumika in a while. Lyrics are also written in topic, with four seasons and
reminiscing the past, making the songs more impressionable. Overall, this is a
nice song, and it fully represents fumika’s style. And since she’s out of Sony
Music Japan, a super-copyrighted label, means you can watch the PV on YouTube!
My eyes tear up the first time I watched and sang to this. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span><br />

  If you tear up halfway through the song, so did I…

<br />Rating: 4 stars (Solid Average) <br /><br />(2) A~Yokatta<br />Don’t mind
the looks of the song title, but the song itself is full of hype, and a feel of
thankfulness is felt after receiving bliss and enjoying the happiness. I like
this song too, as is concludes the single really well. Which really makes this
single so complete. Makes me feel like I’ve reached another stage of my life,
though not marriage, haha. <br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Verdict:
Overall, it’s a good single. It’s complete, as I mentioned above in the two
songs in it. And I’ve already placed an order, which… is not here yet. I’ll show
fumika-san on Twitter when I got the copy. It’s the best proof that I do support
artists I listen.<br />[P.S.: With “Endless Road” the song I also got fumika-san
to follow me on Twitter. OMG.]<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"

(I know about the title being in
<a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/LASM-4168" target="_blank">another format</a>, but I
shall stick to the consensus. Very typical covers though, and Nanana-chan seems
to have twisted her arm…)<br /><br />Origin: If you guys need me to introduce
this voice actor idol group, then you’re insulting my unique taste in their
works. Again they have tied up with another Anime “Ryuugajou Nanana no
Maizoukin” which I do watch (not a bad show), impending for their upcoming
FOURTH album after celebrating their 5th anniversary after debut. Again, this
single is not a disappointment, and I’ve already prepared to press the order
button when I finished listening to this release.<br /><br />(1) Kasuka na
Hisoka na Tashika na Mirai [(A) Faint, Scretive, Certain Future]<br />What’s
almost awesome is from when I heard the Anime preview and radio previews before
that, and overall the song lands in the typical Anison format, which is fine by
my case. I personally favour a shorter song (as shorter song makes lesser
mistakes and variations), but this is fine as it is. A very nice song to listen
to, especially the chorus.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Anison-typical Average)<br /><br />(2)
synchronicity<br />I only knew of the title of the song and heard the preview of
the song from Aki-chan’s radio show just three days ago, and I heard the full
song yesterday already. With the song title’s creativity aligned with mine
(refer to APoL cards for details LOL), this song is also creativity presented,
in a wacky and somehow naughty way (with a slight dere theme?), typical of their
songs. And I particularly liked the chorus, and again, this song turned out
better than the A-side above. It’s not the first time this has happened, so I
shall no dwell upon it. Personally like this song more than the Anison, and
primarily the reason why I would bother to go Sony Music Shop to get the special
gift AGAIN.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Verdict: If it’s not
good it wouldn’t even make it here. This is another good single from sphere. And
I like it. PV-wise… I haven’t seen it yet, so… But overall it’s good, and
Klassic Note is about listening, so I guess the video is not important?<br /><br />-Kaineng,
on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br />That’s all, folks. Until the next time… if
I get the two singles within next week then I’ll talk about it again? Meanwhile
I’ll moan about the dreadful reality that I don’t live in Japan…<br /><br />
