Hi guys, and welcome back. It’s been like forever since I used that introduction again. Well, glad it’s back. And you guys too, if there is any. This week… is rather short, and probably for many weeks ahead, but at least from Anime I see great potential in the next season… (I almost always say that to myself, so…)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><strong>Glasslip:</strong> Wow. The most controversial episode thus far? Actually this show has not failed to surprise me till now, even if it is an Anime original. Come on, does it have to be like this? Do they have to make Touko go berserk? Do they have to make David look like the bad guy? Do they have to start tearing up relationships that are halfway set? Well, let’s hope this does not get in the way of the bigger picture, now that we’re halfway into the season. Currently even Touko’s sister is coming into the spotlight…<br /><blockquote>“After going through all of that, I think my favorite part of the episode was probably any scene that had Touko’s younger sister. Not only did the episode title seemed to be focused on her (<i>I didn’t see any other bicycles</i>) but I thought it was kind of cute how her swim team seems to be madly in love with Yuki.” –Takaii @ <a href="http://randomc.net/2014/08/15/glasslip-07/" target="_blank">Random Curiosity</a></blockquote><strong>Kuroshitsuji:</strong> Well good that this story isn’t disappointing, as following the story rather religiously is rather expected of this production thus far. Some may be left out, but I guess it’s fine. Good thing is we’re not far from the ending. It’s all going to start next week. Sad thing is it’ll be a lot to cover before it ends. Here’s wishing to a- oh yah I think I know the ending; I shouldn’t think of a good ending, huh.<br />I will skip SHOWS unless you want me to talk about CrazyGod. One Piece is not my cup of tea.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><strong>No BLEACH</strong> so nothing for this week.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well I managed to take a listen to <strong>Amamiya Sora (Ten-chan) and her debut single “Skyreach”,</strong> and think it’s pretty good. The whole single. Yeah, and this is likely what I’ll expect next week:<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.amamiyasora.jp/img/common/artist_image/70007000/70007954/images/201407292014120.jpg" height="320" /><br />They should’ve taken the B-side of this single as the ending song for Isshukan Friends. Seriously. (Audience: Seriously? The photo is more important than the CD?) Hehe yep *^_^*<br />On other new additions for the week, I also gave a good listen to <strong>nano.RIPE and their latest album</strong> released at the start of the year. And I think it’s good, given the first impression from the live performance from the latest single’s DVD. But seriously still kind of mindful about that high pitch act-cute voice, so decided to hold back. Okay, maybe three songs isn’t as much as holding back, huh. I could’ve given only one…<br /><br />Well there isn’t much for next week, so probably I’ll take a break from getting new songs. Or not. <strong>Two weeks from now</strong> will be releases from <strong>Aqua Timez and SID</strong>, so I’ll be looking forward to that, especially Aqua Timez; It’s been some time. For <strong>news of new songs</strong> approaching, I’ve been posting on Twitter, so I guess here’s the summary. <strong>Ayachi’s next single</strong> will be opening song (wow for the first time it’s credited) (must be good) (hopefully) for Anime “Denkigai no Honya-san”, premiering next season, which I did mention I intend to watch. <strong>Ikimono’s new single</strong> also features a new song to be the opening theme song for next season Anime “Nanatsu no Taizai”, which… (*sees Fairy Tail author*) I may or may not watch. Just by looking at this:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-j2-egU_ezhM/U_CUjxTdevI/AAAAAAAAKJ0/O8_c5ULKUGM/taizaigoogleimage%25255B11%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="480" style="background-image: none; border: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="640" /></div>I’m not optimistic. But then last year I watched Titans. It’s about time for this year, huh. Come on, you guys know I normally don’t watch this. BLEACH is SOO much better. (Letterbox filled with audience complaints) Haha screw you guys.<br /><br /><br />Well that’s all, folks. And after this I’m going to honour my promise by <strong>finishing up Chapter 12 of APoL</strong> and carrying on because I lost the bet. To fail English. But I’m glad. Don’t have to su**** be*** tog***** wi** C**** p***le liao. Haha, go figure. Cya guys next week then, and until next time… please come back. I need company. Even if it is me answering myself.<br /><br />[P.S.: I then noticed my laugh is weird. <strong>Maybe I should stop laughing already. </strong>For aesthetic and cosmetic reasons. My voice and my looks, basically… (Audience: But you’ve been laughing so rarely lately…)]<br /><br />[P.P.S.: There isn’t much for this week, but if you guys insist…<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10616021_10152660736582460_8030684650090937802_n.jpg?oh=fb538a986bf291b0aa1c3b2fe1f87903&amp;oe=57BBEECC" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10557360_10152666421302460_2227057158469634129_n.jpg?oh=c8d280f6997ffe7ff89bba8d611d7cf1&amp;oe=57B451D5" /><br />Again I noticed, that I’m into older girls. OMG. (Come on because the new generation has nothing to offer, okay??)<br />[Okay Ten-chan is the same age as me, and Mina-chan is just one year older. Don’t mind?]<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Entertainment News</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
