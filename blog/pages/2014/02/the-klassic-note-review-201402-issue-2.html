I don’t want to scold people. Transiting to be a civilised person already… (Audience: LOL)<br /><br />Will be talking about SID’s new single and Yanagi Nagi’s single (which I mentioned <a href="../../2014/02/the-klassic-note-review-201402-issue-1.html">over here</a> already), but mainly on SID, and the special gift. Yep. The B3 poster (really, not joking) which I don’t know where to put in my room now. Yanagi Nagi or Manaka-chan? Hmm…<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />SID – hug [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/00/17/KSCL-2355.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/00/19/KSCL-2357.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition Type A feat.

A little better than sphere’s 5th Anniversary single next week because it has a Regular Edition CD, for me.)<br /><br />Origin: I guess they also don’t need much introduction either. SID has been a great Rock band ever since I heard them in 2008, under credit of Anime “Kuroshitsuji” (you guys know they’re starting production on a 3rd season, right?) and have been impressing me with great songs since then. Whether it is from moody to lively songs they all have a touch, surprisingly done by vocals and lyricist Mao, backed up by awesome solo guitarist (he does the solos every time so well you forget about everyone else) Shinji, bassist and (surprisingly) composer of the group Aki and upbeat drummer Yuuya. They all come up with nice songs and have been mentioned in credit of several Anime include recent “Magi” and even “BLEACH” too.<br /><br />Wow too long an introduction liao…<br /><br />Verdict: Since it’s only single-track let’s keep it simple. Read below.<br /><br />(1) hug<br />If its a emotional song then normally one would listen to the lyrics. Since I guess anyone reading this either is a English well-versed Japanese or just anyone who doesn’t understand Japanese, I’ll not talk about lyrics. But suffice it to say the lyrics are rather intimate, befitting of the title of the song. Melody wise… when I first heard it from the PV, the impression wasn’t deep, but it wasn’t all the bad. Their style if part of the reason why I still listen to them anyway, and I decided to take it. And then I found out it’s a single-track single, and here it is on my shelf.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you like their style, support them as always. Like, buy their single, like what I did. Haha. Really. Don’t act blur. Also, this single is a good prelude to their album (which I probably wouldn’t buy, don’t know why) which I WILL be listening to it too, once it’s out (I can’t tell you where) next month.<br /><br />~ Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br />Yesh, now about the poster. Initially was excited about getting this order due to its source which was again different from the previous ones. Normally it’s <a href="http://cdjapan.co.jp/" target="_blank">CDJapan</a> (do I need to put all the links here?), and last November it’s <a href="http://www.animate-onlineshop.jp/" target="_blank">Animate Online Shop</a> with Mina-chan and Yocchan’s singles (they get the season’s beta testing first), and this time it’s Yanagi Nagi, from <a href="http://www.hmv.co.jp/" target="_blank">HMV Japan’s</a> online store it seems. Maybe I should just explain what I think of HMV. At first I expected to see a post card along with the B3 poster but then was disappointed because the post card did not appear. Then I checked repeatedly to confirm that the post cards are only for her Limited Edition title. Exceptions did apply on her previous single, but not now. And all early pre-orders do get the poster, which is what I did. <br /><br />(I’ll probably do up an all-out review of all the retailers once I tried them all. Or most of them. Which would probably be within the year.)<br /><br /><br />Honestly, it’s late birthday gift. But even more honestly, I enjoyed it. Listening to it just makes me… happy. I guess that’s the reward I have for getting them in the first place. I guess… that’s my spirit. The Klassic Note spirit. Cya guys tomorrow, hopefully I’ll remember to do up the Entertainment News. Or not there’s always Monday…<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Klassic Note</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
