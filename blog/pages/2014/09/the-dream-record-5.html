<h2 class="title">The Dream Record #5</h2>
<div id="hashtags"></div>
<div class="header"></div>
Sorry for the delays from this morning, this is supposed to be<br /><br /><b>WHY I CANNOT HAVE DREAMS DURING GODDAMN AFTERNOON NAPS??</b> Geez...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE ABDUCTION<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Okay, I was chasing someone (supposedly a friend) down a flight of stairs, having some horseplay perhaps. When I see him got out of an open door in one of the lower floors, we both took out gun and start to shoot each other. I used my pistol and got into cover, keeping my paintball gun away. [1] I then noticed he's nowhere to be seen in the rather dim alleyway, and also see him hidden in an alley a few feet away taking cover. I then took aim <strike>with the pistol and a bullet flew through and</strike></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">THE REDO #1</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">(Yeah these things happen in dreams. Suck it up.)</span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">I then took aim with the paintball gun and managed to strike a few hits on him. Then suddenly my buddy started giving discrete actions by pointing behind me down the alleyway. Before I could even turn back and leave for the stairs I was immediately caught by one of the aggressors, whoever they are. They then dragged me along with a few other people (I don't see my buddy here though) down the alley...</blockquote><br />THE HAPPENINGS<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">When I woke up (supposedly I was knocked out), I was still being dragged down the alleyway, suddenly into a stop. We were facing a big white metal door. In front of me was a strong muscular man dragging a blonde female (yes westerners appear in my dreams, can?), in which the guy who is dragging me says:</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"She can skip this. I'll let this guy do it."</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"OMG do what?" was going through my mind and the door opens and I see <strike>a whole pile of poison-labelled chemicals with a potent aura</strike></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">THE REDO #2</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">(Yeah these things happen TWICE in dreams, can?)</span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">The door opens and I see a small storeroom filled with lots of documents, mostly empty paper filled in messy stacks. I stare back behind me.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Hey, go write down in a few sentences what you have been doing."</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">I then see the tall guy who dragged me talk to the blonde female. She is apparently accompanied by a couple of weak guys in black suits seemingly in a team with her (I know my imagination is terrible), and they seem to be forced to write down what they have been doing, even if it's not some national secret. [2]</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Hey, you too. Follow them."</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">What? What am I supposed to write? I was just having <strike>a shooutout</strike>&nbsp;some horseplay with a buddy, that's all. (Oops) Oh, I know. Maybe he just wants something out of us, like ideas or something. But then that is not all. While I was frantically taking paper (which is all over the shelf, yes) and a pen which there is only one black pen on the top shelf, I rummaged through, in the top compartment, a small stack of my private stuff (yes you won't get to know what it is; it's just real private) and... a copy of my recent project report. [3] Summarise this?</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Hey! Hurry up and do it!"</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">I used a stack of blue foolscap paper I grabbed off the shelf [4], took a kneeling position on the ground, and started writing: (yeah fancy me remembering this)</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">THE REPORT IS ABOUT</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Sh*t about what? I was too confused to think of anything at that point (yeah even my dream recalling is bad too), and then my dad came by. (no really, my dad)</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Hurry up and write it! Anything will do!"</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Hey! Have you finished writing??"</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The tall guy was sitting on a bed, reading through pieces of paper and smoking a close-to-dead cigarette. Okay, never mind. I'll just write it. (case sensitive for me to finish this module, okay?)</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">THIS REPORT IS ABOUT A TECHNICAL REPORT TO SOLVE REAL WORLD PROBLEMS USING THE IDEAS OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR &lt;SUBJECT CODE&gt; &lt;SUBJECT NAME&gt; (I can only tell you it's a communication module).</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Hey! Why are you still writing? You don't know what is a summary? You write more and I'll-" [5]</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">He raises his fist and I immediately stopped my pen and placed it down. He brought down his hand too, and tore the paper in a rugged manner, managing to steal most of the paper onto his hands.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Can we go now?"</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">My dad was pleading for our 'release'. He looked at our pitiful faces.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Yeah, you can do."</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"What about him?"</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">My dad was pleading for me too, specifically.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Yeah, yeah.. Go off now."</blockquote><br />THE REVENGE?<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">We quickly scrambled out of the room frantically, putting down the short door curtain behind us. [6] As we took a step out of the room, my dad started saying:</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"You know how bad they treated me? They forced me to teach people, you know!"</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">I can even see the redness in his eyes along with his lethargic expression.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"You want to ask whether we can *******?" (Yep I forgot, damn. Well it's not important anyway)</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Huh, really?"</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"If we don't ask we'll be even a more dangerous position."</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">We both hesitated for a moment.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"If none of us want to us, then we better scram."</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">My dad took courage and went into the room with the bad guy, closing the wooden door behind him. And suddenly I hear a lot of noises and stuff being thrown around and when I opened the door I saw...!</blockquote><br /><br /><br />Haha end of dream. (Audience: What?) Yeah, because I cannot imagine it anymore, and I woke up. (Audience looking displeased) Come on, I edited my dream twice in order not to make this too bloody, okay?<br /><br />There are obvious references to this dream which I did not do any reference in the dream because... it was such a cliffhanger. These include:<br /><br /><ol><li>The changing of weapons was more specific, like, GTA V style, while cycling through a range of pistols and, yeah, paintball pistol. Don't ask me if water pistol is in there or not. I don't think so though.</li><li>This feels like some movie I've NOT seen before, like those action scenes where some blonde is forced to reveal national secrets? I don't know.</li><li>Rummaging my own stuff, and a copy of my recent project. Cannot tell much on this, but seriously, maybe it's because I am still reluctant to finish the last draft because of this week's <strike>half-semester</strike> term break? I think it's a rude awakening already, huh...</li><li>Yes, blue foolscap paper. So specific it looks like the stack of foolscap papers I had at home. It's... just... not blue...</li><li>Apparently he mentioned about some 50 words limit like he was an idiot. But then I was about to write more too, so... glad he stopped me? I don't want to turn this into comedy, you see.</li><li>It was not until the end when my dad (yes it's really him) and I left the room then I noticed... it's my sis' room. Really. Door curtains, the bed... OMG</li></ol><div>Okay, that's all. After such a rude awakening, I think I have to start work already. Cya guys later, where I promise <strike>I'll do up the Klasic Note Reviews.</strike> I see the order coming soon. We'll wait until I get my hands on the CDs, okay? Meanwhile...</div><div><br /></div><div>We'll start from 'that', yes? The assignment report can wait...</div><hr><h4>#The Dreams</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
