<h2 class="title">Three Idiots in a Lift</h2>
<div id="hashtags"></div>
<div class="page-header"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Well, it's not actually three idiots only, but let's say it's "three sets of idiots" instead.</p><p dir="ltr">As I reached home taking the lift (you can assume I'm living in a public apartment), my entry was followed by a couple wheeling a pram and a girl who is not a moment eyes off her phone. (iPhone for those who need statistics without feedback) As we enter, I hit X (a number between the other two I will be mentioning later) and the girl hit 12. The first obvious problem one can observe right now is someone did not hit a button. Well I assumed someone lives in the same floor as one of us, but as we passed the 7th floor, about 9th, and suddenly:</p><p dir="ltr">"Seven, please."</p><p dir="ltr">Haha, right. <em>It's over already, idiot.</em> And he's hitting that button that did not respond.</p><p dir="ltr">The lift then quickly reached the floor of my destination and I left the lift, in front of me the girl still staring at her phone. Clearly she did not even stare at the floor she was in as I reached for my home door. <em>Wow, another idiot</em>. I laughed dryly to myself as I reached for my set of keys and... they're not there. After entering the house did I notice that my set of keys are hanging on the key rack next to the door.</p><p dir="ltr">I then noticed that, coincidentally, there are three (sets of) idiots in the lift, and <em>I'm the third one. </em>All of this in under a minute.</p><p dir="ltr">[P.S.: Haha I guess I'll leave you guys to internalise that. I have a pair work project to prepare for tomorrow. Cya guys on Sunday.]</p><hr><h4 class="post-tags"><div> Reported in </div><a href="../../../index.html#TheEverydayLife">The Everyday Life</a></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
