Hey guys, welcome back. Since I feel like in a good mood for now (yes for now, maybe not tomorrow), I shall take more time doing this? We shall see. I don’t feel like doing much, more on sleeping these days…<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><strong>Sora no Method </strong>(last episode): Somehow it got solved? Maybe Yuzuki just noticed that people are worrying about her, or just the author doesn’t want to drag this story anymore (recall this is an Anime original), but I see some gap that requires more episodes in order to be answered. Moving on, we see more in the mystery of that saucer that is above their heads after a wonderful mini scale fireworks festival. We are close to halfway there, and I don’t see more development. Maybe I’m expecting too much?<br /><strong>Uma no Hone:</strong> Somewhat a Sensei-chan focused episode, she tries to rush her first serialisation as a manga artist and with the usual drama, also reveals her time in staying at the store, with some serious problems in regards to the lack of femininity with her actions. Somewhat reminds me of what soldiers do outfield. Wow, she’s good for the army, huh…<br /><strong>KimiUso:</strong> Apparently the writer in RC cannot take the Anime production already, but I’m not going to give up just yet. Not like I hate the show, till now it still shows a lot about Kousei and his idea of getting back his confidence in playing music, due to the lack of that natural learning curve when he was a child. I know, it needs more time to get into him. But apparently it’s doing well, him jumping off the river bridge along with Kaori-chan. Nonetheless, I’m expecting more in terms of mood, though different from Toradora!, and it should just get better. I don’t think it’s bad, really.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><strong>BLEACH:</strong> Yep the Zero Division is screwed. So are those who do not deserve the power, and the Quincy leader just redistributes them to those who are useful. At least Kubo didn’t remove all and focus only like FIVE or something…<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well this week features only two singles, if I didn’t remember wrongly, for there are more starting from next week. <strong>fhana’s new single</strong> is far from impressive as I’ve said last week (probably), and the PV doesn’t make it any better. I also gave chance to <strong>Mikakoshi’s new single</strong>, because I gave for the quirky melody and transitions in the song. Although the B-side song with lyrics written by her is not my fancy (referring to the melody here), at least I gave a listen. Well, next time Mikakoshi.<br /><br />Next week brings us a whole group of releases featuring <strong>Rie fu</strong> (I’m prepared to give half the album already), <strong>miwa</strong> (haven’t heard anything much from this yet), <strong>Ikimonogakari </strong>which I gave the A-side already and nonetheless with the CD coming possibly another week later, <strong>Aki-chan’s new single</strong>. Seriously looking forward to it. But also means emotional songs need to be stricter in standard to be in my list this period, for example miwa’s new song is an emotional one, along with <strong>Porno Graffitti’s new single</strong> which features a song about… women? Not that I’m sexist, but I don’t know. I used to like their songs… *recalling songs 2010-2011*<br /><br />Also in the news is <strong>the return of ClariS</strong>, that unseen schoolgirl (now university students) duo that made into fame from 2010, is getting a remake, with Alice out for her studies (apparently) and Karen into the equation. With the new song… they sound like each other. I don’t suspect two of the same person, but hope Sony Music Japan didn’t just pick a random girl on the streets to match with the girl that brought the Anime world down… with music, I mean. More new songs in the further weeks include <strong>SCANDAL’s new music video</strong> which is on YouTube now with some superhero action (along with a bunch of lucky freaks *Hmph*) along with an acoustic version of <strong>Goose house’s new song</strong>, also KimiUso’s opening song. Their best song I’ve heard so far, I must say.<br /><br /><br />So many things, so little time left. (Audience: For what?) My exams, goddammit. And I still have a final assignment to pass up for a project before the end of this semester. Haiz, what to do? Maybe start on work and less of… I don;t know. So much of the things I enjoy is somehow hurting me in within. Maybe it’s just me, haha. Cya guys next time, and I’ll see if Aki-chan’s new single will ever come any earlier. I have the whole of next week (and the week after) anyway…<br /><br />[P.S.: The recent update of Aki-chan’s website brings a lot of wonderful images of her… in a winter outfit. Anti-climax.<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10612732_10152857089532460_8307749233746267475_n.jpg?oh=fcdd5a118f38b793f980a035ec3844d1&amp;oe=5789B6CA" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/v/t1.0-9/10458464_10152859466567460_7127360958658994191_n.jpg?oh=278c04db81eb40674879cdbfa90b201f&amp;oe=57B32D2F" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/v/t1.0-9/10801866_10152863350272460_7435031937555259551_n.jpg?oh=319298e930836e95d5762451c8a6fcd1&amp;oe=57827364" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/10247239_10152865271657460_3424461290037055626_n.jpg?oh=a0b5e50d280e8cc8242f8b7dfb833222&amp;oe=57725586" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/1557581_10152866715312460_8661836503131694172_n.jpg?oh=658a5fac50ad6780b866718b3a03dd35&amp;oe=57BAFE04" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/1560632_10152868571132460_3686353971273558906_n.jpg?oh=20662a7af5bece7057ff9fd0f334482d&amp;oe=5785A09F" /><br />“Well, it’s not like I want to see her reveal more skin or something like that!” (Audience: LOL tsundere)]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
