<h2 class="title">The Klassic Note Review – 2014.10 Issue 3</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
<p>Not that I have more releases to add to my shelf, but I’m just going to show <strong>what’s new on my shelf</strong>, with respect to the previous issue. And probably next time if I have to do it separately (which I’ll try not to; I have to write more), I’ll do it like this too. I figured it’s better than putting it in Entertainment News. Like, for there it’s just a summary. Here’s for case studies (the Klassic Note tag), and details are at Twitter. Yep. Go visit it if you are free. I need no followers, if I need to mention that again.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>THE PACKAGE<br>Yes I know images speak a thousand words, so I shall cut short the essay and give an image.</p> <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-Mu2fe5Z6cTI/VFDvZ2vhEKI/AAAAAAAAKt0/3Z0FOTJwM8s/IMG_20141029_131128%25255B16%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="640" height="480"></p> <p>As you can see, it’s Ayachi’s new single, Ikimono’s new single along with Kon Natsumi’s single for Anime “Isshuukan Friends.”, which are all awesome in its own way.</p> <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-pNCobm-jgO0/VFDvahUumyI/AAAAAAAAKt8/OUBFlt20x28/IMG_20141029_131302%25255B5%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="240" height="180"></p> <p>For Ayachi, yes I got the gift, it was great, especially when you crop that irresistibly cute face and paste it on my phone homescreen. (I’ll show it this weekend, stay tuned) After that, not much of her due to the nature of an Anime cover.</p> <p>Also an Anime cover is Kon Natsumi’s single, which has been a heated argument within Klassic Note (which only consists of myself, so… yeah), is finally staying at my shelf. Problem is like some artists I know her photos are all over the booklet, contrast to the Anime cover. And yeah with reference to people who do not have the looks, I tried not to look too much. And I’ll only show one. If I scan the whole booklet you guys will probably… I don’t know. Maybe you’ll like her. Her singing voice, I guess.</p> <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-JniHSh0a_Ro/VFDvbFpaUfI/AAAAAAAAKuE/MBL4kgMivBg/IMG_20141029_134802%25255B5%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="240" height="180"></p> <p>As for Ikimono, it’s the usual three pages featuring the members, and yeah with First Press Edition comes with the special card, which is great as always. But then they have it for every release including DVDs and albums, which I probably cannot collect them all, but never mind. In Klassic Note that’s not even important.</p> <p>Because just coincidentally I got it all from <strong>Tower Records Online</strong>, which has shown impressive service since the last time I bought somethign from them. Only problem I see is a minor scratch on Ikimono’s single, which… if I asked for a replacement will be a pain in the… brain. Because it’s troublesome. If I got it from the shop front maybe I’ll do it. But if you’re like ways from that, I guess it’s better to just take it, unless I really see major damage.</p> <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-hSF09EVTFLc/VFDvbm_BySI/AAAAAAAAKuM/-KeDSGXbnyA/IMG_20141029_141355%25255B8%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="240" height="180"></p> <p>Reason is I got it like, two days ago, if you have followed in Twitter, but since no one is at home to claim the package it got reserved at the post office, and it’s not until today that I got it. This is also a good chance because I’ve reached the week in my studies for I cleared by quizzes (ok there’s one more on Friday) and presentations for the semester. So this package after that is sure a joy to have, just at the right time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Cya guys then, until next time… I know. I’ve been listening to new songs. This week just gets better. Ciao~</p>  <hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
