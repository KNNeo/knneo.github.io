Yes it‚Äôs the only one. Because SID new single isn‚Äôt impressive and the two last week aren‚Äôt either. And I don‚Äôt intend to buy any albums soon. Maybe Ikimono, but I shall see that for myself.<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=AquaTimezIkite><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Aqua Timez ‚Äì Ikite [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy height=320 src=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/adm_image/common/artist_image/70004000/70004138/jacket_image/145009__800_800_0.jpg style=-webkit-user-select:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;user-select:none width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy height=320 src=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/adm_image/common/artist_image/70004000/70004138/jacket_image/145008__800_800_0.jpg style=-webkit-user-select:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;user-select:none width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[Limited Edition]<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[Regular Edition]</table>(Pretty much the same, these two, but the Regular Edition looks more blissful. I‚Äôd like the Limited Edition though because it features live footage from the niconico live before their album release, which‚Ä¶ oh well.)<br><br>Origin: Well we are all familiar with pop rock band Aqua Timez, for they bring us many awesome songs from Anime, drama and many more. Celebrating their 10th year, with the release of their album earlier in August comes this single for another drama (which I wouldn‚Äôt elaborate here), but as it is only a single-track (new song) single, I‚Äôm sure to be reviewing it, right? Hell yeah you bet I will. This single falls on the line of single-track singles of their band, and this isn‚Äôt any shabby either.<br><br>(1) Ikite [Live On]<br>Eh‚Ä¶ first impression from music video is rather impressive, with most of the captivating components of a pop song available, and along with my favourite long phrases leading to the chorus again just like ‚ÄúHinayume‚Äù from their latest album, this song just makes for another great track to listen to. The lyrics generally talk about life in general, that though we go through life and are worried or even get emotional just talking about it, we still live on, and thus my translation of the song title. (Yes my translation dammit) Overall a wonderful song, but honestly? I was expecting more. Damn, why am I expecting more, right?<br>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br><br>(2) MASK (Shoes and Stargazing Version)<br>If I‚Äôm not wrong this is likely a rendition from their live this year also of the same name, but is also good in terms of song selection. If anyone recalls three years back where Anime ‚ÄúBLEACH‚Äù is still on and running (slowly) that this is one of the ending theme songs. Somehow three years listening to this version makes me view the song totally differently, which is great given the original song is already pretty good in terms of melody. Nostalgic is all I can think of at the moment, but really, nice song too. And if no one knows Klassic Note gives remixes of songs already in list, which also explains why negoto‚Äôs single is on my shelf too.<br><br>Conclusion: Altogether a nice single to have, and if not for my hesitation to get pre-order I probably would‚Äôve done this last weekend. If you‚Äôre a fan and have not missed a release from them, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs at your shelf now already. Or else, if you‚Äôd like a nice song to listen, my recommendations will never exclude Aqua Timez. Really, <strike>old timer</strike> experienced band already. It‚Äôs been ten years anyway‚Ä¶<br><br><br>THE PACKAGE<br>Yes, even I‚Äôm excited when I get to this part, where I talk about it before I put it on my shelf. Funny it‚Äôs been two years I‚Äôm still feeling this excitement within. Must be my own money that makes it matter, isn‚Äôt it?<br><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 height=180 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9e0Wj3pkcyb2KUux05zsBbefwtykxyX_IXg0Q4t5TNyJ7zGUepYWkBsmaqjeIzcCyZzTcjkCqGTODXvwy8DYl2ArTuHjVDQLDNvWYHWk5e7nh5YZhT4Zz0sbGaweXrGK_l3xrmr2WS1oC/?imgmax=800" style=background-image:none;border-bottom-width:0;border-left-width:0;border-right-width:0;border-top-width:0;border-width:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0 width=240><br>And yes, as you see the special gift here is not a promotional poster, but a poster of them in their live. <span class=emoji title=üòä>*smiles*</span> You get what I mean already, huh. Anyways, the packaging looks familiar as to the album with the elf theme, but this time the elf has a human granny. Just saying. Artistic view is exceptionally good though. Here, a bigger picture.<br><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 height=240 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3UumrMHE2k9r8BdhfAlPMxYNgilfC0Bb2N_tGyo33hvEZW5tZkTnaUXiF_VdS630hDmm4FnuOJ5IpP3nhutaZCYpHixmnsbwqgYasp9X7QxHDdK-1iztGOp6R4IvUrd0SpRcjGZ0jJLhs/w320-h240/?imgmax=800" style=background-image:none;border-bottom-width:0;border-left-width:0;border-right-width:0;border-top-width:0;border-width:0;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;padding-top:0 width=320><br><br>I guess that‚Äôs all this time. Cya guys next year for more review of course, and I‚Äôll see if I can compile all the reviews I‚Äôve done for this year or not. Along with the final look of my shelf for the year. Yeah just you wait and see‚Ä¶<br>[P.S.: APoL Chapter 13 is expected to be completed by this weekend. &lt;&lt;This is to make sure I meet the deadline. Really not making progress recently‚Ä¶]<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
