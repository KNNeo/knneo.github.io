Hi guys, welcome back. Yes, the point I‚Äôm here at this time of the week also means I cannot stand the wait till the weekend until I talk about how wonderful Aki-neechan‚Äôs new single is. So let‚Äôs get started before I forget my opinions now, which MAY be overly biased. I‚Äôll try not to, yeah?<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=ToyosakiAkiKanaeTamae><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Toyosaki Aki ‚Äì Kanae Tamae [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy src=https://www.anisong.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/51GvwpYUxwL.jpg style=-webkit-user-select:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320 height=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy src=https://www.anisong.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/51RbJyMG5IL.jpg style=-webkit-user-select:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320 height=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table>(Don‚Äôt ask me why it‚Äôs this style, but she really is trying to be cool. Those 80s-mafia style you know. ‚ÄúBig Sister‚Äù image?) <br><br>Origin: Well we‚Äôve all known Aki-neechan for a long time, ever since this voice actress started her singing career five years ago. Ok, at least I knew. But then her songs have not failed to disappoint. So far I‚Äôve only rejected like‚Ä¶ less than five of her songs? Five of her total two albums full of songs? She continues to stay strong this year, and after the previous single in March (review is at the old site) she comes back with another single, this time more bolder and more adorable. It‚Äôs all about love, according to herself.<br><div align=center></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en data-scribe-reduced-action-queue=">Yes, Aki-neechan. They both are love songs. I love them, and I love you too. xD (Can't help myself, must confess this sooner or later)<br>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/statuses/487200191682867201 target=_blank>July 10, 2014</a></blockquote><br><script async="" charset=utf-8 src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script>(1) Kanae Tamae [Wish Come True]<br>This song proves to be promise from the start I heard it, because of its rock style in nature, back then when I heard the preview on her radio show. Until only recently then I got to hear from the PV (review is just the previous post) and noticed the song was overall pretty good. No overly decorated parts, and a solid rock tune, arranged by the infamous Theatre Brook (he‚Äôs a producer), as mentioned by her again. It‚Äôs really not bad, in my opinion.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br><br>(2) Tomato<br>What the single shows promise surprisingly (again) is the B-side, not the topic song. I was worried about it being a 5-minute song (problem is that longer songs ‚Äúmake more mistakes‚Äù) but this happy song, as mentioned by Aki-neechan (again) is really a great one, and the lyrics make a lot of sense in terms of love, like the English at the introduction is actually ‚ÄúWalking through life together‚Äù. Yeah. And the point that only the grandparents are mentioned means you just shouldn‚Äôt tell your parents about it, huh. Overall, the song makes of a happy, nice love song. And I like it. Actually I love it. And her, too.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br><br>Conclusion: If you loved Aki-neechan (she really would‚Äôve made of a great sister), then you‚Äôll love her even more after this single and the music video. If not, at least take the B-side. It sounds great, at least for a love song. Kudos to the composers who are, for once, trying NOT to spoil the songs! Yay!<br><br>~Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br>[P.S.: Problem is the pre-order I‚Äôve placed has come to a standstill. And it looks like it‚Äôll take time before it will reach me, or even the forwarding service in Japan itself. The focus is that things are already stuck at the JAPANESE online store, which means I have little knowledge of what is happening. Really problematic, in my opinion. Well, worst is that I may have to cancel the pre-order to order from a familiar store like CDJapan or HMV Japan lor‚Ä¶ <span class=emoji title=üò¢>*sob*</span> Hope it doesn‚Äôt happen. <span class=emoji title=üò¢>*sob*</span>]<br>[P.P.S.: Surprisingly for the B-side (2), the lyrics mention nothing of the title until one part, which is that ‚Äòfor you I‚Äôll also eat the tomatoes that I hate‚Äô, which is not even 5% of all the words in the song. Also, translation on this page (this and the (1) song title) are not precisely accurate due to own translation knowledge plus Google Translate.]<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
