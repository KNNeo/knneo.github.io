Figured out this week was the week.Well actually it was just yesterday so I can avoid the sudden interview noticeover this week lol. But I think I worry too much since chances there are manywho applied so yeah I might be unemployed again this month my sis already isegging me to go do delivery service as temp job already HAHA NO NOT DOING ITlol<br /><br />Real life aside, this week was... as boring as I thought. Okay, Idid get my certification from a guy who had a wider grin than mine (FYI mydefault face is a frown) so that's great. But that was Monday already so I wouldsay my happy days are over. Well, not unless you include Entertainment this weekbecause we got quite a good run this week! Let's get started.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH05">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    No seriously Eiji just go home we don't need another Skip as bait lol  </div></blockquote>So there you go. Banana Fish is [spoiler alert] just the name of the drug. Imean, why would you call out someone or an organisation when you're about todie? Okay not that it's got any relation to the new episode (#BANANAFISH05)because Ash is free. Well, conditionally free from prison. And after that, it'sjust a roller coaster of events that if you didn't strap yourself to your seatprobably already died riding on that truck lol. Okay, the episode. Ash is out,of course, since he heard from Max, to get revenge for his brother's death. Bigproblem, because he thinks he can do it himself. Yeah try that when he's thelargest gang leader and half the police will be watching his ass, he probablycould do with some help. Surprisingly, Eiji wants to be on the ride. Goingagainst his supervisor, he helps Ash escape from police interrogation and triesto assassinate Dino himself. Well, it sort of worked since it landed him inhospital but his own gang rival ex-subordinate Arthur is helping the old man, sohe's not going to get an easy advantage. With some help from Shorter, he managesto at this point, render him immobile while he possible continues the search forthe truth with Max, since he technically knows more than Ash himself. Problemis, he doesn't want to go home. Go home as in, the home he escaped out of. Nowyou know why he's so emo. Next episode will be what leads us to the truthfinally, and knowing that [spoiler alert] Banana Fish is the drug name doesn'tmake it feel bad anymore. Problem is Dino thinks this will change the world. Howwill it do so? I have no idea. I mean, he can't possibly make a shit ton of thisand pour it into the water inlet. Or can he? Okay maybe not that but you know,drugs are going to get a whole lot more... devastating on children's lifeexpectancy? I mean I don't know ask Dino he's the one who took other people'skids<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q6UqzGJjFdQ/W2ZqYLmmDtI/AAAAAAAApFs/Au45A0cyzkkmbJbeNc0zi1s-SJxknt-igCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish05_dino.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        MFW I want to diddle kids so bad lmao Dino you're one sick old man      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. I haven't listened to the theme songs yet and they both sound cool, andgreat at further listen. Let's see if I can secure one of these to justifywatching this show.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ChioChan05">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Even if there's an issue with the relationship, all the blame will fall on    the teacher!" Haha Manana you have never been more correct  </div></blockquote>"I'm going to look into this" I mean you're going to be friends with them realsoon haha okay the new episode (#ChioChan05) is still all kinds of weird, butlet's go take a leak in the toilet. As much as I just bombed Chio-chan on hertrip to school on the first part, it was quite an adventure. (I got turned on by<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/22329/Naomi_Oozora" target="_blank"  >the voice actress</a>panting lol) (But seriously how softcore is this show lmao) Here's question eventhough it's totally revealed already: What would you do if you're stuck in themiddle of nowhere searching for a toilet and your bladder is making sure you'llwet your pants/skirt before you can find one? You... firstly crawl. Yes, crawl,with every step and with care. Then, rush into a public toilet of the oppositegender. With ZERO regard of consequences. Then, act as if the toilet needscleaning and get out through the back window. This is fully assuming you'reskinny enough to get out of the smallest windows in existence. Lastly, create adiversion (this is purely depending on luck, and panties) and pretend somethinghappened to you on the streets so no one will think you jumped out of a window.There, problem solved. No really Chio-chan, what's your problem- *shock* Oh. Iam male. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Here heavily implies I can decrease my SAN value just byfinding a nearby bush) Next up, the true value of friendship. Here's a pro tipfor you guys out there, because if you haven't shitted on your friends before,they are not your friends. To add on, if you haven't done the dumbest thingstogether, you're not friends. As much as friendships can be taken down, thestudent council president Momo is going to have a hard time tearing down therelationship between Chio and Manana. Like seriously. As much as I want theMamanachio song and dance to be a music video and soundtrack (it better be)it's... probably their best way of showing their friendship, considering Mananacan't even recall Chio-chan's birthday lol. All in all, fantastic episode asalways, and if every episode didn't blow your mind you could be as weird asthese girls. Just... just wear some safety shorts, yes? It's Anime here so it'salright? I don't know man apparently next week there will be more lol panties Imean haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UYcG0XKuRpw/W2Z0_80_oVI/AAAAAAAApGA/SZP51ai0KVc6sh7PgDgsaQIXqLHaCs5agCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan05_chio2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Mouse over/Tap to see what Chio-chan is so happy about          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NCQDO1sOibc/W2Z0_w7WLWI/AAAAAAAApGE/AvitRCv2Bt8AMeanXopCtjPFjS4qqqLnQCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan05_toilet.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            She is more than happy; She is relieved. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is your latest Ikimonogakari reference lol.Or is it a Naruto reference? I know the former only though so FUCK YOU NARUTOhaha (this hatred will never cease, I promise you)<br />P.P.S. Here's a voiceactor pro tip: Go (back) to the first mention of the Anime title and hear thevoice. That is undoubtedly (if you watched BLEACH) the<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/257/Nobuyuki_Hiyama" target="_blank"  >voice actor behind Madarame Ikkaku</a>. I guess he's one of the guys who peeped at the girls' undies then lol (okaymy bad he was the guy who entered the toilet because his bladder was givingway)<br />[THIS ANIME'S CUTENESS IN GIF!!

Now I just gotta trick that idiot into doing it    with me" &lt;= Takagi-chan's devil thought lol wait she is the devil  </div></blockquote>Wow that's the most desperate I've seen... who's that girl again? Haha hey guyswelcome to another episode of teasing. And no, I'm not going to do my renditionof solving problems because it's the SWIMSUIT EPISODE yeah yeah haha. But I cantruthfully say, Nishikata is happier without women lol. Okay, the OVA episode isabout the water slide. And yes we do NOT have to mention how wonderful it iswhen a boy and a girl go down it together, but suffice it to say they will fallin love with each other. Haha, of course, it's our dear main girl Mano-chan whowanted to go with her... boyfriend Nakai-kun, so yeah, it got drifted off realquick though. Although I must admit same gender hanging out with each otherseems way more natural though so I actually liked the girls' talk and stuff, buthey, the couples gotta go down the slide together too. So with Takagi-chanfinding Nishikata they decide to (or well SHE decides to) spy on the couple toprobably see if they are doing well or not and if all goes to plan. Of courseeven Nishikata did not expect it to be Takagi-chan's motive for bringing him upto the slide to they can go down together... well you know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All in all,Yukari-chan's swimming lesson was a bust, and I wish her other two friends willtreat her better. I assume it was a hard time convincing her to come to thepool, so... the other two guys only ate the whole time? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="576"              data-original-width="1024"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OrfZYxxjAYQ/W2ab0u5C96I/AAAAAAAApGs/7dBYVneL-CwhiV5qp9C-Cz3d_Rx9gF0RQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanOVA_mano1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The many faces of Mano-chan          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="576"              data-original-width="1024"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m8T332ncfNw/W2ab0ktG84I/AAAAAAAApGo/gIv1nGbCyWcRSl3Wkg_43qp3egd1UubGgCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanOVA_mano2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The many faces of Mano-chan          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. God they gotta put that analogy in and yes I'm referring to the floatingducks when Yukari-chan is in the swimming briefing<br />P.P.S. Did Yukari-chanjust take out her glasses and put them back??? Wow, so surreal lmao<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kuroshitsuji</span>  </div></blockquote>Hmm... the new chapter (142) was totally worth the build-up up till now, to behonest. So, summarising what happened in all, other Ciel was resurrected byUndertaker after the incident which made Ciel Ciel form a contract with thedemon to restore his past glory back for the family, but in this case I wouldsay the older brother is trying to steal all of what he has right now? Theshinigamis were about to fight until... guess what, the police arrive?? Yeah,plot twist, everyone. So yeah, the police found out about the incident, NOT thePhantomhive house. Not yet, not until the doors are open and the detective sawit for himself. That, and proof to back up who's the right heir to thehousehold. Cue Elizabeth Milford. Yeah, that could've gone worse. So why didElizabeth side with the other Ciel, considering the Ciel Ciel restored the houseto its former glory although technically sacrificing the brother? I don't knowif (the author) Yana-chan-sensei wants to walks us through this guilt ride but Isuspiciously think so. Now it's more like me thinking that since Elizabethtechnically knew the older brother better as in the flashback she would take hisspot, but considering he's already dead and this boy over here is literally theonly resurrected person Undertaker has ever done, where does this all put us toother Ciel's existence? Man, I'm not going to throw all the existentialismthings on you this is the Anime world btw but I am going to say this: themajority will be by other Ciel's side. And what is Ciel Ciel going to do? Willhe watch to see himself go down to the ground? Will he be evil enough (he isn'tbtw Sebastian is) to use the contracted demon to do whatever is required tocontinue to exact revenge for his family? Why not, I mean? But this one, itmight be his biggest hurdle yet. (Oh please tell me other Ciel is technicallydead so I can see him die again in piece, hopefully in pieces lol)<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="774"          data-original-width="837"          height="295"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PgQlReL1jVk/W2ae2am8E4I/AAAAAAAApG8/VXz-eJm6DOkN8SZhdPuPzbT8QhlsI_IdACLcBGAs/s320/1426.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Introducing Othello, the weakest shinigami we've seen yet lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. To think about this in Sebastian's perspective (or actually the author's)if a shift of leadership in the Phantomhive household were to happen if otherCiel ie. the older brother takes charge, and considering Tanaka-san and Lizzyare on his side, the servants won't have much of a say and with Undertaker it ishighly likely that Sebastian can be eradicated... that might spoil his andCiel's contract for exacting revenge, so yeah, Sebastian will most definitelynot allow that to happen, since it will impede the current Ciel's power tocomplete the contract. Also, the house is burnt down. Considering Undertaker'spowers even if he brought back other Ciel back then he would not have the(demon) power to bring the house back up, hiring servants who will protect themaster, and all the stuff that has been done till far to restore the family'sreputation. How to prevent this eventuality (if possible) from happening though,I have no idea.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>In this week of Klassic Note, I suddenly reminded myself to go check when theAnime theme songs I'm watching this season will release, and heck have theyreleased already. <b>Anime "Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro" theme songs</b> releasedlast week already, but finally giving them a listen they aren't bad, asexpected. So I gave them both. Don't ask for B-sides they aren't great. Also, Ijust listened to <b>Survive Said The Prophet's new single</b> for Anime "BananaFish" opening theme song, and it's short, sweet, and I almost wanted to puttheir single on the shelf. Almost. 2018 me is not generous enough to give themthis quick off the bat. I also took a listen to<b>Shishido Kavka's new album</b>(s) which also released last week and... theone theme song for the Anime with MIYAVI was better haha. Turns out hercollaboration songs are better? Okay, doesn't say much for the album becausemost of the songs are also collaborations and I didn't give any lol. Anime then,Anime. Last but not least, I decided to give <b>Uesaka Sumire's new album</b> alisten after her full initiation into Apple Music Japan just this week with thenew album in streaming too, and of course for the single which hit the ranks ofKlassic Note last year. Turns out not crazily impossible to give because I evengave that Anime "POP TEAM EPIC" theme song too. Ugh, I'm ashamed to say that.With this song also I've came up with a themed yearly which will be released bythe end of the year separate from the... I'm also ashamed to say, #KN10YEARcompilations which are not even in place. I'm sorry guys, feeling emo to get itdone quick.<br /><br />Next week brings us (finally)<b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new single</b>, and damn am I excited. The music video(preview) is pretty good in first impression, so I'm going to be looking forwardto a release for a long time lol. I also have<b>plans to clear my live performance archive</b> because I don't like sittingin front of my computer to just watch lives so I will now, and it'll take placein the long weekend I'll have next week starting Wednesday/Thursday we shallsee, but I'll put my impressions in Twitter if I can. To give you an impressionof what artists are "featured": sphere (yes their 2017 live), Chatmonchy andtheir final live, GLIM SPANKY's latest live in Budokan, and Sambomaster's latestlive.<br /><br />In latest news on Twitter,<b>Asakukra Momo's new single music video</b> (preview) is out for listen,and... if I didn't see the music videos from one Tomatsu Haruka I'll totallyfall in love with Mocho right now. So yes, I'm not. The song isn't impressivethough. <b>Tokyo Karan Koron will release a new album in October</b> this yearafter like, 9 months so that's great, and (don't make me spell ASIAN KUNG-FUGENERATION every time, yes?)<b>Ajikan will release their new single in September</b>. No really, this wasjust hot off the press I just retweeted it go check it out. In other news, youshould've read previous paragraphs to figure out that<b>Uesaka Sumire's music collection</b> is available in Apple Music Japan forstreaming. <b>AZUMA HITOMI</b> will be in a new instrumental band (yes the onewho legend-ed her way to the ranks in Klassic Note 2011)&nbsp;(and no not thesame as "Hello, Wendy!" in which she was in a quattro with Niitsu Yui) by theend of the year, and <b>Scenarioart has formed their independent label</b> andartist management companies signalling departure from their music label Ki/oonMusic and management group Sony Music Artists. Doesn't sound much but inpreparation for their 10 years in band formation we might have more news tocome. They've gotten themselves a fashion label, for starters. I'm for musicthough so no thanks? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yeah that's it fornow. I can say that now because I'll be back tomorrow (hopefully, unless I'm<i>so</i> busy taking in interview phone calls lmao) for more Anime stuff Ihope, and until then... I can't really say for sure if you are going to have anice next week, but I know I am. Happy National Day, my country. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Imean, you should figure it out by now where I live) (No really the answer's onmy Twitter profile)<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
