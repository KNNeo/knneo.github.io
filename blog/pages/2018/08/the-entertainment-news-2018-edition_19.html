And I like how there's the holiday in the middle so if I can't takeit for tomorrow and the day after I can just take a break lol. Well, it's a longstory, but suffice it to say I found a company who wants people doingapplications that is identical to the one self-learnt internship program I madefor that company. So yeah, I'm employed. *cheers*<br /><br />So yeah, postingthis quick and early so I can prepare some know-hows (I'm not confident in myskills especially terminology considering it's self-learnt) to make sure I don'tembarrass myself tomorrow haha<br /><br />LET'S BEGIN!! (Audience:<a href="https://jisho.org/search/norinori" target="_blank">„Éé„É™„Éé„É™</a>„Å†„Å™...)&lt;= I think I have a need to convert my audience to Japanese so I can practicemy lingo and because I don't need translations who reads this shit anywaylmao<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It's like sex" Boy, do I not know anything about that lol  </div></blockquote>I think I am feeling comfortable in watching this series so much I am actuallyliking the plot development tbh. The new episode (#BANANAFISH07) again,emphasises to us that the most important thing humans need is family. Oh well,or so we think. Hey, it's Anime, man. You can write whatever the fuck you wanthaha. Okay, the plot. The crew was going to the West to figure out details aboutBANANA FISH, now known as the drug which had similar effects to common drugslike LSD but with much adverse effects, and this conspiracy may go all the wayto the top. Well, at least to the military because it seems they were using iton the soldiers a lot without them realising. Knowing of the truth, we know Maxand Ash are the only two on the route to discover this mystery, and hopefullywill be the only ones alive after convincing the Japanese duo to go home, andhopefully, Ash noticing something's wrong with the bro and partner Shorter. Hey,the alliance is broken the moment that Dino name appears, to be honest. Still,it gives good hints to the two now that they have to go back to New York, facethe shit that is literally the whole mafia, and try to uncover the truth at thesame time. Sorry Los Angeles trap for the truth, and thanks for all the factswhich probably will not matter once we see Max's family die next week lol. Nah,probably not, but it's good exchange to stop the search, for sure.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kmGAKkXP3zY/W3jWfyQmV1I/AAAAAAAApgE/rAMvm3ej9EoZRy5QQpT4VAzgzqxWD8xOACLcBGAs/s320/bananafish07_magazine.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Please tell me some real life magazine has already made this haha      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ChioChan07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span style="text-align: start;"      >"Do you ask sumo wrestlers why they wear their thongs?" Yeah, I do,      actually. But probably not directly at one of them they too busy touching      other guys lol</span    >  </div></blockquote>Man, I agree with you Chio-chan video games are a problem in Japan as J-Pop is aproblem here where I live haha oh it's just me? <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> The new episode(#ChioChan07) gives us enemas (oops), BL content, and more. All in a day's workfor those animators, I hope. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> Okay, let's talk about what happened.Firstly, Chio-chan's trip to the convenience store. Well, she wanted to buy arare gaming magazine which only is sold locally in the store (I feel you,Chio-chan) but has been replaced by a BL gaming magazine which got her attentionand interest real fast, so I won't say that's a bad thing. Problem is, she hasto buy it. Normally you won't mind because you do it online and the cashierisn't someone you know of who will judge you, but hey Chio-chan doesn't know howto use her computer to do anything else besides gaming, and Andou-san is onshift today, so... you know. She's screwed. But not as bad as the second halfwhere Manana got screwed real hard TWICE by a middle schooler who apparentlyplays finger-up-your-anus games in their private school. Wow. Okay, not true btwso don't go ask any student the next time you go on a foreign student exchange(because it'll be real dumb, or at least make sure the one knows about this showlol), but man it was fun to watch. Just weird to find someone on the streetswanting to stick it up your ass so desperately anyways, but hey, thanksKushitori-senpai for chipping in haha. Yeah, she gonna break her fingers, thatkid. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> Also, never hinted on why or who she was other than her gettingrevenge for her brother, but unfortunately I'm going to spoil it here becauseshe's Andou's sister. Why or how it is so, we'll leave it to future episodes toexplain. I mean, Andou-san can't <i>possibly</i>&nbsp;be interested in boys loveAND know ass sticking, right? RIGHT??? <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> God this show is terrible haha.To end this off,&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;"  >"Homos" is the word you're finding, audience. And I apologise on behalf of  the show for censorship lol it's to keep this show air-able haha</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CnPhOgr31tk/W3jgCG-AwcI/AAAAAAAApgY/GSnv_r9Hpj8F9pjpyBBpl7yt7nN_5nDAACLcBGAs/s320/chiochan07_compare.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Comparison rate: 99.9% (lol)<br />[That is As Nodt from the "BLEACH"            series btw]          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kyFveBveTP8/W3jfj3RV1NI/AAAAAAAApgQ/1CnbifmbhSoupYRrLlIim4Zamf0YxxFPACLcBGAs/s320/chiochan07_poked4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I can't show any of the enema stuff so here's a reaction from poor            Manana lmao<br />          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Oh you damaged store merchandise? Just... put it back! <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> Sorry Japanhaha we have bad habits in this city state<br />P.P.S. Also decided to watchthis live from a Japan TV stream (which is a thing now, go Google "Abema.tv")since "Asobi Asobase" also had it on the channel, and man was it funny to seeJapanese comments on this episode. But hey, I may just do this again buthopefully my impression of the show will dampen so I can laugh again like this,unlike the other which airs on Sunday night and I have to review it the nextday<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>Êº´Áîª</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> MANGA</span>  </div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">  Nothing here, guys. I'll see if I can keep this segment on next week.</div><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week brings us a couple of releases that are worth talking about.<b>Sambomaster's new single</b> is on my shelf (it has been some time since Isaid that lol) after kind of cheating like in Ikimonogakari's (I wouldn't say)last single as a fork from their best album, these guys in order to fulfil amovie credit had an existing song as their image song and B-side of the singlerelease. Of course, re-played so that it feels like the band today. Still goodthough. Okay we'll talk about that hopefully by the end of the month.<b>ClariS new single</b> is okay, I didn't expect too much from it so I justended up giving it after a bad first impression as heard from the Anime creditit's from. But hey, "happy good day" man, so I'm not complaining. I alsoconfirmed on a couple of releases from the past week including<b>Kuraki Mai's new single track and King Gnu's single track</b> as for thelatter I really held back in giving them to be honest. But... in Klassic Note wegive shorter songs relatively easy chance of entering so long as it's notirritating as I hear it multiple times.<br /><br />I'm still (not really) tryingto give songs from the various live performances I've listened to from like, twoweeks ago, and now I regret not&nbsp; listening to Sambomaster's liveperformance this weekend because you know, work stuff. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> So yeah,sphere's live will be hard but for <b>GLIM SPANKY</b> I may have plans. Some ofthe melodies are ringing in my mind from time to time. We shall see. Next weekwill brings us the most lovable silly not Anime girl irl Asakura Momo's 4thsingle because she's just as described (lol) and the new single sounds lively,so I'll give her a chance. Also on review in Klassic Note will be<b>LuckLife's 2nd album</b> which hopefully I'll be able to listen to itconsidering the topic song isn't that great. Man, we're slowly running out ofgood songs...<br /><br />In the newest news which I don't know of,<b>SID's music library</b> (in case you don't know of them I reviewed one oftheir singles back in 2014 lol) is now available (I know I'm a week late in thisbut) in major streaming platforms, and that of course includes Apple MusicJapan. So yeah, go ahead and re-live the past that is now forgotten, butseriously, where are the good songs guys. That, they are trying to realise withthe new mini-album due in September. And they're giving as a preview! Hmm...won't say I like it, but I'll give the release a listen when it comes. Hey,another artist joins the ranks. It's making my Apple Music subscription worthmore every year.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I know this is not much, buthey remember the new Anime airs tonight ie. I can only review them tomorrow.(Well technically I can watch Asobi Asobase live but I wanna watch it twicehaha) Late night Anime problems, everyone. That, and I gotta work tomorrow.<span class="emoji" title="ü§≠">*giggles*</span> Okay cya guys tomorrow. I'm nervous and happy at the same time thatsome small company would want me to work for them. Little do they know... noit's nothing guys don't worry about it haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
