I expected a test though. It feelslike an exam already this morning. Well, I'm not putting too much hopes on thejob interview with the best prospects for taking me in (sorry cousin), but hey,I gotta continue to find jobs. That, and really practice my coding. I'm going tobe lagging behind real good at this rate. Apparently people like terribleprogramming languages like C and Java ugh<br /><br />Talking about disgustingstuff, this post is full of the opposite so yay let's begin<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Did you poke her butt?" OMG teacher wtf are you thinking lol  </div></blockquote>I know I've purposedly watched this online (without subtitles) yesterday night(it's possible) but man watching this the 3rd time through is still funny haha.The new episode (#AsobiAsobase06) continues on the strong momentum of horrorstories, butt play lol, Maeda and so on, so that's going to be a good laugh.Firstly, I wished I get to see these girls read Key of Solomon with Oka-san theprevious time with this supernatural freak is amazing haha. Though ignoringthat, the girls decide to investigate the disappearance of one of the members.Well, I mean, if it's not obvious for you even middle schoolers know this, butyeah, the one girl didn't get teleported. But hey, the truth is not far away asthe trio approach the teacher to find out that... Oka-san has been lied to.Yeah, pretty much. Aguri, the one supposedly missing, is actually hospitalisedfor surgery, and yeah, I would agree with the teacher that if she didn't tellsomeone she probably doesn't want whoever it is to feel bad or be worried abouther. So that's terrible, for Oka-san personally. I mean, I don't have to be inthe supernatural to know about care and concern, and this sure is exhibitedgreatly to be one of the most emotional episodes so far. Next up, the android.Well before this, I feed bad for Hanako. Like really, falling back to thereality that she will never have at this point meaning that one will neverachieve success because there's always that someone who will be better than herin anyway ie. having a boyfriend, is terrible on her mental health, I would say.Maeda comes to the rescue this time round since the other two didn't do too tellon their term papers (Olivia lol that's me irl) to provide her with a solution:an ikemen android who looks good as much as he sounds. Okay, it didn't last verylong as its various flaws gave itself away, and Hanako quickly took care of it,though in front of her friends lol. I mean, it's real gross really, consideringMaeda AND the grandfather lmao. Then, there's the haircut disaster. I mean, Iagree with everyone here that Olivia has wonderful blonde hair (not my fetishbut just general opinion) and cutting it would be a waste, but comparing toHanako's hair it sure is hard on her on the hot summer day. So yeah, she decidedto do it before really going to a hairstylist. (Note: Hanako did not referdirectly to Olivia's sweat glands as written in the subs but to her armpit,which you can infer from there as it felt like the subs made it feel like Hanakogave it away which is not true) It was fine for the first cut on her long bangs,but after that it's all gone to hell. The teacher did come in to pitch awonderful solution, and all will agree with me that Olivia looks cute in ahairband, but you know, acne. So... Olivia became substitute teacher lmao.Lastly, the girls play a game of "<a  href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%A4%A7%E6%A0%B9%E6%8A%9C%E3%81%8D&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6mfjd-encAhWWWX0KHXQLBhcQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974"  target="_blank"  >daikon nuki</a>" (Trans.: Radish Pulling) where it's kind of a school sport in middle and highschools of Japan to... pull each other's calves lol. But yeah, the girls decideto give it a go. I like how the comments online (refer to first sentence ofparagraph) mention how Kasumi managed to hold on due to the extra chest weightlol, and how Kasumi managed to pull it off (pun intended after I wrote theprevious similar phrase) because Hanako is rather weak at this game, turned outto be like a life and death action show with typical evil grin on Kasumi andHanako being pulled away like she's going to hell lol. All in all wonderfulepisode as always, and being able to watch this multiple times without gettingbored is good evidence of how re-watchable this gag comedy show is.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ngAU_rfYHOA/W3FyKf03u8I/AAAAAAAApXA/nhpFgU40OKgBk33lwa-5ILgsLg1fiLzBwCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase06_olivia5.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            If you need an image definition of "fugly" lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-G-uoChY1HrY/W3FyQ9KBi3I/AAAAAAAApXE/1Is0RzWul9sVFjFuysI_mL0zIwW_knOEgCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase06_voodoo.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            If you need an image definition of "overkill" lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. I know Olivia is best girl because she is cute (she is) but man is Hanakogreat. She has everything: the wacky image, the more than over reactions, thesinging I'll bow down to (may I refer you to her singing before Olivia cut herhair and the daikon song lmao), the fucked up butler/assistant/something... theright to be jealous of people with boyfriends lol also<a  href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xptTULGTG0g/W3FTW6dMZRI/AAAAAAAApWs/md3A_xdFJHkadiMAd82LLUAxDCfLkp5rwCLcBGAs/s640/DkPQJ7SUYAAXdtS.jpg"  target="_blank"  >a good real life equivalent</a>hehe that is Kino Hina-chan btw<br />P.P.S.

It's notdisgusting me to the least though, I've seen worse in the world of Anime.(Thanks, Kara no Kyoukai) The new episode (#AttackOnTitan41) talks about moreprogression, and of course, hunting down of the Scouts and specifically, Levi'ssquad. Two more landed in the hands of the squad, but instead of getting killed,they decided to help them upon learning of the truth. And Levi is right, thereare too many people who do not know of the truth. (I like how we all know aboutit though I guess we're not within those walls) That, and the son of the Reeveswho got killed by Levi's bro Kenny Ackerman (oops *looks at Mikasa*) took thecourage to stand up against the Military Police, hopefully protecting thedistrict I don't know for how long. Meanwhile, Levi's squad ambushed a campsitehopefully to gain more information about the whereabouts of Eren and Historiabut to no result, and are probably going to meet another end once again. Amongstall this, Erwin has been giving in to all sorts of torture, but not until finaljudgement. Until then, let's hope next week will be a great revolt we will beable to witness so this tide will be able to turn things around. I mean, to notknow of the truth is bad. We don't need stories to tell us that just look atreality and Communism, people. I'll be looking forward to what Erwin and Pyxishave up their sleeves next.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-28RnP-m7wBk/W3F7EnhkNsI/AAAAAAAApXk/t1T6eAdw7movPKzBkGUN9TwsrphrAHI3wCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan41_erwin.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Thought Erwin deserved a thumbnail before he dies (hopefully not)      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Apparently they did develop a new maneuver gear in the dark and not let itbe used by the Scouts for some reason. Man, evil government as we like ithaha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Tsukumogami04">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "You, get out" &lt;= That's Seiji if he has balls haha  </div></blockquote>I kept forgetting that apart from these guys being real good at taking thegossip, they are also capable of creating the gossip hehe. "In the new episode(#Tsukumogami04) of #TheGossip" (I mean, you know I gotta) we're introduced witha playboy who's out to get Okou? How can Seiji stand back and not protect hisstepsister, right?? You're right! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But it's more complicated than youthink. "Let's go over everything we know." (Yes, that's a Goi impersonationright there) Story goes that the young master of Omiya is a playboy, or so therumours go. But as with all stories, this one is also a misunderstanding. Imean, the guy keeps coming into the rental shop for a better reason than tryingto look like that guy who liked Okou-san and is trying to pick her up? SureSeiji, do whatever you like. But as with all investigations, just send a coupleof items along their way and the tsukumogami will reveal to us all. We learnt acouple of terms from the Edo period along the way, and we found out that the guyisn't what was rumoured after all. Even his precious item's tsukumogami canvouch for this. Then why? So apparently in hosting events back then, it's hardto reject two things: alcohol, and women. Now you know why I'm alone without anyfriends lol. That, and coupled with the fact that he keeps avoiding the otherguests by leaving early and paying the bill quick, he just seems to worsen thesituation by inviting more people who will want to witness the rumour forthemselves. Other than the fact that they'll never get to see it, the youngmaster seems to be actually, shy about confessing his feelings for the othergirl. So yeah, typical romance problems. And that's where the tsukumogami cameinto the picture. By spreading a rumour that the girl he likes is about to getmarried, this has picked up some of his courage to you know, try out romancingfor once. Hey, a real episode where the little ones are of help haha I'll belooking forward to the next where... #RIPSuou?? I don't know man the ending wasso vague!!! More next week I guess<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HpTUksEVmRY/W3GawWcXGUI/AAAAAAAApX8/Fuv5cl0-JMsCYNx0tkRepUMLCO5vmPLKwCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami04_ohana.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is the cutest girl in this Anime I Have.

Memorable moments includeher:<br /><ul>  <li>    Speaking while cracking her knuckles and blurting out the pain at the same    time  </li>  <li>    Taking forever to find Bolivia or something and she shouted "It's (in)    Japan!!", and  </li>  <li>    Saying the first thing that came into her mind when asked why her name was    cute was because she was born by her parents lol  </li></ul>Yeah, I'll probably give her new single a listen next week when it comes by hahayou know I will. Cya guys om Sunday then, or hopefully I'll dig up that singlethat I should have reviewed months ago and hopefully review it this year? Idon't know.
