Hey.<br /><br />It all went well, I hope. I expected a test though. It feels
like an exam already this morning. Well, I'm not putting too much hopes on the
job interview with the best prospects for taking me in (sorry cousin), but hey,
I gotta continue to find jobs. That, and really practice my coding. I'm going to
be lagging behind real good at this rate. Apparently people like terrible
programming languages like C and Java ugh<br /><br />Talking about disgusting
stuff, this post is full of the opposite so yay let's begin<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I know I've purposedly watched this online (without subtitles) yesterday night
(it's possible) but man watching this the 3rd time through is still funny haha.
The new episode (#AsobiAsobase06) continues on the strong momentum of horror
stories, butt play lol, Maeda and so on, so that's going to be a good laugh.
Firstly, I wished I get to see these girls read Key of Solomon with Oka-san the
previous time with this supernatural freak is amazing haha. Though ignoring
that, the girls decide to investigate the disappearance of one of the members.
Well, I mean, if it's not obvious for you even middle schoolers know this, but
yeah, the one girl didn't get teleported. But hey, the truth is not far away as
the trio approach the teacher to find out that... Oka-san has been lied to.
Yeah, pretty much. Aguri, the one supposedly missing, is actually hospitalised
for surgery, and yeah, I would agree with the teacher that if she didn't tell
someone she probably doesn't want whoever it is to feel bad or be worried about
her. So that's terrible, for Oka-san personally. I mean, I don't have to be in
the supernatural to know about care and concern, and this sure is exhibited
greatly to be one of the most emotional episodes so far. Next up, the android.
Well before this, I feed bad for Hanako. Like really, falling back to the
reality that she will never have at this point meaning that one will never
achieve success because there's always that someone who will be better than her
in anyway ie. having a boyfriend, is terrible on her mental health, I would say.
Maeda comes to the rescue this time round since the other two didn't do too tell
on their term papers (Olivia lol that's me irl) to provide her with a solution:
an ikemen android who looks good as much as he sounds. Okay, it didn't last very
long as its various flaws gave itself away, and Hanako quickly took care of it,
though in front of her friends lol. I mean, it's real gross really, considering
Maeda AND the grandfather lmao. Then, there's the haircut disaster. I mean, I
agree with everyone here that Olivia has wonderful blonde hair (not my fetish
but just general opinion) and cutting it would be a waste, but comparing to
Hanako's hair it sure is hard on her on the hot summer day. So yeah, she decided
to do it before really going to a hairstylist. (Note: Hanako did not refer
directly to Olivia's sweat glands as written in the subs but to her armpit,
which you can infer from there as it felt like the subs made it feel like Hanako
gave it away which is not true) It was fine for the first cut on her long bangs,
but after that it's all gone to hell. The teacher did come in to pitch a
wonderful solution, and all will agree with me that Olivia looks cute in a
hairband, but you know, acne. So... Olivia became substitute teacher lmao.
Lastly, the girls play a game of "<a

  target="_blank"
  >daikon nuki</a
>" (Trans.: Radish Pulling) where it's kind of a school sport in middle and high
schools of Japan to... pull each other's calves lol. But yeah, the girls decide
to give it a go. I like how the comments online (refer to first sentence of
paragraph) mention how Kasumi managed to hold on due to the extra chest weight
lol, and how Kasumi managed to pull it off (pun intended after I wrote the
previous similar phrase) because Hanako is rather weak at this game, turned out
to be like a life and death action show with typical evil grin on Kasumi and
Hanako being pulled away like she's going to hell lol. All in all wonderful
episode as always, and being able to watch this multiple times without getting
bored is good evidence of how re-watchable this gag comedy show is.<br />

P.S. I know Olivia is best girl because she is cute (she is) but man is Hanako
great. She has everything: the wacky image, the more than over reactions, the
singing I'll bow down to (may I refer you to her singing before Olivia cut her
hair and the daikon song lmao), the fucked up butler/assistant/something... the
right to be jealous of people with boyfriends lol also

I must say, it's real easy to get interrogated in this show haha. It's not
disgusting me to the least though, I've seen worse in the world of Anime.
(Thanks, Kara no Kyoukai) The new episode (#AttackOnTitan41) talks about more
progression, and of course, hunting down of the Scouts and specifically, Levi's
squad. Two more landed in the hands of the squad, but instead of getting killed,
they decided to help them upon learning of the truth. And Levi is right, there
are too many people who do not know of the truth. (I like how we all know about
it though I guess we're not within those walls) That, and the son of the Reeves
who got killed by Levi's bro Kenny Ackerman (oops *looks at Mikasa*) took the
courage to stand up against the Military Police, hopefully protecting the
district I don't know for how long. Meanwhile, Levi's squad ambushed a campsite
hopefully to gain more information about the whereabouts of Eren and Historia
but to no result, and are probably going to meet another end once again. Amongst
all this, Erwin has been giving in to all sorts of torture, but not until final
judgement. Until then, let's hope next week will be a great revolt we will be
able to witness so this tide will be able to turn things around. I mean, to not
know of the truth is bad. We don't need stories to tell us that just look at
reality and Communism, people. I'll be looking forward to what Erwin and Pyxis
have up their sleeves next.<br />

P.S. Apparently they did develop a new maneuver gear in the dark and not let it
be used by the Scouts for some reason. Man, evil government as we like it

    "You, get out" &lt;= That's Seiji if he has balls haha

</blockquote>
I kept forgetting that apart from these guys being real good at taking the
gossip, they are also capable of creating the gossip hehe. "In the new episode
(#Tsukumogami04) of #TheGossip" (I mean, you know I gotta) we're introduced with
a playboy who's out to get Okou? How can Seiji stand back and not protect his
stepsister, right?? You're right! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But it's more complicated than you
think. "Let's go over everything we know." (Yes, that's a Goi impersonation
right there) Story goes that the young master of Omiya is a playboy, or so the
rumours go. But as with all stories, this one is also a misunderstanding. I
mean, the guy keeps coming into the rental shop for a better reason than trying
to look like that guy who liked Okou-san and is trying to pick her up? Sure
Seiji, do whatever you like. But as with all investigations, just send a couple
of items along their way and the tsukumogami will reveal to us all. We learnt a
couple of terms from the Edo period along the way, and we found out that the guy
isn't what was rumoured after all. Even his precious item's tsukumogami can
vouch for this. Then why? So apparently in hosting events back then, it's hard
to reject two things: alcohol, and women. Now you know why I'm alone without any
friends lol. That, and coupled with the fact that he keeps avoiding the other
guests by leaving early and paying the bill quick, he just seems to worsen the
situation by inviting more people who will want to witness the rumour for
themselves. Other than the fact that they'll never get to see it, the young
master seems to be actually, shy about confessing his feelings for the other
girl. So yeah, typical romance problems. And that's where the tsukumogami came
into the picture. By spreading a rumour that the girl he likes is about to get
married, this has picked up some of his courage to you know, try out romancing
for once. Hey, a real episode where the little ones are of help haha I'll be
looking forward to the next where... #RIPSuou?? I don't know man the ending was
so vague!!! More next week I guess<br />

P.S. "People are trying to get their hands on you!" I mean, this show would be
way more direct if Seiji was a man lol<br />P.P.S. "Let's go over things" That's
when your boss has no idea what he's doing and keeps asking for your opinion
just shut up already Goi lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry for the late
post I was watching a livestream with Mocho (Asakura Momo) on it and I can't
stop laughing at her silliness this girl's too cute. Memorable moments include
her:<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    Speaking while cracking her knuckles and blurting out the pain at the same
    time
  </li>
  <li>
    Taking forever to find Bolivia or something and she shouted "It's (in)
    Japan!!", and
  </li>
  <li>
    Saying the first thing that came into her mind when asked why her name was
    cute was because she was born by her parents lol
  </li>
</ul>
Yeah, I'll probably give her new single a listen next week when it comes by haha
you know I will. Cya guys om Sunday then, or hopefully I'll dig up that single
that I should have reviewed months ago and hopefully review it this year? I
don't know. Haha bye
