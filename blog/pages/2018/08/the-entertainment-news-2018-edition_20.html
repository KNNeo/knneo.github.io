Hey!<br /><br />I know I look like I'm happy, but hey, my first day of full-time
employment getting a proper salary... wasn't that bad. But considering I came
out of government service to the private sector, you must wonder why everyone is
so slack. Fine by me though. *waves goodbye to previous employer* Haha okay
let's do Anime then! <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Things I can't talk about with my colleagues... or
could I?<br /><br />Well, we can but hope. *punches chest with clenched fist*
March forward!! &lt;= not Attack on Titan reference<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I thought that tsukumogami show is the only Anime this season I'll be watching
talk about gossip but hey this one has it too haha even though I think we can
come up with those ourselves lol. The new episode (#AsobiAsobase07) plays a lot
on conspiracy, and pretty much all the weird stuff comes back and reminds you
this show is nothing but a joke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like really, there's nothing serious
about this show, isn't it? Okay, maybe. Firstly, Aozora-san (the one suspected
of being a male) has a request for the girls. Specifically, to steal a book
which reveals secrets of the people in school. It's mostly on Hanako's fault
which brought the reputation of the Pastimer's Club to its lowest in Anime
history for school clubs, but still, when you want to read a book, you read all
the way till the end. *sees Aozora burn some pages* Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah,
the only serious part of the show too. Also, sorry Olivia we know of your BO
lol. Secondly, Hanako's bored after school. Well, remember Kasumi and Olivia had
to take remedial classes? This genius doesn't have to, and it took some time for
her to realise that she could just meddle with her friend's stuff. So sorry
Kasumi, it was all meant to be. I mean, the BL thing. And damn, that was quite
lame. Not only did they put the story on a dumb end, they also didn't reveal
what happened after the cut. Well, I guess we have to imagine like how Hanako
imagined it I guess. Lastly, home economics the way you like it. Olivia's one
was great and simple and looks great on her too, Hanako made a yukata which was
kind of off due to the lack of sleeves but didn't fare as worse as Kasumi who
took a risk and tried making a T-shirt which CAN'T FIT HER HUGE RACK lol yes I
meant to do that haha. So yeah, the skirt thing would have worked, but instead
she chose the Hanako-please-save-me method which of course, ended up in a
disaster. I hope Hanako's yukata was fine after this lol<br />

Wow, this episode (#AttackOnTitan42) is fantastic. Finally, JOY in an Anime
series of despair. I hope we aren't near the end because it sure feels like so
right now. Following Erwin's supposed conviction in front of the king, the pivot
point came in where Pyxis cleans his butt off the Scouts so he doesn't get
killed, the officials in royalty think they are right, and suddenly Wall Rose
was broken. So yeah, make the decision to close them so half the people left get
killed? Well, at least the Military Police head had some balls to defend his own
humane decision. So yeah, apparently it was a planned coup detat, and the
Premier ie. head of the military is ready to act in response to a liability of a
government and a really fake I-paid-to-not-talk-and-sleep-here king. (God, I
wanna be that guy lol) But of course, this was only half the story. The other
half rests on the real royal blood who were purposedly set on fire on the day
where Wall Maria (recall Episode 1) was broken down, and what were the Reiss
family doing praying in church? Well I wouldn't know, but suffice it to say,
Lord Reiss had his way. Why hold on to his last hope of a descendant and Eren? I
mean, if Hange didn't give enough of a clue for you all to guess I'll make a
guess right here: Eren's about to get eaten. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay we can't do that he
has to live. But, we might be revealed what might be the biggest time bomb in
close to 40 Anime episodes, this show. Let's see what you have up your nape,
Historia. (And no, I'm not doing a sex act lol)<br />

In the new episode (#Tsukumogami05) of... come guys say it with me: #TheGossip!!
Yeah, we got it there haha. Okay, the episode. Ignoring the still supposed
mystery and ending of mention of Suou which apparently is a fake since the two
immediately recognised it, Okou-san also kind of helped avert the marriage
disaster from last week. Moving on, we talk about a bandit, of justice! And this
time, it's Ohime the tsukumogami's turn. Legend has it that there's this guy who
grants the wishes from the nearby shrine, that, and steals from the rich to give
to the poor. Supposedly swaying towards any wish that is happening in town, it
got real attention in the community when the news spread far and wide in paper.
Ohime, curious to see one for herself, got in the act but with a different
story, I suppose. We'll explain that in a while, but yeah, it's like that
moonhead story but with Ohime now haha. In a series of events, we then found out
that it was all for intention, where the newspaper man did the act, brought it
up to 9000, and they were selling like hotcakes. I mean, the one guy who stole
from the same place every time? Yeah, too bad I was too dumb to figure this out,
but the guy's creating stories for his own benefit. Sorry I can't be excited
about writing about it because I believe you should watch it for yourself as
it's as interesting... as it can sound like in Edo period drama. I promise, it's
better than real life ones. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Funny thoughts happened when I watched this
show which kind of made no sense though, but hey it's Anime I kind of forgave
it. For example, no one knows if Ohime was actually stolen or her statement was
true since she was the "God" and the other one present was Itachi Kozo (lol) so
yeah, I wouldn't believe it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time on #TheGossip, where we
continue to progress that cancelled marriage hopefully convincing your mother to
let you marry the one cute girl in the cafe. Hey, it's not hard today but back
then, it's quite a challenge. Be sure to make use of your nearby pawn shop
merchant to make sure your mom believes you want the smart girl behind the
counter lol. Hey actually Okou-san can fake the news too, make it super valuable
and she'll have done it!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah the jokes never end<br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />Cya guys on Sunday then. This is going to be a good
exception as I struggle to do this during my work days. I mean, it's only Day 1
so it's fine, but if I ever have to do overtime... forgive me for pushing this

everyone! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
