But considering I cameout of government service to the private sector, you must wonder why everyone isso slack. Fine by me though. *waves goodbye to previous employer* Haha okaylet's do Anime then! <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Things I can't talk about with my colleagues... orcould I?<br /><br />Well, we can but hope. *punches chest with clenched fist*March forward!! &lt;= not Attack on Titan reference<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I don't care anymore" and CUE THE TRAINING MONTAGE lmao  </div></blockquote>I thought that tsukumogami show is the only Anime this season I'll be watchingtalk about gossip but hey this one has it too haha even though I think we cancome up with those ourselves lol. The new episode (#AsobiAsobase07) plays a loton conspiracy, and pretty much all the weird stuff comes back and reminds youthis show is nothing but a joke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like really, there's nothing seriousabout this show, isn't it? Okay, maybe. Firstly, Aozora-san (the one suspectedof being a male) has a request for the girls. Specifically, to steal a bookwhich reveals secrets of the people in school. It's mostly on Hanako's faultwhich brought the reputation of the Pastimer's Club to its lowest in Animehistory for school clubs, but still, when you want to read a book, you read allthe way till the end. *sees Aozora burn some pages* Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah,the only serious part of the show too. Also, sorry Olivia we know of your BOlol. Secondly, Hanako's bored after school. Well, remember Kasumi and Olivia hadto take remedial classes? This genius doesn't have to, and it took some time forher to realise that she could just meddle with her friend's stuff. So sorryKasumi, it was all meant to be. I mean, the BL thing. And damn, that was quitelame. Not only did they put the story on a dumb end, they also didn't revealwhat happened after the cut. Well, I guess we have to imagine like how Hanakoimagined it I guess. Lastly, home economics the way you like it. Olivia's onewas great and simple and looks great on her too, Hanako made a yukata which waskind of off due to the lack of sleeves but didn't fare as worse as Kasumi whotook a risk and tried making a T-shirt which CAN'T FIT HER HUGE RACK lol yes Imeant to do that haha. So yeah, the skirt thing would have worked, but insteadshe chose the Hanako-please-save-me method which of course, ended up in adisaster. I hope Hanako's yukata was fine after this lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LGFzYjDQHjk/W3q1817b3MI/AAAAAAAApg8/x7fwYnzyRB04S1gsoM-8lflGvolNyTr5wCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase07_girls6.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When you overreact in front of your friends lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Goe_iL8ivLQ/W3q1_ZYscQI/AAAAAAAAphA/3-8ciS5PnjgBePw3jnEgGF8k5MZm5DmxQCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase07_yukata.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Hanako is so cute in this I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. I like how Hanako wants to burn away all their crimes when it has so faralready been made into seven 20-minute length videos and broadcast in dozens ofTV channels and the Internet lmao<br />P.P.S. "OS XP" lol you Anime can't youjust pay the copyright<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan42">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span style="text-align: start;"      >"If humanity is more precious than one single life..." I mean Erwin, with      one man you can't bang haha</span    >  </div></blockquote>Wow, this episode (#AttackOnTitan42) is fantastic. Finally, JOY in an Animeseries of despair. I hope we aren't near the end because it sure feels like soright now. Following Erwin's supposed conviction in front of the king, the pivotpoint came in where Pyxis cleans his butt off the Scouts so he doesn't getkilled, the officials in royalty think they are right, and suddenly Wall Rosewas broken. So yeah, make the decision to close them so half the people left getkilled? Well, at least the Military Police head had some balls to defend his ownhumane decision. So yeah, apparently it was a planned coup detat, and thePremier ie. head of the military is ready to act in response to a liability of agovernment and a really fake I-paid-to-not-talk-and-sleep-here king. (God, Iwanna be that guy lol) But of course, this was only half the story. The otherhalf rests on the real royal blood who were purposedly set on fire on the daywhere Wall Maria (recall Episode 1) was broken down, and what were the Reissfamily doing praying in church? Well I wouldn't know, but suffice it to say,Lord Reiss had his way. Why hold on to his last hope of a descendant and Eren? Imean, if Hange didn't give enough of a clue for you all to guess I'll make aguess right here: Eren's about to get eaten. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay we can't do that hehas to live. But, we might be revealed what might be the biggest time bomb inclose to 40 Anime episodes, this show. Let's see what you have up your nape,Historia. (And no, I'm not doing a sex act lol)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Jcsm8Z49ZXs/W3q9Ul52RII/AAAAAAAAphw/-qtQmiP4ungeU9DY3JFC2e7Y71GbP1H9wCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan42_eren.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Thought he looked ripped so I gave him a screenshot          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D5Tfp5LXdIk/W3q9Uxhq56I/AAAAAAAAphs/Lh_E_gdKe2YoqZbdjZn-hv8lTDNGkR3qQCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan42_erwin.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Thought he looked worse than last week so I gave him a screenshot            haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Okay, the episode. Ignoring the still supposedmystery and ending of mention of Suou which apparently is a fake since the twoimmediately recognised it, Okou-san also kind of helped avert the marriagedisaster from last week. Moving on, we talk about a bandit, of justice! And thistime, it's Ohime the tsukumogami's turn. Legend has it that there's this guy whogrants the wishes from the nearby shrine, that, and steals from the rich to giveto the poor. Supposedly swaying towards any wish that is happening in town, itgot real attention in the community when the news spread far and wide in paper.Ohime, curious to see one for herself, got in the act but with a differentstory, I suppose. We'll explain that in a while, but yeah, it's like thatmoonhead story but with Ohime now haha. In a series of events, we then found outthat it was all for intention, where the newspaper man did the act, brought itup to 9000, and they were selling like hotcakes. I mean, the one guy who stolefrom the same place every time? Yeah, too bad I was too dumb to figure this out,but the guy's creating stories for his own benefit. Sorry I can't be excitedabout writing about it because I believe you should watch it for yourself asit's as interesting... as it can sound like in Edo period drama. I promise, it'sbetter than real life ones. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Funny thoughts happened when I watched thisshow which kind of made no sense though, but hey it's Anime I kind of forgaveit. For example, no one knows if Ohime was actually stolen or her statement wastrue since she was the "God" and the other one present was Itachi Kozo (lol) soyeah, I wouldn't believe it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time on #TheGossip, where wecontinue to progress that cancelled marriage hopefully convincing your mother tolet you marry the one cute girl in the cafe. Hey, it's not hard today but backthen, it's quite a challenge. Be sure to make use of your nearby pawn shopmerchant to make sure your mom believes you want the smart girl behind thecounter lol. Hey actually Okou-san can fake the news too, make it super valuableand she'll have done it!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah the jokes never end<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8Gas9dpwHnA/W3rDW09D2vI/AAAAAAAApiA/WVI6BNIWl80elm22fBA-sIqn0p2YbAlSgCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami05_faint.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            That one time thinking too much killed him lol Goi          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3EdJpGvVt2Y/W3rKSdad8FI/AAAAAAAApiM/KZbImXorfXgVhGi27z0l3qb1xnXJxBukACLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami05_shock.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When no one thought you got Employee of the Month          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.
