Hey! I'm going for an interview tomorrow. Wish me luck. Probably also will fail
like, 2 minutes into the "interrogation" because I suck at my university major
and any question they throw at me I'll just screw it up. So yeah, wish me
luck.<br /><br />You may notice, therefore, that my reviews for the Anime below
may take a dip in quality (is there one?) so yeah, maybe you should take it more
seriously? Haha I don't know like I don't know what to do for tomorrow too

Wow that took quite a turn, that pen to the other table. I'm referring to the
animation btw haha.&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;"
  >Oh and Hanako-chan? That's not Harajuku style that's more like arson style
  lol.&nbsp;</span
>The new episode (#AsobiAsobase05) has so many laughs, I just forgot I've got
real life problems to deal with haha. Firstly, Hanako sets a restaurant on fire.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Besides totally summarising what happened, we need to mention a little
bit more about... you know, Hanako's fashion style. I just hope this is not her
usual style when she leaves the house it'll make the fire department really busy
lol. Also, don't ask me how that happened but man, does indirect arson count as
a crime? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Secondly, we're introduced with a new character. She is
Aozora-san, and... she is suspected of being a futanari. Yes. That. (Don't
search if you don't know I can't put the mature rating gate in front of you)
Despite what might feel like it from her unusual activities in school, and the
fact that she might be voiced by a male (no really, it is) (Edit: It's Yuuki Aoi
btw no wonder), she apparently has perfect excuses which make her look like a
normal girl who Hanako hates haha. But hey, we gotta wonder. Next, my favourite
segment. We're introduced with another character Oka-san, who for some reason,
just "lost" all of her members in the supernatural club she was in. So yeah,
kind of a problem 'cos the club's gonna get disbanded by the school. She
overheard the girls play an Ouija game board, and decide to join in. To add on,
she brought her own game into the table, and it's probably the scariest
hide-and-seek the girls have ever played. Well, spoiler alert because someone
took away the doll of "Maeda" (lol) in the end so I wouldn't call that scary but
Olivia and Hanako practically died so... we only need one more member to form
back the supernatural club now? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Aozora-san you want to join? lmao)
Last but not least, ranked second in this episode, is the talk about having
babies. I would say this got as far as Seitokai Yakuindomo level of wrong, and
the teacher's involvement didn't make it any better, but thank goodness Hanako
decided not to have kids anymore. The funnier things are the common knowledge
questions we deem common aren't as common on these middle school girls. You guys
know what a French Kiss is, don't you? I know, because it's a kiss between
French people. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> I mean, doesn't have to be both of them one of them can
be like, the great-grandmother is French will do lol<br />

Wow that's quite a lot of truth to digest after one peaceful episode. The new
episode (#AttackOnTitan40) talks about the story behind the government, and how
the royalty came to be. According to most accounts from Erwin, Historia's past
and the father, we can come up with a pretty good deduction. Allow me to paint
the inglorious history for you guys. Story goes - as seen from episode 1 - that
a century ago, humans were forced to be behind walls with the emergence of
Titans. In there, they hid behind the walls while maintaining prosperity,
keeping what's left of the human species alive. Well, at least they's what they
tell you. We now know that the government of the Trost district/country/kingdom
had to take severe measures to ensure peace within the walls. I mean, why be so
extreme with its internal affairs? Why only do the Titans attack at episode 1?
Remember there was total peace before that? So yeah, something must have
happened with the government itself, and apparently, it was due to the then King
who was not meant to be. At this point, the relation between humans in Trost and
Titans felt more like a threat, but yeah, the current governing body is
balancing between keeping its people alive and quiet while making sure they all
don't get killed. Too bad with Eren that might not be possible. Eren's Titan
powers might likely happen thanks to the new knowledge of intelligent Titans
(read the eyecatch ie. image in the middle of the episode for details) where it
is possible for a Titan to get stronger by consuming another. Chances are Eren's
dad got hold of such a sample (don't ask me how) and "fed" it to Eren, resulting
in his warcry-like Titan powers, which obviously could prove useful in battle.
Considering this, the current government would like to of course, take Eren in
and you know, NOT make him the superpower. You know, like, let him get eaten by
probably someone who is within the walls and knows how to control that power
already. Lastly, I'll end this story with supposed plans of Erwin and Levi's
squad right now. Erwin aims to seek for the truth to the point of sacrificing
for the greater good, and Levi... let's just say his cowboy-looking brethren is
getting in the way. That, we'll have to leave it to next week. Man, this is
getting exciting.<br />

P.S. Society advice #40: Do not kill anyone in front of kids. Even if he or she
is not one's family.<br />P.P.S. Also also, congrats on Hange taking the new
role of Commander of the Scouts! Pity there wouldn't be many people left to
command after this lol<br /><br />

Wow! No introduction that was played over the past two episodes? That's new.
Haha okay the new episode (#Tsukumogami03) brings in the new #TheGossip
character (oh that's the new hashtag now haha) Nadeshiko, recently bought in by
the Izumoya, by Okou-san since in relation, Sanae-sama who was the wife of the
first episode victim lol and needed a change in apparel as
<strike>all of them</strike> most of them are childish and rather inappropriate
as a grown-up according to the mother. (Sorry ladies of today the women of the
past were cooler haha) And this difference is mainly because (and I don't want
to conclude this quickly but) the mother and daughter lacked the communication
to listen to each other's concerns. So yeah, the mother probably gave in since
the husband did not mind of the childish apparel anyway. And that is thanks to
Usagi the tsukumogami and the comb, who was originally used for a mother to comb
her daughter's hair. Sorry for sending that purple bat to go do scouting, but
overhearing the conversation between Sanae-sama and Okou-san you gotta find out
because it's #TheGossip haha God I love this show. Turns out that is of course,
Okou-san's obsession for a newly released comb which she could not afford, so
yeah, Seiji is still fine since the one handsome guy who the sister likes did
not come back lol. Although that leaves us for more stories next time maybe, I
would prefer #TheGossip to continue as is instead of going into the romance
Anime direction haha. Sorry Seiji, you are not going to get any love from your
sister lol. Also also, there are so many expressions in this show I can't even
talk about all of them because the story of #TheGossip every week is so complete
and good I have to share, so be sure to check out the most entertaining bunch of
Anime characters I've ever seen in a decade. No seriously, Usagi (voiced by
Iguchi Yuka) is great tbh. Also also (I'm Usagi now lol), we may agree with you
Sanae-sama's mother on the rabbits origin about bringing luck in numbers but man
have you not heard of

at the red light district, so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. Seriously if there's no
YouTube and video games these tsukumogami are the entertainment I don't care if
it's a part-time job I WANT THAT JOB PLEASE lol #TheGossip<br />[*narrating with
a heavy tone* "TONIGHT, ON HASHTAG THE GOSSIP" lmao can't help but this
seriously man the CIA series can't even compare to this]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And...
that'll be it. Wow, that was relaxing. Thanks Anime, for oppressing my anxiety
problems for tomorrow even though I know it's not going to change anything after
that I'm just wasting time to get insulted tomorrow in my best outfit <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span>
