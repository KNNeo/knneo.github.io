I'm going for an interview tomorrow. Wish me luck. Probably also will faillike, 2 minutes into the "interrogation" because I suck at my university majorand any question they throw at me I'll just screw it up. So yeah, wish meluck.<br /><br />You may notice, therefore, that my reviews for the Anime belowmay take a dip in quality (is there one?) so yeah, maybe you should take it moreseriously? Haha I don't know like I don't know what to do for tomorrow too<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase05">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Two of them graduated, one transferred, and the other was teleported" She    WHAT??  </div></blockquote>Wow that took quite a turn, that pen to the other table. I'm referring to theanimation btw haha.&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;"  >Oh and Hanako-chan? That's not Harajuku style that's more like arson style  lol.&nbsp;</span>The new episode (#AsobiAsobase05) has so many laughs, I just forgot I've gotreal life problems to deal with haha. Firstly, Hanako sets a restaurant on fire.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Besides totally summarising what happened, we need to mention a littlebit more about... you know, Hanako's fashion style. I just hope this is not herusual style when she leaves the house it'll make the fire department really busylol. Also, don't ask me how that happened but man, does indirect arson count asa crime? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Secondly, we're introduced with a new character. She isAozora-san, and... she is suspected of being a futanari. Yes. That. (Don'tsearch if you don't know I can't put the mature rating gate in front of you)Despite what might feel like it from her unusual activities in school, and thefact that she might be voiced by a male (no really, it is) (Edit: It's Yuuki Aoibtw no wonder), she apparently has perfect excuses which make her look like anormal girl who Hanako hates haha. But hey, we gotta wonder. Next, my favouritesegment. We're introduced with another character Oka-san, who for some reason,just "lost" all of her members in the supernatural club she was in. So yeah,kind of a problem 'cos the club's gonna get disbanded by the school. Sheoverheard the girls play an Ouija game board, and decide to join in. To add on,she brought her own game into the table, and it's probably the scariesthide-and-seek the girls have ever played. Well, spoiler alert because someonetook away the doll of "Maeda" (lol) in the end so I wouldn't call that scary butOlivia and Hanako practically died so... we only need one more member to formback the supernatural club now? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Aozora-san you want to join? lmao)Last but not least, ranked second in this episode, is the talk about havingbabies. I would say this got as far as Seitokai Yakuindomo level of wrong, andthe teacher's involvement didn't make it any better, but thank goodness Hanakodecided not to have kids anymore. The funnier things are the common knowledgequestions we deem common aren't as common on these middle school girls. You guysknow what a French Kiss is, don't you? I know, because it's a kiss betweenFrench people. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> I mean, doesn't have to be both of them one of them canbe like, the great-grandmother is French will do lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JCEHMVzExxs/W2gyf2TCOzI/AAAAAAAApMk/SlTMVfSMSgEqqWtIcoId4xk3uaEeGugDQCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase5_hanako2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            No really what's with all the censorship using wiggly lines lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--TaaxBFgTHk/W2gygCiXMuI/AAAAAAAApMs/TUxjcWhHz2gO-3oDDWSU_usgBJePcPP8QCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase5_sleep.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Okay I admit she was cuter than the cat because            <a              href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6HOJLgtiqLI/W2gygJtt6jI/AAAAAAAApMo/zT0Vhz36N8AZi1oERzyd5EdKQPCJyVkMwCLcBGAs/s1600/asobiasobase5_cat.jpg"              target="_blank"              >it looks RETARDED</a            >            lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Haha these idiots are so dumb  </div></blockquote>Wow that's quite a lot of truth to digest after one peaceful episode. The newepisode (#AttackOnTitan40) talks about the story behind the government, and howthe royalty came to be. According to most accounts from Erwin, Historia's pastand the father, we can come up with a pretty good deduction. Allow me to paintthe inglorious history for you guys. Story goes - as seen from episode 1 - thata century ago, humans were forced to be behind walls with the emergence ofTitans. In there, they hid behind the walls while maintaining prosperity,keeping what's left of the human species alive. Well, at least they's what theytell you. We now know that the government of the Trost district/country/kingdomhad to take severe measures to ensure peace within the walls. I mean, why be soextreme with its internal affairs? Why only do the Titans attack at episode 1?Remember there was total peace before that? So yeah, something must havehappened with the government itself, and apparently, it was due to the then Kingwho was not meant to be. At this point, the relation between humans in Trost andTitans felt more like a threat, but yeah, the current governing body isbalancing between keeping its people alive and quiet while making sure they alldon't get killed. Too bad with Eren that might not be possible. Eren's Titanpowers might likely happen thanks to the new knowledge of intelligent Titans(read the eyecatch ie. image in the middle of the episode for details) where itis possible for a Titan to get stronger by consuming another. Chances are Eren'sdad got hold of such a sample (don't ask me how) and "fed" it to Eren, resultingin his warcry-like Titan powers, which obviously could prove useful in battle.Considering this, the current government would like to of course, take Eren inand you know, NOT make him the superpower. You know, like, let him get eaten byprobably someone who is within the walls and knows how to control that poweralready. Lastly, I'll end this story with supposed plans of Erwin and Levi'ssquad right now. Erwin aims to seek for the truth to the point of sacrificingfor the greater good, and Levi... let's just say his cowboy-looking brethren isgetting in the way. That, we'll have to leave it to next week. Man, this isgetting exciting.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3kBIHnpyck4/W2g8vShvdcI/AAAAAAAApNA/xDw7mOgj2oYFeRi5KC7bE58M5p82J7x6wCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan40_reiss.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE KING?

Also also, congrats on Hange taking the newrole of Commander of the Scouts! Pity there wouldn't be many people left tocommand after this lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Tsukumogami03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Just who is borrowing things from your shop?" Your husband, for starters.    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>Wow! No introduction that was played over the past two episodes? That's new.Haha okay the new episode (#Tsukumogami03) brings in the new #TheGossipcharacter (oh that's the new hashtag now haha) Nadeshiko, recently bought in bythe Izumoya, by Okou-san since in relation, Sanae-sama who was the wife of thefirst episode victim lol and needed a change in apparel as<strike>all of them</strike> most of them are childish and rather inappropriateas a grown-up according to the mother. (Sorry ladies of today the women of thepast were cooler haha) And this difference is mainly because (and I don't wantto conclude this quickly but) the mother and daughter lacked the communicationto listen to each other's concerns. So yeah, the mother probably gave in sincethe husband did not mind of the childish apparel anyway. And that is thanks toUsagi the tsukumogami and the comb, who was originally used for a mother to combher daughter's hair. Sorry for sending that purple bat to go do scouting, butoverhearing the conversation between Sanae-sama and Okou-san you gotta find outbecause it's #TheGossip haha God I love this show. Turns out that is of course,Okou-san's obsession for a newly released comb which she could not afford, soyeah, Seiji is still fine since the one handsome guy who the sister likes didnot come back lol. Although that leaves us for more stories next time maybe, Iwould prefer #TheGossip to continue as is instead of going into the romanceAnime direction haha. Sorry Seiji, you are not going to get any love from yoursister lol. Also also, there are so many expressions in this show I can't eventalk about all of them because the story of #TheGossip every week is so completeand good I have to share, so be sure to check out the most entertaining bunch ofAnime characters I've ever seen in a decade. No seriously, Usagi (voiced byIguchi Yuka) is great tbh. Also also (I'm Usagi now lol), we may agree with youSanae-sama's mother on the rabbits origin about bringing luck in numbers but manhave you not heard of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Austin" target="_blank"  >Thomas Austin</a>dear woman<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/qKX9Oq8UvBI?t=2m19s" target="_blank"  >Australia is hating you now lmao</a><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iaPzC2XX3wc/W2hFVGy0EHI/AAAAAAAApNM/DQfxnF6yyu8VI8DuYmuGKzzsO5aWXcKSQCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami03_notetsu.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW my colleagues want me to do sh*t work but I don't want to be            made use of          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0daz_96MK40/W2hFVFvK8rI/AAAAAAAApNQ/gbumxyXLmOo-gRY9XcjSLOV9y8ZrxCvoQCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami03_glare.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW my colleagues want me to do sh*t work but I don't want to be            made use of          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.
