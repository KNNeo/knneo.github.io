This time, I was referred to by my cousin, so I don't want to disappoint. I know he doesn't mind but I do. Also, he said they (interviewers, or the lot of them) may ask for my 5-year or 10-year goals, which I don't have any? I just want to code, man. I don't have such goals to think about. I just want to work and live life with a paycheck already. Is that asking too much? Okay I better not say this tomorrow lol<br><br>Chances are tomorrow's post won't be delayed but if it'll do you'll know haha let's finish this early<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BANANAFISH06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> BANANA FISH</span></div></blockquote>Okay. The new episode (#BANANAFISH06) after solving the truth about that the title of this show is, brings us escalation to more problems and of course, politics that will make sure this show ends as spectacularly as you can think. Firstly, the trip home. Ash and the guys head for Boston, and meet their father and... I would say, stepmother. In search of the truth on the people involved, Griffin's belongings reveal certain people in the Army who might be involved in this, namely the one guy who shot the disabled man, and his address aligns with the one Ash was given before the last guy who blabbered this phrase passed away. In all good searches and peaceful talks and conversations, Dino's men would of course catch up at some point, sadly harming the innocents in the process. (#RIPJennifer) What happens next as they head for Los Angeles in search of the truth, hopefully not to be cornered by Dino but I guess we will after that one Lee jerk who helped Shorter out for a moment ended up siding with the East's biggest underground power? Well, we'll see how this goes. Ibe-san did plan to leave with Eiji soon though, and we know this kid won't leave anyways, but hey, it's gotta happen someday. Hopefully not half dead or dead like all the others. Then again, it's a killer's haven in America, so you gotta be careful sometimes. Guns are probably your only option to survive, unless you think bulletproof vests can save your damn life lol okay they probably can haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUZUuQawYGaxQKFEIYTFh8f_LgKPkV-oXDzakorTFTRqiLRVAaOw_F7PnzrygnN0M7NrApm0ANS5856nKmi28GSO-QUFH2apUveqjNYFJAz2YwU73qyfO03rQ_iCWhIgaNefeRVF7GJy5t/s320/bananafish06_phone.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>iPhone X in a 90s manga serialisation? WHAT YEAR IS IT? lol</table>P.S. I seriously wondered if anyone here in the group will be a traitor or not. I don't know, guess not for now.<br>P.P.S. Here's some voice actor trivia right here: You watched this episode. You know of Jennifer, the mother that wasn't meant to be. She is voiced by yours truly, Kugimiya Rie. Man, seriously didn't think that her voice would be in this show.<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=ChioChan06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Master of Kabaddi! Have you heard of 'Bloody Butterfly' before?" lol she good at Kabaddi that woman</div></blockquote>[WARNING NUDITY CONTENT] Haha the new episode (#ChioChan06) shows us what best friends are for:Â  groping their asses when necessary so they go through the same sh*t with you? God, I love this show. We start of with the missing incident of Kushitori who, for some mysterious reason with no consequence to the previous episodes whatsoever, is training her Kabaddi skills in the middle of nowhere ie. the neighbourhood park, and not going to school. So yeah, Hosokawa-san got worried, the duo saw her with the Master? I mean, what did he do? All he did was &lt;insert backstory spoilers here> and he was the Master? Okay, logic aside so the two can find her, Chio-chan pushed Manana to the front line in hopes of getting her back to school, only to ignite her obsession of ladies... eh what do you call that? Cranium? Again, once more like she was fasting or in like some monk training where fantasies are to be avoided? I don't know. It was funny to say the least. #PlotTwist when the Master revealed his true identity (oh, God) (if you need to know check out online video website tags for "train rape" lol) and somehow Kushitori understood her true desires? Yeah, she still likes to grope other girls, that's for sure. I like how Manana-chan was such a good target until I forgot the duo have a hobby of ratting out each other in any way possible so we only get to hear Chio-chan moan hehe. (Don't get me wrong I may not be Kushitori but I'm a male here) ("A true descendant of the Master himself" lol okay no I'm not a groper I'll never be) Coupled with Chio-chan calling Hosokawa earlier (did I mention about the BFF thing between the duo?) and her arriving just on time for the beast to feast upon lol, okay at least they had a wonderful game of chase. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In the second half because this one took forever which I liked lol, Chio-chan decide to do a surprise prank on her BFF again, this time, dangerously, using stealth techniques probably better used on like a commando soldier than a high school female student. So yeah, this one is staple on showing how much their friendship has gone to the recycling bin, picked up, recycled, and then thrown away again hopefully to be picked up again and recycled. You see, this is an evil cycle, people. Saying that though, I love such a thing because nothing is more pure in friendship than to f**k each other over. Al through this one I would say took a little too far now that they had to fake their name so that this random stranger who saved them from dropping into the river will not report them to the school lol. My only grind (as in ass lol) in this episode is the overuse of flashbacks. Seriously, always make me feel like it's their excuse because they can't fit another scene in hehe we know that production<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzBqSWsLQsDfCSBxct-Bef4XMH2Kh_9eSKW4nSxJd-AL1mHUUBlzvEkccHTtXK1iUDNJ6T01FhtkxbPkCqyBdR_Mq__XNOCYuKgpDMy2VBtVh44xBgeb_ECjaO1X5sShVkpBYtPOI5bGjS/s320/chiochan06_spotted.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The true value of friendship...</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhODEzbqSOCt6i1wJgG7B544Q27lyHidE_3ICuAg_r7kysVgzEFAzmtnorrFkQ4BihV1Fl6Gtkmo9f92bavX-2GM0U22tSt7Zcn9KkX5K5MN8c8jya3BJ5I8uGU05JmhG8GgKUp_bGfl_Wv/s320/chiochan06_grope.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>... that cannot be expressed in words lmao</table></div></div>P.S. "I want to grab some asses" lol I don't know I should be glad I think like Kushitori or I think I can have my life in the way of the Master lmao okay maybe not<br>P.P.S. Again, totally appreciative of the voice cast this episode (the Master not included) mostly because of the panting, the screams, and everything cheeky (yes for all of them) in between. I'm not going to point all of them out because by the time I do so you'll change your opinion of me and my fetishes- oh wait it changed? I'm so sorry (I need to consider uploading sound clips here tbh lol)<br>[#BeastMode GIF lol I can't stop laughing at this]<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzf3IaEjeQFFn5ULB7tme9ZOcCAC_HVT67DLDA40L0NCX5xsUv-UEkmiBr7JnOAzF-bkSPPMPMIpLKXHMmgtE7yMRcUjbnTZhdIicZYnVi5OVUn-j703gw1hQdgOX1bweQijuiHyVgn4Zp/s1600/chiochan06_beastify.gif style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>OMFG lol</table><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span class=head-title> K-ON! Shuffle</span></div></blockquote>"Looks like she's really into a band she saw at Sakuragaoka High School" lmao oh damn the feels. Okay, in case you didn't know, "K-ON!" was a legend. It broke out as an Anime sensation back in 2009 of what might be the standard for many music-based shows to follow. But now, the original author Kakifly had a different idea. So in comes the next work, totally original, not based on anything before (well, subtle hints indicate they might be), with a different cast and setting, but the premise is the same: It's some girl who liked how cool band music is and decide to start a journey of her own. Before this series it's Tainaka Ritsu if you need a reminder (who dragged her friend Mio to quit her application for Literature Club I think, after reminiscing themselves a flashback of watching an awesome live performance), and this time, it's Sakuma Yukari, a spiritual successor to Ricchan but behaves like a 5-year-old. Basically, Ricchan if she is Yui-chan lol. Her partner, Shimizu Kaede, seems to be an easy-going person, going along with the friend since middle school unlike the one bassist we're familiar of. Clamped in with (literally) Maho-chan (family name unknown?) who is just an innocent classmate who is currently as of now, here to fill in the blanks for the light music (because they don't have clubs of this type, and) appreciation society who's main purpose does not contribute and aren't recognised by the school, contains only one senior. Satou Riko-chan here, seems to be enjoying her studying in this to-be-evicted location since she decorated it really well. Of course, drum kit included so Yukari-chan decided to have a go. That's pretty much it though for the first chapter (1) it would seem, so let's talk more about what we have seen. Clearly Kakifly-sensei wants to convey the point of being impressed by music to performing music once again, and in essence I think it has been fulfilled. The similarities between the series stop there though, as now we have a senior in our hands instead of a junior (Azunyan if you need a reminder), and... they technically aren't recognised by the school. Although this might just be a good thing since it'll take some time before they get together everything to be even believed that this club exists (it's November apparently), and they technically still need an advisor. Well, I assume they have a teacher behind this, but yeah, it'll take some explaining. I conclude this with a statement to remind you all that this is NOT the original work: bear in mind there aren't going to be any old stuff to remind you of (like Mio-chan's embarrassment, Yui-chan's stupidity) (okay maybe the latter) so if they don't deliver don't be disappointed. But be promised of something, that the girls will still be heading for the road to success as they attempt to form the next music band in Anime history. Hopefully. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I'm liking this though so I'll be reading this if it comes out.<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=282 data-original-width=408 height=221 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiR3pxoJTEfNAv9MNOgVg1WSm7XTds155LrNeCkGtgBGisghIh9fe5OJxreazurLYPRxyXEV_kp9zQb6Q5twl9B-FDwE_crgJIcOhSr0sbgs3uXecPt6hB2IsjGVNu0siwoYZXFinRR-f_R/s320/shuffle1E2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Just a good reminder that everyone in Kakifly's world is kind</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=281 data-original-width=404 height=222 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkVc5PVRD2di7LZqxiRtvyHhyphenhyphenh5Jraux3rH2mpRMpH5od_sYqAi_H0tdxfOufkha3jrO3lzdk2lMN2kd3zFPNGFH9F0r6ItwT4DXyF0hytA5hZqCPGwLLmyoSsQE2hKY-R49M93xef5VKV/s320/shuffle1E4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>lmao but man Ricchan, you have inspired others good on you</table></div></div>P.S. To take things waaaay further, I imagine from the expressions of the chapter (in terms of <u>role</u> in the band) Yukari-chan will be the drummer, Kae-chan might just be a bassist ('cos why not?), Maho-chan I would guess... can we have a DJ? Lol I have no idea. And Riko-chan can take the vocalist role. Oh, we going to have a Scenarioart-like situation where the drummer is the lead vocalist? S~WEET!!<br>P.P.S. To take things EVEN further (lol this is just), I imagine from the chapter dialogue that (in <u>voice acting</u> based on actresses today if possible) Miko-chan sounds like a quaint Toyosaki Aki (probably not her cannot imagine that tbh) Maho-chan sounds like a generic girl voice so I don't know (we don't know much about her anyway), Yukari-chan sounds like a Minase Inori lol, and Kae-chan... man if you give us another Inorin x Oonishi Saori I don't mind xD<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Yeah I'll leave Kuraki Mai's new song for next week then haha I'm watching Japan livestream that stupid show which I'll review tomorrow (not the latest episode unfortunately) so let's talk about the other things I've listened to. I've confirmed on <b>Survive Said The Prophet's new single</b> which also means I'll be officially giving Anime "BANANA FISH" so that's good. On the other hand, I have doubts over King Gnu's new song which I'll probably give over next week I like the feel of the song but the verses aren't convincing me to give it tbh. <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new single</b> is once again a wonderful listen just that I didn't give anything on the B-side. Then again, it's them at their best on the topic songs so I'll take that. It's been some time since their last release anyway. Finally, I took a listen to <b>mouse on the keys and their latest album</b> because I kind of missed them many times trying to find back the kind of style I can give on them but... nah, it's not easy after all. Sorry guys I tried. Then again, I did give these alternative music from Japan so damn long ago, and now... I only live for Anime? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Haiz, how shameful can I get...<br><br>Next week brings us wonderful <b>Sambomaster's new single</b> after a year of not releasing songs and despite being only one song on the two track single being new I may have to end up reviewing it so we shall see until then. Yeah, that's my plan for next week for now. Maybe I should go listen to more indie artists. That SUGARLUNG band got a chance to play on that rock festival this weekend so maybe I should give them another chance.<br><br>In Twitter news, <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION is going to release a new single</b> which I think I mentioned before and <b>Komatsu Mikako got her chance to be in Kuraki Mai's new music video </b>which I must say is going to be a joy for her personally (FYI her relationship to Kuraki Mai is me to YUI back then, just that they both know each other <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span>). In other stuff, I did plan to watch live performances from a bunch of artists over the long weekend (there's a holiday here somewhere) (I mean, everyday's a holiday for me now lol) so let's talk about them. <b>sphere's live from last year</b> (yeah their latest reunion livestream reminded me of this) was as standard as they can deliver and I feel like I can give a couple more songs which I missed, but maybe I'll wait for some potential best album next year haha. <b>Chatmonchy's last live performance</b> streamed live in July at Budokan puts me in tears as it ended, so I won't say much about that. It's sad enough on 2011 already, and then this. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span> Maybe I should watch that too then; I kind of skipped it because I didn't want to... Oh well. <b>GLIM SPANKY's recent live performance</b> at the famous big stadium was also pretty good, but hey, I didn't have any feel for their old songs so... oh well at least I enjoyed the ones I know of. I've been trying to give them songs though, but it would seem that maybe giving new songs would be easier. Sambomaster will be next week then. I'm not in the mood to watch today haha<br><br><br><br><br>Okay I'm going back to enjoy that livestream now so if you would excuse me. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay I'm joking I need to prepare for tomorrow the interview is quite early (well, 9.30am is quite early for me now lmao) so yeah I need to get my house printer running a bit. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> I'm soooo going to screw this one up too cya guys tomorrow<br><br>[P.S.
