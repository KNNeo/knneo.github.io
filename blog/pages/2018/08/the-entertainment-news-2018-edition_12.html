This time, I was referred to by my cousin, so I don't want todisappoint. I know he doesn't mind but I do. Also, he said they (interviewers,or the lot of them) may ask for my 5-year or 10-year goals, which I don't haveany? I just want to code, man. I don't have such goals to think about. I justwant to work and live life with a paycheck already. Is that asking too much?Okay I better not say this tomorrow lol<br /><br />Chances are tomorrow's postwon't be delayed but if it'll do you'll know haha let's finish this early<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay. The new episode (#BANANAFISH06) after solving the truth about that thetitle of this show is, brings us escalation to more problems and of course,politics that will make sure this show ends as spectacularly as you can think.Firstly, the trip home. Ash and the guys head for Boston, and meet their fatherand... I would say, stepmother. In search of the truth on the people involved,Griffin's belongings reveal certain people in the Army who might be involved inthis, namely the one guy who shot the disabled man, and his address aligns withthe one Ash was given before the last guy who blabbered this phrase passed away.In all good searches and peaceful talks and conversations, Dino's men would ofcourse catch up at some point, sadly harming the innocents in the process.(#RIPJennifer) What happens next as they head for Los Angeles in search of thetruth, hopefully not to be cornered by Dino but I guess we will after that oneLee jerk who helped Shorter out for a moment ended up siding with the East'sbiggest underground power? Well, we'll see how this goes. Ibe-san did plan toleave with Eiji soon though, and we know this kid won't leave anyways, but hey,it's gotta happen someday. Hopefully not half dead or dead like all the others.Then again, it's a killer's haven in America, so you gotta be careful sometimes.Guns are probably your only option to survive, unless you think bulletproofvests can save your damn life lol okay they probably can haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2lSqIUWbF7g/W2-lPD2EuVI/AAAAAAAApUk/X1q1_Dh8gyAjCxusRF-g_3vL0bWqtRtmgCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish06_phone.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        iPhone X in a 90s manga serialisation? WHAT YEAR IS IT? lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. I seriously wondered if anyone here in the group will be a traitor or not.I don't know, guess not for now.<br />P.P.S. Here's some voice actor triviaright here: You watched this episode. You know of Jennifer, the mother thatwasn't meant to be. She is voiced by yours truly, Kugimiya Rie. Man, seriouslydidn't think that her voice would be in this show.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ChioChan06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Master of Kabaddi! Have you heard of 'Bloody Butterfly' before?" lol she    good at Kabaddi that woman  </div></blockquote>[WARNING NUDITY CONTENT] Haha the new episode (#ChioChan06) shows us what bestfriends are for:&nbsp; groping their asses when necessary so they go through thesame sh*t with you? God, I love this show. We start of with the missing incidentof Kushitori who, for some mysterious reason with no consequence to the previousepisodes whatsoever, is training her Kabaddi skills in the middle of nowhere ie.the neighbourhood park, and not going to school. So yeah, Hosokawa-san gotworried, the duo saw her with the Master? I mean, what did he do? All he did was&lt;insert backstory spoilers here&gt; and he was the Master? Okay, logic asideso the two can find her, Chio-chan pushed Manana to the front line in hopes ofgetting her back to school, only to ignite her obsession of ladies... eh what doyou call that? Cranium? Again, once more like she was fasting or in like somemonk training where fantasies are to be avoided? I don't know. It was funny tosay the least. #PlotTwist when the Master revealed his true identity (oh, God)(if you need to know check out online video website tags for "train rape" lol)and somehow Kushitori understood her true desires? Yeah, she still likes togrope other girls, that's for sure. I like how Manana-chan was such a goodtarget until I forgot the duo have a hobby of ratting out each other in any waypossible so we only get to hear Chio-chan moan hehe. (Don't get me wrong I maynot be Kushitori but I'm a male here) ("A true descendant of the Master himself"lol okay no I'm not a groper I'll never be) Coupled with Chio-chan callingHosokawa earlier (did I mention about the BFF thing between the duo?) and herarriving just on time for the beast to feast upon lol, okay at least they had awonderful game of chase. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In the second half because this one tookforever which I liked lol, Chio-chan decide to do a surprise prank on her BFFagain, this time, dangerously, using stealth techniques probably better used onlike a commando soldier than a high school female student. So yeah, this one isstaple on showing how much their friendship has gone to the recycling bin,picked up, recycled, and then thrown away again hopefully to be picked up againand recycled. You see, this is an evil cycle, people. Saying that though, I lovesuch a thing because nothing is more pure in friendship than to f**k each otherover. Al through this one I would say took a little too far now that they had tofake their name so that this random stranger who saved them from dropping intothe river will not report them to the school lol. My only grind (as in ass lol)in this episode is the overuse of flashbacks. Seriously, always make me feellike it's their excuse because they can't fit another scene in hehe we know thatproduction<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0MGpP-44Ohw/W2-vA16sIEI/AAAAAAAApUw/8DiP89aUbrUvQHBciYx6ukHJq25jSm5ngCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan06_spotted.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The true value of friendship...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yd7LEu-bJCs/W2-vBxLmOYI/AAAAAAAApU0/LNH3KpsuzRQrxpW1Prp2xUPx6XdvgiiaACLcBGAs/s320/chiochan06_grope.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ... that cannot be expressed in words lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "I want to grab some asses" lol I don't know I should be glad I think likeKushitori or I think I can have my life in the way of the Master lmao okay maybenot<br />P.P.S. Again, totally appreciative of the voice cast this episode (theMaster not included) mostly because of the panting, the screams, and everythingcheeky (yes for all of them) in between. I'm not going to point all of them outbecause by the time I do so you'll change your opinion of me and my fetishes- ohwait it changed? I'm so sorry (I need to consider uploading sound clips here tbhlol)<br />[#BeastMode GIF lol I can't stop laughing at this]<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FavxCBRvb70/W2-wlCN1UKI/AAAAAAAApVA/HQlI3X6TLS8SK_2NOrRtJsuSh1oBf-bygCLcBGAs/s1600/chiochan06_beastify.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">OMFG lol</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> K-ON! Shuffle</span>  </div></blockquote>"Looks like she's really into a band she saw at Sakuragaoka High School" lmao ohdamn the feels. Okay, in case you didn't know, "K-ON!" was a legend. It brokeout as an Anime sensation back in 2009 of what might be the standard for manymusic-based shows to follow. But now, the original author Kakifly had adifferent idea. So in comes the next work, totally original, not based onanything before (well, subtle hints indicate they might be), with a differentcast and setting, but the premise is the same: It's some girl who liked how coolband music is and decide to start a journey of her own. Before this series it'sTainaka Ritsu if you need a reminder (who dragged her friend Mio to quit herapplication for Literature Club I think, after reminiscing themselves aflashback of watching an awesome live performance), and this time, it's SakumaYukari, a spiritual successor to Ricchan but behaves like a 5-year-old.Basically, Ricchan if she is Yui-chan lol. Her partner, Shimizu Kaede, seems tobe an easy-going person, going along with the friend since middle school unlikethe one bassist we're familiar of. Clamped in with (literally) Maho-chan (familyname unknown?) who is just an innocent classmate who is currently as of now,here to fill in the blanks for the light music (because they don't have clubs ofthis type, and) appreciation society who's main purpose does not contribute andaren't recognised by the school, contains only one senior. Satou Riko-chan here,seems to be enjoying her studying in this to-be-evicted location since shedecorated it really well. Of course, drum kit included so Yukari-chan decided tohave a go. That's pretty much it though for the first chapter (1) it would seem,so let's talk more about what we have seen. Clearly Kakifly-sensei wants toconvey the point of being impressed by music to performing music once again, andin essence I think it has been fulfilled. The similarities between the seriesstop there though, as now we have a senior in our hands instead of a junior(Azunyan if you need a reminder), and... they technically aren't recognised bythe school. Although this might just be a good thing since it'll take some timebefore they get together everything to be even believed that this club exists(it's November apparently), and they technically still need an advisor. Well, Iassume they have a teacher behind this, but yeah, it'll take some explaining. Iconclude this with a statement to remind you all that this is NOT the originalwork: bear in mind there aren't going to be any old stuff to remind you of (likeMio-chan's embarrassment, Yui-chan's stupidity) (okay maybe the latter) so ifthey don't deliver don't be disappointed. But be promised of something, that thegirls will still be heading for the road to success as they attempt to form thenext music band in Anime history. Hopefully. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I'm liking this though soI'll be reading this if it comes out.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="282"              data-original-width="408"              height="221"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aMyH-h8cmEA/W3AOBwmzm-I/AAAAAAAApVs/t3yr7FQkNqQN7R6W0nWGqeMRlFXZLCNJACLcBGAs/s320/shuffle1E2.jpg"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Just a good reminder that everyone in Kakifly's world is kind          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="281"              data-original-width="404"              height="222"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xJ_dcieVoa0/W3AOB5RXrTI/AAAAAAAApVw/H5OBTwKxEx88cuFY8pSLRzN4Vg9uLIMaQCLcBGAs/s320/shuffle1E4.jpg"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            lmao but man Ricchan, you have inspired others good on you          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. To take things waaaay further, I imagine from the expressions of thechapter (in terms of <u>role</u> in the band) Yukari-chan will be the drummer,Kae-chan might just be a bassist ('cos why not?), Maho-chan I would guess... canwe have a DJ? Lol I have no idea. And Riko-chan can take the vocalist role. Oh,we going to have a Scenarioart-like situation where the drummer is the leadvocalist? S~WEET!!<br />P.P.S. To take things EVEN further (lol this is just), Iimagine from the chapter dialogue that (in <u>voice acting</u> based onactresses today if possible) Miko-chan sounds like a quaint Toyosaki Aki(probably not her cannot imagine that tbh) Maho-chan sounds like a generic girlvoice so I don't know (we don't know much about her anyway), Yukari-chan soundslike a Minase Inori lol, and Kae-chan... man if you give us another Inorin xOonishi Saori I don't mind xD<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Yeah I'll leave Kuraki Mai's new song for next week then haha I'm watching Japanlivestream that stupid show which I'll review tomorrow (not the latest episodeunfortunately) so let's talk about the other things I've listened to. I'veconfirmed on <b>Survive Said The Prophet's new single</b> which also means I'llbe officially giving Anime "BANANA FISH" so that's good. On the other hand, Ihave doubts over King Gnu's new song which I'll probably give over next week Ilike the feel of the song but the verses aren't convincing me to give it tbh.<b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new single</b> is once again a wonderful listen justthat I didn't give anything on the B-side. Then again, it's them at their beston the topic songs so I'll take that. It's been some time since their lastrelease anyway. Finally, I took a listen to<b>mouse on the keys and their latest album</b> because I kind of missed themmany times trying to find back the kind of style I can give on them but... nah,it's not easy after all. Sorry guys I tried. Then again, I did give thesealternative music from Japan so damn long ago, and now... I only live for Anime?<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Haiz, how shameful can I get...<br /><br />Next week brings uswonderful <b>Sambomaster's new single</b> after a year of not releasing songsand despite being only one song on the two track single being new I may have toend up reviewing it so we shall see until then. Yeah, that's my plan for nextweek for now. Maybe I should go listen to more indie artists. That SUGARLUNGband got a chance to play on that rock festival this weekend so maybe I shouldgive them another chance.<br /><br />In Twitter news,<b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION is going to release a new single</b> which I think Imentioned before and<b>Komatsu Mikako got her chance to be in Kuraki Mai's new music video </b>whichI must say is going to be a joy for her personally (FYI her relationship toKuraki Mai is me to YUI back then, just that they both know each other <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>).In other stuff, I did plan to watch live performances from a bunch of artistsover the long weekend (there's a holiday here somewhere) (I mean, everyday's aholiday for me now lol) so let's talk about them.<b>sphere's live from last year</b> (yeah their latest reunion livestreamreminded me of this) was as standard as they can deliver and I feel like I cangive a couple more songs which I missed, but maybe I'll wait for some potentialbest album next year haha. <b>Chatmonchy's last live performance</b> streamedlive in July at Budokan puts me in tears as it ended, so I won't say much aboutthat. It's sad enough on 2011 already, and then this. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> Maybe I should watchthat too then; I kind of skipped it because I didn't want to... Oh well.<b>GLIM SPANKY's recent live performance</b> at the famous big stadium was alsopretty good, but hey, I didn't have any feel for their old songs so... oh wellat least I enjoyed the ones I know of. I've been trying to give them songsthough, but it would seem that maybe giving new songs would be easier.Sambomaster will be next week then. I'm not in the mood to watch today haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OkayI'm going back to enjoy that livestream now so if you would excuse me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Okay I'm joking I need to prepare for tomorrow the interview is quite early(well, 9.30am is quite early for me now lmao) so yeah I need to get my houseprinter running a bit. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> I'm soooo going to screw this one up too cya guystomorrow<br /><br />[P.S. I notice in events like the above you just let yourbody experience instead of your soul because mine is already broken haha]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
