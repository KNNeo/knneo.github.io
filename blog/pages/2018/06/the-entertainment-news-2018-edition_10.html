I thought I gotta letthis out first before I talk about everything else in this week because... Ifinally get to graduate this year. Thanks to whoever involved in making thatdecision which is otherwise never possible for those pu**ies at the school'sadministrative office. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Okay, not pondering about that liao;it's ending in two weeks. Let's talk about entertainment, yes?<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="FumikiriJikan09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Fumikiri Jikan</span>  </div></blockquote>What? This is a two-parter? See you next week lol. Anyways, the new episode(#FumikiriJikan09) is simple in presentation yet leaves us with more questionsthan we came in with, which is none. Okay so there's this man who's waiting bythe railroad crossing reminiscing (I used this word specifically to describe hisage) about his school days, seeing the girl across the crossing on the nearbytrain station, but yeah, he didn't take any action. Well, that day did come, andso he wrote a letter and passed it to her. Problem is, wait, what? It's theexact same girl holding his letter? Time paradox? Or it's the daughter? So manyquestions, yet we'll only know next week. Damn, this show. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1B5MHs4WG7g/WxzFc12NpaI/AAAAAAAAnwk/IchFWlZHq4kA7i0C-JM3b3NWvJK2wz2kwCLcBGAs/s320/fumikirijikan09_skirt.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Not going to spoil what happened but you can guess what is below her        haha      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TadaKun10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "ALWAYS MAKE YOUR HEART RAINBOW!" <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>The wait is over, dear Rainbow Shogun fans. It's the focus episode!! *cheersirrationally* The new episode (#TadaKun10) focuses surprisingly heavily on theshow and also, on the main two. And man, what an ending. But hey, let's talkabout what happened. Firstly, Teresa-chan. She went with Tada-kun to the RainbowShogun Show, and you bet that was fun to watch. More importantly, the symbolismof them being together seems to foretell something that will happen, which is...(spoiler alert) it's her last day. And even Alec-san turned kind and happy foronce. Hey, if this only gave Ijuin-kun the creeps we're not normal haha.Secondly, the family story. We're finally dropped big hints on who Rachel isthis episode, and yes if you need guessing it's probably an old lover. Of theold Tada-kun. Okay at this point let's assume old friend, yes? Even so, thatwill make the relationship between Teresa-chan and Tada-kun somewhat closealready, considering we know about the North Star story back in a couple ofepisodes ago. Still, what that means? We have no idea. Suffice it to say thatthis will be the only opportunity when revealed, to do something about theending we didn't expect to happen at the end of this episode, I would guess. Andlastly, what has happened. So yeah, why the sudden return to their hometown? Imean, the parents' dead already right? So... Rachel's in trouble? Or Alec wasworried this might get any worse "so let's get back and finish the marriage"instead? Maybe, but we don't know. Problem is over her, will anyone here doanything about it? Will Tada-kun even bother to ask the questions? Remember theAnime title? Yeah, that's going to play into this next week I suppose. Anyways,many questions, and we can only but wait to find out. Hey, at least there's thecliffhanger. Seriously didn't expect that until Ijuin noticed Teresa walkingaway from the hotel. Yeah, it's that late for me. How about you all? I hope Iwas the only blockhead haha. All in all, I can foresee the impending disasterthat is about to happen to Teresa after making such a sudden decision of leavingwithout saying proper goodbyes... I mean I'm prepared for those floodgates toopen so we can finally see someone break down for love in this story hehe I'mwaiting Anime production<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T5ZoL_veVOQ/WxzNyt4yAOI/AAAAAAAAnww/vIDFz4D7gOsNv3Pkt7ljM5BWeCLJ8yWPQCLcBGAs/s320/tadakun10_show.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When everyone is interested in something you don't lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cwql5y5WmDM/WxzN1OMhv4I/AAAAAAAAnw0/b0a5a9PvIfIFJigd6M3xHIjw5us_8o82ACLcBGAs/s320/tadakun10_alec.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I was seriously as shocked as Ijuin and I totally expected a date of            some form but... nothing.<br />Alec-san you disappoint me.          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "I don't think it's your fault that your parents got into an accident" WELLNO SHIT *looks at Tada-kun* haha #mindblown for him to say the least. Drama~<br />P.P.S.All I want in life now, is that Teresa-chan would say those emotional wordsright beside me using that 3D sound head dummy thing??

So yeah, the maincouple decide they've done too much otaku, so Narumi suggested to go on a themepark or something, but Hirotaka posed a dumb penalty (well it wasn't that dumb)on mentioning anything otaku, which basically means their lives right now so Idon't think this is a good idea. On the other hand, they did in the end havesomething to talk about, though Kabakura and Koyanagi had to chip in to theirdiscussion. To a further extent, it gave time for Hirotaka to think about howmuch he and she has changed along the years, and it doesn't matter anywaybecause we move at our own pace. Well that is until someone thinks your pace istoo slow and decides to pace you like that stupid sergeant who thinks you cannotpass your fitness test lol okay back to Anime. So yeah, the usual laughs, thepiggybank was heavy enough to (as I expected) go buy souvenirs, and I must sayif we're going on a date where we can't talk about the stuff that brought ustogether, that's gonna be a bummer. But I like that idea I just don't haveanyone else to use it on- *cries* I don't really know how this will make for thedirection of the show, but as of now I don't think it's much. Hey, that's theproblem with adapted productions, people. You may not get an ending. Well, atleast make it good one, yes? We're close to the end already.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U_H7XSUGl2Q/WxzX6sj3s0I/AAAAAAAAnxQ/yUS9aM_yppwgFWdNTNBz64BP-W89xSD2gCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi09_queue.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I like the reverse drawing style here where the main characters are            sketchy and the background is detailed lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YLV5I3YAUNo/WxzX6mdGp1I/AAAAAAAAnxU/mdhgFG3PKhAXB60GIvdJPbOjPCBvDZxwgCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi09_eyecatch1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I like this super complicated character chart (or whatever you call            it) of them two haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Gotta remind myself of that haha *stares    at wallpapers*  </div></blockquote>Since this series is kind of short (well, 7 volumes isn't short but the chapterswere) I decided to finish it in one go. Meaning I've been reading this for like6 hours straight haha. (Could've been shorter had it not been sh*tty streamingsites) Anyways, I chanced upon this on pure coincidence because Komatsu Mikako(hint starts here) was Tweeting about her life-sized paper figures on the shopspromoting her upcoming album with a hashtag, and instead of seeing more imagesof that figure I instead saw this manga which was still celebrated like, 4 yearsafter final release of the manga in 2014, so I decided to take a look. So, thismanga which started as a weekly serialisation in 2009 by author Kyou Machiko, isabout a short story in a familiar setting: the final year in high school.Typical, right? Yes it is, but what caught my attention after reading a chapterof it (in Japanese) and probably would catch your attention too is the artstyle. It's really sketchy, for starters. Coupled with the minimal expressionthat is in the work, it brings of little meaning but heavy understanding andinterpretation for every chapter. For such a work to lie on the literary side ofexpression (but not in words because I wouldn't get it), you can't help butthink this can go in the right direction. Hey, this may not be an award-winningpiece (okay it was, just not big enough for us to know) for all to know, but ithas its quirks.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="686"          data-original-width="938"          height="234"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kzkgyYwyuM0/Wxfi7tlOEZI/AAAAAAAAns4/pd5LfkcTSK0b5UPtgcdz8FKSyjK8vE9OwCLcBGAs/s320/76x4.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Didn't know you could do this to a penknife tbh      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>The story goes off describing a girl's life (name inferred) Mikako who is stillas aimless as she is after all these school years, and things are about tochange for her in her senior year. She got to be friends with a guy who likesthe same band as she does, she managed to get herself a boyfriend which is notthe friend (we'll get to that soon), she has a best friend (I assume) who alsohas her relationship woes... all the stuff you can expect in school. That, andthe future which lie before them. And this is where the inferential stuffhappens. Every chapter is either something with relation to the story the authorwants to point out (eg. "It was at this time, I think I fell in love with him")or a short description about a detail in everyday life (eg. the whole familydoing everything near the same sink, from laundry to snatching your spot tobrush teeth so they can sleep early) and that is interesting in itself, thoughmost would think it's boring. The overall plot progression isn't that excitingtoo, so if you're expecting "Toradora!" level romance antics and cliffhangersyou're not going to get any. What might be more disappointing is the endingwhich obviously we can assume is that the main two will eventually get together,probably more than friends. But the last few chapters were totally based on yourown inference because it was half-assed, I would say. Still, this story isinteresting in its own field, I would admit, but maybe it's a little too dull,and maybe a little too true to life. As the author mentioned she wanted toconvey teen life as well as being normal in life yet living out our ownstories.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img loading="lazy"    border="0"    data-original-height="681"    data-original-width="454"    height="320"    src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sIc8jwl0pkY/Wxfi3Jje_zI/AAAAAAAAns0/6irLT2A7NM03oFRH6JBaYTrmeNwNurifwCLcBGAs/s320/180-5x4.png"    width="213"  /></div>Man, you wished all manga was this true to life. And it says so well to me too.I was going to bore all your lives with a longer paragraph than this, talkingabout my life as a student now (almost about to be) living another semesterbecause of an accident I did similar to Mikako-san (I didn't break my armwalking down the stairs though), but yeah, makes you think about how life shouldgo from here on. Sadly, I wasn't blessed with people who will like me, or evenwalk up to say they do, which kind of makes me glad to have this manga asawakening. Also, inspiration for how I should write my lifework APoL too, that'sfor sure. All in all, I liked the story, the sketchy art, and everything inbetween, from a loving heart to not feeling anything at all to... to being aloneand lost, just like myself.<br /><br />Okay let's move on with life I'm sick ofthese kinds of depressing stories haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> A Channel</span>  </div></blockquote>The special chapter in Volume 8 titled "Sweet Operation" talks about Yuuko'sstruggle to... be friends with Tooru. Well I suppose this is an early storything since... haha okay maybe not, but yeah it's a nice story to find out.Yuuko just wants some love from the incredibly adorable shorty (haha), but shedoesn't care. Time probably won't solve this stalemate according to Run-chan andNagi-chan was probably more right since it's easier to find something in common.Hey, did someone mention sweets? Yep, baited her good, this cooking talent ofhers. And that's probably how it all began. Funny huh, that Nagi-chan can talkwell with Tooru.

I finally also got my hands (thanks Apple Music) on<b>DENIM's first full album</b> after recommendation of a audio preview fromGotch like, half a year ago (yeah I remember these guys since I've heard of thembefore this too, that's why I know) but then... this one was also a no-go.Probably will be giving the one song that brought me in though; that one is asrelaxing as its song title.<br /><br />I also took some time to give<b>GLIM SPANKY</b> another song for the money because I like them hard rockmusic after listening to a live performance released on YouTube which I can'tbelieve I've been missing out since it was uploaded in February this year. I'veproven my dad over the weekend through Apple Music Japan (even so) that he canenjoy his dialect songs from Taiwan by taking in one of our accounts (which isnot possible haha) or just paying 10 bucks a month (he can sign the local regionone Taiwan is not&nbsp; Japan) to support his favourite artists... which hedidn't reply. Oh well, can't believe the discount is THAT much already and hestill won't consider. It's fine. I took<a  href="../../2015/06/the-cost-effective-plan-part-2-where.html"  >a couple</a><a  href="../../2016/09/the-cost-effective-plan-part-2.html"  >of years</a>to come to this decision as well. (Oh wait I called both posts "part 2"??lol)<br /><br />On other news looking at my Twitter account,<strike>Anime</strike> <b>Manga "K-ON!" will receive its sequel</b> with adifferent cast and a drummer as main girl (I thought you'd like to know thisxD), <b>nano.RIPE is releasing their new album</b> in August ever since theirhiatus and return from last year.<b>That vocalist from SECONDWALL noticed my tweet</b> lol, and... that's it.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay I gotta complete the sentences I <strike>wrote</strike><strike>spoke</strike> wrote out at first, can? Remember; this was written as anarrative. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That'll be it, people. I know Imentioned a lot about <b>#KN10YEARS</b> but I've not been making progress,mainly because it's harder to write a complete story for the next five years(ie. KN2013-2017) compared to the first five because I don't have any referenceand I noticed I was supposed to write a summary and make a full one 5 years agobut I didn't and now I'm doing the reverse I guess? I don't know. I'll confirmonce I'm ready. And since we have that piece of good news which I started thepost with which means my time is limited on this too so I better hurry up. Sorryif the story isn't told in more detail but I guess only I will care so whateverhaha. Cya guys next time then, and until then... I wish someone will give mesome feedback on <a href="https://github.com/KNNeo" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a>...<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
