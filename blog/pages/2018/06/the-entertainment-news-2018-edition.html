I can barely remember anything after a month anda half of not studying and playing games lol let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="FumikiriJikan11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Fumikiri Jikan</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I know Majima-san from an angle you've never seen" lmao as if you know  </div></blockquote>The guy in this episode needs to fix a mirror on his shoe in order to have theultimate experience lol. The new episode (#FumikiriJikan11) continues on thefantasising journey of Tanishi, that bald kid who can't even stand against(height pun intended) the beautiful female classmate. Well, as much as histhoughts were lengthy, they were progressive. From boyfriend conversations towhatever you think is beneath that skirt lol, this guy's thoughts haseverything. Funny how this can constitute a 3-minute video considering (warningsexual content) I go from arousal to jerking off faster than that haha this guyis literally me 10-year-old me oops. Anyways, nice episode, and we are nearingthe end, so... no conclusion perhaps? Oh well. It's still a great show to watchthough. Some of the stories (like this) are interesting for me who likesslice-of-life shows.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qJX27x1yyL0/Wy8xl9v87vI/AAAAAAAAn-g/UqJLJJY6Edgnm38AXu8ivcwO1Vp3L1qGgCLcBGAs/s320/fumikirijikan11_fantasise.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            My safety distance when I am not conversing with a girl but thinking            of her naked lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jk6ywQAy93s/Wy8xl1aEj8I/AAAAAAAAn-c/WtChQxspRhE_VCN4UkgGk8jQoIQ25ynRQCLcBGAs/s320/fumikirijikan11_height.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            OUT!<br />(Like, seriously bro, you're out)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. #TheSin when you saw just briefly a lady's tookus... This boy is too purehaha<br />P.P.S. In case you wondered and cannot remember the names as you passby the opening theme, the girl is voiced by<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/20022/Yuri_Komagata/" target="_blank"  >Komagata Yuri</a>who also sang the opening theme song. I mean, she's technically less than just anewbie for only saying a couple of lines in this show, and the song wasn't thatgreat, so... nah she's not my type haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TadaKun12">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Damn, is she sniffing on my fiance's clothing?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> #PlotTwist (No, she    just likes the smell of <strike>that man</strike> that perfume brand it's    got quite an exquisite aroma lol)  </div></blockquote>I think we should rename this episode (#TadaKun12) to (spoiler alert) "Tada-kunwa Naite wa Shinai" (Trans.: Tada-kun Never Cries) instead let's get thatpetition going, guys. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, the episode. I must say it was lacklusterfor what needs to be conveyed, you know, like the breakdown, but nope, therewasn't much as in the process but in the result. Tada-kun reached Larsenburg(the only time I'll spell this, and correctly) in search of... well let's justsay he's being a messenger for his grandfather, and (I wouldn't say he found it,so) chanced upon Rachel, who apparently lives in a different (but heavilyguarded) abode than the palace, I assume. She did not reveal the situation thatTeresa and Alec (and Charles) are in though, but passes the baton to the palace,where the couple met again after what seems like forever. They sat down, and ofcourse, the truth be told. So yes, Teresa was actually just a royalty who has togo overseas for experience, and more specifically, to do so as part of growingup, before taking over the nation. So yeah, I was half right. This and all, thepeople in Japan don't know. So yeah, it was kind of bad. Teresa mentions it wasdecided from the beginning, the marriage part, and Tada-kun... let's just say healso cried. No doubt Ijuin will be there to support him and maybe motivate himto take some action towards his love or whatever I don't know now. What isimportant is that this must be settled in some way, and I anticipate an ending.How epic will it be? This episode didn't really deliver that impact, so I hopethe last episode will. My fingers are crossed. On other things, Alec likesCharles? Well, that doesn't make any of them royalty I'm afraid, and yeah theycan't really find a replacement unless you tell me Teresa and Mitsuyoshi arerelated by blood (that's even worse) so this can't go anywhere that far I'mafraid. I feel sad for Alec though, through her serious face hides her innocentbehaviour even I feel for. Oh well. At least you're not having it as hard asTeresa-chan, who might have to make that decision eventually should Tada-kunever take action to prevent the supposed reality from happening. I'll be lookingforward to that.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RQgmXVjiToc/Wy9GTk66_tI/AAAAAAAAn-8/Dtx56Z0vybkiUi0TLZ1eCCZg0konqgmOgCLcBGAs/s320/tadakoi12_book.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        When you thought you could see more from a gravure by tilting the book        lol<br />(And the one woman beside you is better lmao)      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Once again, Ijuin MVP this episode. For his weird sneezing, stupid Englishintroductions, and how terribly he screwed up the tailing of his best friendlol<br />P.P.S. I knew what was under Teresa's desk already. That's everyoneelse if they has secrets haha. Seriously though, you can NOT not forget thosewonderful times.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="WotaKoi11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay maybe I was dumb but if you figured out what happened with the three hintsyou're a good boyfriend/girlfriend haha. "Love is Hard for Otakus", I guess.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The new and final episode (#WotaKoi11) of the series is as adequate ofa good ending as you would expect it to end, but it's not without a bunch ofstories to tell again. I know the recipe for storytelling here is getting dry,but I still like it for the jokes, the stuff they talk about, the love within,and everything else in between. That's still what makes this show special. FromHirotaka playing games end to end for days (I mean, what is he playing?), Narumicooking for her boyfriend (where can I put a request on that order lol),&nbsp;Koyanagi desperately wanting some love, Kabakura concealing his emotions foranything he doesn't like... these four sure have something to talk about. All inall, the series proves to show much of what is love between otakus withoutboring us with the technical stuff (okay the last part about first love is... Icouldn't even bother to research on who they are) and still maintains quite ahigh standard for those jokes and plot lines, so I congratulate the show forthis. I enjoyed it personally, the pace may be kinda slow, it's a bit true toreality lest I experience it first lol, but hey, if you wonder what is it likedating someone who just likes comics and animation, this is as close as it gets.Then again now that I got to know about it maybe it wasn't such a good ideaafter all, finding someone with the same interests as me. I mean, I'm only a<i>little </i>into Anime and Manga titles. Would be at a different level if Iwere Japanese lol. Finally, as&nbsp;a teaser to end this just like how theyended this series, my first love (in Anime when I was about 14) was... drum rollplease... Remember "Toradora!"? I'm not into little girls so...<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/12305/Minori_Kushieda"  target="_blank"  >Kushieda Minori</a>!! (Love Hina doesn't count I have no feelings for Naru) But really, why?Hmm... I liked lively girls back in 2008 (not so because they can drag me out ofthe house lol) (and also because spoiler alert - she is not that bubbly inpersonality anyway), and she's cute. And voiced by the lovely Hocchan. Can't sayanything more. It quickly changed to the K-ON! girls the following year thoughfor some reason haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ6aGu3bX1w/Wy9FZPuimaI/AAAAAAAAn-w/9KyW8UN3IUkQY9GNBVNJmKFjPGY5smmIQCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi11_nico.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when I notice they are "having a good time" lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nd1Of5NfYU0/Wy9FZHWTuCI/AAAAAAAAn-s/6_jbqyRwloUuJQbpV0aQQRjEPZ5iI7z7ACLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi11_naked2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when they notice I was "having a good time" lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. #RealityCheck when you know you're not going to get greeted on a surprisevisit the same you would encounter in a shoujo manga lol Narumi<br />P.P.S. TILKabakura likes Cardcaptor Sakura haha don't worry bro everyone does<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> MANGA</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span style="font-size: x-small;"      >I'm skipping this for this week too I've got manga to catch up after      tomorrow</span    >  </div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>It has been quite a week in Klassic Note, so let's talk about it.<b>Suchmos's new album</b> is not impressive by any means, and it's mostly justme giving it a listen because I heard of the topic song which was alreadyreleased like, 4 months ago but I didn't like it until now? Yeah, so I'll givethat a pass.<a  href="https://twitter.com/gotch_akg/status/1009426358370357248"  target="_blank"  >Gotch seems to like the second song in the list</a>like many others online though, so if you like them go give a listen.<b>Chatmonchy's last album</b> is finally out after half a year of crying ontheir announcement of disbandment, and... I'll give it. In this case, I'll holdon to the true Klassic Note fashion but I have to say I cannot take their musicstyle. They have come a long way, but if you don't miss their classic rock musicstyle, I do. So yeah, not quite a happy ending in this case, but otherwise...yeah I did like the song with the lyrics written by former member Kumiko (thatis track 6 in case you wonder) so there's that. <b>LILI LIMIT</b> also came backon the microscope after much resistance of not giving anything from their latestformal release in February this year and that one single track in April. Soyeah, giving two in this case, to compensate in protest of the song style I'drather prefer (I'm not into their electronic music tbh) and also anticipate forbetter songs as I continue to like their melodies and expression. Still, quitean exception in the industry and in Klassic Note in recent years. Last but notleast, <b>Komagata Yuri's debut single</b> for Anime "Fumikiri Jikan" is finallyout, I WILL be giving another song in the single a chance unlike many othersingles which slipped off my hands from the start of the year, and the songitself... I mean, the preview in the Anime is only the chorus; I don't have muchto work with here so it could be anything. Well, except it wasn't terrible.<b>Sorry halca-san</b>; you gotta swallow the fact that despite the last episodeof the series you're not getting your ending theme song single vetted by me. No,damn, way. It's time to be real critical in Klassic Note. Unless it rings in mymind again (I just listened to it in full again) then maybe. Otherwise, we'redone. Komagata-san, you still got chance. We can talk Anime roles and bodies.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Refer to the Anime review above for more)<br /><br />I also spent sometime to <b>go on a journey for some indie artist music</b> again. I know it'snot prime time to do this because typically an early May season would be wise,but hey, I do when I can. I highlighted a couple of artists on my Twitter feedfrom SWANKY DANK to LuckLife ripoffs (well both of them aren't that famous yetanyway) so be sure to check them out if you can, and yes I'm being gender biasedto male vocals because there's too many female vocals on my song list I'm tryingto even it out here okay? Too much idol sh*t songs already and I can't take inmore at this rate...<br /><br />Next week brings us... nothing. So I might justgo explore more indie artists then. I missed the times I was givingSpecialThanks back in 2015 along with a couple more artists and am happy to seewhere they are today to be honest. You know, these solo journeys are mypilgrimage, and I feel a lot the same.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'mdone. Wow, 3 hours left before bed so I won't knock myself out in the morningpaper. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I'm trying real hard to thinkof how to do #KN10YEARS stuff, continue APoL Chapter 17 and watch all those liveperformances AT THE SAME TIME??? Man, time is short when you keep playing thosestupid online free-to-play games lol okay bye bye<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
