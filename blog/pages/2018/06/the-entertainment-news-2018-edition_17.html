Hey, guys.<br /><br />Yes, I know, my plans for
<strike>#KN20</strike> #KN10YEARS have yet to start, but yeah, I'm still working
on it. Turns out if too much happened in a year I have to spend more time
writing about everything. Should've thought of spacing all the events out to
make the storytelling in the future more consistent haha I'm going to run out of
content to talk about for Klassic Note last year lol okay let's do this first<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

  </div>
</blockquote>
The new episode (#FumikiriJikan10) brings us the epic conclusion (hopefully the
guy didn't f*** a schoolgirl lmao) of whatever cliffhanger we're left last week,
which is that guy seeing his student self crush but him as an old man. Spoilers
are ahead but yep, it's the daughter. Don't worry, nothing happened after the
truth was let out of the bag, and man was the daughter dressed exactly like the
mother. Just through literary? This kid is real smart, and fearless apparently,
to appear dressed in the same way. Well then again we're dealing with one guy
who will recognise her so... I guess it's okay? Man, is this the kind of love
story I'll see years from now when I'm an old man and my secondary school
(middle school for you folks out there) crush appear in the streets? Haha not
gonna happen I swear I don't even have a crush on anyone. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span><br />

P.S. Yeah I saw the cast in the opening theme. Remember last week's episode
didn't feature the girl talking? Thanks Tamura Yukari-chan you make a wonderful
schoolgirl voice lmao the last time I heard of her is when

Seriously at this point I want to be an Anime character, enter Tada-kun's cafe
and do that Rainbow Shogun action until Mitsuyoshi decides to go find the girl
haha. Okay, not going to happen just yet, but the new episode (#TadaKun11) sure
got a lot of people sad. IT'S BEEN ONE MONTH ALREADY?? Wait, THREE MONTHS?? I
mean, if you got regrets you better do something about it now. And so he does.
Among all the sadness is realisation, that their sudden departure is of course,
with reason. And of course, still possible to find out the truth. I mean, unlike
the last time Tada-kun your dear crush is not dead yet. And I must say the setup
to this part is real good; that I give the production credit for. From Tada-kun
being angry at them two leaving abruptly without a word, so seeing things around
town and reminiscing the good times, to cleaning up the past and finding them
out again (I mean, they could've just formatted that memory card haha) and even
in all these there are remnants of not only the two, but of regret. Of wanting
an answer to conclude the end of the good times. Hey, we all expected at least a
year of good times. This motherf**ker just left in six months!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay
jokes aside, if watching the video footage in the school computer didn't make
you tear up, you're heartless. If you're not touched when your dear grandpa
tells you to go pursue what is needed and giving you back your regret, you're
emotionless. All in all, I must say this is a real good plot twist aftermath for
an Anime original, and I can't wait to see how this pans out. With Tada-kun
conquering his fear of airplanes (Teresa-chan be like "he's not going to come
for us he hates planes" lol) for the one he likes, things are going to get real
awkward when he notices that he can't speak a word of European in that small
country lol okay yes chances are Teresa-chan could be married but still YOU WANT
HER TO COME FIND YOU WHEN SHE'S CARRYING TWO KIDS WITH HER OR WHAT? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />

P.S."Alec-san took the Volume 7 of my beloved mystery novel and didn't return?
We're doing to Larsenburg!" Is what I hoped Yui-chan would say, but hey, this is
not <i>her </i>show. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. Ijiun-kun MVP this episode because
he's the only one who can still keep the mood up (for himself mostly) despite
the circumstances. Also Miyano Mamoru MVS (most valued seiyuu) in case you don't
know how active he is in person compared to his Anime counterparts. Yes, this
isn't his first role with an active personality. Also MVC (most valued couple)
(lol) are the two regulars in the cafe because I want to say my love to someone
someday #RelationshipGoals<br /><br />

Oh wait, Nao-kun is HITTING ON A GIRL??? Oops. The new episode (#WotaKoi10) is
another one of those "And that is how I met your mom" stories? No? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
Okay, the story. Nao-kun manages to find himself a
<strike>plaything</strike> friend to play games with but unfortunately he, or
should I say, she, is a pro gamer like the brother. But before that, let's talk
about the glasses. A day with Hirotaka but without his glasses must be my
favourite part of this series now because I mean, it hits all the jokes at the
right spot. He indirectly gets laid by all the girls in the office, he is
mistaken by doing BL with his boss lmao (the hardest I've laughed here so far),
and... the girlfriend is jealous. Okay, maybe not the BL part she's enjoying it
but yeah, it was fun to watch. Now, Nao. Word pun not intended because it's a
lot more interesting in perspective for the title of the show I keep forgetting
because I keep thinking it's about those four. So yeah, the little brother
thinks his elder brother is just a heartless pro gamer who doesn't give two bird
poop about others, but hey, at least Kou-kun (as Nao-kun has referred to so it's
burned into my brain now) was kind enough to play with this total noob, and so
assist him whenever possible. That's how you make friends, people. Lucky you
Kou-kun; you'll not be that lucky again considering how closed and alone your
personality is. I'm a living example of such bad luck haha. On the other hand,
it was interesting to watch mainly because it's not about the main four anymore,
and with some hope we might just get to see some sparks going once that poor
part-timer notices he was hitting on a girl hehe I'll be looking forward to that
but going from the episode count... Please Anime give me that last part as
conclusion you won't give us the main conclusion anyway haha<br />

This week was quite important as it concluded on the many songs I've yet to give
over the past few weeks for some reason, and also new releases.
<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES new album</b> was much anticipated although rather
disappointing but I haven't given up yet so yeah I'll probably a couple more
after the topic song. The one <b>split single from cinema staff</b> was a real
bummer as I can't even so yeah I'm skipping that too (man, I've been doing this
quite a lot this year I wonder why) because it's just too hard to even give
anyone here. I also gave a listen to <b>H ZETTRIO</b> after quite some time
giving them a couple of music pieces from last year, and I won't say I will give
a lot here so I don't have to say I never give anything next week haha<br /><br />Talking
about next week, we're finally welcoming the end of<b>
  Chatmonchy and their final album</b
>
along with the sensation I went up on Twitter to make after getting hooked to
<b>Suchmos</b> and their new album which apparently the topic song I didn't get
hooked back four months ago and this is after their departure to major (though
independent) label earlier this year. So yeah, these two, are the plans.<br /><br />On
other news from the Internet for Klassic Note,
<b>fumika is finally back on Apple Music Japan</b>&nbsp;(since her departure
from major label) so yeah you should've noticed that playlist link,
<b>miwa's best album</b> tracklist isn't that impressive considering I missed
two of her recent singles already, as I said I got crazy on Suchmos instead of
being crazy over #KN10YEARS plans... oh that didn't go up on Twitter haha I
don't have the guts to announce something in progress<br /><br /><br /><br />
