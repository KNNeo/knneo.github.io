Turns out if too much happened in a year I have to spend more timewriting about everything. Should've thought of spacing all the events out tomake the storytelling in the future more consistent haha I'm going to run out ofcontent to talk about for Klassic Note last year lol okay let's do this first<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="FumikiriJikan10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Fumikiri Jikan</span>  </div></blockquote>The new episode (#FumikiriJikan10) brings us the epic conclusion (hopefully theguy didn't f*** a schoolgirl lmao) of whatever cliffhanger we're left last week,which is that guy seeing his student self crush but him as an old man. Spoilersare ahead but yep, it's the daughter. Don't worry, nothing happened after thetruth was let out of the bag, and man was the daughter dressed exactly like themother. Just through literary? This kid is real smart, and fearless apparently,to appear dressed in the same way. Well then again we're dealing with one guywho will recognise her so... I guess it's okay? Man, is this the kind of lovestory I'll see years from now when I'm an old man and my secondary school(middle school for you folks out there) crush appear in the streets? Haha notgonna happen I swear I don't even have a crush on anyone. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span><br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oVhsv8UcyLI/WyZH-7bNM0I/AAAAAAAAn3M/ETCm7oLRek87-poaSDB9loHDv9r0haXmACLcBGAs/s320/fumikirijikan10_shock.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        On the other hand, I'm surprised she's surprised at the...        confession?<br />Gotta inspire the girl to be a writer hehe      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Yeah I saw the cast in the opening theme. Remember last week's episodedidn't feature the girl talking? Thanks Tamura Yukari-chan you make a wonderfulschoolgirl voice lmao the last time I heard of her is when<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B-gata_H-kei" target="_blank"  >I was doing her on the bed</a>(Audience: HEY HEY HEY PG BRO) haha oops<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TadaKun11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I'm sure they have a good reason" YEAH YOU BET THEY DO haha #foreshadowing  </div></blockquote>Seriously at this point I want to be an Anime character, enter Tada-kun's cafeand do that Rainbow Shogun action until Mitsuyoshi decides to go find the girlhaha. Okay, not going to happen just yet, but the new episode (#TadaKun11) suregot a lot of people sad. IT'S BEEN ONE MONTH ALREADY?? Wait, THREE MONTHS?? Imean, if you got regrets you better do something about it now. And so he does.Among all the sadness is realisation, that their sudden departure is of course,with reason. And of course, still possible to find out the truth. I mean, unlikethe last time Tada-kun your dear crush is not dead yet. And I must say the setupto this part is real good; that I give the production credit for. From Tada-kunbeing angry at them two leaving abruptly without a word, so seeing things aroundtown and reminiscing the good times, to cleaning up the past and finding themout again (I mean, they could've just formatted that memory card haha) and evenin all these there are remnants of not only the two, but of regret. Of wantingan answer to conclude the end of the good times. Hey, we all expected at least ayear of good times. This motherf**ker just left in six months!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okayjokes aside, if watching the video footage in the school computer didn't makeyou tear up, you're heartless. If you're not touched when your dear grandpatells you to go pursue what is needed and giving you back your regret, you'reemotionless. All in all, I must say this is a real good plot twist aftermath foran Anime original, and I can't wait to see how this pans out. With Tada-kunconquering his fear of airplanes (Teresa-chan be like "he's not going to comefor us he hates planes" lol) for the one he likes, things are going to get realawkward when he notices that he can't speak a word of European in that smallcountry lol okay yes chances are Teresa-chan could be married but still YOU WANTHER TO COME FIND YOU WHEN SHE'S CARRYING TWO KIDS WITH HER OR WHAT? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <span class="normal"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qZXBaMqHHZ4/WyZRvppc6xI/AAAAAAAAn3Y/tplHLuIduHoxBS_oV1Ooz9GSI5UdnJoTgCLcBGAs/s320/tadakun11_cat1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Spoiler-free reaction images to this episode lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ><span class="hover"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fUkVPtW5sps/WyZRv3_7v-I/AAAAAAAAn3c/HgH_WIyR2MYvGe3FZpv-cJmGPJe5VpaJQCLcBGAs/s320/tadakun11_cat2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Spoiler-free reaction images to this episode lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ></div>P.S."Alec-san took the Volume 7 of my beloved mystery novel and didn't return?We're doing to Larsenburg!" Is what I hoped Yui-chan would say, but hey, this isnot <i>her </i>show. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. Ijiun-kun MVP this episode becausehe's the only one who can still keep the mood up (for himself mostly) despitethe circumstances. Also Miyano Mamoru MVS (most valued seiyuu) in case you don'tknow how active he is in person compared to his Anime counterparts. Yes, thisisn't his first role with an active personality. Also MVC (most valued couple)(lol) are the two regulars in the cafe because I want to say my love to someonesomeday #RelationshipGoals<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="WotaKoi10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "He's the type of person who's fine being alone" NAO TRIGGERED lol  </div></blockquote>Oh wait, Nao-kun is HITTING ON A GIRL??? Oops. The new episode (#WotaKoi10) isanother one of those "And that is how I met your mom" stories? No? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Okay, the story. Nao-kun manages to find himself a<strike>plaything</strike> friend to play games with but unfortunately he, orshould I say, she, is a pro gamer like the brother. But before that, let's talkabout the glasses. A day with Hirotaka but without his glasses must be myfavourite part of this series now because I mean, it hits all the jokes at theright spot. He indirectly gets laid by all the girls in the office, he ismistaken by doing BL with his boss lmao (the hardest I've laughed here so far),and... the girlfriend is jealous. Okay, maybe not the BL part she's enjoying itbut yeah, it was fun to watch. Now, Nao. Word pun not intended because it's alot more interesting in perspective for the title of the show I keep forgettingbecause I keep thinking it's about those four. So yeah, the little brotherthinks his elder brother is just a heartless pro gamer who doesn't give two birdpoop about others, but hey, at least Kou-kun (as Nao-kun has referred to so it'sburned into my brain now) was kind enough to play with this total noob, and soassist him whenever possible. That's how you make friends, people. Lucky youKou-kun; you'll not be that lucky again considering how closed and alone yourpersonality is. I'm a living example of such bad luck haha. On the other hand,it was interesting to watch mainly because it's not about the main four anymore,and with some hope we might just get to see some sparks going once that poorpart-timer notices he was hitting on a girl hehe I'll be looking forward to thatbut going from the episode count... Please Anime give me that last part asconclusion you won't give us the main conclusion anyway haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <span class="normal"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iwWVnWNxclA/WyZaBTjD-iI/AAAAAAAAn3s/BXvv2kIdurYDURXSuBCvfYrx1O4d3KuBwCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi10_myopia.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The two parts I laughed the most to haha<br />(That's me irl btw            it's funnier too that he's working instead of just staring at some            monitor)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ><span class="hover"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6FieJuhKtpw/WyZaBaUUytI/AAAAAAAAn3o/GtGXKs6IxoMKXggTtTccC1aHlUzeYjfcQCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi10_BL.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The two parts I laughed the most to haha<br />(I laughed harder at            Koyanagi's expected reaction lmao BL is great content for jokes)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ></div>P.S. *Watched last part after ending theme* Oh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S.

The one <b>split single from cinema staff</b> was a realbummer as I can't even so yeah I'm skipping that too (man, I've been doing thisquite a lot this year I wonder why) because it's just too hard to even giveanyone here. I also gave a listen to <b>H ZETTRIO</b> after quite some timegiving them a couple of music pieces from last year, and I won't say I will givea lot here so I don't have to say I never give anything next week haha<br /><br />Talkingabout next week, we're finally welcoming the end of<b>  Chatmonchy and their final album</b>along with the sensation I went up on Twitter to make after getting hooked to<b>Suchmos</b> and their new album which apparently the topic song I didn't gethooked back four months ago and this is after their departure to major (thoughindependent) label earlier this year. So yeah, these two, are the plans.<br /><br />Onother news from the Internet for Klassic Note,<b>fumika is finally back on Apple Music Japan</b>&nbsp;(since her departurefrom major label) so yeah you should've noticed that playlist link,<b>miwa's best album</b> tracklist isn't that impressive considering I missedtwo of her recent singles already, as I said I got crazy on Suchmos instead ofbeing crazy over #KN10YEARS plans... oh that didn't go up on Twitter haha Idon't have the guts to announce something in progress<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />Okay I'm tired from making<a  href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HmM_6kPdWMU/WyZlU03kzII/AAAAAAAAn38/iBu4rwJhEI0LFMvq1VY52mM7blzz40O-QCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2B%25285%2529.png"  target="_blank"  >some stupid program in Python</a>to help me fetch Songs of the day from my own Twitter account it's overflowingin user traffic for some reason lol.
