Hey.<br /><br />If you wonder why I posted this late, it's mostly because I've
been watching a lot of YouTube videos just now (it just happens, or else I fap)
(lol please don't tell anyone else) and also because... I'm waiting for an email
before I continue.<br /><br />And... I'm glad I'm going to graduate this year
because I finally registered my final course. Goddamn finally. I've been scared
this whole weekend after whatever the heck happened this week. It has been long
tbh<br /><br /><br />

If you're chanting to yourself "he's gonna lose" you're not alone haha. In the
new episode (#TakagiSan03) (ah I love starting the week maybe with Anime)
despite him working out to get abs or to punish himself for whenever he gets
teased, he still looks like a final stage cancer patient when he's with girls,
especially the one girl lol. Hey, I think Nishikata got hit more times than he
should have already, or that he may be setting his bar too high by classifying
every time he gets teased as a punishment. Then again, he's going down hard on
himself, just like his lack of EQ lol. Takagi too, she's enjoying this for sure,
and yeah, I guess it's getting overboard considering she knows how to make use
of the boy to satisfy her joy. Really reminds me of how I get teased by
classmates when I was a kid. Poor guy. He's going to end up like me lol.
Anyways, more focus is also put on the secondary characters, and I like that
tbh. From vending machine drinks to
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/aiaigasa" target="_blank"
  >sharing an umbrella</a
>
in the rain, this show's got everything. Now I wish the ending theme is true and
we'll see a summer version of this soon. Hey, it does not have to be the same
jokes because the guy's an idiot (he probably forgets more when he gets teased
than Takagi forgets stuff) and I can totally confirm that, just even through his
thinking. I mean, you know one can refrain from answering, stop being a nice guy
(offering umbrella), and never trust your instincts until you get tricked. Hey,
this episode in a nutshell. I'm not going to hope Nishikata wises up already
because he won't in a thousand years, but I wish we'll get to see just maybe (we
kind of did, but) someday that Takagi can get teased in some way. Whether it's
embarrassment, clumsiness, whatever. I know. R*ping her is the only option, huh.
*laughs at Nishikata*<br />

P.S. What the f*** is with that cat dubbing I want this show to be like this for

as the new Anime term for being teased by someone. Someone get this in urban
dictionary or something haha<br />

Hey it's another wonderful episode (#SlowStart04) in this slice-of-life series,
and we are introduced with probably the best girl in the entire series probably
(sorry Eiko-chan haha), and it's (yeah don't read it directly even if&nbsp; you
know it) Hannen Hiroe. And in this introduction, we actually get a lot more
development than I would wish for, from a shut-in to revealing her past to what
she is by the end of the episode, being friends with Hana-chan and FINALLY
getting out of the house lol, she's doing it. And I'm surprised to be blown off
of how bad my impression of this emo freak until they got into this episode,
which is good news to me. She might just be my new favourite now, probably with
affection as much as Eiko-chan is giving to that poor woman lol. Anyways, the
girls are as usual having a wonderful time, we now know this is literally an
episode to cheer girls up (hey I highly recommend this episode to dejected
females out there), and seriously Hiroe-san, you can most definitely wear
Shion's clothes hehe #alltheway<br />

The new episode (#DagashiKashiS203) is short as always, but of course, there's
no dagashi. Eh? Yeah, it's about games, and a sad tale to tell, to say the
least. First, game. If you have watched the livestream like I did yesterday, you
shouldn't be surprised with beigoma, that spinning top before there was beyblade
lol. Anyways, if it's a bet, and there's no Sayashi, then Hotaru wouldn't have
lost. Haha, just saying. Her luck is as bad as... wait, no one is as bad as her
tbh even Ayachi got something in the baseball gum game featured last episode
haha. Then, there's the flashback. Flashback to when there wasn't Shikada
Dagashi, and Hotaru had to go pester another shop lol, but yeah, she's not
entirely wrong. Considering she has been well experienced with being the
daughter of the largest dagashi company in Japan, can't say she doesn't know.
But not everything, and here is where she gets most of her education, from a
sulking and balding old man haha. Anyways, brings back memories for her, not
like she'll shed a tear now that it's gone (I mean, I wouldn't if I had
Kokonotsu lol), but still. It's something to say the least. Oh yeah, add in more
Hotaru fanservice (should I even mention any of them here?), and you get your
staple ecchi comedy. Hey, "if this doesn't sell I don't know what will", said
the producer haha<br />

    The new chapters (101-105) (wow that was quite a bunch) talk about a couple
    more sweets, and also, something familiar. Now I'm glad I've watched the
    Anime first instead of this hehe. From fake tattoos to doing business 101
    with Kokonotsu to finishing homework (which reminds me lol), this show's got
    everything as usual. Also, there's that recollection of Hotaru visiting that
    balding... okay I've said it before so if you read the manga first then go
    watch the Anime. I guess the guys are catching up with the scans, so that's
    good news. I wonder when the new characters are coming. Hmm...<br />

This week in Klassic Note wasn't that eventful. Well, not until you know there's
next week and it's a lot better than this week. I finally got a listen to
<b>yanaginagi's new album</b> and I must say... I want to give it chance. So the
final verdict will have to wait, but it looks like I'm giving
<a href="https://twitter.com/roundkitagawa" target="_blank">Kitagawa</a> (if you
still don't know who he is I can't help you) and his compositions more than
yanaginagi herself somehow, and I don't know if that's a good thing or not.
Talking about him and about something totally unrelated to him because I want to
find a link to the sentences (lol), I also reviewed
<b>Anime "Slow Start" opening theme</b> and I guess it's okay, and that is good.
It's been some time I've given a good Anime theme song, and this is going to
continue the momentum since I gave a satisfactory one from Anime "GAMERS"; that
too was pretty good.<br /><br />Don't ask if I have heard new songs here and
there (yanaginagi pun not intended) this week because if you read the intro I
don't need to explain why here. It's mostly based on my mood so expected
releases will have to do for now. Come on, I'm even struggling to give those
now.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yeah, I'm done. I'll need to move on with life now
that my last semester of university is determined. Cya guys next week then, and
until then... I need motivation. I'm lacking in a lot of it. Maybe be a rich
kid, whatever. My dad want to sponsor my rich life? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nah I'm just joking
bye<br /><br />P.S. Seriously thinking about APoL because it's the only thing
that can make me sleep every night. Yeah. Serious. Thinking too much about
course registration all week already. I really should get one more done by...
the end of the year? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sorry not sorry<br /><br />P.P.S. I'm seriously
close to giving my first review of Klassic Note 2018. Yes, I'm looking at you
