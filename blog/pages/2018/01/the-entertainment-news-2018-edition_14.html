I'm tired. Then again, I'm always tired. Maybe it's the coldweather. Man, reaching a new low here already. Guess the new school semester ishere to make me kick into gear again, although as of now I don't have atimetable so technically I'm a free bird hehe<br /><br />Okay, let's get tothis. This is also probably the last week I'll still be looking for new Anime totalk about them, and I think I have enough for regular viewing, so I'll be backto regular schedule next week. Sorry for the excessive scrolling for the pastfew weeks haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSan01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "How do I embarrass Takagi-san?" I mean, just r*** the shit out of her lol    haha no guys I'm just joking don't do that  </div></blockquote>Hmm, I might just watch this show, and I've got my reasons. The first episode(#TakagiSan01) delivered a good summary of what is in and what might happen, andthat's good for something which feels like on first impression, Anime "Tonari noSeki-kun". But in this case, the girl's playing fun of the boy, and the boy's anidiot lol. Anyways, the story in brief. It's a slice-of-life, but it's also withdevelopment, which is what will make it different, I hope. Nishikata sits besideTakagi-san, and if you haven't been duped into anything before by someone of theopposite gender I pity you. Or on the other hand, I congratulate you. Becausethe author has seemingly written it perfectly on how pranks work in class,whether from setting it up to doing it where least unexpected - Takagi-san hasit all. Nishikata seems like he's smart, but once you watch halfway throughyou'll notice he's still dumb af lol. Add in some mystery in the romancedepartment (yes it's written ALL over Takagi's eraser and Nishikata's face lol)and secondary characters, and we might have the least unexpected romance comedyhere. Hey, I may be dreaming, but watching this episode makes me feels like so,and I like it. I also appreciate the slow pace of the show (because why doesDagashi Kashi get half-length episodes but not this) because it brings up morereactions from both characters (personally I like the girl) (yes I'm not as dumbas you Nishikata I'm straightforward) which is a nice touch to catch the eyes ofeveryone who likes the animation, and I must say, it's pretty good. Coupled withfamiliar voices which is not Amamiya Sora (for some reason Takahashi Rie soundslike Ten-chan I don't know), this is setting up to be the next romcom that I'lllike. Hey, I'm just saying, but you can't stop me liking that ending theme songbecause Ikimonogakari hehe and it's super duper cute with Rie-chan too<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rewwKmmKctU/WlQ_xp7e8EI/AAAAAAAAkT8/70MW_TmuXg8qJUpLgIQMIcyewbKa8hTzwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisan01_takagi2.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Should I photoshop the eraser so it looks like she's lewd?<br />Okay        maybe not HAHA I'M DOING IT      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Yep, they totally covered it. When Takagi climbed down from the desk out ofthe curtain. The animation team was trying so hard to make sure this is notrated lol okay there wasn't anything there anyway PRANKED<br />P.P.S. As usual,the way to deal with people who like to prank you (as with Seki-kun too) is toignore, and take the task at hand seriously ie. pay attention to the lesson, buthey, they're still middle schoolers, so I won't say much haha Nishikata continueto be dumb or else we'll run out of material<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ihzyioXB6Y8/WlrSpajvinI/AAAAAAAAkXY/qjd-Sg_ATl8n4_VvLCvlGcBAv_6bfCbjQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisan01_takagi1edit.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">FIXED IT haha</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;">  <i><span style="font-size: large;">OMAKE!!!!</span></i></div><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          height="178"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9p0rIiBBh5I/WlRQmKaZQvI/AAAAAAAAkUg/yK_Y320Y-WYSH-JI08moWVBWM3cuxkZcwCLcBGAs/w320-h178/takagisan01_desk.gif"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Man, how did they make this show so wrong haha      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="CardcaptorSakuraClearCard01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card-hen</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    All I want to be in life is to be Tomoyo-chan. No, not the recording of    lovey-dovey action of Sakura-chan gaining ultimate monopoly of the footage;    I'm talking about being a rich kid haha  </div></blockquote>Man, all the memories. Although to be honest, I didn't watch everything of whatCardcaptor Sakura has to offer, so firstly, I'll talk about my experience withthe show. This show was probably introduced by my sister (who is of course now,excited for this return) back in 10 years ago, where she also started watchingthe full three seasons worth of original Anime which was aired some years ago.Haha, feel old yet? And guess that? It's back to (may I quote someone on theInternet) show how shoujo action Anime should be done. (Sorry, Madoka Magica)Okay, my experience is only quite limited but not to whatever you probably knowof when watching the first episode - the characters (it took me some time toremember who's that from England), the antics (Tomoyo with the camera forexample), the developments (Yue transformation, Sakura and Syouran are a thingnow) and everything in between ie. most of the stuff I probably forgot. Still,this brings back much memories. To top that, everything else is exactly the sameas before, from animation, sounds (fue~~), to character voices... it's all same.Heck, even Sakamoto Maaya came back for the opening theme song. With all this inline, how can it not bring all the fans - new or old - back to these wonderfultimes? I may not watch this in full though (I don't think the slow pace of theplot holds up to any extent, which is why I mentioned I don't remembereverything), but I'll take note. Considering my sis is also watching this I'llprobably hop on the hype train with her, so yeah, no more reviews after this.But hey, welcome back Sakura. I liked Syouran better lol I mean his voice HISVOICE!! Sakura sounds too high pitched cute imo<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HTAVAmA1tJ8/WlRI4bqJt8I/AAAAAAAAkUM/vru5r-kxrAM-kidoVib09WWzpQMv8vMWgCLcBGAs/s320/sakuraclear01_tomoyo.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        99% of the audience faces look like this when this first episode        aired.<br />The other 1% are screaming at the new clothes Sakura-chan        will be wearing hehe      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. I would hope for new characters for this series, but I may be putting myhopes too high. Still, the new generation of voice actors/actresses will be agreat addition to this wonderful series. We've only got Hayami Saori on thistrain so far and she's not even in the cast<br />P.P.S. Good reminder that nowwith<abbr alternative="" girls="" title="Tachibana Naomi, from Game"  >my own experience</abbr>I can figure out that<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/2897/Keroberos" target="_blank"  >Kero-chan</a>speaks with a high-pitched Osaka accent. Well then again I started with Englishdub (I know) so I'm not that familiar with this voice<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DagashiKashiS201">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi 2</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    I just noticed I'm laughing way too hard at Hotaru running into an entrance.    Then I noticed it's the only thing that will (probably) make me laugh hard    in this series.  </div></blockquote>Okay, not starting this on a sad note, but as you may have noticed, the show'slength is cut in half. Then again, same style, so I'll call this show a blessingin disguise. That doesn't mean I won't watch it though because everything soreminiscent is what is still making this a nice series to watch. The firstepisode (#DagashiKashiS201) brings about the reunion of all four characters ontothe table as prelude to the introduction of new characters, I assume. They touchon two chapters of the manga that I already have read but probably forgotten(okay maybe not), but yeah, it's a lot more. A lot more laughs, a lot moresubtle jokes (the running entrance is a mystery in itself lol), and a lot moreawkward parts. This, I'll look over it. Besides that, you get your usual showalbeit with a little more Hotaru fanservice as obviously seen throughout theepisode, even the opening theme animation tbh<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">  <b><span style="font-size: large;">TOKUBETSU SPECIAL!!!</span></b></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qutUXSIzGkY/WlrUR88Ff_I/AAAAAAAAkXo/UvlzngMVWiAY_l97Xty9G18j0acNvhrhQCEwYBhgL/s1600/dagashikashi2_1_hotaru.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Hotaru Orgsam Mode, I call it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />(I'd rather they just make        her pant lol)      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. I mean, do you seriously see a difference in animation? All I see was justanother season of Anime! You guys need to be more positive about the animationstudio change, really.<br />P.P.S. For the theme songs, I'll give Ayachi foropening because it's going to be obligatory especially if I decide not to givethe ending. That one, I'll see for myself. I may just like it if I listen 11more times lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SlowStart02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Slow Start</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Secretions"?? I KNEW IT THIS IS AN ECCHI ANIME lol  </div></blockquote>In this slice-of-life Anime that I can't stop watching, the new episode(#SlowStart02) brings Hana-chan's past and one of her (many, maybe) weaknesswhich is she is bad at sports. And she lied. Yes, first lie of this series,ladies. (Audience: What about the gentlemen?) And among all these straight jokesI appreciate how this show is going. The pace may still be slow, but I like thefeel of the show. Really reminds me of A Channel, just that now we have a castof nothing but Tooru voices. Okay, maybe not Eiko. And the cousin. But yeah, Iguess I can watch this. Let's talk about plot. Hana-chan got ill during theentrance exam period (that is Jan-Feb) so she missed all the exams, but wasstill able to get into high school, but I guess she has to change in herlifestyle for being too much of a shut-in and worrying about getting friends,among many things in her life right now. Still, she said a lie to her newfriends in which she is quickly experiencing the consequences in the recentsports test, and yeah, she's terrible. Terrible if you don't exercise. Terriblenot because you're young and can still do that fist clench test. Just like me.Man, I share so many similarities with Hana lol. Anyways, about the others.Kamuri is good at running but way too shy to carry a conversation with others,Eiko is always going to be MVP in this show because of her elder sister"onee-chan" character (see Blend.S for what that means), and Tama-chan is themost lively wife you'd ever want hehe. All in all, I like this show, and eventhe teacher throws us off every once in a while. (The teacher has cramps lol)<br />P.S.Okay I don't know which Hana-chan expression I should put so I'll put one hereand make the other a GIF. Also, not posting girls lovey-dovey stuff here justbecause I can.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZQ4XzVFZO44/WlrNYytcIoI/AAAAAAAAkW8/ADpjCIBnWaALUmPcIXbBOLI20nMKR8DsACLcBGAs/s320/slowstart02_happy.jpg"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Happy stuff, yes?

That's how lone wolf terrorists are made lol  </div></blockquote>Hey, it's another episode, so let's talk about it once more, since Hina-chanhints that this might be the end of it all. The new episode (#3Lion35) concludeson the bullying arc (lol) with the head teacher confidently (though unwillingly)sweeping this into a school event, and made sure the class can spill the beans,without all of the "prosecutors" involved. And yeah, it has indeed come to aconclusion. Even though for Megumi? (Yeah I don't remember a**hole names haha)She may have her own problems. But we'll not discuss it here I guess; she's notthe main character lol. Anyways, she leaves us something (if you haven'tnoticed) of how to live in society, and that is not wrong. Many people voice outor even act out their own way to achieve something, whether it's psychologicallygood or bad for others. But sometimes, it's not within the society to acceptthose that are bad. So great, people have to intervene. But see for Chiho-chanher case, she can't deal with such things, likely even with help of others.Hina-chan is strong enough to defend against that, but has barely came outalive. Just a good reminder to tell us there's always a part of society thatwill embrace you for who you are. But seriously, don't do bad things. There isfreedom in many bad things you can do that are not illegal, I promise. And also,I want to be happy so I won't do things that are stupid, just so you know. On alighter side, we see some more interaction with Kiriyama and Hina-chan. I mean,they are 3 years apart only, and they admire each other so much. Can we getsomething out of this some time? Says the Anime production to the author who isprobably still shaking his head right now lol, but yeah,those moments are thebest. I totally appreciate how they made sure you can feel what it means to bein this show, be it happiness or sadness or just pure despair. Hey, it's drama,and it's drama done well. Okay, maybe not for the<strike>shafting</strike> sub-par animation quality but still. The theme songscould be better haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2DpBssb9DGI/Wlr20N8cYcI/AAAAAAAAkYI/Tqh8Oopb2Nsu1dc_LvdFTF2GKgrPI7LkQCLcBGAs/s320/sangatsunolion35_sleeping.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        さあ、どうする?ww<br />[So, what will you do (now)? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S.

The first talks about boobs it seems (sorry Sayashi I'll beatTou-kun up on your behalf lol), and we still didn't know about the story behindit, or if it had one. Or if whoever thought of the name was sick enough to notuse pacifier as part of the name lol. The other, since it's a 100th chapter,brings us back to one of the first chapters Butamen, even though not much hasbeen mentioned, it talks about eating them and using the fork in a customerperspective, which somehow is a good change of view.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="347"          data-original-width="653"          height="170"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kl3V_4no2L4/WltGezKoINI/AAAAAAAAkYc/aTjafLIzWm0Ezh2C4KdpDxnuS_ZPyiR7QCLcBGAs/s320/dgska99_001.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Can this be an ad? lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Nagasarete Airantou</span>  </div></blockquote>Well it's been some time again (the last update I checked was February last yearlol), so let's see where we left off, because I do take notes. The new chapters(101-102) conclude on the Beniyasha arc I probably forgot most of them, with theelderly being a nine-tailed fox confronting Ikuto with the two most importantpeople in his life? Sure, but the sister Misaki has a totally different story.Reason she was half-youkai was because her mother was in this island, andTsurara (the elder's assistant Michiru's mother who lives in the mountains)rarely comes down to the land because she cannot maintain her form that long.After a good summary which makes me more confused as before (so yeah Misaki andMichiru are Tsurara's kids and the elder's grand-kids), there is no doubt thatthe only human who was never born on this island as of now is still Ikuto haha.The latest chapter (153) talks about the reunion of the mother and daughter, andof course how much difference it makes to be a birth mother. Then again, it'sgood to hear about Ikuto's family in completion, from the grandfather to theparents, so that's good. The author apparently still has plenty of stories towrite, so I'll see how long I can follow this.<br />P.S. Is this the first timeI've been touched by one of the manga chapters?? Haha<br />P.P.S. Okay most ofthe pages are too much upskirt shots so I'm not putting a thumbnail here lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>I've been listening to a couple of releases lately, but haven't been able togive most of them. <b>DENIMS</b> came under the Klassic Note microscope onceagain because I've given them a chance once already but to no avail, and I doubtanything will happen this time around. Their newest album released in Decemberlast year isn't online though, so I may have to wait to see if the newer releaseis any different. Hmm... what else... oh yeah the<b>new Anime theme songs</b> this season? Sangatsu no Lion probably is givingthe most problems as of now because I don't really like either of them; SlowStart is currently at its best because I can take both theme songs; Takagi-sanI'll be giving the opening since I don't want to give cover to a song I've given10 years ago (wow it's been so long I feel old lol), and Dagashi Kashi I fearfor the ending because IS THAT RAPPING IN THE VERSES?? Oh well, we shall seeabout it then. I'm not giving Sumipe's new single (Pop Team Epic opening) that'sfor sure haha<br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm real tired of doing this. Tired asin because of school stating tomorrow and I have to go to school because I haveto return a long due library book because I haven't been doing it last week whenit did lol, not because this is the final issue haha. Man, I'm full of lamejokes. Cya guys next week then, and until then... don't even post commentsonline. People assume so much they'd rather trample you than respect you foryour personal opinion. In the past I thought I was one of them but now I'm mostdefinitely not. It's not majority anymore; it's universal opinion apparently.Thanks for ruining someone's day, reddit idiots. Also, Pirates series isn't thatfantastic.
