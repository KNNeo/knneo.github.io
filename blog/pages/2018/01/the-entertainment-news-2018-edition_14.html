Wow, what a week. I'm tired. Then again, I'm always tired. Maybe it's the cold
weather. Man, reaching a new low here already. Guess the new school semester is
here to make me kick into gear again, although as of now I don't have a
timetable so technically I'm a free bird hehe<br /><br />Okay, let's get to
this. This is also probably the last week I'll still be looking for new Anime to
talk about them, and I think I have enough for regular viewing, so I'll be back
to regular schedule next week. Sorry for the excessive scrolling for the past
few weeks haha<br /><br /><br /><br />

Hmm, I might just watch this show, and I've got my reasons. The first episode
(#TakagiSan01) delivered a good summary of what is in and what might happen, and
that's good for something which feels like on first impression, Anime "Tonari no
Seki-kun". But in this case, the girl's playing fun of the boy, and the boy's an
idiot lol. Anyways, the story in brief. It's a slice-of-life, but it's also with
development, which is what will make it different, I hope. Nishikata sits beside
Takagi-san, and if you haven't been duped into anything before by someone of the
opposite gender I pity you. Or on the other hand, I congratulate you. Because
the author has seemingly written it perfectly on how pranks work in class,
whether from setting it up to doing it where least unexpected - Takagi-san has
it all. Nishikata seems like he's smart, but once you watch halfway through
you'll notice he's still dumb af lol. Add in some mystery in the romance
department (yes it's written ALL over Takagi's eraser and Nishikata's face lol)
and secondary characters, and we might have the least unexpected romance comedy
here. Hey, I may be dreaming, but watching this episode makes me feels like so,
and I like it. I also appreciate the slow pace of the show (because why does
Dagashi Kashi get half-length episodes but not this) because it brings up more
reactions from both characters (personally I like the girl) (yes I'm not as dumb
as you Nishikata I'm straightforward) which is a nice touch to catch the eyes of
everyone who likes the animation, and I must say, it's pretty good. Coupled with
familiar voices which is not Amamiya Sora (for some reason Takahashi Rie sounds
like Ten-chan I don't know), this is setting up to be the next romcom that I'll
like. Hey, I'm just saying, but you can't stop me liking that ending theme song
because Ikimonogakari hehe and it's super duper cute with Rie-chan too<br />

P.S. Yep, they totally covered it. When Takagi climbed down from the desk out of
the curtain. The animation team was trying so hard to make sure this is not
rated lol okay there wasn't anything there anyway PRANKED<br />P.P.S. As usual,
the way to deal with people who like to prank you (as with Seki-kun too) is to
ignore, and take the task at hand seriously ie. pay attention to the lesson, but
hey, they're still middle schoolers, so I won't say much haha Nishikata continue
to be dumb or else we'll run out of material<br />

</blockquote>
Man, all the memories. Although to be honest, I didn't watch everything of what
Cardcaptor Sakura has to offer, so firstly, I'll talk about my experience with
the show. This show was probably introduced by my sister (who is of course now,
excited for this return) back in 10 years ago, where she also started watching
the full three seasons worth of original Anime which was aired some years ago.
Haha, feel old yet? And guess that? It's back to (may I quote someone on the
Internet) show how shoujo action Anime should be done. (Sorry, Madoka Magica)
Okay, my experience is only quite limited but not to whatever you probably know
of when watching the first episode - the characters (it took me some time to
remember who's that from England), the antics (Tomoyo with the camera for
example), the developments (Yue transformation, Sakura and Syouran are a thing
now) and everything in between ie. most of the stuff I probably forgot. Still,
this brings back much memories. To top that, everything else is exactly the same
as before, from animation, sounds (fue~~), to character voices... it's all same.
Heck, even Sakamoto Maaya came back for the opening theme song. With all this in
line, how can it not bring all the fans - new or old - back to these wonderful
times? I may not watch this in full though (I don't think the slow pace of the
plot holds up to any extent, which is why I mentioned I don't remember
everything), but I'll take note. Considering my sis is also watching this I'll
probably hop on the hype train with her, so yeah, no more reviews after this.
But hey, welcome back Sakura. I liked Syouran better lol I mean his voice HIS
VOICE!! Sakura sounds too high pitched cute imo<br />

P.S. I would hope for new characters for this series, but I may be putting my
hopes too high. Still, the new generation of voice actors/actresses will be a
great addition to this wonderful series. We've only got Hayami Saori on this
train so far and she's not even in the cast<br />P.P.S. Good reminder that now

I can figure out that

Okay, not starting this on a sad note, but as you may have noticed, the show's
length is cut in half. Then again, same style, so I'll call this show a blessing
in disguise. That doesn't mean I won't watch it though because everything so
reminiscent is what is still making this a nice series to watch. The first
episode (#DagashiKashiS201) brings about the reunion of all four characters onto
the table as prelude to the introduction of new characters, I assume. They touch
on two chapters of the manga that I already have read but probably forgotten
(okay maybe not), but yeah, it's a lot more. A lot more laughs, a lot more
subtle jokes (the running entrance is a mystery in itself lol), and a lot more
awkward parts. This, I'll look over it. Besides that, you get your usual show
albeit with a little more Hotaru fanservice as obviously seen throughout the
episode, even the opening theme animation tbh<br />

P.S. I mean, do you seriously see a difference in animation? All I see was just
another season of Anime! You guys need to be more positive about the animation
studio change, really.<br />P.P.S. For the theme songs, I'll give Ayachi for
opening because it's going to be obligatory especially if I decide not to give
the ending. That one, I'll see for myself. I may just like it if I listen 11
more times lol<br /><br />

In this slice-of-life Anime that I can't stop watching, the new episode
(#SlowStart02) brings Hana-chan's past and one of her (many, maybe) weakness
which is she is bad at sports. And she lied. Yes, first lie of this series,
ladies. (Audience: What about the gentlemen?) And among all these straight jokes
I appreciate how this show is going. The pace may still be slow, but I like the
feel of the show. Really reminds me of A Channel, just that now we have a cast
of nothing but Tooru voices. Okay, maybe not Eiko. And the cousin. But yeah, I
guess I can watch this. Let's talk about plot. Hana-chan got ill during the
entrance exam period (that is Jan-Feb) so she missed all the exams, but was
still able to get into high school, but I guess she has to change in her
lifestyle for being too much of a shut-in and worrying about getting friends,
among many things in her life right now. Still, she said a lie to her new
friends in which she is quickly experiencing the consequences in the recent
sports test, and yeah, she's terrible. Terrible if you don't exercise. Terrible
not because you're young and can still do that fist clench test. Just like me.
Man, I share so many similarities with Hana lol. Anyways, about the others.
Kamuri is good at running but way too shy to carry a conversation with others,
Eiko is always going to be MVP in this show because of her elder sister
"onee-chan" character (see Blend.S for what that means), and Tama-chan is the
most lively wife you'd ever want hehe. All in all, I like this show, and even
the teacher throws us off every once in a while. (The teacher has cramps lol)<br />P.S.
Okay I don't know which Hana-chan expression I should put so I'll put one here
and make the other a GIF. Also, not posting girls lovey-dovey stuff here just
because I can.<br />

Hey, it's another episode, so let's talk about it once more, since Hina-chan
hints that this might be the end of it all. The new episode (#3Lion35) concludes
on the bullying arc (lol) with the head teacher confidently (though unwillingly)
sweeping this into a school event, and made sure the class can spill the beans,
without all of the "prosecutors" involved. And yeah, it has indeed come to a
conclusion. Even though for Megumi? (Yeah I don't remember a**hole names haha)
She may have her own problems. But we'll not discuss it here I guess; she's not
the main character lol. Anyways, she leaves us something (if you haven't
noticed) of how to live in society, and that is not wrong. Many people voice out
or even act out their own way to achieve something, whether it's psychologically
good or bad for others. But sometimes, it's not within the society to accept
those that are bad. So great, people have to intervene. But see for Chiho-chan
her case, she can't deal with such things, likely even with help of others.
Hina-chan is strong enough to defend against that, but has barely came out
alive. Just a good reminder to tell us there's always a part of society that
will embrace you for who you are. But seriously, don't do bad things. There is
freedom in many bad things you can do that are not illegal, I promise. And also,
I want to be happy so I won't do things that are stupid, just so you know. On a
lighter side, we see some more interaction with Kiriyama and Hina-chan. I mean,
they are 3 years apart only, and they admire each other so much. Can we get
something out of this some time? Says the Anime production to the author who is
probably still shaking his head right now lol, but yeah,those moments are the
best. I totally appreciate how they made sure you can feel what it means to be
in this show, be it happiness or sadness or just pure despair. Hey, it's drama,
and it's drama done well. Okay, maybe not for the
<strike>shafting</strike> sub-par animation quality but still. The theme songs
could be better haha<br />

The new chapters (99-100) talk about... very different things, so I'll touch on
them individually. The first talks about boobs it seems (sorry Sayashi I'll beat
Tou-kun up on your behalf lol), and we still didn't know about the story behind
it, or if it had one. Or if whoever thought of the name was sick enough to not
use pacifier as part of the name lol. The other, since it's a 100th chapter,
brings us back to one of the first chapters Butamen, even though not much has
been mentioned, it talks about eating them and using the fork in a customer
perspective, which somehow is a good change of view.<br />

Well it's been some time again (the last update I checked was February last year
lol), so let's see where we left off, because I do take notes. The new chapters
(101-102) conclude on the Beniyasha arc I probably forgot most of them, with the
elderly being a nine-tailed fox confronting Ikuto with the two most important
people in his life? Sure, but the sister Misaki has a totally different story.
Reason she was half-youkai was because her mother was in this island, and
Tsurara (the elder's assistant Michiru's mother who lives in the mountains)
rarely comes down to the land because she cannot maintain her form that long.
After a good summary which makes me more confused as before (so yeah Misaki and
Michiru are Tsurara's kids and the elder's grand-kids), there is no doubt that
the only human who was never born on this island as of now is still Ikuto haha.
The latest chapter (153) talks about the reunion of the mother and daughter, and
of course how much difference it makes to be a birth mother. Then again, it's
good to hear about Ikuto's family in completion, from the grandfather to the
parents, so that's good. The author apparently still has plenty of stories to
write, so I'll see how long I can follow this.<br />P.S. Is this the first time
I've been touched by one of the manga chapters?? Haha<br />P.P.S. Okay most of
the pages are too much upskirt shots so I'm not putting a thumbnail here lol<br /><br />

I've been listening to a couple of releases lately, but haven't been able to
give most of them. <b>DENIMS</b> came under the Klassic Note microscope once
again because I've given them a chance once already but to no avail, and I doubt
anything will happen this time around. Their newest album released in December
last year isn't online though, so I may have to wait to see if the newer release
is any different. Hmm... what else... oh yeah the
<b>new Anime theme songs</b> this season? Sangatsu no Lion probably is giving
the most problems as of now because I don't really like either of them; Slow
Start is currently at its best because I can take both theme songs; Takagi-san
I'll be giving the opening since I don't want to give cover to a song I've given
10 years ago (wow it's been so long I feel old lol), and Dagashi Kashi I fear
for the ending because IS THAT RAPPING IN THE VERSES?? Oh well, we shall see
about it then. I'm not giving Sumipe's new single (Pop Team Epic opening) that's
for sure haha<br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm real tired of doing this. Tired as
in because of school stating tomorrow and I have to go to school because I have
to return a long due library book because I haven't been doing it last week when
it did lol, not because this is the final issue haha. Man, I'm full of lame
jokes. Cya guys next week then, and until then... don't even post comments
online. People assume so much they'd rather trample you than respect you for
your personal opinion. In the past I thought I was one of them but now I'm most
definitely not. It's not majority anymore; it's universal opinion apparently.
Thanks for ruining someone's day, reddit idiots. Also, Pirates series isn't that
fantastic. Have you watched "Yoru no Mijikashi, Arukeyo Otome"??
