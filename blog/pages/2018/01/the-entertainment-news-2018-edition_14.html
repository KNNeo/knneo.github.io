I'm tired. Then again, I'm always tired. Maybe it's the cold weather. Man, reaching a new low here already. Guess the new school semester is here to make me kick into gear again, although as of now I don't have a timetable so technically I'm a free bird hehe<br><br>Okay, let's get to this. This is also probably the last week I'll still be looking for new Anime to talk about them, and I think I have enough for regular viewing, so I'll be back to regular schedule next week. Sorry for the excessive scrolling for the past few weeks haha<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSan01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"How do I embarrass Takagi-san?" I mean, just r*** the shit out of her lol haha no guys I'm just joking don't do that</div></blockquote>Hmm, I might just watch this show, and I've got my reasons. The first episode (#TakagiSan01) delivered a good summary of what is in and what might happen, and that's good for something which feels like on first impression, Anime "Tonari no Seki-kun". But in this case, the girl's playing fun of the boy, and the boy's an idiot lol. Anyways, the story in brief. It's a slice-of-life, but it's also with development, which is what will make it different, I hope. Nishikata sits beside Takagi-san, and if you haven't been duped into anything before by someone of the opposite gender I pity you. Or on the other hand, I congratulate you. Because the author has seemingly written it perfectly on how pranks work in class, whether from setting it up to doing it where least unexpected - Takagi-san has it all. Nishikata seems like he's smart, but once you watch halfway through you'll notice he's still dumb af lol. Add in some mystery in the romance department (yes it's written ALL over Takagi's eraser and Nishikata's face lol) and secondary characters, and we might have the least unexpected romance comedy here. Hey, I may be dreaming, but watching this episode makes me feels like so, and I like it. I also appreciate the slow pace of the show (because why does Dagashi Kashi get half-length episodes but not this) because it brings up more reactions from both characters (personally I like the girl) (yes I'm not as dumb as you Nishikata I'm straightforward) which is a nice touch to catch the eyes of everyone who likes the animation, and I must say, it's pretty good. Coupled with familiar voices which is not Amamiya Sora (for some reason Takahashi Rie sounds like Ten-chan I don't know), this is setting up to be the next romcom that I'll like. Hey, I'm just saying, but you can't stop me liking that ending theme song because Ikimonogakari hehe and it's super duper cute with Rie-chan too<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rewwKmmKctU/WlQ_xp7e8EI/AAAAAAAAkT8/70MW_TmuXg8qJUpLgIQMIcyewbKa8hTzwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisan01_takagi2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Should I photoshop the eraser so it looks like she's lewd?<br>Okay maybe not HAHA I'M DOING IT</table>P.S. Yep, they totally covered it. When Takagi climbed down from the desk out of the curtain. The animation team was trying so hard to make sure this is not rated lol okay there wasn't anything there anyway PRANKED<br>P.P.S. As usual, the way to deal with people who like to prank you (as with Seki-kun too) is to ignore, and take the task at hand seriously ie. pay attention to the lesson, but hey, they're still middle schoolers, so I won't say much haha Nishikata continue to be dumb or else we'll run out of material<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ihzyioXB6Y8/WlrSpajvinI/AAAAAAAAkXY/qjd-Sg_ATl8n4_VvLCvlGcBAv_6bfCbjQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisan01_takagi1edit.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>FIXED IT haha</table><div style=text-align:center><em><span style=font-size:large>OMAKE!!!!</span></em></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=178 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9p0rIiBBh5I/WlRQmKaZQvI/AAAAAAAAkUg/yK_Y320Y-WYSH-JI08moWVBWM3cuxkZcwCLcBGAs/w320-h178/takagisan01_desk.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Man, how did they make this show so wrong haha</table><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=CardcaptorSakuraClearCard01><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>All I want to be in life is to be Tomoyo-chan. No, not the recording of lovey-dovey action of Sakura-chan gaining ultimate monopoly of the footage; I'm talking about being a rich kid haha</div></blockquote>Man, all the memories. Although to be honest, I didn't watch everything of what Cardcaptor Sakura has to offer, so firstly, I'll talk about my experience with the show. This show was probably introduced by my sister (who is of course now, excited for this return) back in 10 years ago, where she also started watching the full three seasons worth of original Anime which was aired some years ago. Haha, feel old yet? And guess that? It's back to (may I quote someone on the Internet) show how shoujo action Anime should be done. (Sorry, Madoka Magica) Okay, my experience is only quite limited but not to whatever you probably know of when watching the first episode - the characters (it took me some time to remember who's that from England), the antics (Tomoyo with the camera for example), the developments (Yue transformation, Sakura and Syouran are a thing now) and everything in between ie. most of the stuff I probably forgot. Still, this brings back much memories. To top that, everything else is exactly the same as before, from animation, sounds (fue~~), to character voices... it's all same. Heck, even Sakamoto Maaya came back for the opening theme song. With all this in line, how can it not bring all the fans - new or old - back to these wonderful times? I may not watch this in full though (I don't think the slow pace of the plot holds up to any extent, which is why I mentioned I don't remember everything), but I'll take note. Considering my sis is also watching this I'll probably hop on the hype train with her, so yeah, no more reviews after this. But hey, welcome back Sakura. I liked Syouran better lol I mean his voice HIS VOICE!! Sakura sounds too high pitched cute imo<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HTAVAmA1tJ8/WlRI4bqJt8I/AAAAAAAAkUM/vru5r-kxrAM-kidoVib09WWzpQMv8vMWgCLcBGAs/s320/sakuraclear01_tomoyo.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>99% of the audience faces look like this when this first episode aired.<br>The other 1% are screaming at the new clothes Sakura-chan will be wearing hehe</table>P.S. I would hope for new characters for this series, but I may be putting my hopes too high. Still, the new generation of voice actors/actresses will be a great addition to this wonderful series. We've only got Hayami Saori on this train so far and she's not even in the cast<br>P.P.S. Good reminder that now with <abbr alternative="" girls="" title="Tachibana Naomi, from Game">my own experience</abbr> I can figure out that <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/2897/Keroberos target=_blank>Kero-chan</a> speaks with a high-pitched Osaka accent. Well then again I started with English dub (I know) so I'm not that familiar with this voice<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=DagashiKashiS201><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Dagashi Kashi 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>I just noticed I'm laughing way too hard at Hotaru running into an entrance. Then I noticed it's the only thing that will (probably) make me laugh hard in this series.</div></blockquote>Okay, not starting this on a sad note, but as you may have noticed, the show's length is cut in half. Then again, same style, so I'll call this show a blessing in disguise. That doesn't mean I won't watch it though because everything so reminiscent is what is still making this a nice series to watch. The first episode (#DagashiKashiS201) brings about the reunion of all four characters onto the table as prelude to the introduction of new characters, I assume. They touch on two chapters of the manga that I already have read but probably forgotten (okay maybe not), but yeah, it's a lot more. A lot more laughs, a lot more subtle jokes (the running entrance is a mystery in itself lol), and a lot more awkward parts. This, I'll look over it. Besides that, you get your usual show albeit with a little more Hotaru fanservice as obviously seen throughout the episode, even the opening theme animation tbh<br><blockquote class=tr_bq style=text-align:center> <b><span style=font-size:large>TOKUBETSU SPECIAL!!!</span></b></blockquote><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qutUXSIzGkY/WlrUR88Ff_I/AAAAAAAAkXo/UvlzngMVWiAY_l97Xty9G18j0acNvhrhQCEwYBhgL/s1600/dagashikashi2_1_hotaru.gif style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Hotaru Orgsam Mode, I call it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br>(I'd rather they just make her pant lol)</table>P.S. I mean, do you seriously see a difference in animation? All I see was just another season of Anime! You guys need to be more positive about the animation studio change, really.<br>P.P.S. For the theme songs, I'll give Ayachi for opening because it's going to be obligatory especially if I decide not to give the ending. That one, I'll see for myself. I may just like it if I listen 11 more times lol<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SlowStart02><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Slow Start</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Secretions"?? I KNEW IT THIS IS AN ECCHI ANIME lol</div></blockquote>In this slice-of-life Anime that I can't stop watching, the new episode (#SlowStart02) brings Hana-chan's past and one of her (many, maybe) weakness which is she is bad at sports. And she lied. Yes, first lie of this series, ladies. (Audience: What about the gentlemen?) And among all these straight jokes I appreciate how this show is going. The pace may still be slow, but I like the feel of the show. Really reminds me of A Channel, just that now we have a cast of nothing but Tooru voices. Okay, maybe not Eiko. And the cousin. But yeah, I guess I can watch this. Let's talk about plot. Hana-chan got ill during the entrance exam period (that is Jan-Feb) so she missed all the exams, but was still able to get into high school, but I guess she has to change in her lifestyle for being too much of a shut-in and worrying about getting friends, among many things in her life right now. Still, she said a lie to her new friends in which she is quickly experiencing the consequences in the recent sports test, and yeah, she's terrible. Terrible if you don't exercise. Terrible not because you're young and can still do that fist clench test. Just like me. Man, I share so many similarities with Hana lol. Anyways, about the others. Kamuri is good at running but way too shy to carry a conversation with others, Eiko is always going to be MVP in this show because of her elder sister "onee-chan" character (see Blend.S for what that means), and Tama-chan is the most lively wife you'd ever want hehe. All in all, I like this show, and even the teacher throws us off every once in a while. (The teacher has cramps lol)<br>P.S. Okay I don't know which Hana-chan expression I should put so I'll put one here and make the other a GIF. Also, not posting girls lovey-dovey stuff here just because I can.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZQ4XzVFZO44/WlrNYytcIoI/AAAAAAAAkW8/ADpjCIBnWaALUmPcIXbBOLI20nMKR8DsACLcBGAs/s320/slowstart02_happy.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Happy stuff, yes?

That's how lone wolf terrorists are made lol</div></blockquote>Hey, it's another episode, so let's talk about it once more, since Hina-chan hints that this might be the end of it all. The new episode (#3Lion35) concludes on the bullying arc (lol) with the head teacher confidently (though unwillingly) sweeping this into a school event, and made sure the class can spill the beans, without all of the "prosecutors" involved. And yeah, it has indeed come to a conclusion. Even though for Megumi? (Yeah I don't remember a**hole names haha) She may have her own problems. But we'll not discuss it here I guess; she's not the main character lol. Anyways, she leaves us something (if you haven't noticed) of how to live in society, and that is not wrong. Many people voice out or even act out their own way to achieve something, whether it's psychologically good or bad for others. But sometimes, it's not within the society to accept those that are bad. So great, people have to intervene. But see for Chiho-chan her case, she can't deal with such things, likely even with help of others. Hina-chan is strong enough to defend against that, but has barely came out alive. Just a good reminder to tell us there's always a part of society that will embrace you for who you are. But seriously, don't do bad things. There is freedom in many bad things you can do that are not illegal, I promise. And also, I want to be happy so I won't do things that are stupid, just so you know. On a lighter side, we see some more interaction with Kiriyama and Hina-chan. I mean, they are 3 years apart only, and they admire each other so much. Can we get something out of this some time? Says the Anime production to the author who is probably still shaking his head right now lol, but yeah,those moments are the best. I totally appreciate how they made sure you can feel what it means to be in this show, be it happiness or sadness or just pure despair. Hey, it's drama, and it's drama done well. Okay, maybe not for the <strike>shafting</strike> sub-par animation quality but still. The theme songs could be better haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2DpBssb9DGI/Wlr20N8cYcI/AAAAAAAAkYI/Tqh8Oopb2Nsu1dc_LvdFTF2GKgrPI7LkQCLcBGAs/s320/sangatsunolion35_sleeping.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>さあ、どうする?ww<br>[So, what will you do (now)? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</table>P.S. You see? Chiho-chan had to resort to being friends with animals! See? (Sorry if I offended any pet owners lol) I mean, "three steps to making friends"? First step: Don't be a jerk. BOOM GOTCHA<br>P.P.S. Production is like "What's better than one cute girl? How about five?" lol I was referring to the cookie baking gathering<br><br>[And I'm NOT going to comment that the petit milady pair (Taketatsu Ayana, Yuuki Aoi) appeared in Pop Team Epic this week. NEVER.]<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>漫画</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Dagashi Kashi</span></div></blockquote>The new chapters (99-100) talk about... very different things, so I'll touch on them individually. The first talks about boobs it seems (sorry Sayashi I'll beat Tou-kun up on your behalf lol), and we still didn't know about the story behind it, or if it had one. Or if whoever thought of the name was sick enough to not use pacifier as part of the name lol. The other, since it's a 100th chapter, brings us back to one of the first chapters Butamen, even though not much has been mentioned, it talks about eating them and using the fork in a customer perspective, which somehow is a good change of view.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=347 data-original-width=653 height=170 src=https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kl3V_4no2L4/WltGezKoINI/AAAAAAAAkYc/aTjafLIzWm0Ezh2C4KdpDxnuS_ZPyiR7QCLcBGAs/s320/dgska99_001.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Can this be an ad? lol</table><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>漫画</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Nagasarete Airantou</span></div></blockquote>Well it's been some time again (the last update I checked was February last year lol), so let's see where we left off, because I do take notes. The new chapters (101-102) conclude on the Beniyasha arc I probably forgot most of them, with the elderly being a nine-tailed fox confronting Ikuto with the two most important people in his life? Sure, but the sister Misaki has a totally different story. Reason she was half-youkai was because her mother was in this island, and Tsurara (the elder's assistant Michiru's mother who lives in the mountains) rarely comes down to the land because she cannot maintain her form that long. After a good summary which makes me more confused as before (so yeah Misaki and Michiru are Tsurara's kids and the elder's grand-kids), there is no doubt that the only human who was never born on this island as of now is still Ikuto haha. The latest chapter (153) talks about the reunion of the mother and daughter, and of course how much difference it makes to be a birth mother. Then again, it's good to hear about Ikuto's family in completion, from the grandfather to the parents, so that's good. The author apparently still has plenty of stories to write, so I'll see how long I can follow this.<br>P.S. Is this the first time I've been touched by one of the manga chapters?? Haha<br>P.P.S. Okay most of the pages are too much upskirt shots so I'm not putting a thumbnail here lol<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span style=font-size:large>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>I've been listening to a couple of releases lately, but haven't been able to give most of them. <b>DENIMS</b> came under the Klassic Note microscope once again because I've given them a chance once already but to no avail, and I doubt anything will happen this time around. Their newest album released in December last year isn't online though, so I may have to wait to see if the newer release is any different. Hmm... what else... oh yeah the <b>new Anime theme songs</b> this season? Sangatsu no Lion probably is giving the most problems as of now because I don't really like either of them; Slow Start is currently at its best because I can take both theme songs; Takagi-san I'll be giving the opening since I don't want to give cover to a song I've given 10 years ago (wow it's been so long I feel old lol), and Dagashi Kashi I fear for the ending because IS THAT RAPPING IN THE VERSES?? Oh well, we shall see about it then. I'm not giving Sumipe's new single (Pop Team Epic opening) that's for sure haha<br><br><br><br>Okay I'm real tired of doing this. Tired as in because of school stating tomorrow and I have to go to school because I have to return a long due library book because I haven't been doing it last week when it did lol, not because this is the final issue haha. Man, I'm full of lame jokes. Cya guys next week then, and until then... don't even post comments online. People assume so much they'd rather trample you than respect you for your personal opinion. In the past I thought I was one of them but now I'm most definitely not. It's not majority anymore; it's universal opinion apparently. Thanks for ruining someone's day, reddit idiots. Also, Pirates series isn't that fantastic.
