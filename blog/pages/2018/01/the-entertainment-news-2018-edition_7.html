I really don'twant my reality to dabble with the wonderfulness of the Anime world hehe<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="YoriMoi01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho</span>  </div></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>I didn't believe in this show at first, but now it has convinced me to want towatch it all just like Kobuchizawa convinced Mari-chan. The first episode(#YoriMoi01) gives context, creates coincidences, and sets the girls on ajourney. We start with first girl Mari, who has goals in life, but never set outto do them. Just in an easy example of skipping school, and she still ended upcoming to school. But in comes next girl Kobuchizawa Shirase who has a reason totravel far away. And this will be the premise of the story, I guess. Of course,it still serves to explore the things behind the characters which is as touchingas it is exciting, and I guess that's what got me hooked as I watched theepisode. Unfortunately, it may just stop there, just like Mari's determinationto leave for a land far away. The opening theme animation gives good insight towhat will happen to this original animation, with many obstacles not andincluding training and awareness as to prepare for the trip, and that, I mightjust be deterred. You see, I'm not much of a travel guy than a guy who isinterested in travel, but then again it's mostly because of money, just likewhat Shirase-san lacks. Still, I believe the storytelling may be more convincingin getting me to continue this journey compared to everything else, but thenagain don't expect a smooth journey. Just like real life, we'll see a lot ofbumps, but we'll also see a lot of stories. Things that will touch us, thingsthat may motivate us, and things that will make us thankful for whatever we havedone. And that, I might just watch. Hey, it's just an Anime. I'm not so easy asMari-chan who just joins a trip to Antarctica and letting the family and herinsurance company (if she is covered) worry about her lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aZFHDLcgNI8/Wk8NnSv38bI/AAAAAAAAkQA/Z2deY6aoTtUrPKByfL4SlFS8pIELjzq-ACLcBGAs/s320/yorimoi01_maki.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Me when I feel bad about stealing someone's stuff lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>I'll see if this holds. I'll probably bail if too much technicality is involved.Otherwise, I might be in for an exciting (Anime) journey of my life. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.S.Biggest problem I have now is surprisingly not all these, but in animation. Thegirls look terrible, in my opinion. If anything is really going to stop me fromcontinuing this show, it's that. No really, feels weird to me tbh<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TojiMiko01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Toji no Miko</span>  </div></blockquote>I'd like to safely say a "no" on this one. Firstly, "special equipment"? Nothanks, sci-fi. I'm okay with that centipede, but no robotic powers, thank you.Secondly, didn't expect it to be a group attack, because one-to-one will be moreawesome anyways, especially without special equipment. Simplicity, ladies andgentlemen. Remember Kekkaishi? I base this a lot on the opening sequence of thefirst episode, just so you know. Lastly, I find myself less interested in thestory at all times, from the defense group to all the sword-fighting terms tothe competition that is happening which had some cliffhanger ending right thereso you guys will continue to watch. But I must say I'm probably not followingthis franchise, considering they are going to make it big. Sorry Kanami-chan(and Hondo Kaede-chan), sorry Juujou-san (and Onishi Saori-chan), sorrysuper-interesting fighting stance and speed boosts (lol), but yeah, I'm going toskip on this one. Not quite what I like to watch, considering I've already seenthe awesomeness that is BLEACH lol. Finally, "what the fuck do you think you'redoing Juujou" shall be my last statement for this show.<br />P.S. Kaede-chan's"uh-woah" is probably the best I've heard this season, and I've watched threeshows already haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="POPTEAMEPIC01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Pop Team Epic</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    WTF did I just watch? And where's the Sumipe opening theme song??  </div></blockquote>Okay I'll do a short summary on this one because I'm MOST DEFINITELY notcontinuing on this series. First things first: this show is not a lie. If youknow who were supposed to sing the theme songs and who the real voices are you'dhave no worries about what is happening on screen. Talking about worries, theshow is nothing but short random jokes, just like how comedy is to be made, butdone in two exactly different ways, taking half of each episode. If I were theproduction I would have killed myself but they didn't. Add in some side storywhich sounds like the main story about an idol group (they went that far to dothis??), and a more palatable second half because we watched the first halfwhich was voiced by the directors probably lol, hey at least this show hasn'tsent me to the mental hospital. Not watching for... more reasons than other. Nowyou know why this show was delayed by one season instead of airing last year.<br />P.S.I still don't know what is happening so don't forgive yourself for not knowingotherwise (&lt;= 100% intentional)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="3Lion34">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Sangatsu no Lion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    I watched the second half with Gramps vs Akari and I'm like "hey when have I    seen this before?" lol man this show haha  </div></blockquote>The new episode for the new season (#3Lion34) makes me watch to punch my PCmonitor as I watch it haha. (And now you know I don't watch in front of the TV)Okay, the story. I guess they are going to do this until Kiriyama gets to fightwith... whoever that silent guy is. Still, really pisses me off that I have towatch another episode of this incident. Hey, kind of important, and if it irksyou the production wins, so unlike the parents' in-depth arguing with eachother, let's just&nbsp; talk briefly about it. The bullying incident ensues andspreads across the class, creating tensions at an all time high. The teacherherself was not able to stand the problems that surface within the class, andcollapsed. Firstly, I would like to blame on the teacher for not being able todeal with the situation, or until it's too late to do so. Easily because mostteachers who are teachers tend to not want to interfere with the affairs of theclass, mostly because they are just paid to teach. Very stereotypical situationover here, but of course, as all would recommend, teachers must actually havethe patience to deal with and understand the class to some extent in order tohelp them out when necessary, and not only service those who approach, much likein Anime Assassination Classroom. (Remember that octopus of an assassin? Okaythat may be extreme case, but) Then, a replacement homeroom teacher arrives. Andbecause he's also head teacher, dealing with bullying shouldn't be too much of aproblem for him. And that brings us to the next point. But instead of picking onseniority for my reasoning, I would like to say the head teacher is right. Ifthere is bullying that whoever is voicing it out will be it. This is made eveneasier when he decides to do one-on-one talks with all the students in theclass, easily means that every other student would have spoken to the teacherabout it then. Hey, problem solved. I guess the only thing I can blame on -which the head teacher also admits - is the dealing with situation at the wrongtime, for example putting the meeting of the two parents at further differenttime period would have been more appropriate. Still, I think we may have aconclusion to this, and don't worry Akari-san, you don't have to deal with thisstuff anymore because it's settled. I hope. Lastly, I would love to praise onthe author for making this a stellar explanation to bullying in school (I hopehe wasn't a victim lol), and making the portrayal of weakness and anxiety to itsbest coupled with the Anime. For the I don't know how many times I'm sayingthis, I'm glad I watched this show.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZvaH2UmJZtk/WlG-Xbbz7BI/AAAAAAAAkQ4/xLFXJaOES-sditf9_vdmNbnxx2Vlgb7dQCLcBGAs/s320/sangatsunolion34_hikari.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        And here's an anxiety-free image from the episode.<br />(Oh sh*t it        triggered the theft incident? Sorry)      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. And boy am I glad to have given one of UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's songs lastyear to not throw up on the opening theme song ugh haha oh we're done with PopTeam Epic already? The ending sounded better though, even though I couldn'tcatch the beats somehow<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SlowStart01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Slow Start</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Oh so you're good with your hands, I hear? lol okay that's as far as I will    go&nbsp;  </div></blockquote>I wouldn't say this show is out to a slow start, but this show has plenty tooffer to be the next slice-of-life Anime, but I'm not sure I'm that into itthough. Let's talk plot. Ichinose Hana (since she said her full name again atthe end) is up to a new school life. Somewhere unfamiliar, living alone(technically), and not fast enough to make friends. I mean, if you're likefriendly and open Tama-chan you wouldn't have problems. Or if you're theshortest student who probably hasn't grown much since then, or if you're such aonee-san type people will remember your kindness, you're sure to leave animpression on the first day of school. Sadly, Hana-chan is none of them. She isshy, she is nervous, but she got lucky. It's her birthday on the first day ofschool. And guess what? With that luck she got recognised by the class, or moreimportantly, by the trio. The show has good subtle jokes too which makes theshow more entertaining than your usual genre, so that's good. I'm worried abouthow much that might affect me though, as the detail and jokes kind of fall offeven on the first episode. (Remember the meatballs joke? I don't even if Iunderstood) Talking about names probably is the most boring thing that canhappen, but details is what makes this show special too. Little do I encounter ashow where the first episode (#SlowStart01) is just Day One. Goddamn, if onlythey had more of these to share. So I'll be thinking about it for now. Nopromises because I cannot stand the voices of the newbie voice actors which makeme feel like I'm watching a magical girl Anime for some reason lol, but otherthan that I see this as a good change to a show like A Channel. And that, I maynot mind. Man, when are they adding more guys in these kinds of shows?<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Al_rf017hs/WlHHV1BVkZI/AAAAAAAAkRI/f6Ww4ePMISQ9lYDqBbGG-DOvvEw8P5tIwCLcBGAs/s320/slowstart01_present.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        When you know they are giving out freebies on the streets and you got        three already lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Referring to the thumbnail above, when Hana-chan received a present fromher cousin on the birthday dinner I'm like "FINALLY a proper present for mybirthday" lol (I'm secretly liking the "going home with you because we gave ourgood luck charms to the birthday girl" pick up line though haha *writesdown*)<br />P.P.S. I may not favour the opening theme, but if I were to watchthis Sangatsu no Phantasia has got my back. Thanks, Mia-san. *censored eyes,thumbs up* (&lt;= Works too when referring to how Hana-chan looks in her schooluniform lol)<br />[I am trying VERY HARD to not mention the boobs jiggleincluding audio cues in this show I just hope it doesn't happen often it'sirritating as heck]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi</span>  </div></blockquote>The new chapter (98) brings us back to a recollection, where sports days mustcome with bentos? Sure, something I definitely don't know after years ofwatching Anime lol, but hey, turns out the father did terrible stuff. I mean,it's really mean to put dagashi in your bento, yes? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Still, I like howKokonotsu likes Sayashi's bento, because that just proves someone here's a goodhousewife hehe. Still, the one time dagashi had to still appear because it wasregarded as a dessert, not that it must be everything of a bento. I reallywonder if You-san just likes dagashi or is a screw loose haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="411"          data-original-width="313"          height="200"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kAvUdY8RUcw/WlIQ_Xz0WJI/AAAAAAAAkSY/31LQpIRn6io9eC-vCDZe_KcJllKAKEVCwCLcBGAs/s200/dgska98_007.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="151"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        If you didn't miss kid Sayashi I did hehe      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KurokamiNoOtome01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Yoru wa Mijikashi, Aruke yo Otome</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">[(The) Night Is Short, Walk On Girl]</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    And the least I'd expect is to hear Kana-chan speak fast. Hey, welcome to    the Morimi Torihiko world, ladies and gentlemen.  </blockquote></div>Oh damn am I exited to jump into this same world as Anime Yojouhan ShinwaTaikei. And boy was it an amazing production. I swear, it brings back memories,and then some. I find myself enjoying this movie to the fullest, all wrapped upin a story that happens in a single night.<br /><br />Let's talk about story fora bit, because unlike the Anime, this movie "actually as a plot here". Plot goesthat the senpai (main guy) was finding a way to be with the girl he likes, thegirl with the black hair (main girl). And so, in her night of craze besidessticking by a normal wedding night, she starts a tour of the city and getsinvolved in everything she is in. The thing is, she finds amazement ineverything she does, never leaving regret behind otherwise not drawn by fate.But she forgot something. That fate can be created. By someone. Who has anintention. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but hey, what's wrong with chasing agirl?<br /><br />This show summarises my life so well, I don't even know how tocomment. (Okay, besides the drinking, the hotplate deathmatch, and I had someoneto love in university haha) Firstly, let's talk about production. This wonderfulmovie is done in the exact same way as the Anime I've seen five years ago, andboy am I glad to have watched that screw up of a show. But then, it left animpression I wasn't able to forget, and a lesson I'll always remember. (Be sureto watch that first before watching this) Cue in the announcement for this movieto be done in the exact same way but featuring a different story written by thesame author, my anticipation for this went to an all time high. Featuring somefamiliar voices (Hanazawa Kana *chu*, Kamiya Hiroshi who also is very similar inpopularity to his acting character lol), I can't wait for this to come out. AndI'm not disappointed. Watching this type of animation is like going on ajourney, and I might say, comparable to Studio Ghibli movies. Add in a nicetouch of unexpected musical format to keep the format short yet eventful(because they don't have 11 episodes to do never-ending speeches like lasttime), the journey was fun. Just like the girl with the black hair, we had movedforward consistently without having to worry about devotion and just to enjoylife to the fullest. And that is its beauty.<br /><br />Then, there's thereferences. I don't know about old songs which the musical might have adaptedfrom to tell the story in the guerrilla theatre, the show is FULL of Yojouhanreferences. From familiar faces (Higuchi, the chairman, Jougasaki lol) to evenmore familiar scenarios depicted from speech to visuals (lol boob wall), becausethis was adapted from a similar environment which is the university that themain guy of the Yojouhan Anime was from, I felt right at home the moment itstarted. I was mostly laughing because I've became the target of the many jokesfrom the very familiar yet ironic references in the movie, I can only butlaugh.<br /><br />Finally, the pace. In this types of animation, mostappreciated and the most underappreciated must be its pace. It's so fast, youthought the night wind in the movie that was giving everyone the colds (I mean,it's technically a typhoon) was blowing faster than the plot. And then they evenreminded you with it in various ways, from the clocks/watches of the elderlyrunning faster than the young main characters (reflection of society btw) to howall this happens in one night (if you didn't catch it the main girl said it invisit to Rihaku's house when he was ill) to Johnny's appearance in the senpaicausing in an emergency, and despite all that, it did not miss on storytelling.I can guarantee you that after watching this, it's either you get all of it oryou get none of it. Well, it may be because of the references, but still. It's ahell of a ride of freedom. And it all makes sense from a book ownershipperspective, just like how the God of Used Books has desired. Now we can allrest well, knowing we've yet witnessed another wonderful romance tale that willnever exist in our bland, empty and meaningless lives, just like the Fake DenkiBran hehe. Hey, at least these guys made me laugh for 2 hours. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Now Iwished I had paid to watch this movie when it aired<strike>March</strike>&nbsp;April last year. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> Also, I think I found theperfect woman to teach me to enjoy cocktails. I've watched that Anime Bartenderand always wanted a drinking buddy hehe<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="900"          data-original-width="1600"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jV4SnxOIbLM/WlHkOxygMmI/AAAAAAAAkRg/4KEKtjMVpkkYU3CmXx4lUgOusB4fqRRGgCLcBGAs/s320/mijikashiotome_hand.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Haha I let my inner Johnny choose the thumbnail lol<br />(Also, if you        can take this image, the show is perfectly adult-friendly hehe)      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Thanks production for the summary. Otherwise, I'll be the latter audienceeven up till now and probably have to watch back the footage just to remindmyself what happened lol. Also, thanks Ajikan for the theme song. Ends the movieperfectly.<br />P.P.S. Once again, I've enjoyed being in another fictionalworld. Hey, to all authors out there? If you can create one fictional world inyour life and everyone likes it, keep doing it. (think J.K.Rowling) Becausethere's never a better way to do fiction than to re-use that wonderful world andtell a thousand stories on it.

I gave songs fromCoalamode (their latest single) and GLIM SPANKY (thanks One Piece not) maybe tostart Klassic Note this year which is actually from next week, so all songs ofthe day are void and not committed to Twitter as of now. I've heard some themesongs from the Anime I watched this week, and I can see some of them coming into the list in the near future. Other than that, I guess I'll take more time togive other artists I've given this year as an update, maybe Frederic, as much asI don't want to because it's all their beats or whatever haha<br /><br /><br /><br />Thisis it then. I've thought of writing that draft I created years ago on BLEACHuniverse now that the manga has ended (even though it'll require some tweakingbecause things have changed), but nah probably not I better get started on myschool project soon. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully, I'll be sadder thanI am now. Haha goodbye.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
