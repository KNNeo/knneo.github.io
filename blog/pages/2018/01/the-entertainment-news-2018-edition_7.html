Hey, I did say I was taking a break, and so I did. <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span> I'm so in trouble for
my final year project...<br /><br />Anyways, let's get to it. I really don't
want my reality to dabble with the wonderfulness of the Anime world hehe<br /><br /><br /><br />

I didn't believe in this show at first, but now it has convinced me to want to
watch it all just like Kobuchizawa convinced Mari-chan. The first episode
(#YoriMoi01) gives context, creates coincidences, and sets the girls on a
journey. We start with first girl Mari, who has goals in life, but never set out
to do them. Just in an easy example of skipping school, and she still ended up
coming to school. But in comes next girl Kobuchizawa Shirase who has a reason to
travel far away. And this will be the premise of the story, I guess. Of course,
it still serves to explore the things behind the characters which is as touching
as it is exciting, and I guess that's what got me hooked as I watched the
episode. Unfortunately, it may just stop there, just like Mari's determination
to leave for a land far away. The opening theme animation gives good insight to
what will happen to this original animation, with many obstacles not and
including training and awareness as to prepare for the trip, and that, I might
just be deterred. You see, I'm not much of a travel guy than a guy who is
interested in travel, but then again it's mostly because of money, just like
what Shirase-san lacks. Still, I believe the storytelling may be more convincing
in getting me to continue this journey compared to everything else, but then
again don't expect a smooth journey. Just like real life, we'll see a lot of
bumps, but we'll also see a lot of stories. Things that will touch us, things
that may motivate us, and things that will make us thankful for whatever we have
done. And that, I might just watch. Hey, it's just an Anime. I'm not so easy as
Mari-chan who just joins a trip to Antarctica and letting the family and her
insurance company (if she is covered) worry about her lol<br />

I'll see if this holds. I'll probably bail if too much technicality is involved.
Otherwise, I might be in for an exciting (Anime) journey of my life. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />P.S.
Biggest problem I have now is surprisingly not all these, but in animation. The
girls look terrible, in my opinion. If anything is really going to stop me from
continuing this show, it's that. No really, feels weird to me tbh<br /><br />

I'd like to safely say a "no" on this one. Firstly, "special equipment"? No
thanks, sci-fi. I'm okay with that centipede, but no robotic powers, thank you.
Secondly, didn't expect it to be a group attack, because one-to-one will be more
awesome anyways, especially without special equipment. Simplicity, ladies and
gentlemen. Remember Kekkaishi? I base this a lot on the opening sequence of the
first episode, just so you know. Lastly, I find myself less interested in the
story at all times, from the defense group to all the sword-fighting terms to
the competition that is happening which had some cliffhanger ending right there
so you guys will continue to watch. But I must say I'm probably not following
this franchise, considering they are going to make it big. Sorry Kanami-chan
(and Hondo Kaede-chan), sorry Juujou-san (and Onishi Saori-chan), sorry
super-interesting fighting stance and speed boosts (lol), but yeah, I'm going to
skip on this one. Not quite what I like to watch, considering I've already seen
the awesomeness that is BLEACH lol. Finally, "what the fuck do you think you're
doing Juujou" shall be my last statement for this show.<br />P.S. Kaede-chan's
"uh-woah" is probably the best I've heard this season, and I've watched three
shows already haha<br /><br />

</blockquote>
Okay I'll do a short summary on this one because I'm MOST DEFINITELY not
continuing on this series. First things first: this show is not a lie. If you
know who were supposed to sing the theme songs and who the real voices are you'd
have no worries about what is happening on screen. Talking about worries, the
show is nothing but short random jokes, just like how comedy is to be made, but
done in two exactly different ways, taking half of each episode. If I were the
production I would have killed myself but they didn't. Add in some side story
which sounds like the main story about an idol group (they went that far to do
this??), and a more palatable second half because we watched the first half
which was voiced by the directors probably lol, hey at least this show hasn't
sent me to the mental hospital. Not watching for... more reasons than other. Now
you know why this show was delayed by one season instead of airing last year.<br />P.S.
I still don't know what is happening so don't forgive yourself for not knowing
otherwise (&lt;= 100% intentional)<br /><br />

    I watched the second half with Gramps vs Akari and I'm like "hey when have I

  </div>
</blockquote>
The new episode for the new season (#3Lion34) makes me watch to punch my PC
monitor as I watch it haha. (And now you know I don't watch in front of the TV)
Okay, the story. I guess they are going to do this until Kiriyama gets to fight
with... whoever that silent guy is. Still, really pisses me off that I have to
watch another episode of this incident. Hey, kind of important, and if it irks
you the production wins, so unlike the parents' in-depth arguing with each
other, let's just&nbsp; talk briefly about it. The bullying incident ensues and
spreads across the class, creating tensions at an all time high. The teacher
herself was not able to stand the problems that surface within the class, and
collapsed. Firstly, I would like to blame on the teacher for not being able to
deal with the situation, or until it's too late to do so. Easily because most
teachers who are teachers tend to not want to interfere with the affairs of the
class, mostly because they are just paid to teach. Very stereotypical situation
over here, but of course, as all would recommend, teachers must actually have
the patience to deal with and understand the class to some extent in order to
help them out when necessary, and not only service those who approach, much like
in Anime Assassination Classroom. (Remember that octopus of an assassin? Okay
that may be extreme case, but) Then, a replacement homeroom teacher arrives. And
because he's also head teacher, dealing with bullying shouldn't be too much of a
problem for him. And that brings us to the next point. But instead of picking on
seniority for my reasoning, I would like to say the head teacher is right. If
there is bullying that whoever is voicing it out will be it. This is made even
easier when he decides to do one-on-one talks with all the students in the
class, easily means that every other student would have spoken to the teacher
about it then. Hey, problem solved. I guess the only thing I can blame on -
which the head teacher also admits - is the dealing with situation at the wrong
time, for example putting the meeting of the two parents at further different
time period would have been more appropriate. Still, I think we may have a
conclusion to this, and don't worry Akari-san, you don't have to deal with this
stuff anymore because it's settled. I hope. Lastly, I would love to praise on
the author for making this a stellar explanation to bullying in school (I hope
he wasn't a victim lol), and making the portrayal of weakness and anxiety to its
best coupled with the Anime. For the I don't know how many times I'm saying
this, I'm glad I watched this show.<br />

I wouldn't say this show is out to a slow start, but this show has plenty to
offer to be the next slice-of-life Anime, but I'm not sure I'm that into it
though. Let's talk plot. Ichinose Hana (since she said her full name again at
the end) is up to a new school life. Somewhere unfamiliar, living alone
(technically), and not fast enough to make friends. I mean, if you're like
friendly and open Tama-chan you wouldn't have problems. Or if you're the
shortest student who probably hasn't grown much since then, or if you're such a
onee-san type people will remember your kindness, you're sure to leave an
impression on the first day of school. Sadly, Hana-chan is none of them. She is
shy, she is nervous, but she got lucky. It's her birthday on the first day of
school. And guess what? With that luck she got recognised by the class, or more
importantly, by the trio. The show has good subtle jokes too which makes the
show more entertaining than your usual genre, so that's good. I'm worried about
how much that might affect me though, as the detail and jokes kind of fall off
even on the first episode. (Remember the meatballs joke? I don't even if I
understood) Talking about names probably is the most boring thing that can
happen, but details is what makes this show special too. Little do I encounter a
show where the first episode (#SlowStart01) is just Day One. Goddamn, if only
they had more of these to share. So I'll be thinking about it for now. No
promises because I cannot stand the voices of the newbie voice actors which make
me feel like I'm watching a magical girl Anime for some reason lol, but other
than that I see this as a good change to a show like A Channel. And that, I may
not mind. Man, when are they adding more guys in these kinds of shows?

P.S. Referring to the thumbnail above, when Hana-chan received a present from
her cousin on the birthday dinner I'm like "FINALLY a proper present for my
birthday" lol (I'm secretly liking the "going home with you because we gave our
good luck charms to the birthday girl" pick up line though haha *writes
down*)<br />P.P.S. I may not favour the opening theme, but if I were to watch
this Sangatsu no Phantasia has got my back. Thanks, Mia-san. *censored eyes,
thumbs up* (&lt;= Works too when referring to how Hana-chan looks in her school
uniform lol)<br />[I am trying VERY HARD to not mention the boobs jiggle

The new chapter (98) brings us back to a recollection, where sports days must

watching Anime lol, but hey, turns out the father did terrible stuff. I mean,
it's really mean to put dagashi in your bento, yes? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Still, I like how
Kokonotsu likes Sayashi's bento, because that just proves someone here's a good

regarded as a dessert, not that it must be everything of a bento. I really
wonder if You-san just likes dagashi or is a screw loose haha<br />

Oh damn am I exited to jump into this same world as Anime Yojouhan Shinwa
Taikei. And boy was it an amazing production. I swear, it brings back memories,
and then some. I find myself enjoying this movie to the fullest, all wrapped up
in a story that happens in a single night.<br /><br />Let's talk about story for
a bit, because unlike the Anime, this movie "actually as a plot here". Plot goes
that the senpai (main guy) was finding a way to be with the girl he likes, the
girl with the black hair (main girl). And so, in her night of craze besides
sticking by a normal wedding night, she starts a tour of the city and gets
involved in everything she is in. The thing is, she finds amazement in
everything she does, never leaving regret behind otherwise not drawn by fate.
But she forgot something. That fate can be created. By someone. Who has an
intention. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but hey, what's wrong with chasing a
girl?<br /><br />This show summarises my life so well, I don't even know how to
comment. (Okay, besides the drinking, the hotplate deathmatch, and I had someone
to love in university haha) Firstly, let's talk about production. This wonderful
movie is done in the exact same way as the Anime I've seen five years ago, and
boy am I glad to have watched that screw up of a show. But then, it left an
impression I wasn't able to forget, and a lesson I'll always remember. (Be sure
to watch that first before watching this) Cue in the announcement for this movie
to be done in the exact same way but featuring a different story written by the
same author, my anticipation for this went to an all time high. Featuring some
familiar voices (Hanazawa Kana *chu*, Kamiya Hiroshi who also is very similar in
popularity to his acting character lol), I can't wait for this to come out. And
I'm not disappointed. Watching this type of animation is like going on a
journey, and I might say, comparable to Studio Ghibli movies. Add in a nice
touch of unexpected musical format to keep the format short yet eventful
(because they don't have 11 episodes to do never-ending speeches like last
time), the journey was fun. Just like the girl with the black hair, we had moved
forward consistently without having to worry about devotion and just to enjoy
life to the fullest. And that is its beauty.<br /><br />Then, there's the
references. I don't know about old songs which the musical might have adapted
from to tell the story in the guerrilla theatre, the show is FULL of Yojouhan
references. From familiar faces (Higuchi, the chairman, Jougasaki lol) to even
more familiar scenarios depicted from speech to visuals (lol boob wall), because
this was adapted from a similar environment which is the university that the
main guy of the Yojouhan Anime was from, I felt right at home the moment it
started. I was mostly laughing because I've became the target of the many jokes
from the very familiar yet ironic references in the movie, I can only but
laugh.<br /><br />Finally, the pace. In this types of animation, most
appreciated and the most underappreciated must be its pace. It's so fast, you
thought the night wind in the movie that was giving everyone the colds (I mean,
it's technically a typhoon) was blowing faster than the plot. And then they even
reminded you with it in various ways, from the clocks/watches of the elderly
running faster than the young main characters (reflection of society btw) to how
all this happens in one night (if you didn't catch it the main girl said it in
visit to Rihaku's house when he was ill) to Johnny's appearance in the senpai
causing in an emergency, and despite all that, it did not miss on storytelling.
I can guarantee you that after watching this, it's either you get all of it or
you get none of it. Well, it may be because of the references, but still. It's a
hell of a ride of freedom. And it all makes sense from a book ownership
perspective, just like how the God of Used Books has desired. Now we can all
rest well, knowing we've yet witnessed another wonderful romance tale that will
never exist in our bland, empty and meaningless lives, just like the Fake Denki
Bran hehe. Hey, at least these guys made me laugh for 2 hours. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Now I
wished I had paid to watch this movie when it aired
<strike>March</strike>&nbsp;April last year. <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span> Also, I think I found the
perfect woman to teach me to enjoy cocktails. I've watched that Anime Bartender
and always wanted a drinking buddy hehe<br />

P.S. Thanks production for the summary. Otherwise, I'll be the latter audience
even up till now and probably have to watch back the footage just to remind
myself what happened lol. Also, thanks Ajikan for the theme song. Ends the movie
perfectly.<br />P.P.S. Once again, I've enjoyed being in another fictional
world. Hey, to all authors out there? If you can create one fictional world in
your life and everyone likes it, keep doing it. (think J.K.Rowling) Because
there's never a better way to do fiction than to re-use that wonderful world and
tell a thousand stories on it. I'm not talking about you though Disney; Don't
get the wrong idea haha<br />

I'll talk about briefly what I did, like many other things I said I will talk
about briefly above and still it's a heck of a paragraph lol. I gave songs from
Coalamode (their latest single) and GLIM SPANKY (thanks One Piece not) maybe to
start Klassic Note this year which is actually from next week, so all songs of
the day are void and not committed to Twitter as of now. I've heard some theme
songs from the Anime I watched this week, and I can see some of them coming in
to the list in the near future. Other than that, I guess I'll take more time to
give other artists I've given this year as an update, maybe Frederic, as much as
I don't want to because it's all their beats or whatever haha<br /><br /><br /><br />This
is it then. I've thought of writing that draft I created years ago on BLEACH
universe now that the manga has ended (even though it'll require some tweaking
because things have changed), but nah probably not I better get started on my
school project soon. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully, I'll be sadder than
I am now. Haha goodbye.
