Wow, what a week. Of nothing. Well, I meant here by the way. Don't ask me about
work haha<br /><br />Oh and tomorrow will still have Anime to watch, so don't
freak out if this page got real short all of a sudden. Well it won't be because
as you can scroll down and see I'm talking about all of them from this season.
So be sure to check that out.<br /><br />Okay let's do this I almost forgot to
do this because I was playing so much DOAXVV I even got myself an auto clicker
but then I can't do this when it "works" lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Yes, I have thought about doing this for some time because I read back and
noticed what I mentioned at the start of the season wasn't very smart of me
until I regretted watching them, among all other reasons. So, I'm here to
technically mock myself of what I said at the start of the season (and each
season from here on) but also talk about what was good on the stuff that I
watched. This is by means no ranking though; if I chose to watch a show it's
already good. Exceptions do apply though, so we can talk about those. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span>
Let's start.<br /><br />I'll not talk about BANANA FISH since it hasn't ended
yet, but so far it's pretty accurate actually, from my initial guess. I'll also
not talk about the other two shows from tomorrow because they have not been
mentioned here.<br /><br />This is a full quote (WITH MY OPINIONS) from three
months ago in
<a href="../../2018/07/the-entertainment-news-2018-edition.html"  >Entertainment News #26</a
>:<br />
<hr />
(Opinions on my) Opinions on the new season of Anime:<br />
<ul> <li>  BANANA FISH (airs 5th July): Not interested in plot (it's like L.A.Noire but  with heavier context in war so... no) </li> <span class="popup"  ><span class="normal" ><li>  Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro (airs 6th July): It's Naomi-chan's next big role  (unless you watched her 2014 romance Anime) as a main character and the  story is totally a joke, and Random Curiosity wrote as fun to watch  since it describes the life of something you'll never do which is going  to school without getting distracted lmao </li></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0;" ><div  style="width: 100%; animation: none; background-color: #444444; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px; word-wrap: break-word;" >  Thanks Naomi-chan because <b>Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</b> was awesome.  Well, apart from the sticking it up your butt and kabbadi references I  think it's real entertaining haha sorry Andou (Mayumi) for being  discriminated in a female-dominant show also that homeless Sensei haha </div></span  ></span ><span class="popup"  ><span class="normal" ><li>  Hataraku Saibou (airs 7th July): I may just watch 1st episode to see how  heavy in technical knowledge it gets (as long as they describe things  I'm fine, but explain further then please make it short), the plot seems  interesting anyways (lol cancer bacteria), there's Kana-chan in a main  role again... we'll see haha </li></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0;" ><div  style="width: 100%; animation: none; background-color: #444444; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px; word-wrap: break-word;" >  Sorry <b>Hataraku Saibou</b> you only got cute stuff and lame jokes I  can't put up with a biology class every week, as expected. Also, cheesy  motivational stories are not my thing. </div></span  ></span ><span class="popup"  ><span class="normal" ><li>  Asobi Asobase (airs 8th July): It's Aho Girl stupid but with all kinds  of games I assume, I may not get used to the animation so I'll have a  test of 1st episode to see if I can forgive it, but otherwise you've got  a cast of very new female voice actresses, so I'll remember this based  on my first impression of the promotional video because it made me crack  lmao </li></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0;" ><div  style="width: 100%; animation: none; background-color: #444444; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px; word-wrap: break-word;" >  Well... Aho Girl has got nothing on <b>Asobi Asobase</b> mainly because  it's middle schoolers talking about mostly sex which is super  entertaining (and still less dirty than that banana-loving idiot lol)  but also, features three attractive characters. For Aho Girl the class  chairperson is the only one I think has some body and isn't stupid haha  (Audience: ËèØÂ≠ê„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„ÅØ?) Who? <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> </div></span  ></span ><span class="popup"  ><span class="normal" ><li>  Jashin-chan Dropkick (airs 9th July): Random Curiosity relates the show  to Anime like "Binbougami ga!" and "Gabriel Dropout" (which I did not  watch the latter), the promotional content did not reveal much of the  plot, but the animation looks good and it's just one of those  I-can't-get-back-to-my-world-so-let-me-stay-in-your-human-house-for-now  stories, so... I'll give a chance based on my mood and considering  Gabriel Dropout got so much attention over the past few years (I'm  saying based on Reddit experience haha) </li></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0;" ><div  style="width: 100%; animation: none; background-color: #444444; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px; word-wrap: break-word;" >  Nope, didn't watch <b>Jashin-chan Dropkick</b>. Didn't even bother to  watch one episode of it. And as expected, the content was real crazy. I  mean, I probably would laugh at it, but I'll have a hard time giving  theme songs. Well, I had a hard time giving Asobi Asobase too but, for  this I had a choice haha also too many shows liao </div></span  ></span >
</ul>
<hr />
...<br /><br />I guess I'll talk about Tsukumogami next time? Or maybe right
when it ends? I really forgot about that one it's ending in... two weeks? Oh
this week's episode is also postponed? Man, typhoon can make a lot of things not
work according to plan...<br /><br /><b >NOTE: THERE WON'T BE AN ISSUE OF ANIME EXTRA TOMORROW</b
><br /><br />I know I'm going to regret my initial opinions from last week's
season preview already because I'm to going to have to critique on it at the end
of this year lol #NextSeasonProblems<br /><br />

"And that is how your sister got her driver's license" is what I would like to
use to summarise this new chapter (108) but hey, Keiko did it. She allowed her
sister to come fetch her. Not in a vehicle she didn't, but isn't it great to be
able to go home with your sibling? (Never tried that before though so I can't
relate) (Or even recommend) (I'm dumb lol) You know, what's wrong with siblings
going home together? I must say though, these small things are what makes life
great. And it's most definitely not your sis being more attractive than you,
dumber than you, or just plain ignorant compared to you. At least you two are
similar (*stops to go watch the one OVA episode Keiko starred in*), and maybe
because of your sis you'll finally get laid. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span>

Keiko-chan; you'll be successful one day without your sister haha wait she is
already lol<br />

This week is mostly on YUKI. Sorry guys, didn't have that much time to listen to
new songs, but a new week is dawning and I'm desperate, so that's good news
before the releases next week which we'll talk about later. Firstly,
<b>YUKI's 15th anniversary album</b> introduces 15 songs (I don't know if it's
one per year but I don't think so) and... I got interested in two. Also,
surprising that they are from the past 5 years so I must have been missing out
tbh. I also took some time to listen to
<b ><a  href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%8B%E3%82%B8%E3%83%9F%E3%82%AB%E3%83%85%E3%82%AD/1349673319?l=en"  target="_blank"  >Tsuzuri Zukuri's album from last year</a ></b
>
apparently they released one and I only listen to them a year later lol, and...
I think I can give a song or two. We shall see.
<b ><a  href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BA-%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BA-single/1536465388?l=en"  target="_blank"  >ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</a ></b
>
was quite a disappointment to be honest so I'm not giving it, and I also got a
listen to some rock festivals and
<b ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ad4NsEy1tg" target="_blank"  >"Polkadot Stingray"</a ></b
>
and
<b ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoAZtHUGVlM" target="_blank"  >"SHE'S"</a ></b
>
caught my attention so I'll be doing a little research (again, the appearance of
women in the music video is a coincidence) about them next week. Both available
on Apple Music Japan by the way, in case you need to know.<br /><br />Next week
brings us finally, <b>Asakura Momo's 1st album</b> since her debut since she
debutted two years ago, and I can't wait what <strike>leftover</strike> new
compositions they have given for this lovely girl to sing hehe.
<b>YOSHIKI's new single</b> which was the theme song for Anime "Attack on Titan"
after getting much media attention is also getting released next week, so I'll
have a listen to that to see if this guy is any better than Linked Horizon. I
expect, it will be a flop. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span><br /><br />In Twitter news, I missed that
<b ><a  href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1045912407728545792"  target="_blank"  >Scenarioart live YouTube stream</a ></b
>
which I told myself to watch but I was here lol <span class="emoji" title="üò¢">*sob*</span> (that tracklist too,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1046396935421100034" target="_blank" >so many good songs</a
>...),
<b ><a  href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1045238045564272641"  target="_blank"  >GLIM SPANKY is releasing a new album</a ></b
>
end of the year, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/fumika_tweet/status/1045146678783664128" target="_blank" ><b>fumika is releasing a new cover album</b></a
>
considering she has been singing cover songs for the past 6 months. So yeah,
this versus Yoshioka Kiyoe? You know I hate to give cover songs haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I
shall stop here; the weather today is really hot for some reason. Has been like
that for the weekend for some reason. I should be glad I didn't have Anime to
watch this week because the amount of content I need to edit on this is CRAZY
but really did you guys see every single one of them? Cool, huh? I always
thought of how this place can be more interactive, and creating a flexible frame
is just a small step in the right direction. Hey, I'm no web coder but I try.
Probably have to iron some stuff out when I have free time at work next week but
this will do haha. But seriously, WAY easier to just type stuff and not link to
everything I mention, but hey, I liked doing this so... Cya guys next week then,
and hopefully until then that single which was delayed shipment will come so I
can talk about King Gnu then haha <span class="emoji" title="üò©">*sigh*</span>
