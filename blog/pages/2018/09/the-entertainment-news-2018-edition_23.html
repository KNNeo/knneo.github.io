Either I'm going to read Japanese manga raw or I'll just have to spend weeks
going through current translated serialisations of manga in order to get more
weekly updates? Sorry guys, that's not going to happen I have a day job now
haha<br /><br />Hey guys. Now I really regret not making myself busy enough such
that if I want to play a simulation game over the weekend I only have... well
just an afternoon to play. That's about 4 hours. The rest went into those two
games that I have to play or else the events will end lol why<br /><br />Well
let's begin I need to talk about how many new songs I've listened to this week
haha #sarcasm<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

This show is becoming one of those where there is the big boss having a mistress
he found on the streets while he goes out and orders people to kill so he can
take over the world. And it's not even a mistress too. Heck, Ash is becoming the
new Golzine lmao. The new episode (#BANANAFISH12) ends the honeymoon period of
this series we're going to get a second cour of, so that's fun. First things
first: Arthur and Ash haven't fought. It's all the proxy war thing where Ash
just swiftly takes over all the gangs in downtown and making sure the rest don't
interfere, for example, gangs who want nothing from both of them. Instead, they
pretty much become spies for Ash, so Arthur is at the losing side at this point.
Well, besides having all the power Golzine has in New York, and even then the
old man himself may not be in a good state. Not physical state because he's so
healthy after banging all the boys lol, but yeah, mentally he's probably not
feeling so good. On the other side, the truth may have been discovered to be a
larger conspiracy than before, that Golzine is practically a pawn in the bigger
state of things involving the government of the US, Middle East, and everything
else money can influence the world. So yeah, money is everything in this show
apparently. Well, unless you're Ash and can't say farewell enough to Eiji even
though you're the one sending him away, knowing FULL WELL you'll not be able to
even buy this friendship back, has to go settle his own affairs once and for
all. Ash is real deep in this worldwide conspiracy involving the drug, and it's
only going to get more crazy. I really wonder what is up next for now besides
Arthur's confrontation and that sweet, sweet revenge. I hope there's enough plot
twists to make me excited because this cold war drama period is killing me
haha<br />

P.S. "I'm becoming a murderer" I mean Ash, you're not doing most of it though
lol<br />P.P.S. Yeah the first one Ash probably did not get to save was that
girl someone thought was his girlfriend, I guess. The second one was probably
Shorter, so... who's next? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />

    MANANA-CHAN NO TSUUGAKURO CONFIRMED haha no really why are we sticking with
    Chio-chan for the story up till now? lol
  </div>
</blockquote>
And... we're finally at the end. Man, I wish we'll be able to get that last
chapter of the manga animated, but hey, just watch episode 1 but imagine Manana
in it haha. The final episode (#ChioChan12) of this crazy series of happenings
gives us a little more than what we wanted, which isn't bad until you notice
they've gone too far once again. Wait, isn't it for all the episodes in the
series what am I saying? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Firstly, Chiharu found out a lot of things.
Where Chio-chan lives, and that she is totally unlikely the girl her brother
likes. (Oh man, she doesn't know) Well, we found out a lot of other things, like
how smart she is, eh... that's it actually. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> On the other hand, we may
have found out how dumb Chio-chan was at solving a problem although I would take
pity on her because if I were her I'll probably end up the same fate. We're all
not smart or lucky like Manana standing on a line anyways so whatever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
Then again, I would like to remind whoever reads this that it sucks to be
average because you won't be looked up to or be taken care of, which is actually
the worst. So yeah, I'm glad Chio-chan is below average and not just average
lol. And the second part gives us the best thing we can ever hope for in this
series which I hope if from the original work: no-pan. An abbreviation for not
wearing panties (typically in public), these girls have taken it to such an
extent, I wished I was born in the Hosokawa family. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (So if I marry into
the family do I have to walk around the house naked??) (Man, it's all the
sagging too besides Yuki-chan maybe haha) So yeah, she wasn't wearing anything
down there, it's all white overlays for the whole scene until Manana wanted to
join in the fun before she got found out lying, and then Chio-chan felt lonely,
and then Kushitori-senpai wanted to play Kabaddi. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> No really, not a good
time to do this, but hey, they kind of got away with that. I mean, you'll feel
it once... everything else happens because... okay I lied I know nothing about
that I'm not even female lol someone pay the fine for Yuki-chan's potential
streak act in the future please. Lastly, the animation production gave us two
things that we wished was in every series: random stuff, and NGs. Wait, what?
"How does the latter happen?", you say. I mean, it's not hard making weird cuts
to stuff which probably should've happened otherwise but didn't outside of
animation, but this is a good effort, and fun too. It's not that fun actually
now that I see it haha. On the other hand, we were introduced to the legendary
seven in that rich girls' school in which Chiharu is trying to defeat but
seriously wtf man I want that this to be a series which will never be approved
you know how much it took to approve everything else in this series???
<b>THAT, is how you know this is a good Anime.</b> <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And seriously, stop
with those underwear referencing I'm becoming a pedophile real soon *looks
away*<br />

</blockquote>
Well I kind of skipped the Japanese "simulcast" because VPN is playing on me so
whatever I just watch the subbed one earlier then hehe. And it's still the last
episode too. Oh well. The final episode (#AsobiAsobase12) for the series talks
about... wow. I don't know there's too much to absorb. How are they still so
high when it's about to end?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, there's a lot packed into
this last one, so let's talk about all of them since I got more time hehe.
Firstly, the baby.
<em>Man</em>, if the word I use to start this sentence isn't the best word to use
to describe whatever is the beast that the teacher's friend raised, I couldn't
be more wrong haha. So yeah, the girls get to play around with the baby for some
reason, and ignoring the speeches that we can understand somehow, he went from
playful to wily to evil and everything else like he's part of this club or even
this Anime to be honest haha. It's just weird, okay? That's Anime. Live with it.
Just like how we have to live with Olivia's armpit stench. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next, we
have a lesson on bras. Thanks to Kasumi who had literally no choice but to wear
a bra earlier than everyone else (it is a problem to those people btw) (I speak
from experience) (Anime experience, actually), and Hanako is jealous of her as
usual. (Olivia did I hear you say "wizards"? *looks at Oka-san* haha they should
help that flat-) On the other hand, she got a quick lesson on how to select
bras, but I think for now there won't be one that can fit her. Fun fact also,
there aren't a lot of brassiere designs which are below A cup. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Then,
there's this show's adaptation (I hope this was from the author and not just
filler content) of whatever is that popular Battle Royale genre of games which I
shall not mention the name of (acronym starts with a P) (starts with an F if you
live in the West it's more popular), but this one is too cute to miss. So, the
girls have a go after being recommended by Olivia. (I seriously thought the
Kasumi notice of the sweets being horizontal was because we're playing a
Maeda-produced game here HAHAHA) And as expected, they didn't do very well. Much
like a bunch of noobs playing one of those games, you're going to get killed
fast if you don't know the rules. In their defence, they were playing against
the shougi club who immediately saw their team name and took action (especially
the president personally) to exact their revenge. I like how this show relates
past content so well and I really was waiting for something about them to talk
about after that incident which sent the club president flying really far and
into the hospital bed lol. Lastly, a game I've never heard before. But
essentially if you don't think this game is lame and for kids, it's a game of
influence. If you can convince your opponent that they have lost, you win.
Although it's that simple, technically there isn't a way to end. From simple
things like a prince, a shield, to like a cannon, a politician speech (lol),
Mister Man (lmao wtf), or even to that parasite which we don't know why Maeda
thinks that's the most powerful thing in existence (I don't want to know tbh
lol), this game has everything Asobi Asobase wants you to know. Heck, this is
the most sketch comedy of sketch comedies ever. Well, at least within my
experience, but man does this show take things to the max, even with just middle
schoolgirls and that butler which shoots a laser out of his butt haha. All in
all, boobs are great, I laughed a lot, and I don't mind joining this show as a
third character with the likes of Maeda and Hanako's grandfather haha seriously
that family is weird how did the brother not be influenced by all this??
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> now I WANT TO BE THE BROTHER lol<br />

Let's see what I listened to this week... <b>YUKI's latest best album</b> from
earlier this year was planned on the list this week but I didn't listen to it
over the weekend, so that'll wait till next week.
<b>YUKI's newest single</b> though... I might just give it chance. To be honest
I've heard a dozen songs which sound like this and are honestly better, so this
one is going to pale in comparison to for example,
<a

  target="_blank"
  >that Kotobuki Minako song</a
>. <b>Linked Horizon's new single</b> has to come by considering the Anime
tie-in, but heck it wasn't good anyways, so maybe I'll just give this over the
opening theme song which... honestly haven't surfaced yet for some reason. (It's
getting TV attention though because of the collaboration) So yeah, we'll see
about that. I don't think I want to give another 3-star song which is a rarity
and a symbol of failure in Klassic Note now, so I just refrain from doing that.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Can we just remove the give-one-theme-song rule now? I'm regretting
giving the series haha yeah I think that's why hahahaha<br /><br />Next week
bring us... oh yeah I haven't listened to
<b>KANA-BOON's new B-side compilation</b> yet so maybe I'll listen to that or
not because I don't like their early stuff for some reason. Yeah that's it. I
mean, I wish I spent more time if I have any to go around and listen for good
songs but all I have are these guys mentioned above. Oh well. We know the good
stuff is appearing next month. *looks at Asakura Momo*<br /><br />Speaking about
good stuff, on Twitter there has been many good news.
<b>TrySail's new single</b> comes at 14th November just before their trip to
Singapore hehe (haiz),
<b>Yoshioka Kiyoe is finally releasing a formal album of cover songs</b> on end
of October (yes, Ikimonogakari's vocalist) for the first time since her hiatus
from the group, apparently <b>King Gnu's digital single</b> was such a success
they had a CD release which I will review next week as it releases this week (I
almost forgot to talk about this in front) and
<b>Komatsu Mikako is singing a new song for Anime</b> once again. (Be reminded
she is under Q-MHz care now, that Anime composers group) So yeah, all good
stuff, but in the future. Well, the King Gnu single review will be coming in
quite early so we shall see about that. Meanwhile, you can catch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Bzhpm8h0o" target="_blank"
  >their new music video</a

online. Very dark for a song which sounds great tbh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm
done. I hope you guys did notice that wonderful addition of a Apple Music embed
code I replaced instead of a link to go there and an upgrade from hovering over
to show an image. It's really cool too; they don't load unless you hover
over/tap on it. (As usual, find those blinking texts I make easy references) Ah,
I love coding. Just that I'm not doing a lot in work for some reason even the
newer guys who came after me got to crush some program bugs. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Oh well,
might as well start asking for it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys tomorrow I've got a support
phone to learn to answer considering I have ZERO EXPERIENCE with customer
service hehe I hope I'm not disappointing lol
