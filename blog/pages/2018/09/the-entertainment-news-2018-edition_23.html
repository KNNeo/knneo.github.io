Sorry guys, that's not going to happen I have a day job nowhaha<br /><br />Hey guys. Now I really regret not making myself busy enough suchthat if I want to play a simulation game over the weekend I only have... welljust an afternoon to play. That's about 4 hours. The rest went into those twogames that I have to play or else the events will end lol why<br /><br />Welllet's begin I need to talk about how many new songs I've listened to this weekhaha #sarcasm<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH12">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I just feel so in pain when I can't do anything for you" I mean Eiji, you    did him a great favour by showing him a good time last episode haha  </div></blockquote>This show is becoming one of those where there is the big boss having a mistresshe found on the streets while he goes out and orders people to kill so he cantake over the world. And it's not even a mistress too. Heck, Ash is becoming thenew Golzine lmao. The new episode (#BANANAFISH12) ends the honeymoon period ofthis series we're going to get a second cour of, so that's fun. First thingsfirst: Arthur and Ash haven't fought. It's all the proxy war thing where Ashjust swiftly takes over all the gangs in downtown and making sure the rest don'tinterfere, for example, gangs who want nothing from both of them. Instead, theypretty much become spies for Ash, so Arthur is at the losing side at this point.Well, besides having all the power Golzine has in New York, and even then theold man himself may not be in a good state. Not physical state because he's sohealthy after banging all the boys lol, but yeah, mentally he's probably notfeeling so good. On the other side, the truth may have been discovered to be alarger conspiracy than before, that Golzine is practically a pawn in the biggerstate of things involving the government of the US, Middle East, and everythingelse money can influence the world. So yeah, money is everything in this showapparently. Well, unless you're Ash and can't say farewell enough to Eiji eventhough you're the one sending him away, knowing FULL WELL you'll not be able toeven buy this friendship back, has to go settle his own affairs once and forall. Ash is real deep in this worldwide conspiracy involving the drug, and it'sonly going to get more crazy. I really wonder what is up next for now besidesArthur's confrontation and that sweet, sweet revenge. I hope there's enough plottwists to make me excited because this cold war drama period is killing mehaha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TkNFyaKRYuk/W6cu_F80CqI/AAAAAAAAqUs/lWINJIt6iAQUOYrNjMoM-sqQoBehx4w5gCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish12_disgust.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            And here I thought they wouldn't make this episode more            interesting:<br />Introducing a Westerner with natto!

(Wait,            what?)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "I'm becoming a murderer" I mean Ash, you're not doing most of it thoughlol<br />P.P.S. Yeah the first one Ash probably did not get to save was thatgirl someone thought was his girlfriend, I guess. The second one was probablyShorter, so... who's next? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ChioChan12">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    MANANA-CHAN NO TSUUGAKURO CONFIRMED haha no really why are we sticking with    Chio-chan for the story up till now? lol  </div></blockquote>And... we're finally at the end. Man, I wish we'll be able to get that lastchapter of the manga animated, but hey, just watch episode 1 but imagine Mananain it haha. The final episode (#ChioChan12) of this crazy series of happeningsgives us a little more than what we wanted, which isn't bad until you noticethey've gone too far once again. Wait, isn't it for all the episodes in theseries what am I saying? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Firstly, Chiharu found out a lot of things.Where Chio-chan lives, and that she is totally unlikely the girl her brotherlikes. (Oh man, she doesn't know) Well, we found out a lot of other things, likehow smart she is, eh... that's it actually. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> On the other hand, we mayhave found out how dumb Chio-chan was at solving a problem although I would takepity on her because if I were her I'll probably end up the same fate. We're allnot smart or lucky like Manana standing on a line anyways so whatever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Then again, I would like to remind whoever reads this that it sucks to beaverage because you won't be looked up to or be taken care of, which is actuallythe worst. So yeah, I'm glad Chio-chan is below average and not just averagelol. And the second part gives us the best thing we can ever hope for in thisseries which I hope if from the original work: no-pan. An abbreviation for notwearing panties (typically in public), these girls have taken it to such anextent, I wished I was born in the Hosokawa family. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (So if I marry intothe family do I have to walk around the house naked??) (Man, it's all thesagging too besides Yuki-chan maybe haha) So yeah, she wasn't wearing anythingdown there, it's all white overlays for the whole scene until Manana wanted tojoin in the fun before she got found out lying, and then Chio-chan felt lonely,and then Kushitori-senpai wanted to play Kabaddi. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> No really, not a goodtime to do this, but hey, they kind of got away with that. I mean, you'll feelit once... everything else happens because... okay I lied I know nothing aboutthat I'm not even female lol someone pay the fine for Yuki-chan's potentialstreak act in the future please. Lastly, the animation production gave us twothings that we wished was in every series: random stuff, and NGs. Wait, what?"How does the latter happen?", you say. I mean, it's not hard making weird cutsto stuff which probably should've happened otherwise but didn't outside ofanimation, but this is a good effort, and fun too. It's not that fun actuallynow that I see it haha. On the other hand, we were introduced to the legendaryseven in that rich girls' school in which Chiharu is trying to defeat butseriously wtf man I want that this to be a series which will never be approvedyou know how much it took to approve everything else in this series???<b>THAT, is how you know this is a good Anime.</b> <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And seriously, stopwith those underwear referencing I'm becoming a pedophile real soon *looksaway*<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eHfPEmYmLYs/W6c5KsSPmHI/AAAAAAAAqVA/1fAvnaP_VNQSCS8_yzkoK7JoO3KRxq3vgCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan12_yuki2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            My opinion about this series in general          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RVfkvs6tYjc/W6c5Kv7lLPI/AAAAAAAAqU8/Y5UXgqYs2VwsWhM3Z1vAm28lKm1HX1XGwCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan12_punch.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when my friend acts innocent for spouting nonsense          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Lol what's with the last episode opening theme extra SFX they just gotbudget to do a new season?? Haha I wish<br />P.P.S. "Like I was missingsomething the whole time..." I mean Kushitori-senpai you meant you smelling somepu**y lingering on the streets? lol<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase12">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It (wrestling club) may be too stimulating for him (the baby)" I mean, this    club isn't any better btw haha  </div></blockquote>Well I kind of skipped the Japanese "simulcast" because VPN is playing on me sowhatever I just watch the subbed one earlier then hehe. And it's still the lastepisode too. Oh well. The final episode (#AsobiAsobase12) for the series talksabout... wow. I don't know there's too much to absorb. How are they still sohigh when it's about to end?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, there's a lot packed intothis last one, so let's talk about all of them since I got more time hehe.Firstly, the baby.<i>Man</i>, if the word I use to start this sentence isn't the best word to useto describe whatever is the beast that the teacher's friend raised, I couldn'tbe more wrong haha. So yeah, the girls get to play around with the baby for somereason, and ignoring the speeches that we can understand somehow, he went fromplayful to wily to evil and everything else like he's part of this club or eventhis Anime to be honest haha. It's just weird, okay? That's Anime. Live with it.Just like how we have to live with Olivia's armpit stench. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next, wehave a lesson on bras. Thanks to Kasumi who had literally no choice but to weara bra earlier than everyone else (it is a problem to those people btw) (I speakfrom experience) (Anime experience, actually), and Hanako is jealous of her asusual. (Olivia did I hear you say "wizards"? *looks at Oka-san* haha they shouldhelp that flat-) On the other hand, she got a quick lesson on how to selectbras, but I think for now there won't be one that can fit her. Fun fact also,there aren't a lot of brassiere designs which are below A cup. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Then,there's this show's adaptation (I hope this was from the author and not justfiller content) of whatever is that popular Battle Royale genre of games which Ishall not mention the name of (acronym starts with a P) (starts with an F if youlive in the West it's more popular), but this one is too cute to miss. So, thegirls have a go after being recommended by Olivia. (I seriously thought theKasumi notice of the sweets being horizontal was because we're playing aMaeda-produced game here HAHAHA) And as expected, they didn't do very well. Muchlike a bunch of noobs playing one of those games, you're going to get killedfast if you don't know the rules. In their defence, they were playing againstthe shougi club who immediately saw their team name and took action (especiallythe president personally) to exact their revenge. I like how this show relatespast content so well and I really was waiting for something about them to talkabout after that incident which sent the club president flying really far andinto the hospital bed lol. Lastly, a game I've never heard before. Butessentially if you don't think this game is lame and for kids, it's a game ofinfluence. If you can convince your opponent that they have lost, you win.Although it's that simple, technically there isn't a way to end. From simplethings like a prince, a shield, to like a cannon, a politician speech (lol),Mister Man (lmao wtf), or even to that parasite which we don't know why Maedathinks that's the most powerful thing in existence (I don't want to know tbhlol), this game has everything Asobi Asobase wants you to know. Heck, this isthe most sketch comedy of sketch comedies ever. Well, at least within myexperience, but man does this show take things to the max, even with just middleschoolgirls and that butler which shoots a laser out of his butt haha. All inall, boobs are great, I laughed a lot, and I don't mind joining this show as athird character with the likes of Maeda and Hanako's grandfather haha seriouslythat family is weird how did the brother not be influenced by all this??<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> now I WANT TO BE THE BROTHER lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PiQ66OYY1lc/W6eoNohqPyI/AAAAAAAAqVk/AAcsUvagJ6MBnnzXG8mbHxnuTKTSyhd6gCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase12_grope3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Initially I decided to watch this series is because of this...<br />(Yeah,            just in episode 1 it was slapped HARD)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S6mj7oVIad0/W6eoNn2MhUI/AAAAAAAAqVo/IMBFjKdPVlgxmaMLPitgcfNjV_1gDOH5ACLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase12_olivia1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ... now I watch this series is actually because of this.

I might just give it chance.

We know the goodstuff is appearing next month. *looks at Asakura Momo*<br /><br />Speaking aboutgood stuff, on Twitter there has been many good news.<b>TrySail's new single</b> comes at 14th November just before their trip toSingapore hehe (haiz),<b>Yoshioka Kiyoe is finally releasing a formal album of cover songs</b> on endof October (yes, Ikimonogakari's vocalist) for the first time since her hiatusfrom the group, apparently <b>King Gnu's digital single</b> was such a successthey had a CD release which I will review next week as it releases this week (Ialmost forgot to talk about this in front) and<b>Komatsu Mikako is singing a new song for Anime</b> once again.

I hope you guys did notice that wonderful addition of a Apple Music embedcode I replaced instead of a link to go there and an upgrade from hovering overto show an image. It's really cool too; they don't load unless you hoverover/tap on it. (As usual, find those blinking texts I make easy references) Ah,I love coding. Just that I'm not doing a lot in work for some reason even thenewer guys who came after me got to crush some program bugs. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Oh well,might as well start asking for it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys tomorrow I've got a supportphone to learn to answer considering I have ZERO EXPERIENCE with customerservice hehe I hope I'm not disappointing lol<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
