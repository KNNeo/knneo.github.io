Do you know: time passesfaster when you don't speak during meetings. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah I lied it was aboring day at work I practically did nothing. Doing nothing is still nothingeven if you learnt a lot. That's... me as a student. Hey, as they say, studentlife reflects upon work life lol<br /><br />Okay reality is boring let's do thisAnime thing<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan46">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Am I acting in my own accord?" I mean, it's dead now so Historia it doesn't    matter lol  </div></blockquote>THERE'S GONNA BE A PART TWO?? Oh no I thought Lord Reiss was the tough one. Thenew episode (#AttackOnTitan46) gives us some happiness in knowing that no morecitizens are going to get killed in this bloodthirsty series. Well, in returnsome soldiers did have to sacrifice as the super big Titan crawls through theNorthern lands destroying everything in his way until he can put his own twohands on the wall to finally stand. I mean, the cititzens thought this wasanother one of those "emergency exercises" then look above you the steam travelsmiles you idiots. It's the best warning sign ever to be seen because it's thatobvious. That, and be reminded that if the Titan doesn't come this way to thesmaller town and goes towards the city, more people will be in the death. Goodthing there are the more competent Scouts compared to the Guards of the area whohave work experience as low as mine right now lol, and did manage to blow thatshit up with the help of Titan Eren. (Erwin making the gamble that he has amouth apparently) (I mean, who doesn't?) The rest of the squad is tasked toshred every single piece left spread around the walls after the big explosion,and Historia was lucky to have gotten the final hit. That, and the memories thatcome with it. It's no coincidence, my girl; that is your dad's memories rightthere. And in view of the success within the walls and a flashback, Kenny'sapprently the only one alive on his squad, dragging himself to safety maybe.Confronted by Levi, he decides to use his last resort. And that might just savehis life as well as provide us with the largest plot twist yet. Yeah Lord Reiss,enthusiasm for your transformation died along with whatever Historia thought shewas doing following your orders to be a Titan which is never. For being astorytelling new Queen though, she could not refuse. I mean, think of all the***** you can su** hahahaha with her height she doesn't have to bend over toolol okay I'm done<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tN4FXQtc0rI/W5-0kjtkhjI/AAAAAAAAqLM/bE0zKYWC1wEEaC2CrC83oN5NPk0KftvmgCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan46_historia.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            That Titan was too disgusting so here's Historia looking cool            <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jygIy-qcczI/W5-0kiFks9I/AAAAAAAAqLI/atiG2jXnMl8GS6xI0GZh2KyY-Qro_BfGwCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan46_sunset.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Kenny was too disgusting so here's two bros with a sunset *thumbs            up*          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. It's like Erwin fires the flare gun with his only hand (RIP other hand),lands on the nape and it burns, kills the Titan and it's over? Haha like thatwould ever happen<br />P.P.S. Also a nutshell of this episode, but yeah it's oneof those Eren doubting his existence and weak self once again. Hey, you jerk,you <strike>got the most important Titan power</strike> are the main guy. That'salready better than everyone else here right now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Tsukumogami09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I didn't find anything (from the servants)" Pfft that's a lie right there    folks hehe  </div></blockquote>Finally, guys. We're going to "get into her heart" so badly I can't even stopthe Anime from doing so haha- Oh I'm referring to Okou-san btw, and yes that's areference to the opening theme song. Very dope, be sure to get a listen. Totallyunrelated to my impression of the show though, because in the new episode(#Tsukumogami09) of #TheGossip things are getting to its climax (I meant theplot btw) where we finally get to know the story behind Suou, that one superexpensive incense burner who tore relationships. Okay, maybe it's just Sataroand Okano I guess. I mean, Okou-san didn't show any passion during thisinvestigation and was always blaming herself, so... The story in a nutshell.Story goes that (let's remind ourselves again because FINALLY they get anarrator to explain this once and for all) Sataro was deemed to love someonefrom a second-hand shop who coincidentally goes by the name of Okou (or Kouapparently I don't know) but immediately the son lost to his selfish mother whoinstead made him marry the one rich merchant's girl. Having to deal with anunwavering heart, Okano gave him an incense burner as a gift so expensive itcould re-build a second-hand shop. Coincidence? Not unless the guy disappearedwith it. And so, the journey to find the guy (and the incense burner) continues.Tapping into every method up our sleeves till this episode, we still could notpull enough strings (thanks a lot to the tsukumogami btw) to find out the truth.We did, however, find out who else was also searching for the one man.Okano-san, apparently. Well, I guess it's from the father, but still. Anddepending on which side you stand on, you may want to be with the guy forever orjust straight out kill him. Hey, gotta happen one way or another. Meanwhile,it's still quite a blind search of the truth while we continue to uncover moretruths we don't believe existed. Seriously, a reflection of reality didn't comeso clear to Seiji until this episode with Gonpei, to be honest. God, this is agood show. The subtitle load though, it needs to go slower I can't catch up- OhI got my poorly trained ears too I can(not) just do this without subti<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pllQhghEifQ/W5-9sLq3zkI/AAAAAAAAqLc/9kxY5MUZ-xQvuBB8T_fNo2utZedtiNLigCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami09_suou.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The legend that ruined everything from families to social status to            marriages          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w6GVILTcL-s/W5-9tcJQcNI/AAAAAAAAqLg/43Qy8jkbH88GU8BYNVTV5Vr53PHEzvAFwCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami09_drama.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Seriously didn't expect a false re-enactment starring the            tsukumogamis lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S, I swear this is the ONLY EPISODE that I said "let's go over things" beforeGokui did HAHA GOTCHA (it's the first one btw)<br />P.P.S.
