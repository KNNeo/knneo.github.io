<h2 class="title">The Entertainment News 2018 Edition Issue #37 - Anime Extra</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
Hey guys.<br /><br />It was a wonderful day at work. Do you know: time passes faster when you don't speak during meetings. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah I lied it was a boring day at work I practically did nothing. Doing nothing is still nothing even if you learnt a lot. That's... me as a student. Hey, as they say, student life reflects upon work life lol<br /><br />Okay reality is boring let's do this Anime thing<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Am I acting in my own accord?" I mean, it's dead now so Historia it doesn't matter lol</div></blockquote>THERE'S GONNA BE A PART TWO?? Oh no I thought Lord Reiss was the tough one. The new episode (46) gives us some happiness in knowing that no more citizens are going to get killed in this bloodthirsty series. Well, in return some soldiers did have to sacrifice as the super big Titan crawls through the Northern lands destroying everything in his way until he can put his own two hands on the wall to finally stand. I mean, the cititzens thought this was another one of those "emergency exercises" then look above you the steam travels miles you idiots. It's the best warning sign ever to be seen because it's that obvious. That, and be reminded that if the Titan doesn't come this way to the smaller town and goes towards the city, more people will be in the death. Good thing there are the more competent Scouts compared to the Guards of the area who have work experience as low as mine right now lol, and did manage to blow that shit up with the help of Titan Eren. (Erwin making the gamble that he has a mouth apparently) (I mean, who doesn't?) The rest of the squad is tasked to shred every single piece left spread around the walls after the big explosion, and Historia was lucky to have gotten the final hit. That, and the memories that come with it. It's no coincidence, my girl; that is your dad's memories right there. And in view of the success within the walls and a flashback, Kenny's apprently the only one alive on his squad, dragging himself to safety maybe. Confronted by Levi, he decides to use his last resort. And that might just save his life as well as provide us with the largest plot twist yet. Yeah Lord Reiss, enthusiasm for your transformation died along with whatever Historia thought she was doing following your orders to be a Titan which is never. For being a storytelling new Queen though, she could not refuse. I mean, think of all the ***** you can su** hahahaha with her height she doesn't have to bend over too lol okay I'm done<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tN4FXQtc0rI/W5-0kjtkhjI/AAAAAAAAqLM/bE0zKYWC1wEEaC2CrC83oN5NPk0KftvmgCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan46_historia.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">That Titan was too disgusting so here's Historia looking cool <span title="*thumbs up*">👍</span></td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jygIy-qcczI/W5-0kiFks9I/AAAAAAAAqLI/atiG2jXnMl8GS6xI0GZh2KyY-Qro_BfGwCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan46_sunset.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Kenny was too disgusting so here's two bros with a sunset <span title="*thumbs up*">👍</span></td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>P.S. It's like Erwin fires the flare gun with his only hand (RIP other hand), lands on the nape and it burns, kills the Titan and it's over? Haha like that would ever happen<br />P.P.S. Also a nutshell of this episode, but yeah it's one of those Eren doubting his existence and weak self once again. Hey, you jerk, you <strike>got the most important Titan power</strike> are the main guy. That's already better than everyone else here right now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I didn't find anything (from the servants)" Pfft that's a lie right there folks hehe</div></blockquote>Finally, guys. We're going to "get into her heart" so badly I can't even stop the Anime from doing so haha- Oh I'm referring to Okou-san btw, and yes that's a reference to the opening theme song. Very dope, be sure to get a listen. Totally unrelated to my impression of the show though, because in the new episode (9) of #TheGossip things are getting to its climax (I meant the plot btw) where we finally get to know the story behind Suou, that one super expensive incense burner who tore relationships. Okay, maybe it's just Sataro and Okano I guess. I mean, Okou-san didn't show any passion during this investigation and was always blaming herself, so... The story in a nutshell. Story goes that (let's remind ourselves again because FINALLY they get a narrator to explain this once and for all) Sataro was deemed to love someone from a second-hand shop who coincidentally goes by the name of Okou (or Kou apparently I don't know) but immediately the son lost to his selfish mother who instead made him marry the one rich merchant's girl. Having to deal with an unwavering heart, Okano gave him an incense burner as a gift so expensive it could re-build a second-hand shop. Coincidence? Not unless the guy disappeared with it. And so, the journey to find the guy (and the incense burner) continues. Tapping into every method up our sleeves till this episode, we still could not pull enough strings (thanks a lot to the tsukumogami btw) to find out the truth. We did, however, find out who else was also searching for the one man. Okano-san, apparently. Well, I guess it's from the father, but still. And depending on which side you stand on, you may want to be with the guy forever or just straight out kill him. Hey, gotta happen one way or another. Meanwhile, it's still quite a blind search of the truth while we continue to uncover more truths we don't believe existed. Seriously, a reflection of reality didn't come so clear to Seiji until this episode with Gonpei, to be honest. God, this is a good show. The subtitle load though, it needs to go slower I can't catch up- Oh I got my poorly trained ears too I can(not) just do this without subti<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pllQhghEifQ/W5-9sLq3zkI/AAAAAAAAqLc/9kxY5MUZ-xQvuBB8T_fNo2utZedtiNLigCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami09_suou.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The legend that ruined everything from families to social status to marriages</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w6GVILTcL-s/W5-9tcJQcNI/AAAAAAAAqLg/43Qy8jkbH88GU8BYNVTV5Vr53PHEzvAFwCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami09_drama.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Seriously didn't expect a false re-enactment starring the tsukumogamis lmao</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>P.S, I swear this is the ONLY EPISODE that I said "let's go over things" before Gokui did HAHA GOTCHA (it's the first one btw)<br />P.P.S.
