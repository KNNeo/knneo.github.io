Hey.<br /><br />I know every week I come in with a heavy mood, but I think this
needs to be discussed with my colleagues because... I still don't know what I'm
doing. Specifically, what I'm doing work for. Not that I have no goals (I don't
though), but I feel empty. It feels the same as the time was in internship too.
I might be too free. Not busy, if you need a better term. I don't know, man. If
I can't take it, I really need to tell someone who is busy. I know I can do it.
I can't bear a sad mood every week.<br /><br />Even my emo days wasn't this
bad.<br /><br />Okay, let's get in and out my world quick. I still have to do
this for tomorrow anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Hey, they do say all your need is one capable guy instead of rearing a bunch of
noobs around. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Am I talking about my workplace? Haha we shall see) The
new episode (#BANANAFISH11) was quite the rise of the comeback, I must say. And
with hope upon us, we can see how Ash might already be playing and planning his
further action against Golzine. Firstly, tasking his remaining squad to gather
information about what he needs to deal with in town. Mainly because his gangs
were taken from him when he was... you know, busy with other things (see past 10
episodes for details lol) so now he has to take it back, even though it's
technically not Arthur's but the remaining ones are those who have the balls
haha. Besides taking a rest and having a great time with Eiji for some reason
(hey why not Golzine has boys to play with why can't his stepson?), he also
started the first part of his own plans to make sure he himself is
self-sustainable, and hopefully out of reach from the lord. So yeah, he went
hacking. Well, I guess it's not tough to hack considering he wasn't enjoying it
when Golzine was doing him (ugh), so that's the old man's fault, I guess. Ash
also got Max to help him out so he can get a place to stay, enclosed within a
condo, near one of the places Golzine owns, hopefully to keep Eiji safe and easy
to spy on maybe. So yeah, Golzine is going to have a rough time for now.
Meanwhile however, he is tasking Arthur to take over his... crumbling empire
(well his house was crumbling lol) as he flies overseas to settle things. That,
which makes this a good last stand for these two enemies who probably should've
settled amongst themselves like, before this series even started. That, and
hopefully things go along their way. Max has something up his sleeve about
protecting Eiji though. Also, Eiji himself can be a liability if he really wants
to, so there's quite a lot to play here. We shall see then. The series has also
been confirmed to be two-cour (as in seasons) announcing the new opening theme
song, so yeah, this show is still here to stay. I want to see some sweet, sweet
revenge, Ash. Make sure it happens. I want more shocked faces of Golzine this
episode was just a teaser haha<br />

P.S. I thoguht the guns guy is going to rat him out but I guess Ash does have
some personal connections outside of Golzine's world, so that's good.<br />P.P.S.
I like how Eiji talks about Ash's dual personality (the killing one, and when
they were in bed lol) even though that's basically just us at work and outside
work. Hey Eiji? We all have to maintain this balance, it seems.<br />[Because I
had to talk about it as it's so weird...]<br />

Oh man this show is just... Okay, let's talk about what happened in this
wonderful new episode (#ChioChan11) where we talk about Chio-chan and BO. Nope,
don't relate them together just yet this episode has too many plot twists for us
to just think of them as so. Firstly, Chio-chan's student life at night in a
nutshell. I mean, I don't stay up late so I can't relate, but I must say at
times she's too smart for herself, really. Because her mother is not strict
enough and doesn't want to break her computer in her room (I mean, you have
never seen my parents INTENTIONALLY turn off the power so I can stop at 10pm),
she lets Chio-chan do her thing. The late gamer life is really great (I mean, I
know Chio-chan is below average, but the animation department is
<i>really</i> trying to push her body into our viewing perspective lol), she
thought it was easy robbing banks as if doing it in video games wasn't enough
lol, and... she still manages to go to school on time while getting some much
needed sleep. Yeah, in case you need me to fill in the blanks as the Anime
didn't, she left her place at 4am dressed in her school uniform, went to the
temple, and slept there with a paper bag on her head so that Manana can wake her
up. Still, it took a few hard whacks to wake this beast up (more on that name
later), so yeah the neighbourhood probably knew (and got used to) that one girl
who has been sleeping at the temple was her anyways. But technically, the game
stuff inside the house, I can relate. Not the sleeping part though when I'm
tired I go sleep haha that's the difference Chio-chan lol. Then, there's
Manana's worry about BO. In case you guys don't know what body odour is, try to
wait till your busy day ends and before you step in the bathroom, smell your
armpit. If you are the 60% that aren't aware or are just using perfume to cover
it up, go shower. If it persists, go see a doctor. I'm one of those who refuse
to do any of them early in the morning so technically I'll make Manana and
Chio's nose fall to the ground with that beast scent lol. Okay, but on Chio-chan
first. If I didn't spoil you on why her armpit smells to Manana and she has to
go through that much to realise that it's because of the house dog licking her
underside, then you'll be glad to know all this logical thinking still doesn't
beat smelling the other armpit lol. Hey, you gotta confirm, man. If your nose
falls to the ground twice then you'll know she needs a doctor's consultation
haha. Well probably for you too but hey you gotta help your friend since she
helped you through so much. And you can go to see the doctor together too.
<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And nope, Manana-chan is not getting laid. I wonder if Hosokawa-san is
or not considering she knows everyone in class apparently. I mean, how do you
know the one guy likes pretty girls? <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Don't look at me, do I look like
I know? Besides, it's not an easy question to answer, considering the classroom
is more heated than that bank robbery which someone got 6 million USD alone in
haha<br />

P.S. Now I secretly wish they'll make Chio-chan's voice actress (<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/people/22329/Naomi_Oozora"
  target="_blank"
  >Oozora Naomi</a
>, for your reference) really play a video game that her Anime counterpart
plays. (I mean,
<a href="https://youtu.be/Ngf4A7rJF1Y" target="_blank"
  >they already let her kill someone</a
>
lol the director I assume) Any of those games, I don't care. I just want to see
her fail catastrophically playing something like PUBG hahahaha PROVE ME WRONG
NAOMI-CHAN<br />P.P.S. "What would you do if I have 700 million yen?" I would
say for Momo-chan, "dagashi" or sweets probably will be the best answer imo.
Refer to last week's episode for more information hehe<br /><br /><br />

I know she thinks she's dead even though she wasn't but I wished she was dead
lol okay she approved the movie anyway so I'll forgive her haha. On the new
episode of (#AsobiAsobase11) whatever the f**k is this show because I need to be
reminded of how stupid, silly and exaggerating the plot can go. And that just
means this show can go anywhere haha. <strike>Firstly, </strike>Actually, this
episode surrounds on the unknown yet super-ridiculous character of the
popularists that you think Hanako would hate the vice-president of the student
council, but yes, it's a slut. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Makeup too much for her own sake, she is
second to the student council president, and is actually helping out to talk to
the boys' school opposite the school to... I don't know. Initially it was to
cooperate on the combined school festival, but the real reason? Haha I'm not so
sure. (They are leaving this for another story involving an in-fighting amongst
the boy school's student council members though) (See? I said there'll be a
second season haha) Ignoring that completely, the vice president (as I shall
refer to from here on), has even more problems than the president. (Does she?)
Well, mostly surrounding the fact that she wants to go to the boys' school so
badly it leaves the president to do all the work ie. approving club activities
for the festival, is giving her a good time to escape the school's clutches and
wearing her makeup so she can be the *the word that shall not be mentioned* that
she can be while being a student lol. And that desperation does spread to the
president but not really, as we quickly switch our attention to probably the
best club in this series (yes better than the Art Club lol) which is the Occult
Club. Proudly gracing her return, we now have
<a
  href="https://twitter.com/todamegumi/status/1039373147072425985"
  target="_blank"
  >Aguri-chan</a
>
(I'm not using her nickname here) joining Oka-san in making some sweets and
maybe cookies for the upcoming festival. I know, you have to have the creeps
even though the taste is totally normal. Okay not that normal after Aguri
mentioned about the special potion that her (probably evil) grandmother gave her
to use when she wants people to be happy. I mean, I forgive her since she's
still a middle schooler, and Hanako probably will know how to use the drug
better, but still. They made some, gave some for that male teacher to eat,
and... you can figure out what happened after that. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Lastly, the
confrontation. Of many things. On the front, it's two out of the three girls
asking for repeal on their proposal (that movie) for the festival. I mean, the
president got enough shit for approving whatever the Art Club was doing with
surrealism (if anal is surrealism I need to go to an arts school right now lol),
so this one was definitely a flat-out rejection. However, due to a series of
unfortunate events and the curiosity of the three girls, they got their movie
approved. Man, it's tiring being student council. Especially the boys' school
student council, if you get what I mean. Between butt lasers, two-faces, long
and boring movie reviews like they matter (boom gotcha movie reviewers and
Olivia's brother) I would say the vice president survived it all. That, and
knocking someone unconscious. Twice. God, if I tell you she is voiced by the
same person who voiced Oka-san you wouldn't even believe me.<br /><br />*serious
face* Yep, I'm not joking. Look it up.<br /><br />Like seriously, if there was
to be a mystery to solve, Conan can step aside because apart from its second
reference in this series, Olivia makes of a good detective and I like haha oh I
meant her in general not her lazy brain which has been actively used twice?

Wow this week is a whole lot of... nothing? Well, I still gotta find new songs
to listen. It's Klassic Note, after all. I can't listen to one-week old songs.
<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> <b>ORESAMA's new music video</b> is finally in after weeks of trying
not to give a melody which is so 90s for some reason (I know, the beat's are
still today's beats don't get me wrong) (maybe that's why the single didn't
appear online), I decided to give <b>Tachibana Rika</b>... on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cGctxwGDKk" target="_blank"
  >her charatcer song on that game</a
>
I'm still playing when I should've quit lol. Why? Because it's so dope tbh and I
can't get it out of my head. And I'll never say sorry to her two mini-albums
because they suck haha. (Oh, and a new yearly compilation is due since I got
enough songs to group to this topic which I hate lol)&nbsp;<b
  >tacica's latest single</b
>
was rather disappointing to be honest, so I instead went to listen their 2009
single of which I did give the topic song thanks to one "Solanin" movie and its
songbook compilation, back in 2013. That is, for my experience. I must say, this
is the most typcial of experiences where artists are trying so hard to create
melodies which won't be exact as others in fear of copyright? I don't know.
Whatever the reason, it's making music compositions terrible, and I wish that
will not happen to everyone. THE ORAL CIGARETTES and Yoru no Honki Dance are
doing pretty well, giving us fresh melodies in every corner. Why can the other
guys do it? Is that a problem that artists are struggling to overcome? I mean, I
don't know; I'm not a music artist.<br /><br />Next week brings us (hopefully)
<b>Linked Horizon's new single</b> for that Anime which I can't even get my
hands on the opening theme for some reason, and this time I might just give
which will be my first since back when I first gave it and regretted my decision
back in 2013. Huh, all the memories are from five years ago somehow.Well, I need
a second impression. First impressions are dying out quick. Especially Linked
Horizon. I'm really wanting to wipe my memory of their music style if they don't
give me another good song haha<br /><br />In the latest news, someone in negoto
got married (oh well haha),
<b>Komatsu Mikako is due for another new single</b> with an Anime tie-in, and
<b>Tsuji Shion's best album</b> is due late October. In other other news which I
TOTALLY don't care about,

(they only got the staff one) (nope, no blog posts as of writing)
<b>are due in Singapore late November</b>. Yeah. I don't care at all. I mean,
how much money does it take to maybe just talk to Ten-chan? FOUR HUNDRED
BUCKAROOS?? Fuck off. I may not even be able to get her to sign one of those CDs
I have on my shelf. Now that I think about it it's a real good idea... ARGH NO I
WANT TO DO IT SO BADLY NOW lol no I don't what do you think this is? I'm paying
just to see their faces? Well it's not that expensive I can just buy the day
ticket or night performance ticket hehe<br /><br />Also also, TIL embedding
Apple Music Previews is now a thing:<br /><iframe

  style="background: transparent; max-width: 660px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"
></iframe
><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay now I can't stop fantasising about talking
to any of them, the six mentioned above. Okay maybe not Nagaku Yuki she not my
type haha. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Okay maybe not. I mean, if my enthusiasm for them isn't
like that one guy who will bring someone's latest photobook for them to sign
while donning on the cosplay of one of their roles... I think I'm already not
eligible even if I HAVE the money to pay for talking to them for 20 seconds.
Hey, if I do? Hmm... I mean, I'm working now, and I definitely have a couple of
hundred bucks to spare... we shall see how. Maybe. Maybe this time. I avoided
this a lot of times, maybe now is the time to do it. Then again, I'm not that
invested in Anime festivals, so maybe not? Cya guys tomorrow then, and until
then... finally took some time to clear my computer of hard disk space, but I
have a feeling I need to get a new system drive this SSD is way too small to do
Android app development. (Audience: お？) (Stop second guessing me please)<br /><br />[P.S.
And for once I don't care about F1 just happening downtown because I've got
Anime to watch #AnimeIsLife haha should've told my colleagues that when they
asked what I do on the weekends]<br /><br />[P.P.S. Some
