Work, man. Makes you not have time to do whateveryou want. Whatever. You. Want. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Alright let's get to it thenI wanna wrap up last week quickly lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan45">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Hange's our only casuality" "Doesn't seem like it's too serious" Wow Erwin    you jerk we aim for zero injuries, asshole. You call this not serious? Ever    heard of workplace safety?? lol  </div></blockquote>The new episode (#AttackOnTitan45) continues on the transformation that stupidRod Reiss being Titan now and can barely move despite being twice the size ofthe biggest Titans we've seen in this series yet. And that's not all. Eren didtransform, but it was not to kill. It was to defend. And thus, Levi's squad getsto see another day. The others we won't care too much because we weren't givenmuch details (I mean, Kenny kind of escaped with his squad), but Erwin's armycame by, and now we're just watching a super large Titan crawl to the city. Imean, that's it, guys. We're done now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay. Now, the details. And wewere right: to think that Eren's dad was actually not a bad guy by trying todestroy the royal family to take the sacred Titan power, but actually to createa chance to "save humanity". I mean, if the term isn't familiar to you yet, atleast by now we have a better idea of what it means to do that. So yeah,Historia kind of chose that option, to not be influenced by Titan rule, and tonot be under the original royalty. Well, she is still technically a descendant,and probably has to take over the throne to complete the coup detat story, butstill. She made a choice, just like how Eren made a choice to make sure eveyroneis safe. Along with all these brave deeds, Erwin now bears the responsibility tosave a city of people, so we shall see how that can be done without evacuatingeven one citizen on the ground that the Titan is approaching. Eren is probablygoing to transform again, but hopefully that wall will hold up. Or not. We don'tknow. It feels flimsy as heck from previous attacks until this slowpoke of aTitan showed up lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NoL7po5tZ0s/W5Z3Usvr69I/AAAAAAAAqAk/poZ-Gh4z7HEcLJpmt_P4vhccmcFnDT7yQCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan45_historia.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Let's be honest here: serious Historia is not cute Historia.      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. "But I still want to see my basement!" Oh no Eren you're not going toyou're going to get eat up by the Reiss lol I mean<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Tsukumogami08">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "And that is how I fell in love... with a man" oh I'm making the narration    up? lol Gokui  </div></blockquote>In the Edo period just two ryo will get you a lifetime membership with a pawnshop? What a deal! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The new episode (#Tsukumogami08) of this wonderfulseries that is #TheGossip (let me get this hashtag out of the way first haha)brings us a tale we can't even talk about. Hey, I mean, we can, it's #TheGossip,mind you. Just that this time, even the tsukumogami can't help much in figuringout the past. Seiji's the smartest person in the area, after all. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay,the plot in a nutshell. The Omiya young master as I would call him from now,knows of some business partners. He was just worried of the one Hansuke who isso kind to him on anything and everything, especially when he's making friendsand being successful ever since he appeared in the area five years ago. (I'msorry to be writing in this perspective because I know of the plot twist and itisn't easy to not write as such) The man invited the people around him to a boatparty, was generous, picked up lots of chicks... one would believe there arerumours about this man spreading far and wide, but it's because there aren't anywhich is making the Omiya young master worried. I understand that he may bescared of people being kind to him as he's shy, but this is more than that, soI'll forgive him. (He even dressed up as a thief how can that be shy?) Deployingthe papparazzi army out from the lending shop thanks to that generous payment,the tsukumogami did not gain any valuable information (get it?) (Probably noteven worth one ryo lol) not because people don't talk about his past, butactually that he doesn't have any. Pair that with Gokui's story about his itembeing used as part of a sad love story, one would believe that Hansuke might bethat man running away from his problems. But plot twist here because I'm a kindperson to warn you guys about it... he was the ex-wife. WHAT~!! Yeah, Hansuke isa cross-dressed male. That would explain how well he was grilling seaweed -something that females were typically better even considering he had a familybackground catching seaweed. That would explain why he was generous because youknow, women spend money like water- Oh that's not it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That wouldultimately explain why he is so kind to Omiya young master, for he likely fellin love with a man who is in happiness maybe. Hey, a man's gotta find some wayto be happy somehow. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, this is getting weird so I'm wrapping up.<span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> You think the tsukumogamis will get to know of the secret in the boat?I mean, if Seiji does not keep it well his next boat trip will be his lastlol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xwcm4ooxQFY/W5aAMSWdPZI/AAAAAAAAqAw/3eHthEjGoL4EetHoo1kOJVhbRaWeayWYQCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami08_huh1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The best faces this episode I can't even <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AhaT3fv0XfI/W5aAMZ4fqMI/AAAAAAAAqA0/U7TU5385sEIDuBJl1DKmbkJ6QreiQHpjwCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami08_huh2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The best faces this episode I can't even <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Casual dressed Ohana and Okou-san are too cute hehe this is what I watchedthis show for<br />P.P.S. THERE'S A LEAD TO SUOU'S PERSON?? Man, I gotta staytuned to the next exciting episode of... well you know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cyaguys next week (Audience: もう？) (Yeah, I'm tired already), and until nexttime... I wish I'd treasure my Cowon player more than my smartphone. I know Ihave a 32GB phone so I can stuff all the songs I need now which I didn't, andthere's still Apple Music, but still. The freedom on that player withoutworrying about mobile data plus that super long battery life (~200hrs to beexact) is still unbeaten. I need to get back to it someday. And in order to dothat, I have to add stuff in. Maybe Bungo Stray Dogs, I guess; I miss a lot ofthat action. Okay maybe not coupled with the long-winded drama of that pussyAtsushi but still lol bye<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
