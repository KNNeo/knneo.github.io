Man, that was quite a run. Sorry tomyself for not deciding to not give up on any one of them so I can sleep earlyand not doze off at work tomorrow lol I wouldn't to be honest it's an openoffice setting it's impossible to sleep haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "The only thing they long for is freedom" Yeah right freedom from your hands    Golzine you sick fuck haha why is it always him? lol  </div></blockquote>Hmm, that was quite a development. The new episode (#BANANAFISH10) and if I maysay is only getting better, talks about what happened after the experiment.Shorter was obviously dead (RIP) (and damn did they operate the shit out of hisdead corpse), but Golzine has something to attend, and that gives everyone theperfect chance to do whatever they need to, well, save people and escapeapparently. Before it got to the Papa's ears, the China boy managed to give Asha chance to escape with his friends including Eiji, Ash's gang came to save himalong with Shorter's gang who now has a new leader, and the China boy himself...let's say he has some plans up his sleeve. The bigger thing is when thescientist - who has been disabled by the needles - mentioned about him takingall the drugs. I mean, we know that anyone who took the drug wouldn't doanything else but bad things with it, so hopefully that doesn't turn out to be azombie apolocalyse case where everyone will be finding Ash and killing him. Idon't know man, the possibilities are infinite with this one. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> On otherthings, the animation is terrible especially when zoomed out - you want tomeasure the proportions of Ash's figure against the rooms in the mansion thatare ever-changing in proportions? I don't want to screncap that because it'sreally bad, but hey, the action was pretty good. Not the violence though. Theyshowed bullet shots in the head real good, you can't even unsee those scenesnow. What next to happen? Revenge on the papa, probably. Now that everyonepretty much is safe and out of the hellhole that is Golzine's mansion, we may beable to see a comeback on Ash's position to... well, I don't really know ifanything else he's planning for besides revenge, unless he also wants to put thedrug on Golzine to make him kill little boys that he so fancies haha I mean it'sonly Ash and Eiji for now right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh no old man we can't have thosepeople dead so you kill yourself, yes?<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-alRSITeUhBQ/W5SOV9T0eBI/AAAAAAAAp8w/qKqLliLIo1EOAckHTVwNPTtVyJj0TqGZACLcBGAs/s320/bananafish10_ash1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            A decent comparison of Ash crying as a kid and him... not as much of            a kid          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5Kx1KkvWg6Y/W5SOWCFNVLI/AAAAAAAAp80/jqUzo-YIwUIw2J0pxPGv9ezgB-9wSEFvgCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish10_ash2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            A decent comparison of Ash crying as a kid and him... not as much of            a kid          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "I mean, technically that scientist there killed your gang leader Shorter;I just shot him good with my gun" lol if I was Ash haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ChioChan10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "She's basically trying to find me, right?" Yep. Chio-chan, you're right.    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>So Momo-senpai has feelings for eating sweets the same way I jerk off at home?<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, the new episode (#ChioChan10) talks about sweets for some reason(I mean, this isn't that<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31636/Dagashi_Kashi" target="_blank"  >sweets Anime series</a>, okay?), the reunion of the Andou siblings and the truth, and a touching storybetween Mayuta (yep that's his name, that Andou) and George. Firstly, thesweets. Shinozuka Momo, the school president, is troubled over why she doesn'tunderstand why kids want to smuggle sweets and snacks into school (termed as"dagashi" in general), and if you don't understand Gotou-sensei's analogy likeme, you'd be pleased to know that the pair will be here to help us get...whatever Momo-chan is trying to get. Instead, we're kind of brought in to thereality of Momo being really enthusiastic even to the extent of crazy, oversweets. And without stopping her, they went to a sweets shop and ate all thestuff they can handle. That, and they probably allowed Momo-chan to go oncharacter overdrive lol. I mean, the only thing these girls are going to get isget fat from all the sweets they ate lmao. Next, the return of the legend. Well,just in talk. The real legend is dead. Right, guys? (#RIPBloodyButterfly) Soyeah, we finally knew in detail of the relation between ex-gang leader Andou andshove-fingers-up-your-kid-ass Andou lol, considering they are siblings 10 yearsapart. Chiharu, the kid one, got pissed of at finding out that her brother losther coolness (apparently what influenced her to go to a private school for somereason) (so she can do that fingering thing during their break?) (I wonder whatshe would be like grown up, Chiharu-chan haha) (I may want to date this girlHAHA) because he got done by the legend who is a girl on the street, and ofcourse found out somehow that Chio-chan was the culprit. Instead of settlingthings on the spot in front of the sister, the two probably ended up gettingcloser than ever before. Physically, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> MVP for this scene wasManana when the ass-beaten beast comes back for revenge and is stopped by thebrother, so all's well ends well? I don't know, this show's too complicatedhaha. But man, did the hits from Chio on Mayuta fail so badly lol. Also,<a href="https://jisho.org/search/burakon" target="_blank">BURAKON</a>!BURAKON!! BURAKON!!! Haha Chiharu-chan you innocent girl. Lastly, a heartwarmingsilent story about Andou (Mayuta) and George, that one cat we've seen in acouple of episodes. It's good to be filled with some backstory, and again didn'texpect silent stories to still hold up this well here. For storytellingpurposes, this Anime has done it well. Just, don't stick your kid fingers up myanus, yes? I don't study in Samejima High School. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />[I can't showanything in the Andou sibling scene so here's a couple of SFW thumbnails lol]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b5F25YLKgpY/W5SbvmfVThI/AAAAAAAAp9A/SC-lVtIbidIuHdbJTuyT9WgsKIF9gjJTwCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan10_wefie.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Happiness is...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LqCesWWwP-Q/W5SbxKESrYI/AAAAAAAAp9E/NJ7BMt-5LNwqViKpJcIWtH7t1SrPNxEvgCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan10_wtf.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ... wishing that someone would make this a messaging app sticker            haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I would like to bring your attention tohow ridiculous it is with the sizes (not talking about Chio-chan's chest here,sorry) between the Andou siblings because man it really looks like I'm watchingsome pedophile holding an underaged<strike>or those monster hentai</strike> haha I'm sorry<br />[Because this in aGIF looks so good]<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RTX8Fs4Rssg/W5Scgoz5TWI/AAAAAAAAp9Q/Oiq7DHTDXgYAKSiWhx5RnBOe82cyUHP2ACLcBGAs/s1600/chiochan10_stuffing.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Happiness is... when you stuff your Anime self with sweets and you don't        get fat haha      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "This is random but I want them to say poo" Yep that's real random Hanako    lol  </div></blockquote>"If you're talking about the illustration above your head" Hey Olivia you'rebreaking the 4th wall here girl haha. Okay, the new episode (#AsobiAsobase10)someone did a reverse Olivia, Aozora did a Kasumi, and Kasumi did a Hanako??Wow, this show has everything. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Firstly, about Fujiwara, that girl whorepresented Olivia who cannot speak English to speak in an English contest, nowknows that this girl can't even speak English even though she was English atsome point. Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But man, do I speak Japanese like she does. (Nope,not going to do it here so just imagine it yourself lol) (But really, I do thatin that one Japanese mobile game I'm playing when I'm bored haha) Not that Iwould want to interest you to<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/44461/Shuu_Uchida" target="_blank"  >this newbie</a>apparently (she's not listed of the role yet as time of writing) but man herEnglish is not bad. I mean, the voice acting. Otherwise, you'd be pleased toknow Fujiwara speaks Japanese as badly as Olivia does with English, so she mixesher bad lingo with the language she is confident in speaking. That, and she mayhave already known and confirmed that Olivia really can't speak English. AsHanako said revealing to anyone would be a good thing, but now I guess to Kasumiat least it's being used as a threat to do anything whoever knows of it wants, Iguess. Don't ask me why Fujiwara wants to go on a date with Kasumi with that ofa face lol, but Aozora-san saved Kasumi so we don't have to see it happen haha.On the other hand, Aozora may have helped us confirm her gender? Which brings usto part two. Apart from Hanako wanting the others to say poo lol, Kasumi keepsthinking about that one kiss to her lips because the other person was... maybe amale, and is having bad dreams about a revaling d*ck. For the sake of censorshipin an Anime which doesn't do it (well, for most of the time), they did make alot of puns around that forbidden word during their Home Economics class, andKasumi not being able to hold it herself, decides to ask her friends to help todiscern once and for all if Aozora is indeed female. Well, it didn't go as well,and they kind of mssed the part on the Banana Book, so... that's their problem.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Adding on to that, I think the ending for when Hanako and Oliviare-enacting the ideal crotch-looking scene is evidence that it won't be possibleto check that for Aozora-san considering she would be wearing safety pants too.Yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Lastly, Kasumi takes the stage again (this show is all about hertoo) but as a director, so she suddenly becomes as sarcastic as Hanako for somereason, taking scenes of space humans and a sexy spy alien (I'll f**k a sexy spyalien you know what I'm sayin'?) and hopefully it ties up all togetherwonderfully like the Star Trek series? Sure, Kasumi-san. All in all diggin' thatsweet-a** poster lol, and if that's a not at all cryptic message about thisseries getting a second season I'M IN!! No really, may this Anime never end justlike how Kasumi's thoughts about that kiss haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CdrFCCtXTAg/W5U7elaOPTI/AAAAAAAAp-Q/Ga1Hz9QB0iwunsA2V8Zzkh9D160TQlvOwCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase10_tie.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I can't show most of the stuff said so here's alien Olivia tied up            and screaming haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KTFYbsgQ27U/W5U7elVX7RI/AAAAAAAAp-M/1KzBmgWys14u3phYlHolH7kYxWd6VeY9QCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase10_scream.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I can't show most of the stuff said so here's alien Olivia tied up            and screaming haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

The new chapter (107) talks about Miporin, one ofTooru's classmates (the one who's not an a**hole?) and her going out with theothers. Well, she's not feeling well though so she tries to cover it up, but asTooru said if you don't feel well take a rest, man. (I guess she hasn't startedthe work life yet so she doesn't know how good that feeling is lol) I mean, ifyou thought she had a fever thinking about Tooru too much you got another thingcoming. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But hey, one can think, right?

I hinted last week that I'll be reviewing this, and here Iam. Gone is a series of Anime so worth watching this was the first fighting showI've watched in years since "BLEACH" ended, but came is another production withnothing else but fights, stories, and an overall created plan that is betterthan the plan which resides it. Thnaks dear author, for we got another wonderfulstory and production due to your extra effort. Coming from the original Animeseries, this was an original filler content talking about a different story inthe current era paused in the time of the Anime I assume, and spoiled of some ofthe future content which would be present if I read the original work. Again,talking about this in three main segments. (1) How this came about, (2) thestory of what it is, and (3) how good was this overall considering I've onlywatched animated adaptations of this work.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vbNcCtBRc8s/W5VB_hA4JgI/AAAAAAAAp-o/RqEFyTj-Sk4yjJKmJfnOe61-FQlhvYgmwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_06.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        OKAY WHO POSTED THIS SHIT lol another Singapore reference      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>Firstly, why I'm watching this. You guys should know I watched this series; Italked about both seasons of it here. Shortly after the end of the second season(which was awesome btw; remember Izumi "sword bitch" Kyouka became one of themafter the President Fukuzawa "you're ma bitch now" Yukichi activated hisability?) came an announcement of an original film which will present moreawesome content that we wish we didn't ask for, and here we are. Aired more thanhalf a year ago in cinemas, I finally got my hands on this and decided to giveit a go. Hey, I have no expectations, so this did blew my mind away.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JY0BIvmRz0E/W5VCZd51I4I/AAAAAAAAp-0/QJAGfOTg6ScpVcxesPtDqwVUVd40pnlUACLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_08.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Ah, the nostalgia haha<br />(All screencapped from the movie I            swear)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2HuAZKdqDvM/W5VCZcmgOTI/AAAAAAAAp-4/ai0Ii5fgUj8Ed-Lu6RRne-mig-yQgMHOwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_09.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Ah, the nostalgia haha<br />(All screencapped from the movie I            swear)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>Secondly, let's talk about the story of this in a nutshell. Man, this is goingto be hard to summarise because I'll talk about that later on how the authorcondenses content based on assumptions and inferences, but suffice it to say itwas a story of the past. Actually, of the dead. History goes that in the DarkAges (if you can recall, the one policeman died for it, and Ozamu "ISNULL()"Dazai changed sides after that) (that's a SQL programming joke) there was quitea war of the Ability users, so the organisation governing the users decided touse a last resort, training and supposedly deploying the one Ability userShibusawa "911" Tatsuhiko (sorry America) who can possess all powers to turnagainst each other, in order to end the fighting. Fast forward 6 years later inthe Detective Agency (if you recall it was 5 years later Dazai left Port Mafia)and this became a recurring problem since the one Ability user felt empty afterbeing used, and now is seeking the Abilities of others, I guess. His motiveisn't that clear, but I'd like to guess it's just trying to fuse all the powerstogether for something. That, we didn't get to. In comes two collaborators whodecided to help him further his cause, even though more likely they are tobetray him at the right time anyways because... he's dead. That in a moment, butthe two are Dazai (I mean, he gotta) and Fyodor "chaos starter" D, apparently aRussian Ability user (man, we gotta cover that after those in America came in?)(Wait, the English too?? This is actually reminding me of "Shakugan no Shana"tbh) who is also leader of the underground group there, has an interestingAbility to "punish" the powers of others. That, may not be clearly shown in themovie, so I guess he gets to release the powers of those who have lost them inorder for them to be duly taken care of? I mean, that doesn't sound likeanything good because he was technically the culprit for everything consideringthe one Shibusawa is already dead. How is Shibusawa already dead? This brings usto our main guy Nakajima "weretiger" Atsushi (yes I'm going to do the nicknamestill the end) who has a past. A past to not be mentioned. Well, it was revealedin this movie. Turns out he was tortured by the occupants, which actually turnsout to be Abitlity users who wanted to take away his power through any meanspossible considering he's an attack-based Ability user. And the one who did thedeed, surprise surprise, was Shibusawa. In a strange turn of events, instead oftaking away the ability, Atsushi took back his Ability and killed the man whotortured him. So yeah, that guy is already dead. I don't want to guess howexactly he came back, but according to the movie his Ability took over hisexistence which explains why "he" felt so empty, considering the body is alreadydead as shown by the skull on the table with the three tiger-slashing scars. So,the whole stage is set by the two collaborators and the undead I suppose? Yeah,to take all the powers from Yokohama (it's like they invited them for something)similar in direction to what the Detective Agency was recently tasked by theorganisation but different in execution. Well, it's gotta happen somehow. Afterrealising what was to happen, and at the right moment, Dazai and Fyodor tookquick action to steal some of the powers in order to put an end to this crazyphenomenon. In order to do this easily, they have to be friends with Shibusawain order for him to reveal the den which keeps all the Ability-condensedcrystals safe which was meant to "create the crown". That, they didn't bother todo, but they did intend to stop this by using some of the Abilities and withDazai's nullifying Ability and that will be able to... I guess stop Shibusawa'sAbility in range and power by making it unstable. You know, suicide just like heloves it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, so with Shibusawa's Ability he thought by getting ridof Dazai following a bunch of betrayals he will be able to, hey, bring back hismemories which was his real intention but he can't. What he did know of thoughfrom Fyodor, was the story that we mentioned that is from Atsushi, and the factthat he's dead. It probably didn't mean as much to him as to Atsuhi as hestruggles to get his power back despite being able to defeat him quite easilywith the help from Kyouka and Akutagawa "Gengar" Ryuunosuke despite them beingin different leagues from each other at this point. You know, collaboration is acommon thing in this world lol. Also from the Port Mafia team with othersnowhere to be seen, Nakahara "Magneto" Chuuya, who has been around back thenwith Dazai, knew of the problem, took it to his own hands to confront Ango (hedoesn't get a nickname here because he has no Ability) about the situation, andof course, took it to his own hands to take care of Shibusawa himself. Well, hewas half the equation as he was only able to stop the Ability user as seenreleased as a dragon considering the disruption and "death" executed by theRussian user. That, and then for punishment, that idiot Fyodor gave the skullpower in order to revive his memories and settle things with Atsushi once andfor all, I assume. Well, it was all a big fight, Yokohama's citizens came outunscathed despite the huge amount of damage done to the place and the fog thatsurrounded the place lol, and peace was restored. Good job, guys.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EIumfL-dA8Y/W5VCJg9N8RI/AAAAAAAAp-s/MNW-NFjG61cXDikM_-GUUj32PkySq-kpwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_01.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Badass bike-riding like you've never seen before until you're reminded        that this guy controls gravity lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>Lastly, what was awesome. Hey, we got no capacity to talk about beingunfamiliar, as the movie made sure to create an opening to introduce everyoneand everything such that even the noobest of viewers can get a grasp of whathappened. Although I would like to say even watching the Anime I still don't getmost of the stuff even WITH the intro. Haha should've watched back a couple ofepisodes before watching this lol. That, and we immediately jump into the story.Feels haphazard, but still really well written. I only felt that it was ascliche as any movie out there was at the last part of the battle because it wasobviously just there to satisfy Atsushi's burning desire to kill haha okay jkjkthat one was just extending the fight so... the fight with Akutagawa was longer(and better) haha. I also like some of the potential spoilers leaked in thisshow ahead of original Anime content ranging from Mori "kid dresser" Ougai'sAbility manifestation in the form of Elise-chan in case you guys didn't noticethat in the Anime (I didn't) to that one woman who works for the organisation.(Thanks Takahashi Rie; your acting was great lol MVP haha) I also appreciate thesimplicity in resolving most of the problems besides the psychological onesbecause Atsushi was created by the author as an idiot lol. The simplicityexplains the solution to fighting their own power which was that gem, andfighting each other's power will return back the power. Which also explains howafter the fog only one Ability user was killed because the guys were alwaysdealing it alone. See? I knew the author was a genius. (He wrote the script forthe movie btw) Other things which are less understood in the movie are theEnglish Abitlity users and whatever that incineration Ability was we don't wantto know lol, but hey, they don't have to interfere since it got settled. But allthese show potential spoiler for those who have watched the Anime but didn'tread the manga tbh and I'm looking forward to them making more of this seriesalready.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JuubsdRf4cI/W5VCqhFWCzI/AAAAAAAAp_E/aCks4t-SbgIuAlpt0PmqUXKUbmJx3372ACLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_15.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Aw this is the cutest thing ever hehe      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>All in all this movie is amazing as it sounds (okay maybe not the new GRANRODEOopening because it sucked haha) (the soundtrack was cool though), and boy am Ihyped to be enjoying this show once again. Can't expect more from this showthough, as I'm just going to feel bad picking on the minor flaws for the shownot explaining it blatantly the situation and resolution, but that's all fine.The ever-changing scenes coupled with some level of reflection and fighing makesit all of what Bungou Stray Dogs was and will become. And for that, I salute tothe Ability users who have to risk their lives to secretly keep the world safe.I like these kinds of shows, actually. It makes me feel good without having toexercise or do charity lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Qq1zFDbVEJk/W5VC8fGA5vI/AAAAAAAAp_Q/g01putFq-i8cwzD6XScQdk8fxMmpZbWRgCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_19.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        MVP this bitch haha now I want to work with Ango lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S.
