Hey!!<br /><br />Thanks to my efforts of staying up a little longer for that
other Anime, I've officially made this post a whole lot shorter and boring.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay both shows here were awesome to be honest, and I may just switch
back next week if I wouldn't have to stay in the office maybe. Well, I couldn't
even make that promise to my mom for dinner, so we shall see. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Let's
get to it!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Just a good reminder Historia, your dad didn't explain two things when he took
out that syringe and otherwise Eren would want to warn you about, but hey, she
doesn't need to know. Poor girl. The new episode (#AttackOnTitan44) is blessed
with much-anticipated action (I WAITED 43 EPISODES FOR THIS), and what that old
man Reiss did not mention is that Historia will become a Titan which will drop
her from being the cutest girl in the series to being the ugliest in the series
lol, and... it's going to be painful, no matter what happens. And it sort of
did. Well, let's talk about the action first, shall we? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> It was awesome.
It's all the
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/omachikane" target="_blank">omachikane</a
>-screams all over for me, I tell you. From Levi's squad creating a strategy to
not lose out to an opponent force triple their size, knowing about opponent
weakness and taking them out in the smoke, Levi vs Kenny... I'm pleased. Hange
died a heroic death. #RIPHange but hey, that's quite a lot of opponents taken
down. Too bad it's not enough to intefere with the things happening deep within
the cavern yet. Rod Reiss tells the holy story of how Titans came to be, and has
always believed, like his ancestors, that this royal line will carry the power
to control and keep humans alive as a race. Not wrong, but there's the history
wipe thing. So yeah, nothing gets remembered outside of the past century besides
the one who had the power to erase them, namely Frieda, and potentially,
Historia. And as with all last-minute climaxes, Kenny may have anticipated for
the ending he hoped: For that little girl to change her mind. Letting Eren off
his mouthpiece, and even though Eren said it was all his dad's fault for
starting everything so he wouldn't fight back (not wrong, his dad's the worst,
and the reason why we're here), but even so, Historia wouldn't do it. Why?
Because of one best friend that will live in her heart forever: Ymir. To live
her own life, she chose not to obey the legacy; To defy God, to create a path
and name for herself as being the one who is the troublemaker and also the one
who will change history forever. Well, technically if you can get rid of the
summoning power than this world will eventually be in peace. (Eventually haha)
Not satisfied by the daughter's decision, Rod chose to take this matter into his
hands even though Kenny thought he was a puss and he wouldn't do it himself (but
I must say it's better that the new generation take the legacy so it can last
longer than if that old man did it and we have to do this ritual in like, 5
years time again lol), and now we have to fight. Well, Eren has to since he's
the only one who will be capable of handling a Titan royal descendant? Fingers
crossed for Eren and the others; This one was already fated to be a bumpy
ride.<br />

Man, this was a nice story. The new episode (#Tsukumogami07) was not that Suou
thing I assure you, for we have another touching story to talk about. It all
started with a fire. Hey, those things happen real often in the Edo period, and
people die for it every time. Too bad man, the fire hydrant and sprinklers
weren't around yet lol. Okay, the story. An incense burner of a tsukumogami
recently got initiated into the rental store, telling his story about wanting to
meet his wife. I mean, for a tsukumogami? Following this mystery, a certain
Tsuruya-san was intending to have a celebration for the opening of his own store
in the area years after the fire, but man, there was more history than that.
Through the help of the pets in the shop lol, and little bit of #TheGossip
(don't you think I'll forget about this hashtag haha) we found out that he was
also one of the victims of the fire. Leaving the place in agony and forced to
sell his land, he brought his ill wife along back then and not long after, she
did not survive. And surprise surprise, he bought back the land he lived before
from the one who stole it from him forcefully. Now you should be able to guess
where this is going. Thank goodness Tsuruya-san did not manage to kill the
proprietor or it'll be two ghosts in the house, so yeah,thanks for not making
the house more haunted. Housing prices dropping real quickly as we speak lol. In
all things that end well, and with a flashback from Seiji, he managed to
convince the man to not take such an evil act of revenge, in view of moving on
from the sadness of his departed wife. Fortunately, they did give what the
arrogant lord deserved, so that's good enough. No really, what a jerk. (Are all
landlords like this?) Anyways, nice story as always, and again if you see me
write lesser than usual means I'm immersed and totally enjoying the show. Hey, a
good show needs no more words. Though I would beg to differ because the
dialogues are long as heck tbh haha<br />

P.S. #PlotTwist when Katsusaburo mentioned about the wife being dead years ago
OMFG Seiji's reaction is like mine haha we both got boomed real hard there about
the truth<br />P.P.S. By the way our new guest was not a tsukumogami according
to the rabbit brush haha it was just a possessed urn. Still not common today,
but there's a difference.<br /><br />

next time then, and until then... I might have to start thinking to finalise
#KN10YEARS because I see my work schedule ahead and it's not nice. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> Haha
