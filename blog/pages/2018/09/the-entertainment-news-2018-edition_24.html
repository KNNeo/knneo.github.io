Hey.<br /><br />I'm just worried about sending a message to ask about my work
tomorrow for some reason. Somehow I don't like to intercept busy people,
especially the super busy ones. You know, because they'll always be unhappy to
see your face.<br /><br />They don't? Okay I better ask before it's too late
tehe~ &lt;=Usagi impersonation<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Ooo what do we have there in the ending... Okay, the new episode
(#AttackOnTitan47) talks about what would be the biggest anti-climax of the
series and I'm going to spoil it here whether you like it or not: Kenny did NOT
turn into a Titan. Well, he doesn't have the physical strength to do so already
at this point. Looking at a grown-up Levi, he reminds himself of the past he
lived, surviving the family name and final crush by the then King (also a Reiss
obviously) Uri who ruled the lands who probably will forget him within a
century. Kenny was glad he survived, but not becuase he was chasing after
something in life. Contrary to others, he was not aiming for anything. He just
wanted to see the truth for himself. That, he may not have gone far enough.
Still, raising Levi apparently became his duty, and when he was ready to survive
on his own, he left the boy. Today, their roads crossed again, and it's not fate
that's the only thing keeping them together. Of course Levi wouldn't do the deed
of transforming into the Titan like Eren did, but maybe someday, it'll become
useful. Meanwhile, Historia becomes Queen for selling herself as the one who
saved the people within the walls, and remember those Titans and that werido
which can command all the other Titans? Now that we know how it works, it's time
for them to come back. We may be expecting more company. I mean, it's time.
Things are going to go exponentially up once we get the story-telling out of the
way. Next episode looks like a backstory to Eren's situation with his father
injecting him that Titan serum, gaining the power that he never wanted. Hey, not
enough people are stealing the royal family's powers, yes? It's time to let it
be known. On a side note, you think those other Titans that will come back stole
their powers too? Hmm... so much mystery to unfold I can't wait<br />

P.S. Not that I'm bored at the story, but I'm savouring it. Hey, it's that
backstory we asked for all this season already, I could at least enjoy it. Oh
well, Kenny's life of drama looks weird though, so don't ask if I had the same
experience even without the Titan backdrop<br />P.P.S. Sorry for my half-assed
enthusiasm and memory of this series but who's behind that beast Titan? Do we
know him? Oh we don't? I thought it was some reveal or something though (I
better not spoil myself by finding out the truth) (No I won't)<br />[Haha

In this new episode (#Tsukumogami10) of this rental shop series we finally get
into #TheGossip of the most important roles of them all: how Izumoya came to be.
And it seems like they have a backer. It's no Kickstarter by all means, but hey
Seiji likes money can't you see it in his face? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay serious talk, this
episode is about selling stuff to people. Specifically, Usagi the comb
apparently. Why? It's not that important at this point because we know that it
will never happen no matter what, but there are a few important things to take
note. Firstly, the shop is in debt. 20 ryo if you need a number. At first it was
a lending just like how this shop works, but sooner or later with interest (Hey
you thought it didn't exist in the Edo period?) this adds up to a lot,
coinciding to the point of two clients asking to buy their lending-only goods. I
mean, we wouldn't be happy if they sold Usagi off to be honest, and I'm still
glad they didn't because I legit teared up <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>, but it's more than just this.
Secondly, we know very little about Okou's story. Remember that Suou thing that
Sataro left with? Not true, ladies and gentlemen, for he told the only one he
had a crush on and trusted, which is Okou. So obviously it didn't get stolen,
and if it did, it was with the fire. So how did the rumour go away with the man?
Someone forked out 80 ryo to buy him another incense burner to save his
reputation and a potential marriage, you see. Very high price for keeping
someone alive potentially, but he left too anyway. Well, at least the money
wasn't a problem to get him hunted down and killed. Ignoring his fading trace,
Okou seems real concerned about sharing this with someone, so she took a
tsukumogami (or two) and told them. I don't think we ever got to know more of
that thereafter because I don't think Notetsu and Usagi will tell the others,
really. Lastly, that priest standing outside their store. So yeah, he sensed the
prescence of tsukumogami, and is apparently here to cleanse the place? Sure bro,
for without them we wouldn't have this series. So f**k you and your warped
senses for you got taken care of by a comb lmao I wish I could help spread the
rumours on the streets on this but nah we gotta protect these wonderful
"neighbours" hehe they are great papparazzi btw<br />

Just a general opinion here but I may not have any shows to watch next season.
Thank goodness for BANANA FISH, right?? Okay, let's talk about my opinions of
the list of doubtful shows I may watch next season:<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <strike>So... ra no</strike> So, <b>Sora to Umi no Aida</b> (premiers 3rd
    October) is like Haifuri but better? Ugh
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Uchi no Maid Usa Sugiru&nbsp;</b>(premiers 5th October): Considering it's
    a comedy show instead of those serious ones with an adult with a kid, and
    Nu-chan (Numakura Manami) is acting the maid #JobHuntGoals, this will make a
    great premise for some laughs. Now I just have to try to give those
    Anime-character theme songs...
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Seishin Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai</b> (premiers
    6th October): What "Puberty Syndrome"?? You call that "puberty", you idiots!
    Again, I know it's Anime but big breasts are not my thing. It's too big
    (literally) a distraction for me to appreciate any show.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Gaikotsu Shokutei'in Honda-san</b> (premiers 7th October): Yes Honda-san
    is the skeleton, and living in a bookstore with a bunch of weird faces. Hey,
    just in case you got sick of staring people in the face, this one's a good
    alternative. Also, the animation is too sketchy. Well, I may expecting too
    much on that part maybe.&nbsp;But man, not as cute as
    <a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/24031/Denki-gai_no_Honya-san"
      target="_blank"
      >Denkigai no Honya-san</a
    >. And I'm not going to expect character development considering the huge
    cast. I may just watch one episode just to hear manly Kitamura Eri voice her
    feminine role lol the trailer
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ore ga Suki Nano wa Imouto Dakedo Imouto Janai</b> (premiers 10th
    October): So it's just Eromanga-sensei? We've watched that, bro. Oh, the
    younger sister is not a jerk and the brother is not that dumb? Ah maybe not
    it's still not a good reason to give that opening theme song- THEY'VE GOT
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/33795/Reina_Kondou" target="_blank"
      >KONDOU REINA</a
    >!! I'M IN!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (A reminder that she is Hana-chan from "Slow Start")
    (I'll probably watch this even though we all know the perfect imouto is
    <a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/character/19571/Ui_Hirasawa"
      target="_blank"
      >Hirasawa Ui</a
    >
    always)
  </li>
</ul>
As of now? None of the above. Although I'll probably watch a couple when the
time comes so that I won't bore myself to death with mafia revenge lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I
hope you guys did notice the pop-up element I improved in CSS because it's going
to a whole new level hopefully if I can get it sorted out by this weekend. If
you need hints wait 5 seconds and you'll see text flash. Now that I can use that
to embed any code I want be prepared to see more referenced text in the near
future. That's my enthusiastic promise, to you guys. Or whoever is here for some
reason lol. Cya guys soon for that Review hopefully it's on its way btw
