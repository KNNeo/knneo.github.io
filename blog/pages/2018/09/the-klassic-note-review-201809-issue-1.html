Hey, guys.<br /><br />Before I forget, I'll be releasing the Entertainment News late tonight because I'll be catching the latest episode of "Asobi Asobase" before I sleep. Yes, Japanese AND another time with subtitles. So yeah, then I'll release it so I can relief the load on tomorrow's post considering I have to watch three shows on Monday which... doesn't sound great for my work life now lol<br /><br />Okay, let's start. This was meant to be done by the end of last month, but... work. Hey, I have to blame something for this. Regardless, it's Sambomaster on the table again!! FINALLY SOME GOOD RELEASE THIS YEAR lol okay let's get to it then!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Sambomaster - Kagayaki Dashite Hashitteku [Single]<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/31/VICL-37419.jpg" height="320" width="320" /></div>(You know if anything else a cover art contains a school girl that it's a good cover hehe)<br /><br />Origin: We should be familiar with Sambomaster, namely still the most famous Rock n' Roll band in Japan and still promoting and encouraging peoples' hearts all over the country. If you don't like them, you really need to give them a listen. Today with these guys, I always get excited, touched, and every other emotion in between. It's like an emotional rollercoaster every time with them. Today, they stand strong with 20 years of music experience behind their backs, and this one got through because of a specific television drama. And with it, comes the most touching work the trio have come up till date. Introducing the veteran, the legacy, and the always nostalgic future of Rock music in Klassic Note and their latest single, and you'll know why I didn't even hesitate to jump right into this one.<br /><br />[*Note: There is no official listing of both the Limited Edition and Regular Edition singles but they do exist. It is implied that the Regular Ediiton single is a 1CD release which does not contain the live CD]<br /><br />(1) Kagayaki Dashite Hashitteku [Running and Shining]<br />From the chorus:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Don't give up your heart, let it shine on</div><div style="text-align: center;">It's okay, (you) will overcome</div><div style="text-align: center;">Don't be disheartened and please smile, bring up (your) chest and go</div><div style="text-align: center;">Because you, (are) sure to be my miracle"</div></blockquote>Of course, the topic song. It was the topic for the television drama it was credited for (which is from a movie which talks about a jorney of a girl joining the cheerleader dancing group in school), and of course without much relation to it, I find hard to give them just the melody, so like every other Collection artist which I gave the thumbs up for, I always give a second chance. Diving into the lyrics did I know how much I felt for this song, considering when I heard this half a month ago I was still searching for a job. This song told me not to give up. This song taught me to overcome, be confident, and to presevere for I am a miracle to exist. Hey, with such lyrics, it's hard to not be touched. Coupled with a nostalgic yet fresh melody from these guys which I favour, you got yourself a successful song. Wonderful all around, and the lyrics will get you out of your latest rut, I promise.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(2) Dekikkonai wo Yara Nakucha [Have To Do (Something That I) Cannot Do]<br />From the chorus:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Don't give up, regardless of when; you can do it, whatever it is</div><div style="text-align: center;">Now in this world (I) see the only strong force (in you)</div><div style="text-align: center;">Things that you cannot do, you can (actually) do it; don't lie</div><div style="text-align: center;">Now in this world (I) see the only strong light (in you)"</div></blockquote>This was definitely not the deciding factor when it comes to giving this single mainly because this was already given. Credited as the insert song for the same drama mentioned above, this was actually a self cover of the original song back in 2010 when it was also credited for another show if I'm not wrong. Fast forward nearly 8 years into this release, and this song it still great. The melody caught my attention back then almost immediately, and the lyrics - after much learning of Japanese back then - brought much meaning. Again, around the premises of never giving up no matter what, this one brings the never-die spirit and straightforward singing into a new level. Forget about songs which bring subtle meaning or even no meaning; Those with meaning will bring out the best in them, especially songs like these. And this one, the one sung in many lives and loved by the fans, is definitely the first song I'll introduce you to so that you'll love Sambomaster as much as I do. What may be slightly different (I suppose they bought the license for this song since they switched music labels) is in the rendition of the instrumentals since this was actually re-done, so maybe not as awesome as the original. Other than that, it's a treasure.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Above Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: I couldn't say much about giving this single, but if you liked the topic song then you'll love this single, I assure you. As a long time Sambomaster fan, I've always appreciated their efforts for making simple melodies which have heavy meaning in their lyrics, and I would say this is a true example of their contributions. Give them a listen to if you haven't, and maybe, just maybe, it'll touch your heart too. Turn away, and you may never have a chance to be touched by music again.<br /><br /><br />- Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />Goddammit the PLAYPASS code expired the end of the month??? WHERE WAS I? Oh I decided to wait for the weekend to review this. Oops.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bO6vOuUsmTs/W4uGVrA8fuI/AAAAAAAAp0U/oC1laO3jUywd8WS-6iYajtRsIZAlic5GwCKgBGAs/s320/IMG_20180902_135226.jpg" width="320" /></div>As you can NOT see, the CD comes with a piece of paper with a link to download the digital version of the single FOR FREE using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.playpass.android.player" target="_blank">PLAYPASS</a> on your smartphone, but I missed it. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Well, I have Apple Music already so this doesn't mean much to me to be honest. But as you can see above, it's your usual wonderfully packaged disc release, with the girl (I didn't bother to check who she is, but I assume it's from the show) on the cover. That's pretty much it, really. Simple without much free gifts (besides the free download) and it's okay, because the price won't be high. Well, it's as cheap as I can get from CDJapan so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />Wait...<br /><br />*playing with phone*<br /><br />Wait...!<br /><br />I think I did manage to download a free copy of the single! YES!! Well, (it's 128kbps AAC but still) (okay there's 320kbps but it's still AAC though) thanks Rechoku for giving me a couple of days for this anyways, Now I have a Facebook account attached to your sub-service. You're welcome haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I better get back to work. I like how I wanted to do work for the week while listening to Sambomaster's live later (I meant that one I mentioned weeks ago which I didn't have time to), so I better do it. Cya guys tonight then, but later than usual, so yeah, go sleep or something first, yes? I'm already missing my sleep already lol haha bye<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Klassic Note</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
