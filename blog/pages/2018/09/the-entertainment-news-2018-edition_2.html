Which is actually watching livestream with the Japanese and thenwatching it the second time with subtitles. Not very fun. I need more time tocomment on all the jokes tbh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But hey, if tomorrow I have to OT atleast I won't have to rush. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> Haha not yet I'm not in that deep<br /><br />Ihope the earlier warning in the form of a Klassic Note Review is enough toensure someone went to sleep instead of waited hours at this... place whereprobably no one knows but me. Thanks, not SEO. That's how I keep my terriblyexpressed opinions off the Internet hehe let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote>Not doing quotes since most of them are reflective of the stupid reality we'regoing through in this series now, so yeah, I'm not that evil. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The newepisode (#BANANAFISH09) talks about the question I left on the previous episodeand what is the answer to all of it: who will have to take the drug, and whatwill happen. Who, we've tried to answer but damn did the author choose the easyway out, so not Ash, unfortunately. It obviously has to be someone else Ash hasto watch in despair so they chose Shorter, and since Eiji is a good friendlytarget to pick, it was the target of "fear" as exhibited from the drug. How thatdrug on Griffin back in the war worked so well on the squad we won't know, butthis one was quite of a stuggle, I guess. Ash and the guys reached the mansion,enjoyed some pep talk with the old man for a while, and the real drama begins.Hey, to be honest, I didn't sign up for this when I decided to give this show achance. Then again, what was presented was an ethical situation for Golzine toshow the military leaders on how one can be used, with the help of the drug, tokill basically anyone you want. I mean, ordering soldiers to kill is pretty muchthe same thing and I don't see why you would need this much to do that, but hey,that one scientist is an idiot. (Sometimes I wonder how much he got paid beforeGolzine slits his throat) Not going to spoil much for you guys, but Shorter hasto die. Because this is BANANA FISH, Ash is too important to die, and if Eijidies we cannot justify the Japanese thing in this show anymore. Remember, thisis still America. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> What will happen next from here? I mean, Golzine hada fun time sleeping with that China boy and Eiji, so... I don't know? Hopefullyrebellion forces ranging from stealth invesgitations and gang form-ups to alittle bit of cliffhanger luck we may get a happier ending. Hey, gotta beoptimistic at this time. How many people can we inject that drug into anyway?Well, there's Max, for starters. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Man, I'm so evil and disgusted atmyself. That's what happens when you have too much money and power, ladies andgentleman. You start to like little boys and destroy the world.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o-ALKKFD9d4/W4tM8iFSvhI/AAAAAAAApyU/S4WJYQYZvXgEmSyjgbq1lhP6Q0r9AIrvwCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish09_bed.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            WTF am I looking at "I didn't sign up for this" lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eJRc_o2xahg/W4tM8wU8yOI/AAAAAAAApyY/2f3q58h9w1Ee54SippRz5Hn6hIgSVf27ACLcBGAs/s320/bananafish09_wine.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when I don't know wine and everyone says the name and year          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. You know, the good thing about liking little boys (haha) is that you areable to sell all the little girls because you know you're not interested inf**king them lol Golzine you bald freak<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ChioChan09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I'll never forget a high school girl's name once I've heard it... NEVER!!"    lol I mean, I wouldn't say that publicly myself but  </div></blockquote>I miss good old Chio-chan already. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay the new episode (#ChioChan09)talks about image change, not killing yourself down a <strike>man</strike> pipe,and Andou-san has a lover??? Man, they all sound ridiculous than before eventhough there's no ass involved for some reason lol, butt let's talk about them.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Firstly, Chio-chan. She didn't study for her test once again (andthat's why maybe smart home speakers may be useful at a time like this) becauseof one query she could've just asked her mom lol, and now she has to pray forherself to not fail it. Thankfully, that one Master who taught Kushitori-senpaiwho is just basically a homeless guy overheard her request, and instead decidedto teach her to be a... I don't want to piss off Hanako from "Asobi Asobase",so... someone who wins in looks. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> It didn't go very well of course incase you thought it did, and apparently good old below-average her is better. Iagree. Oh okay I'm doing it wrong. *speaks in a fat pervert voice* I agree.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, next up is Chio-chan's perception of coolness, and basically howAndou-san is trying to create that image? I don't know Andou-san, you date highschool girls at your age?? Anyways, it started with Chio-chan thinking thatAndou-san (not the sister) is cool after throwing a newspaper into the mailboxacross the street for some reason, smoking cigar instead of the normal stick,and doing BL actions in the streets? I mean, we do know something's wrong inAndou's perception of wooing a school girl like Chio, but man did it go waaayoff. That, and Manana's reaction to this whole thing feels like these main twogirls are in love with each other. Hey, I mean, they did that wall thing onepisode 2 so I guess? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, sounds complicated enough, this show.From future depictions to learning the wrong stuff from someone you like to thatcat which freaked out seeing Chio-chan again... this show's got everything. Nextweek looks even better with probably the meeting up between the Andou siblings(yes that kid who pokes peoples' buttholes for some reason) and I can't wait.Not the penetration though, just the jokes. Even though I would argue that jokesdo penetrate somehow... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QtBR9LOG-3w/W4tWxfZT0GI/AAAAAAAApys/xVUiCIBzXkMKws-0Ey0UZjzZhYwoGqKCgCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan09_chio1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            A memorial (lol) to the cuteness that is Chio-chan hehe          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lGYMDl5xtys/W4tWxcb1CdI/AAAAAAAApyo/3rFzUF4GT3wXz_BM1UfJI1p_t2lU1KqKQCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan09_chio2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            A memorial (lol) to the cuteness that is Chio-chan hehe          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "So what's that about porn mag level sexiness?" I mean, as a woman youstill have a vag-<br />P.P.S. I like that reference to that BL magazineChio-chan bought two weeks ago lol Andou-san you have no idea how thathappened<br />[Because Manana keeps doing it so I can't help but make a GIF]<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img loading="lazy"    border="0"    data-original-height="180"    data-original-width="320"    src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lbc9jVhGmN4/W4tYa3kl4RI/AAAAAAAApy8/1BytahHJHY0oFaChxlF6A7N2UCWai7bkgCLcBGAs/s1600/chiochan09_stroking.gif"  /></div><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I wish she wouldn't use an example that seems weirdly possible for her"    lmao REALLY OLIVIA? On second thoughts I think she may have the butt to    survive a fall <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span>  </div></blockquote>Once again, I must relate heavily to Olivia-san for being so lazy to study andapproach others yet also screwing first impressions up so bad you can only havea handful of friends and people will never know who you are because you faked itin the first place lol. Okay, that's as far as similarities go as in the newepisode (#AsobiAsobase09) the author tries not to draw worse-looking charactersthan<strike>the shougi club president when she threw that shoe</strike><strike>Hanako's grandfather</strike> Maeda lol that's my benchmark right therehaha. Firstly, let's talk about Olivia herself instead of the upcoming newcharacter. She as a middle school student... let's say she has some problems.From lying to the class to missing out in the action, she wants these to clearup. Unfortunately, Hanako is less willing to help her out physically (I mean,the classmate is right about starting the rumour on LINE btw), and Kasumi...let's just say they should've warned her first. But I agree with Kasumi'sreasoning which is also probably the original work author's reasoning which isto make sure she doesn't become popular or else the second half of this episodewill not exist haha okay let's get back here. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, they almost gottwo classmates to believe it which is a pity, and now she has to represent theclass in a English recital competition. Which bring sus to part two. Maeda'sback again, this time prepared to jump in when necessary to solve Olivia'sproblem which is technically Hanako's problem (Kasumi totally saw that coming,his appearance in the room) (I seriously rewinded back to see whether Kasumi wassitting normally and she isn't lol) (She isn't for most of the episode anyway soI guess the animators want to make their own lives easier?) by... re-modellingthat one android Hanako destroyed (#RIPKoiichiKun haha) and in comes Olivia withperfect speaking English. Sadly, thanks to the robot being made in conjunctionwith the grandfather who actually knows English (which explains why Hanako isgood at it) (but not in that aspect) we didn't get a good reputation for therobot as it starts speaking its own mind out which is nothing but vulgarities.So... yeah, their club advisor almost got strangled to death. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Lastly,the brother. Yeah, I didn't have as much expectations as that Japanese audiencewatching the livestream with me which is lesser than Kasumi's which is waylesser than I-want-to-marry-a-rich-and-successful-man Hanako so... well I meanif you came here after watching the episode too bad there won't be spoilers butyeah, it was disappointing. And the only redeeming thing which would also provethat the brother and Olivia are blood-related (I mean, don't show me what thefather or mother looks like pls don't) is that pair of beautiful blue eyes.Other than that, we're greeted with a rude brute in public, literally an Animeotaku (which probably explains Olivia's enthusiasm in manga), and is superstuck-up just to get some magazine back which he probably with his job on twoPhDs, can probably buy another copy himself to save on the shame, as mentionedby Hanako's new poetic serialisation lol. He wasn't all that bad though, becauseI mean he has a good voice (already better than Hanako's grandfather imo), andhe can impress a Hanako. That's fine by me, actually. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I know this isnot a romcom, but heck I want to see Olivia's brother and Hanako cyber-dating.Just... just keep the cosplay photos away, please. *laughs and pukesprofusely*<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ORGD1IMR3Yw/W4v_wAb6d1I/AAAAAAAAp1c/M5ragjmctukeSh4US5pAcoCvyV0kztI7wCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase09_teacher.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            By the way it went real fast from this...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--nSQl1bLI-w/W4v_wM9T9VI/AAAAAAAAp1g/4KCC5uUy3m4VQ6t4HY2xqrej_x4mkMWBwCEwYBhgL/s320/asobiasobase09_strangle.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ... to this lol NOT THIS SENSEI if you want to kill the mangirl is            better!!          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Well if you speak like me there's a 70% chance lol<br />P.P.S. This sectionis reserved for my impressions from the cast's latest niconico live after there-broadcast from episodes 1 to 7. They asked which were the best episodes,talked about how Kasumi's chest (ep7) isn't as good as a mysterious book ofsecrets lol, and played some simple games. Well, nothing I was expecting butthey are cute so I forgive them. Also, the girls all have their social mediaoutlets, so I encourage you to give them some support while you're at it. Kino"Hanako" Hina has a Twitter account, Kohara "Kasumi" Konomi has an Instagramfeed, and recently Kohara-san talked about Nagae "Olivia" Rika also opening anInstagram, so yeah, go check those out. I love to support newbies like myselflol<br />[Because I can only fit two images in this review I chose anotherhehe]<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JnJccXxbidk/W4wAOZ7c_QI/AAAAAAAAp1o/sKsw62e2BuEiOndM2t80tSG1yaJrmXhggCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase09_olivia7.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Am I the only one who immediately knew she's fucked in this? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> A Channel</span>  </div></blockquote>In this out-of-the-world chapter (106) finally we have Nagi-chan again in thespotlight, as she wants to share something she likes (an Anime, specifically)with the girls. So too bad we won't see more... of her friends whom I don'tremember their names lol, but we'll get to see a sleepover! Well, not thosekinds of sleepover. It's thosewatch-until-you-drop-and-drink-until-you-cannot-make-it kind of sleepovers.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> That's Run-chan and Yuko's case by the way. For Tooru and Nagi-chan,they went all out. Well, as much as they can, and then when they wanted to sleepthey couldn't, mostly because they wrnt on to drink something hot. Hot coffee,apparently. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, I hope there isn't school tomorrow lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="361"          data-original-width="382"          height="188"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nmaHV-PGATE/W4vaBsiaqZI/AAAAAAAAp1M/s5affXZknvgcJRSBM4IFcuemXNfe3CHcACLcBGAs/s200/106-3.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="200"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I miss happy Nagi-chan already      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Hmm this week I continue the journey on giving songs from last week. Haha lifeis hard when you don't have all day to listen to songs, mind you. Also, givingsongs is hard now that you have 2000 songs behind your head. That and work andyou're going to forget those songs eventually. Great, so I can give more haha.<b>nano.RIPE's new album</b> wasn't impressive per se, but I would still give acouple of songs because their choruses are good and you know, Kimiko sang it.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> <b>GLIM SPANKY</b> has been stuck on my head for quite some time, soI'm giving a song or two to balance that. sphere... let's just say it'stroublesome to give them songs with only Apple Music. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><b>Scenarioart's new song</b> is only list now because I miss them, and<b>Murder by Death's new album</b> finally got into my brain and... it's weird.It's a lot harder to give than their previous album which I just give a coupleof them off my head. This time around? I listened to the whole thing and I stillcan't decide. Man, this is going to be tough. Benchmark tuner lower settingactivated! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Lastly, I want to give <b>SID's new mini-album</b> a chance.Period.<br /><br />Next week brings us <b>Aimer's new single</b> and from themusic video released earlier this weekend... it's great? It's quite a short songthough, and since pre-release may be as early as tomorrow maybe in retrospect Ishould listen earlier so I can properly give the song by Wednesdays when thereal physical release is out and the world knows of it lol. Also,<b>Tomatsu Haruka's new single</b> came in as fast as her announcement of heranniversary as a singer, so yeah, haven't heard of it yet, will probably golisten to it later for a preview or just... wait three days. Or three months ifyou only had Apple Music lol. Oh no, I won't wait that long, I promise.<br /><br />InTwitter news, I hope you didn't miss the<b>nano.RIPE livestream on YouTube</b> (it's a Lantis miracle haha) because Imissed half of it lol. I'm still glad I didn't miss the fan request segment(well it's just like, a chorus worth but still) but hey, it's just a taste ofwhat it's like if you go to their lives physically. Just go. I'm just not asenthusiastic to do that unfortunately haha. Also,<b>Sambomaster's live in Budokan</b> was impressive. Some of the older songs Ididn't expect them to sing (I guess they would if you went to their lives backthen), they are as enthusiastic as they are emotional (moments of silence, man),and they remind me of how rock n' roll should be like. Hey, for someone whohasn't heard much before them, I take pride on my interest in these guys. Alsoalso, I just reviewed their new single so do check it out. Pretty much what Isaid here actually lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm sleeping I havethings to settle tomorrow, and then some. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Work life, everyone. Hey, atleast I get paid doing it. Now to see if I need to change my phone before itgets extensively used and I can't hear my phone receiver without turning on myphone speaker lol haha good night guys<br /><br />[P.S.<a  href="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hyFdArrmYJmlZOAuF7LVZPhJlIAYgWzxhM0AxUyxuLEcsVDFpMUItWz5oIgkaSiVjPR09EwhPBTg_D2NXGQkubSpNfik0SDNcIR8wbX5_cT0fXDV9eV5tDXgxcVtxAWI_bQtoCXQ6fhx1ATM5MAk7Xw/small"  target="_blank"  >Desktop wallpaper for next week</a>. You're welcome. Sumipe's curves are just too much. I know I watch porn butshe... she's a treasure. Shame on that jerk who threatened her two years ago.Shame on you. It's our duty to oversee idols from afar. Support her and give heras much money as possible to keep her career going. Okay I won't go that far butstalking and killing her is seriously not in my mind. Some people are weird, Idon't know why. Okay bye I need to start dreaming of her soon haha]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
