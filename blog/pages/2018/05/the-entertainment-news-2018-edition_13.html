Remember last week's post? Did you see the surprise block of text(s) there? Oh you did? That's good. If you didn't, I didn't do much because I don't want to rant on a blog post about entertainment and it's also due to shame, so you can still read that if you want to. Just click or tap on the text(s).<br><br>Don't worry; I didn't miss my exams this week. *dry laughs* Doomsday is impending though. Like, on Tuesday? And I'm still doing this. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Two more days, people. Then I'll be happy again. Maybe.<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=FumikiriJikan05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Fumikiri Jikan</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Here's a good lesson for you guys: If you don't want to sprain your back squat instead of bend over to reach things on the floor when standing.</div></blockquote>WTF do people only confess their love in front of railroad crossings? Haha anyways the new episode (#FumikiriJikan05) talks about the loli goth. I've gotten your attention already, dear otaku? Let's move on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I guess it's less in-depth as the others as this old girl is complaining about her back but I guess it's funny for once. (As I said, make the episodes longer so I can laugh more or something) In comes her classmates who recognises her in that outfit and knows her in social media... well you get the point. Total shame for the girl it seems, until she know that her level of "disguise" has become someone's idolisation. That, she can take it as much as she wants. I don't have it since I don't do that but yeah. That's how it works. Photoshop enough and people will like your face lol<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlLvLTenoXphAWSXKhZD4V5gPcCW1f3d4DbhLtJxuyB_cJzdCRZknmyUI-jvwT2TDoXglLk5ILA_NyHyLSNegRoK_mV0UQ85pkt3VuVh_MB21FwPv5WC1NIbf8e-_MtG4mqp-kGKO93xVB/s320/fumikirijikan05_fukutome.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I see that Gothic outfit and I know I'm in for a good episode lol</table><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TadaKun06><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Oh come on Charles you got nothing bad to say AT ALL??? I mean, we're talking about Anime characters at least show some disrespect haha</div></blockquote>The new episode (#TadaKun06) brings us a big question: is there anything related between Teresa-chan and Tada-kun??? Okay, chances that there aren't, but I can't help but think about it. The new episode brings us Charles, chances are he's of royal standards too, he's the perfect man, and he's a candidate to be married to the future Queen of the nation. Yes, talking about you, Teresa-chan. I guess the Anime didn't seem to make of much impact (I mean, the most impact I got was from Alec-san which I can understand she has a huge responsibility on her hands) to bring out the idea of two things: the importance of Teresa having to make a decision of why she was in Japan and how this ties to her royal marriage, and how much the main couple are interested in each other whether through coincidence or interests. I don't know. I felt that it was weak. And I personally don't think smuggling those kids into a rich man's party will make it any easier for story-telling tbh. But at least something was clear at the end of the episode, and that is Teresa-chan is future Queen, she needs a husband, and Charles shall be it. Maybe. I mean, no other options? The problem is, we don't know. Unless we'd like to think that Tada-kun has ancestors tied to the Larsenberg royal family which is totally unlikely, there doesn't seem to have any easy solution to say that her future is not sealed. Which means this show is going to do it the hard way - talking us through romance. And you bet that's gonna be fun! I mean, up till now we haven't really gotten anything from them that is considered romantic (I mean, the jacket thing is just manners imo) so we don't know what any of the stuff in this episode means yet. I guess an action speaks a thousand words (<span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Tsuki ga Kirei), but I guess it's not enough. But hey, we are progressing. Halfway through the series already, and I have hopes that this story can still surprise me. I'll be looking forward to that.<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjizEDcDaXQQA-Z_wBNevoLZzp_6HyK1OUZBVUL3COY6KM4VTZDkXm_1pbb2TqZX-WQLBC5S4kZjoVXONw9gawQEmzwEr9r9c7mbclJAmc6N6F3xjkz4kHWB7BoT_6h9g3aA4EGjP2Ws90u/s320/tadakoi06_charles.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When someone is so perfectly handsome it pisses you off lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSg0R-CFXneyI4oh7YGfaRwBlc99TXTnVDoKZJOa7ADCtyzQAve6aQ_Vcw54xFEBDg8B4oWiuVJGm7JgjZMHfkbnweJhOiLbFQgvLZFyfFV3X7R_lcuyNFkJcvZfcP0eXb_jPJglUgiwxc/s320/tadakoi06_pissed.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When someone is so perfectly handsome it pisses you off lol</table></div></div>P.S.

The new episode (#WotaKoi05) talks about... the fifth character. He's not some competition or whatsoever unlike the other show above lol, but this one... it's Hirotaka's brother. Yeah, just family. And... there seems to be much misunderstanding just because Narumi hasn't seen the two for that long and those other two are just thinking too much lol. From exes to foiling a potential cheating relationship, I must say Kabakura and Koyanagi are really taking this to the extreme. But yeah, this is just a small addition, and yeah the brother Nao is more happy than worried now that the brother got his childhood friend back to become his partner, so that's good. Yeah, not much I can comment since it's rather short to be honest, and the games part... well if you think Narumi is terrible after the past few episodes think again haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgR7UDUMavH4gPnjgqIJngxhyanVCWdjxxLbSgk1r5vLOpyKK4rZDPw37B2Y9QXa2CuBVd80yzFbZPXV6gRHs7YF9ZnbnH53HRDQVCH9P1GKnWxqA_P1zgnZ9ayK-Wuyf0AbXg8Mv_6d8rl/s1600/wotakoi05_ex1.gif style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Sorry can't help but do the finger GIFs haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgib0_VoAvPspxdhd2LU43dvF14RVgflz68zQTKHa1Q_TLCqvwjCJgf6tfWY6u6Pvf71p_R91HYww6MWdAcC5ki2-ythBWEZfKFEPoNWWucpJBjzrjOZdlk0PnDzC_Dr-aBBVT01sDOLi7e/s1600/wotakoi05_ex2.gif style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Sorry can't help but do the finger GIFs haha</table></div></div>P.S. Honestly from a production standpoint I can totally see that the original work is from a 4-koma manga but I may be wrong... oh it's not haha but why then? Why they make it feel like so? I don't know. It just feels weird to me compared to the one above.<br>(*Fixed the title to follow the pronunciation. Turns out the use of the word "wotaku" which has the same meaning as without the 'w' is due to historical conflict in literature 20 years ago.)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>漫画</b></span><span class=head-title> Amaetai Hi wa Soba ni Ite.</span></div></blockquote>Wow that took some time to read lol. The 1st volume of Kawai Makoto-sensei's book is out, and I finally got a chance to read it. (Someday, sensei, I'll buy your <strike>boob</strike> books) Since it's all in Japanese, I'll summarise the story for you guys to garner some interest. In this world, there are humans. And there are androids. Who look like humans and benefit the society by serving as a friendly alternative to human professionals and machinery, especially in the service industry. Hinageshi is one of those ladies (I suppose there are males too, but) who is assigned to the maid part of the industry after receiving some level of training. The closest resemblance I can give you on this is maid employment in developed countries, but this is technically not human. She services a young student and manga author Kaede (this one's a him) who suffered from a recent incident following the death of both his parents. Yeah, sad story as usual, and Hinageshi kind of did her part to help him and cheer him up, so that's good news. Then again, Kaede is not alone, for he has acquaintances from the company he has to submit his work to, and there's the childhood friend Azuki, who probably is fond of him but the blockhead can't take any hints so whatever. (Up till here, think Anime Sangatsu no Lion's Kiriyama and his emotions and without shougi and the Kawamoto sisters.) Everything is well in the house, but there's one catch: Hinageshi has a crush on Kaede. It's not about societal hierarchy or race though, but because there's the one law which states that androids are not allowed to develop romantic relationships with humans. And androids technically still can. They just can't. That's the story.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=781 data-original-width=459 height=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEignQy-i9HXBeKr_GlaIZScg99t8tb_xsYwBZMc2D4jZ9iWr8V5yB6clQA7nAkFRw1bEaNtcrpjJ3mMKaGZwtM3xYGuuRBQE2RKUFwvUDlPdeb2sSBLSvhubnSw1cTxyvuoPLryxTJYLwbP/s320/amaetaihi_vol1_hinageshi.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=188><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Hinageshi, the android<br>(Yes I'm totally trying to sell her image here hehe)</table>Of course, it isn't that simple. There's one thing that will make this public, following heavy consequences in public shame and disrespect for androids if this isn't dealt with discretely or properly, as case studies show. The one thing, is that Hinageshi and Azuki can't keep thoughts to themselves. That's Anime level of honestly right there lol. So after finding out that Hinageshi has feelings for her owner, Azuki can't help but be stuck in a decision of whether to let her be or not. That she didn't decide, but she did discuss with her friend and the friend's house android. Yeah. That's probably where the problem starts to sprout. Hinageshi then gets a call of notice with a deadline of two weeks from a mysterious person to make a decision to do this discretely and avoid further problems. And guess what? Of course she denied. (Backstory required which I will not elaborate here) Even if it's from the senpai who has been taking care of her since the days as an android trainee. Yeah, someone's gotta be the bad guy here. But it doesn't stop there, and I don't think I should spoil any further.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=378 data-original-width=309 height=200 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlIK3E_U2bojYa6oeUvbcO1eRKaKauSzn-TuGnN4WJT8iopwfYcDzYOspYxqh6NpDdpvJwaYF1b3wFzJRpnvnbfVPPdpP9KtnZydlusFkj1fqzKCcNjQVXyJqb-f3zJmrl9nUNDVYVfOMK/s200/amaetaihi_vol1_azuki.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=163><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Azuki, the childhood friend<br>(Part-time stalker lol)</table>This is turning out to be more interesting than I thought. The first chapter gave me a bad impression of making me think a lot for androids, less for feelings, and it's just another love story. But man was I wrong. Within all the minuscule eyebrow twitching and emotion-sniffing (lol), huge racks (sorry Azuki-chan) and nonchalant faces (well there's only that one guy) is actually quite some depth in story to substantiate the end of this volume, which is the android decision to help the human along his life, see him grow up, and (hopefully) not fall in love because it's against the law. We shall see. Now that things have escalated to a new level, I can't help but think this might affect Kaede's reputation as a manga author. I don't know, Makoto-sensei. Blow my mind.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=365 data-original-width=343 height=200 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHa_KozqnaF6j2_qNEj2b8b2T82tThyPuE3R5Ef9vcAEWf0weVFsScDiGWuUlb-11KlSyAxVNIv2bg-PGoRMLXhoE_sBIFaV8jzb_uhJJH0lupurSUmfKRfJEHc_oVx670mbMqG8ArtE7w/s200/amaetaihi_vol1_kaede.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=187><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Kaede, the main guy<br>(Spoiler: He actually smiles on ONE occasion haha)</table><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>漫画</b></span><span class=head-title> Dagashi Kashi</span></div></blockquote>The new chapter (126) concludes the Anime part of the story (if you remember from two months ago) where Hotaru-chan comes back to the shop after... what seems to be a couple of months. (Hey, what a coincidence!) She knows of Hajime-san, and You-san has recovered. Physically. Not psychologically though. And don't worry, the ending plot in the Anime did not happen.

I'll likely give the one song from <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> because it's not her usual hyped style and I don't see a problem with it anyway. The B-side though is a no-no. <b>miwa's new single</b> is still hard to give, but the topic song I'll probably give as it's already an improvement from her singles from last year (thanks again Anime!) so that's good and also in view of the best album maybe. <b>Endou Yurika's first and final album</b> finally managed to wake me up with surprisingly not the one new song, but from her single from last year. That, I consider the epitome of her solo (Anime) singing career. The production has been unfair to her it seems. (<span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> PONY CANYON) Then again, she doesn't have much of a good singing voice, typically struggling to high-pitched voices and trying out music styles that less than suit her, but hey, what am I to say it. I expected her latest and last song to not disappoint though, but nah, maybe I've heard too much to give this song the get-go. <b>GLIM SPANKY's new single</b> didn't disappoint, so that's good news. I'll probably give it another listen to give more of their single. <b>Iwasaki Ai's new album</b> which was planned to release in physical copy this week has been delayed, but I can't wait any longer to make this official and it was too late before I realised I still had to wait another week so... I went to listen to it. And boy did it not disappoint. The entry point maybe harder than some of the above but once you get into it damn you can never let it go. My Twitter feed reflects on how crazy I got after hearing the one song in the release which broke my dull mood.<br><br>I'm still withholding from last week's releases but tentatively now it's... two from Tomacchan's album and 3 from Middle Kids. I've also got an influx of live videos from recent rock and music festivals which I can't wait to listen (there's a collaboration between Sambomaster and SPECIAL OTHERS??? <span class=emoji title=🤯>*mind blown*</span>) so I'll go through these thoroughly once I put that **** of a project behind me lol<br><br>Next week brings us the release I've been waiting for and that is <b>SPECIAL OTHERS ACOUSTIC new album</b>, and boy will I enjoy it. Hopefully. Coming in at a seemingly wrong time, I hope I will have the mood to listen to it when I have to. The topic piece is good though, for starters. On new release news, Asakura Momo is getting one in August (I think I said this before last week), <b>Hanazawa Kana is getting yet another single in July</b> and it's an Anime theme song?? Ooooo and <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES new album</b> will come in June. And yes, you should've heard of that news. I can confidently say I've lost all first-gen Klassic Note Collection Artists. <u>You will be remembered, Aqua Timez</u>. Their final live will be due end of the year similar to Chatmonchy. Yeah, you see what I mean now? <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en> And this is why I need to find new artists to listen.<br><br>So... that's all my favourite artists in Klassic Note disbanded following YUI, Ikimonogakari's "permanent hiatus", Chatmonchy due next month, and now Aqua Timez.<br><br><span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> <a href=https://t.co/wn30Jkpynj target=_blank>https://t.co/wn30Jkpynj</a></div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/993853614085976069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2018</a></blockquote><script async="" charset=utf-8 src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script>(Oh I didn't know this was a thing lol it'll make reading this post easier)<br><br><br><br><br>Oh, I actually do remember it's indie artist season right now in Klassic Note (lol why did I come up with that) but yeah since I've been busy I haven't got the time to listen to ALL of them.
