Hey. I have a feeling I'm playing too much Stardew Valley already, clearing
achievements left and right and I still CAN'T GET ALL THE ARTIFACTS!!!
GODAMMIT!!!<br /><br />Okay, I've vented out my mood for the week haha and
there's catching legendary fish too but let's move on<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

We know that whatever haiku is written here is still WAY better than one Asakura
Momo can come up with on the lift lol okay only I'll get that reference (Hint:
It's from the making video of their first live) lmao. Okay, the new episode
(#FumikiriJikan07) is the most productive we've ever seen anyone wait at a
railroad crossing thus far haha. Of course, I'm referring to the railroad
crossing poet, the legend. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> About this point you should think I'm making
fun of this girl already and you're probably right I am but then again what a
productive way to spend the few minutes of her time. Then again she is probably
wasting good time in front of the crossing despite writing a lot (that's gotta
cost her financially, no matter how little), and we may never see her appear in
public media anytime soon, but you know. It's just the one story. Maybe checking
your phone's social media feed is more productive than this. Maybe.<br />

P.S. And to whoever thinks I'm writing cr*p here's the 5-7-5 100% original haiku
I made up to put in the introductory quote:<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">„ÄéÊîæÈÄÅ„ÇÑ</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">‰∏âÂàÜ„Å†„Åë„ÅÆ</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <div style="text-align: center;">(Call me sensei, kid! lol)</div>
</div>
P.P.S. And to whoever needs explaining, it's (Japanese lessons alert) „Åª„ÅÜ„Åù„ÅÜ„ÇÑ
(5 syllables) for the first and last lines and „Åï„Çì„Å∑„Çì„Å†„Åë„ÅÆ (7 syllables) for
the middle. *imagines people bowing to me*<br /><br />

  </div>
</blockquote>
I'm like "Haha Teresa-chan what kind of sadness are you feeling right now when
you know the year's gonna be over?" when everyone was talking about the future.
I mean, that's pretty much the point in this week's new episode (#TadaKun08)
though, where everyone goes on a trip to snap some stars at night while talking
about love. You know. Where everyone is literally in one somehow. Ijuin fancies
the likes of Alec-san (lol generic opinion not mine), Yamashita has no idea he
is being loved even after drawing the fortune (<span class="emoji" title="üòâ">*wink*</span> Yui-chan), Pin-senpai
thinks he is being loved by HINA, Charles hopes he's being loved by Teresa (I
mean...), Hinako just hopes Pin-senpai isn't that blind to love, Teresa is
literally feeling pain in her chest after this episode and Tada-kun? Let's just
say he still loves his parents (even if passively when they are alive) than the
one woman in front of his eyes. Hey, what can I say? The show is still dropping
very subtle hints though here and there, even though we do not get any more
scoop to Teresa's past or Charles, and Alec's intuition as a woman is acting up.
Literally. Remember how she can sense (lol) HINAko and her identity as a gravure
idol? This time around... I mean, I hope she's not going to be the bad guy this
series; it'll look bad on her image. Although a confrontation would be necessary
lest the future Queen doesn't want to go back home. You know. Alec is some
important person in her life, after all.<br />

P.S. Ijuin-kun MVP this episode because he just keeps picking up on Alec-san and
I like it for some reason haha *memo memo* also Charles listens to Mozart?? Very
deep tastes in music *memo memo*<br />P.P.S. Tada-kun is like "Wow Teresa looks
great I should take a photo of... dammit the camera's fixed to the tripod!!" lol
(&lt;= referring to when he has to talk about growing up without his parents)<br /><br />

Imagine if chibi adventurer Kabakura would to hit the "Quit" button it'll be
shorter than that 3-minute show above lol okay the episode. The new episode
(#WotaKoi07) makes you wish that game within an Anime was real because it was
way above (sorry if I have to offend anyone) Sword Art Online or even KonoSuba
(yeah take that losers!! lol) because man the animation budget went way high on
this one lol. Okay, the real episode. We talk about... man, where should I
start? The guys on the girls first then. We talk about impressions. The male
colleagues went out for dinner, leaving the girls alone for themselves, well,
not entirely. So at the guys' side, we hear a lot about what makes Momose and
Koyanagi great (I mean, in image) (And yes, it doesn't mean anything unless you
like both of them lol *straight face*) and yes it kind of pisses Kabakura off
for some reason hehe and then there's the BL side. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> I'm not going to
talk about how conflicting the girls are despite being the most obvious topic of
the episode as concluded by the two male colleagues, but I would like to offer
my standpoint to their discussion. Totally standing with Koyanagi on this one
(Kabakura on top, and if you still don't get it they meant BL) backed up by my
experience in watching... the same thing but on the other gender lmao. (Okay now
you know my fetishes haha) All in all a fun episode to watch for sure, but yeah,
not much development I guess. But yes, it still makes of good jokes, and I'm
probably still here because I can take those. Well, not so much on the girls'
discussion because boy am I not interested in BL (pun not intended) and I'm glad
I don't haha. Now it just makes me wonder if there is going to ever have an
ending, this show. But hey, we can but hope. We're only halfway through this...
this... I don't know. See as you deem fit, fellow otaku. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span><br />

P.S. I think I should address this because the subtitles suck, but when Koyanagi
said her outfit was "not really free" she meant it was paid but "not (impossibly
[high]) priced" instead. That is as rough as a translation I can provide.
Japanese <em>is</em> tough to translate.<br /><br />

I'm going to blow your mind if you haven't understood the latest chapter (140)
but yeah, chances the Undertaker... was the father. (Audience: WHA-??) Haha, not
that I know of what is in the next chapter, but it definitely looks like so. You
can thank Yana-chan-sensei for making the last shot totally look like him haha.
(Chances it's not he mentioned "your father" anyways) So yeah, this chapter
concludes on the flashback, and confirms a couple of things that we've been
waiting like forever for. So yes, the brother wasn't killed. I mean, he was
stabbed and then gutted for the ring inside his stomach, but yeah, he wasn't
dead. And that, it is possible to revive him. I mean, should've blown his brains
out lol. Anyways, we can definitely infer that the blood transfusion thing going
on this arc for so long that we probably already forgot after all these
flashback chapters is part of making getting the real Ciel back on track, but
the least we know now that could be explained are two things. Firstly, what real
Ciel thinks of his successor, the one we have always known. I mean, we're
talking about unconventional means of saving the brother though, because the
only way anyone can stop the Devil's flame is likely... someone who is not
human. As of now, he doesn't bear a grudge. I wouldn't too though, if
considering life chose my brother instead of me and he... technically brought
back the Phantomhive family line back on track, probably seeking revenge and
living life with an endpoint, to say the least. The next, is the ending part. So
after so many chapters, we might finally understand what is of Undertaker all
this time along. I mean, he didn't help others besides Ciel all this time in
solving mysteries (exceptions do apply, remember the cruise?), he has total
understanding of the Phantomhives for some reason, and he has a familiar face
the more you look at his face without the long hair. Who is he?? I don't think
it's the father though. I mean, to be dead, become a shinigami and come rescue
his son? That sounds ridiculous even in Sebastian's means haha but yeah, maybe
an ancestor. Or a far relative. Well not so far considering chances are he's a
Phantomhive too... this is getting complicated. Oh well, might as well see what
happens next then. Man, Yana-chan-sensei, you totally blew my mind on this
one.<br />

I mean, I don't want to spoil it but the new chapter (104) is about matching
outfits. And yep like Nagi-chan I'm also surprised why Run-chan and Tooru have
never gotten matching anything together ever for some reason. And so they went
to buy a pair. Too bad Yuuko we'll never be able to make that work with
Nagi-chan (I mean, I like that idea though &lt;= her Dad) but still. The girls
had a good time, and probably did their parents. Sorry to Tooru but yeah
Run-chan looks great with her mother haha God I wished my mom was young lol<br />

Ah hah now we finally get a different path than the Anime (farewell Anime plot)
with the new chapter (128) as... <strike>Yutaka</strike> Beniyutaka or whatever
his weird name is, has a past. Of being part of the Shidare family. Of being
rich probably. But more importantly, not being a lover of dagashi. Yeah. Not
even a sliver of interest in this man. Normally we'll eradicate such people into
thin air already (lol it's just me) but no Hotaru offers a different
perspective: it is so that dagashi can be reinvented to be liked. Then again,
having no interest may not be the best thing, since not knowing anything
basically makes you unable to think outside the box in the first place. Hey,
Kokonotsu want to take over the Shidare Company yet? lol but whatever the case,
I supposed we're all as speechless as the boy, considering that it's technically
not our problem, and we don't even know the father's opinion (not you You-san)
in this matter. Well, I don't know. What I know is this is definitely not enough
to get the brother to inherit the company.<br />

I must say, I'm gradually getting disappointed in releases I want to give
chances to haha, and it's continuing its decline this week. But hey, I can find
replacements so don't you worry. <b>Ooishi Masayoshi's new single</b> for Anime
"Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai" was okay I guess I mean it's as Anime as an Anime
theme song could get and don't worry I'm not interested in its B-side AT ALL
haha let's move on. <b>Minase Inori's new album</b> is as disappointing to
listen in full as it is in preview, so yeah, I'm giving it a miss. I mean, if
you've got melodies I can't remember I can safely say I'll forget it as fast as
I can listen to them, and you bet I listen to this the moment it came out.
Instead, my brain is trying to give older releases on more songs over the past
few weeks. I'll probably give another tune from
<b>SPECIAL OTHER ACOUSTIC's new album</b> and also in preparation for next week
I'm giving the B-side from <b>Coalamode's new single</b> a chance I guess it
sounds way better than the Anime theme song anyway. Lastly, a certain someone
(we'll talk about that later) reminded me of
<b>Tainaka Sachi's new mini-album</b> and... man if you haven't listened to
classical music in your life it's going to be hard to convince you to like this
release. On the other hand I kind of like it as my brain keeps reminding me of
the melodies as much as I don't really want to give it. Hey, I respect my
brain's memories in dreams so she's in the list. Also, I took some time to give
<b>KANA-BOON's B-side compilation</b> a listen which was released two months ago
and... did I mention I didn't like the one style from them? This album is full
of it. Well, I did give one of them before which wasn't that style, so yeah. I
didn't give any new ones though.<br /><br />In recent Twitter news,
<b>Kawano Marina</b>&nbsp;(remember "A Channel" the Anime?) may be plotting her
comeback with another major debut so I'll look forward to that hopefully it's
not all baseball lol. Besides that, we've got
<b>album releases trailing the lines</b>&nbsp;on the next few months for Uesaka
Sumire (chances I won't listen to this though), nano.RIPE (#randomhype), THE
ORAL CIGARETTES (the topic song is not bad better than most of the stuff I
mention here now) and... Niitsu Yui (ex.Neats, RYTHEM) is finally releasing her
1st album in July!!! (#randomsuperhype #finally) Also, Yoru no Honki Dance
finally coming back with a new single? Oh man am I going to look forward to all
of these. TrySail's new single though? Not so much. You heard the preview? I'm
saving some money this time round haha thanks <strike>GRANDA</strike>
<strike>GARDENELI</strike> GARNiDELiA man I can't spell your band name<br /><br />Looking
forward, we're welcoming two album releases which feature two of the artists
mentioned earlier. <b>KANA-BOON's new mini-album</b> is a start to their series
of events to celebrate their 5th anniversary in major debut and the topic song
isn't disappointing to say the least, so that's a start.
<b>Coalamode's 2nd album</b> will also be released next week so I'd like to hear
for myself what else they've got after releasing all their indie songs in the
first major album hehe. I should also probably take a look on the recent live
event video footage to see if I can chance upon any more new songs to put in the
list. It's about time to put more artists in Klassic Note. Oh yeah, didn't go on
the indie search too for this year. I got to to that soon too.<br /><br />Of
course, at this point I'm more worried about pushing
<b>the agenda for #KN10YEARS</b> which proves to be a challenge more than a
hurdle as I still struggle to think of how to bring this up a notch considering
I even printed the cases for three CDs five years ago haha. I'll just spoil it
for now just in case I can't deliver in the next few weeks but the three CDs
will get an update with the next five year song lists, we'll get four special
compilations for ten years, and... a series of blog posts is in place. That, I
don't know how to present them better. Considering I'm taking them from the old
blog I may have to do some optimisations or redo it altogether. In any case I'm
determined to make this work somehow before I... officially become busy on all
these stuff but still! It's still Klassic Note, people. This probably won't make
it out of this place. Well, there's still Twitter so... maybe there? Just follow
me to stay tuned, yes?<br /><br /><br /><br />Ok we're done. Cya guys next week
then, and until then... I want to rewrite APoL so I can submit to Wattpad. Yes;
A Pack of Life, my lifelong novel dedicated to write the perfect animated story,
will soon reach public domain. No more cowering in a private website anymore,
people. I want to get Internet famous lol no that's not the point. I just want
to show others <strike>my childish writing</strike>&nbsp;h<strike
  >ow shitty of a action card game like Duel Masters it can be</strike
>
my perspective of the world. Hey, everyone can have an opinion of the world so
why can't I? Haha see you all next week.
