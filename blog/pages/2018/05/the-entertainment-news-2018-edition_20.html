I can confidently say (since Tuesday haha) that I'm happy again. Well, notuntil I have to see the results. Haha why do I have to make jokes on myself<br /><br />See? I'm in such a mood that I'm playing with so much CSS now&nbsp;lol noticehow short this post is?&nbsp;I'm trying an incentive-based blog post&nbsp;whereif you click on each paragraph from now on you'll get the next haha yeah it'sgoing to be like that now<br /><br />Nah just joking it's just for this week I'mnot that free to do so much inline code I don't intend to create a template ofand also it's adding a lot of extra text haha okay now that you know the secretgo ahead and continue reading I may monetize this if this method works lol<br /><br />Oh well I can't make it work I have too many stacking CSS divs lol let's move on<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="FumikiriJikan06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Fumikiri Jikan</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay this new episode (#FumikiriJikan06) is nothing short of lame, but at leastthe upside is its self-awareness lol. A girl stands by a railroad crossing (asper the plot) and an old man pokes his face on a nearby patch of grass beside ashrine under the crossing. (Yes Japanese build shrines anywhere where there ispresence of God) He was too embarrassed to come out because apparently he gotdrunk the night before, fell into the area and is without pants. So yeah, selfaware. So at this point of daylight he has only this girl to ask for help (Imean, the first person he can ask) but yeah, it's kind of tough. Despite all thehelp she got from the girl who probably has anything but some level of clothingfor him to hide his crotch so he can go home, he still thanks her with an orangehe accidentally got after his predicament. And... I can't talk any furtherbecause it's a word pun none of us will understand. And it's not even funny lol.Anyways, I just like how aware is the old man about how embarrassed he will bewithout his bottoms (I mean, look at other Anime for a comparison) and hetechnically does not stick out as a pervert even though he is in a situationthat will make him sound like one lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-008Yi7E7vy0/WwExpHtJ8-I/AAAAAAAAm5M/yp2CRrJWrqA07mi0nVms5o0yFa-UXG6mQCLcBGAs/s320/fumikirijikan06_shock.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I don't need to do a reaction video for this episode I just screengrab        lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Not going to do the word pun explanation because I think it's lame and Idon't really understand it myself anyway haha<br /><br /><span  class="hover"></span><span class="hover"></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TadaKun07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="hover"      >Nyanko Big didn't come home at all? He probably was at the salon dating      that female cat lmao</span    >  </div></blockquote>So wait, what? Is that a yes or a no, Yamashita?? Haha in the new episode(#TadaKun07) it's another character focus episode, and no it's not Nyanko Big wegot over that already and I'm totally correct that it has got to do with thatcat he got interested in, but it's an episode about Yui-chan. Remember? ThatTada-kun's sister which we wished we all had? (Okay, personally I'd much prefer<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/156094/Yui_Tada" target="_blank"  >the voice actress</a>behind it hehe) Yeah, it's her turn to<strike>be played by production</strike> have a chance to experience love forherself. And what more better way to do this then through her favourite medium,books? Well, specifically, through her favourite detective series... I don'tknow the name, but yeah, featuring that woman that the Twitter account had to<a  href="https://twitter.com/tadakoi_anime/status/995083684775522304"  target="_blank"  >promote the cast on</a>lol. (Ooo she's<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/22849/Masaki_Kurosaki"  target="_blank"  >Ichigo's mother</a>) Anyways, the episode talks physically about the missing of Nyanko Big whodesperately is trying to win over the cat whose owner is from the salon, butspiritually it's about Yui-chan trying to get over her love for Yamashita, thatjunior of Tada-kun who behaves like a dog okay that's not the point. The pointis... infatuation, I suppose. But again, what is wrong with that? Then again, atthis point both share similar points like it's only surface level in romance soyeah, you can technically still stand outside the house every day until she goesout with you haha yeah I'm talking about the cat. But yeah, in a similar way,Yui-chan can still...? Hmm I'll leave that for you guys to figure out. Thenagain, they haven't really made much progression on the Tada x Teresa stuff, soyeah, no plot progression I suppose. Another thing; I also felt the episode gota bit lost (like how they without Charles are searching for the cat lol) ontrying to connect this with everyone's understanding of romance. The cat's storyis fine, but also putting Yui-chan into the situation... maybe because thereisn't much context between Yamashita and Yui that makes it feel less substantialcompared to the others who technically have been together experiencing thingsand stuff come on Pin-senpai is already going out with his gravure idol- uh, Imean, that class chairwoman already for some reason. Still, the ending kind ofties the story together for Nyanko Big, and for Charles particularly as wefinally got a glimpse of what seems to be his time with Teresa in the past.Hmm... things need to get more interesting quick I'm getting impatient haha<br /><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDDbE8bFrwQ/WwE6RkHyVBI/AAAAAAAAm5Y/buk4zAOQRjwrC2chJ8Gvky0KT3ArUV-zACLcBGAs/s320/tadakun07_detective.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">EXPECTATION</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wmsH96mFxGc/WwE6SwKI6WI/AAAAAAAAm5c/G515FOEN0VU1jIAGVWKOsp9RY_SKr5r9wCLcBGAs/s320/tadakun07_pose.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            REALITY<br />(lol Yui-chan you so cute)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Once again taking some time to remind you kids not to punch yourgrandparents in the gut because we have to respect elders, yes? *looks at Yui*Also, it's THE THIRD TIME you mention of that quote already I've gotten bored ofit already you NERD haha<br />P.P.S. Also, another thing that substantiates mydoubt on storytelling this episode: Remember the slideshow you watched when Yuiemphasised how important the cat was when it went missing? Yeah, lack ofprevious context. If previous context were heavier this wouldn't even benecessary. As expected of original Anime haha oh well<br />(Yui-chan can be myfeather teaser anytime haha what?? Here's a GIF btw)<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A4dLyvcslGs/WwE7STBuGZI/AAAAAAAAm5o/pzGpsqk1z74q1b6eZwttkdwmujRT_si5ACLcBGAs/s1600/tadakun07_catnip.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Meow" xD</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="WotaKoi06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Yep, I most definitely went back to hear Nifuji impersonate Momose once more    lmao  </div></blockquote>I swear once you know the reason why Narumi-chan is sad about you'll changeperspectives immediately because I did lol. Okay the new episode (#WotaKoi06) isagain separated into two segments, so let's talk about them. Firstly, everythingthat is the text above. Momose Narumi-chan is sad for some reason because she'sacting normal?? Haha okay that because it's that in the manga she reads...(MAJOR SPOILERS) her favourite character died. Yeah. That's it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okaymoving on~ (No seriously I didn't cry because someone died... okay technically Idon't watch many shows with people dying so...) (Audience: Not even actionshows?) (I mean, do people die in BLEACH? Okay yeah there's the old man butstill it's not something to be sad about) Second half of the episode talks aboutChristmas and... it's kind of working out for Koyanagi and Kabakura because theguy just gets busy at the time of year and the girl... she's prepared forcosplaying (at winter Comiket which happens right after Christmas, if you arewondering) so all is well? I mean, of course it's not. Dating man, it's notabout getting that limited edition Anime figure (okay maybe it is) it's aboutthe two having a good time together. So yeah, the guy gentlemanly finishes hiswork so he can have one lovely dinner with his girlfriend. Good job, bro. On theother hand, we get to hear kids stories of Santa Claus and how Nao doesn't seemto have gotten laid yet. I mean, not like we know of lol. Anyways, wonderfulepisode actually compared to the past few tbh, and sorry if the stories aren'tas interesting as you thought it will be. I mean, my house don't even care aboutChristmas, mind you.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a68VCJQCoWI/WwFECoOhPvI/AAAAAAAAm50/Wg2coK-MLAw27lJ-tsZtOKN_MXzVeIEEQCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi07_kabakura.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The kind of happiness I want to be in seriously I'm so jealous of            Kabakura          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-194FuFLvTrQ/WwFEJqaqXeI/AAAAAAAAm54/Cutpg5nvrG0-8DFeEKwzkRzrApebhp0agCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi07_lift.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">#anime_irl</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. To clarify that word pun on the coffee scene, "<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/taihen"  target="_blank"  >taihen</a>" just means hard in this context working outside the cafe in the snow butNarumi is phrasing it as realistic (read as "<a  href="https://jisho.org/word/%E8%BF%AB%E7%9C%9F"  target="_blank"  >hakushin</a>") (okay maybe I'm just dumb because I can't break it down or she's just tryingto make a joke here) because of how sadly Nao as a worker as to stare at couplesconsidering he doesn't have a partner lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Nagasarete Airantou</span>  </div></blockquote>Eh... do we know those aliens?? Man, I cannot remember stuff. The new chapter(160) gives us the answer to the long pondered question of who is the actualLord of the South before Suzu-chan's sensei and that is... a bunch of aliens! Imean, why not, right? Funny they can get out of the island but these peoplecan't lol. Anyways, it's not about that. A bigger thing is that this wasactually due to an accident, I assume. Then again, aliens have been inhabitingthis island? Since when? I have a feeling I've seen this part before but I don'trecall. But then again, it's probably just to round the story up. So yeah, analien saved the Lord at the right time in the past, and left his mantle thereaccidentally even though he clearly stated it was also to send a message toprotect the forest. (I mean, seriously? You don't even live here) Oh well,mystery solved, ladies and gentlemen. Now I can sleep tight knowing that I justenjoyed a bunch of ecchi-related teases on Misaki and Suzu-chan haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="413"          data-original-width="483"          height="273"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZwjElnAy9fQ/WwGDxchetwI/AAAAAAAAm6I/gCEvUd7HtqsoH9nnaN7cPeRSDTjw0Ny2ACLcBGAs/s320/160-126.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        #foreshadowing haha no it's just an alien lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi</span>  </div></blockquote>Well... for this new chapter (127) it's just literally the last part of the lastepisode of season 2 of the Anime, but just done in the park instead of in theshop. Yeah. That's it. I'm done. Well, in the Anime they did not explain manythings, so from next chapter hopefully all will be explained.

Both have a good impression on Klassic Noteand I can't wait to give more. <b>Amamiya Sora is releasing her 2nd album</b> inJuly, <b>Kuso Iinkai is finally releasing a new single</b> after their albumwhich is like a year ago, and <b>Minase Inori sang a commercial song</b> about alemon soda drink and as usual<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/Xo2dIv0dkOY" target="_blank">the music video</a>stands out WAY more than the song for some reason haha idolism everyone<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OkayI'm done. In between playing games (Ugh screw you DOAXVV event) andexperimenting with CSS (when I don't even know how) I'm tired after a long dayoutside the house. Well, it was visiting my aunt's new house since the death ofhalf her family (well there's still her daughter) (and they live in ancodomunium now ie. private apartment) but still there's complication I don'twant to bother you about. Maybe you guys should get worried if I will spam moreposts over the next few weeks because finally I have time for<b>#KN10YEARS</b> and I swear if I'm not going to publicise the heck out of itat least I will finish it. Same thing as 5th year though and in case no oneknows what happened I'll just announce some compilation releases, talk about thepast 5 years, and the future of Klassic Note. As of now... really bleak lol.Anyways cya guys then my enthusiasm for this is going to wear off lol. Untilnext time... may I bless myself more energy and time to do this AND play thegames I want all day haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
