Haha, my mind is full of thatproject despite sinking into the Chinese New Year mood. Clearly stress is goingto be a big factor when it comes to my future job problems I can't put them downespecially when I have to do it "full-time"<br /><br />Maybe I should just workpart-time at a fast food restaurant haha okay let's move on<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSan06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It's how I normally sit" haha yeah WITH YOUR LEGS WIDE OPEN RIGHT haha and    that is how you don't get laid lol  </div></blockquote>Man, doesn't it piss your off when you see lovey-dovey action and yet NOTHINGHAPPENS?? Ugh. Haha, in the new episode (#TakagiSan06) it's the summer vacation,and of course, Takagi-san must find a way to tease poor Nishikata as much aspossible so he can continue his push-up regime to keep himself fit. (Well, Iassume he is ripped by now lol) Still, doesn't stop Nishikata from being dumbenough to accept all the offers that comes from Takagi, mainly because of herclever use of words to egg the poor boy to do stuff against his will. Hey, I'mnot talking about witch level powers, but still. Somehow he gets to play aroundwith the girl more often than ever, and even then he still hasn't learnt a trickor two from her. (Compare that to the other manga publication which isn'tfeatured here starring her with the mother) Nonetheless, it's still a joy (maybeI'm getting bored no boy is THIS dumb lol) to see Nishikata fall into the trapevery time, all the time, without realising that his persistent character isgetting in the way. We're halfway through already for this series (which isstill early according to Sanae-chan and Mina-chan haha), and we're not close toa conclusion, or chances we're not getting any. It's okay though, because thisis good enough. Just like how much of a tease this is just to watch through it,hoping for a happy ending somewhere haha man I'm as dumb as Nishikata so muchwishful thinking that is Takagi hehe<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uYOEVAoaDqw/WokdOUW9s6I/AAAAAAAAlTI/Hz3F51WkmrwFmEbQBhfz4dHZf9aZtceewCLcBGAs/s320/takagisan06_ride.jpg"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        A perfect summary of maintaining a relationship lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S.

Man, if not for friendship maintenance betweenYukari-chan and her retard friends (lol) who will give their well doneearly-finished homework to those slackers haha no seriously do your work earlyor just don't you'll get scolded and probably have a week to finish them allanyway lolol<br />[I noticed the segment looks terrible on mobile so I'll justput without the design here instead]<br /><ul>  <li>    Do not deny that you are embarrassed (lol what's the point of this show)  </li>  <li>Do learn to give up for the right reasons</li>  <li>    Do not refuse an offer especially if it means to satisfy your needs (thanks    for the juice)  </li>  <li>    Advice from previous episodes apply in the new episode (he still hasn't    learnt anything)  </li></ul><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DagashiKashiS206">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi 2</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Wow man Kokonotsu he's here to TAKE YOU DOWN lol "sweets corner"&nbsp;  </div></blockquote>HEY, FINALLY! PLOT DEVELOPMENT!!! The new episode (#DagashiKashiS206) talksabout what was left of a cliffhanger which is obviously just a signal of rivalryagainst the humble dagashi shop: the convenience. Considered as a staple tomodern society first-built amenities, Yutaka has brought a team of employees toopen shop in the small village, which no doubt, will attract crowds to theirshop and leave the poor establishment in the lurch. Still, Kokonotsu is justamazed, but not impressed, at what is in front of him. He blabbers feedback tohis opponent, refuses the offer to work for them, and disrespects his father bynot keeping up (the porn mag) business... he's got a lot more coming. Still,Hotaru is still pretty much stuck in his mind, and along with it, at least oneand a half seasons of lessons of how dagashi came to be. So yeah, you'd be crazyto say yes to any offer from that narcissistic freak of a manager haha. Still,no formal plan has been established on other side just yet, as we may get aquick insight to our other new character - that unenthusiastic employee of theconvenience store - turn back to even leave her current job for good. Who knows?It's not going to be a story of the century, but it's got to be something worthmore than those expensive whole cakes, right?<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aBP72txoOOY/Woki_HvD-hI/AAAAAAAAlTY/1uc6fwBJaI4poZyL1EjUyp7rmYwzNErywCLcBGAs/s320/dagashikashi_S2_06_sweets.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        The decorations lol<br />And seriously, that one whole cake can get you        one dagashi a day for like, a year haha      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. "I'll grab them with my both hands" I know Kokonotsu is talking aboutHotaru-chan lol you lose porn mags haha<br />P.P.S. And seriously, that hourlywage of 850yen (lol) which is above the average is probably <i>the </i>closestto Yutaka will ever get to convince Kokonotsu to ditch the family-owned shop tbhhaha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SlowStart07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Slow Start</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Man WTF did I just watch you guys sure this is not yuri? lol  </div></blockquote>As we may be looming on the side which I'll probably elaborate at the end, thenew episode (#SlowStart07) talks subtle about... no it's not something wrong.It's just maybe it's all the Anime experience that I had and this just turns outto be more than your usual girls' talk, and add in the fact that the pace ofthis show is slow, it kind of drags out the emotions especially awkwardness(come on even the end card too??) a little too long there. Still. The story goesthat Eiko saw the teacher drunk, and whatever happened I'll leave you to watch.It's not much of weird, but it's still unusual. Then again, that is not it. Andthe second half, I prefer. (Sorry Kamu you'll never get to know haha) Andsurprisingly, it ties back (pun not intended) properly (no really I'm not) toHana-chan herself, about her not mentioning about herself to her current buddingfriends. I wouldn't say it's bad, there probably is a better time to do thiswhich is definitely before any of these happened, but hey, there aren't any hugeconsequences to this so I won't say much. How to say... to set up this much justto talk about secrets and stuff maybe a bit of a stretch, but what is in my mindis more of the fact that the author put this teacher-student part in withoutthinking. Okay, maybe that did happened and it's like "heck, it's Anime" kind ofthing, I assume lol. Anyways, I'll forget this episode in an instant too, so noharm to me haha. I still prefer - like the previous episodes - where just donormal slice-of-life stuff, touch on jokes here and there, instead of focusingon emotional stuff. But hey, if this is the direction of this show now, Iactually do not mind. I just feel confused. The queries in my mind about thisepisode is probably going to loom over me for some time, I guess.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jMBuJw5-24w/WokrdMyr3II/AAAAAAAAlTo/pxVFCRcN4nM3UhKFQE0Im9Yn0DvdfmX2gCLcBGAs/s320/slowstart07_tokura.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I'm finding a thumbnail that isn't inappropriate, so here's Wishing Tree        Tokura haha      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Yeah it most definitely looks like something happened "the teacher tied meup" haha god this genre is so underrated? (I mean, I don't know)<br />P.P.S. Thepoint is Tokura is just so happy about being the victim considering she is theone doing it to other girls I suppose man this show is dark in the wrong senselol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Sangatsu no Lion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Just in case you were like me who is not in the know since last week, the    next episode will air 3rd March earliest. Cya guys then. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> WHAT THE    F-  </div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi</span>  </div></blockquote>The new chapters (111-112) following the recent episode of Anime is... rathershort. Hey, I'm not saying it's bad, but somehow the manga did not force me onbelieving the idea of the works compared to the Anime, which did kind of ramp itup a bit, but this time, I feel it's on the negative side. Things that aresummarised on the original work is expanded (the porn mags, for example), and Ican only let the Anime take credit for extending some of the scenes when theyhave to (thinking of Hotaru, for example), and that is pretty much it. Thediscussion was done in the convenience store instead of the dagashi shop, thesimplification for introductions of not asking for name... sometimes it feelsoff, and the Anime may not be rectifying it. But I'm glad I didn't read thisfirst or I'll sure be disappointed. And as mentioned in the Anime segment, we'reclose to the other new character we'll no doubt see her get involved in thisvery soon. I mean, who wants to work in a convenience store... right?<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="316"          data-original-width="314"          height="200"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-O5UUmU2ysGQ/WolpES7xX_I/AAAAAAAAlT4/f9VrAu-zWnAQd2reb5qCtgoCJ3f4oQKVwCLcBGAs/s200/dgsks111_08.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="198"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Just a show for the different in art form.<br />Yes, this is that weird        convenience store manager lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Nagasarete Airantou</span>  </div></blockquote>The new chapter (155) tells us that Yukino's plans to have some time with Ikutowas a huge success, thanks to that distraction last chapter which is also a hugesuccess lol. Anyways, they visit the only mind-reader youkai in the island, andapparently Ikuto's trip was with intention from the elder in the island.Thinking that way, one can't help but find out the romance preferences of theonly guy in the island right now (can I move there now we need to help Ikutoreally), and turns out he's too honest to have a specific preference. Although Iwould say it may not be the case if he's still at his hometown now, but at leasthe's still thinking about it. I mean, the girls on this island. Can't help but,I guess haha. All in all, we've (maybe?) known quite a lot more about Ikuto thanwe have little knowledge of him already (okay maybe the grandfather but) so weshould see some development along the way. Maybe. Honestly saying? I'm gladYukino took the effort to grow up. But maybe she should do some bathroom tripsif she doesn't want to wet the bed all the time lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="416"          data-original-width="622"          height="214"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wovHwr9K2JM/WoltLH6SzOI/AAAAAAAAlUE/4MmXxp1y72YkC9N1I9G6iheeKzUg06CMACLcBGAs/s320/155-14.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Poor Ikuto lol literally ALL the girls are against him okay maybe not        Suzu-chan      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Three new releases have appeared under the scope of Klassic Note thisValentine's Day week, in case you guys remembered that day instead of the otherone haha. (Yes I know I forgot to mention them last week so here it is) It canbe easily summarised in the Tweet below (chain Tweets are awesome), but I'lltalk about it a little more. I listened to <b>Friends latest mini-album</b> fromlast year because I watched the COUNTDOWN JAPAN live video from last year end,and found these guys sound great. Sadly, I think I'm still disappointed by theother music videos I hear on YouTube which are real similar to the one I gave,and the release was less than stellar. Still, I'm going to give a second chancenext week maybe, so I'll see about that. <b>SCANDAL's new album</b> is also out,but since from two years ago they changed their style to include more beats andpop elements, I've not been impressed by the new songs, not to say this release.So I guess I'll do a second round without caring for style or else I may beleaving them in the lurch just like what I did with miwa last year haha. Lastly,<b>the new single from Ohara Yuiko</b> is probably the best Valentine's Daygift, but problem is which version do you want. And if you may have noticed, thetwo releases are both qualified to be on my shelf. Sadly, even with Apple Music,I've not been thinking to any extent to put any of them on review. So yeah, sadto say I may have to pass. I don't think her compositions make of enoughsubstance, so this may be it too. Then again I hope I'll not see her again fornext season Anime I don't need this combo lol<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">  <div dir="ltr" lang="en">    What to listen this week (1): I heard them from a recent live video.
