Hey, how are you enjoying your long weekend? Haha, my mind is full of that
project despite sinking into the Chinese New Year mood. Clearly stress is going
to be a big factor when it comes to my future job problems I can't put them down
especially when I have to do it "full-time"<br /><br />Maybe I should just work
part-time at a fast food restaurant haha okay let's move on<br /><br /><br /><br />

Man, doesn't it piss your off when you see lovey-dovey action and yet NOTHING
HAPPENS?? Ugh. Haha, in the new episode (#TakagiSan06) it's the summer vacation,
and of course, Takagi-san must find a way to tease poor Nishikata as much as
possible so he can continue his push-up regime to keep himself fit. (Well, I
assume he is ripped by now lol) Still, doesn't stop Nishikata from being dumb
enough to accept all the offers that comes from Takagi, mainly because of her
clever use of words to egg the poor boy to do stuff against his will. Hey, I'm
not talking about witch level powers, but still. Somehow he gets to play around
with the girl more often than ever, and even then he still hasn't learnt a trick
or two from her. (Compare that to the other manga publication which isn't
featured here starring her with the mother) Nonetheless, it's still a joy (maybe
I'm getting bored no boy is THIS dumb lol) to see Nishikata fall into the trap
every time, all the time, without realising that his persistent character is
getting in the way. We're halfway through already for this series (which is
still early according to Sanae-chan and Mina-chan haha), and we're not close to
a conclusion, or chances we're not getting any. It's okay though, because this
is good enough. Just like how much of a tease this is just to watch through it,
hoping for a happy ending somewhere haha man I'm as dumb as Nishikata so much
wishful thinking that is Takagi hehe<br />

HEY, FINALLY! PLOT DEVELOPMENT!!! The new episode (#DagashiKashiS206) talks
about what was left of a cliffhanger which is obviously just a signal of rivalry
against the humble dagashi shop: the convenience. Considered as a staple to
modern society first-built amenities, Yutaka has brought a team of employees to
open shop in the small village, which no doubt, will attract crowds to their
shop and leave the poor establishment in the lurch. Still, Kokonotsu is just
amazed, but not impressed, at what is in front of him. He blabbers feedback to
his opponent, refuses the offer to work for them, and disrespects his father by
not keeping up (the porn mag) business... he's got a lot more coming. Still,
Hotaru is still pretty much stuck in his mind, and along with it, at least one
and a half seasons of lessons of how dagashi came to be. So yeah, you'd be crazy
to say yes to any offer from that narcissistic freak of a manager haha. Still,
no formal plan has been established on other side just yet, as we may get a
quick insight to our other new character - that unenthusiastic employee of the
convenience store - turn back to even leave her current job for good. Who knows?
It's not going to be a story of the century, but it's got to be something worth
more than those expensive whole cakes, right?<br />

As we may be looming on the side which I'll probably elaborate at the end, the
new episode (#SlowStart07) talks subtle about... no it's not something wrong.
It's just maybe it's all the Anime experience that I had and this just turns out
to be more than your usual girls' talk, and add in the fact that the pace of
this show is slow, it kind of drags out the emotions especially awkwardness
(come on even the end card too??) a little too long there. Still. The story goes
that Eiko saw the teacher drunk, and whatever happened I'll leave you to watch.
It's not much of weird, but it's still unusual. Then again, that is not it. And
the second half, I prefer. (Sorry Kamu you'll never get to know haha) And
surprisingly, it ties back (pun not intended) properly (no really I'm not) to
Hana-chan herself, about her not mentioning about herself to her current budding
friends. I wouldn't say it's bad, there probably is a better time to do this
which is definitely before any of these happened, but hey, there aren't any huge
consequences to this so I won't say much. How to say... to set up this much just
to talk about secrets and stuff maybe a bit of a stretch, but what is in my mind
is more of the fact that the author put this teacher-student part in without
thinking. Okay, maybe that did happened and it's like "heck, it's Anime" kind of
thing, I assume lol. Anyways, I'll forget this episode in an instant too, so no
harm to me haha. I still prefer - like the previous episodes - where just do
normal slice-of-life stuff, touch on jokes here and there, instead of focusing
on emotional stuff. But hey, if this is the direction of this show now, I
actually do not mind. I just feel confused. The queries in my mind about this
episode is probably going to loom over me for some time, I guess.<br />

P.S. Yeah it most definitely looks like something happened "the teacher tied me

point is Tokura is just so happy about being the victim considering she is the
one doing it to other girls I suppose man this show is dark in the wrong sense

The new chapters (111-112) following the recent episode of Anime is... rather
short. Hey, I'm not saying it's bad, but somehow the manga did not force me on
believing the idea of the works compared to the Anime, which did kind of ramp it
up a bit, but this time, I feel it's on the negative side. Things that are
summarised on the original work is expanded (the porn mags, for example), and I
can only let the Anime take credit for extending some of the scenes when they
have to (thinking of Hotaru, for example), and that is pretty much it. The
discussion was done in the convenience store instead of the dagashi shop, the
simplification for introductions of not asking for name... sometimes it feels
off, and the Anime may not be rectifying it. But I'm glad I didn't read this
first or I'll sure be disappointed. And as mentioned in the Anime segment, we're
close to the other new character we'll no doubt see her get involved in this
very soon. I mean, who wants to work in a convenience store... right?<br />

The new chapter (155) tells us that Yukino's plans to have some time with Ikuto
was a huge success, thanks to that distraction last chapter which is also a huge
success lol. Anyways, they visit the only mind-reader youkai in the island, and
apparently Ikuto's trip was with intention from the elder in the island.
Thinking that way, one can't help but find out the romance preferences of the
only guy in the island right now (can I move there now we need to help Ikuto
really), and turns out he's too honest to have a specific preference. Although I
would say it may not be the case if he's still at his hometown now, but at least
he's still thinking about it. I mean, the girls on this island. Can't help but,
I guess haha. All in all, we've (maybe?) known quite a lot more about Ikuto than
we have little knowledge of him already (okay maybe the grandfather but) so we
should see some development along the way. Maybe. Honestly saying? I'm glad
Yukino took the effort to grow up. But maybe she should do some bathroom trips
if she doesn't want to wet the bed all the time lol<br />

Three new releases have appeared under the scope of Klassic Note this
Valentine's Day week, in case you guys remembered that day instead of the other
one haha. (Yes I know I forgot to mention them last week so here it is) It can
be easily summarised in the Tweet below (chain Tweets are awesome), but I'll
talk about it a little more. I listened to <b>Friends latest mini-album</b> from
last year because I watched the COUNTDOWN JAPAN live video from last year end,
and found these guys sound great. Sadly, I think I'm still disappointed by the
other music videos I hear on YouTube which are real similar to the one I gave,
and the release was less than stellar. Still, I'm going to give a second chance
next week maybe, so I'll see about that. <b>SCANDAL's new album</b> is also out,
but since from two years ago they changed their style to include more beats and
pop elements, I've not been impressed by the new songs, not to say this release.
So I guess I'll do a second round without caring for style or else I may be
leaving them in the lurch just like what I did with miwa last year haha. Lastly,
<b>the new single from Ohara Yuiko</b> is probably the best Valentine's Day
gift, but problem is which version do you want. And if you may have noticed, the
two releases are both qualified to be on my shelf. Sadly, even with Apple Music,
I've not been thinking to any extent to put any of them on review. So yeah, sad
to say I may have to pass. I don't think her compositions make of enough
substance, so this may be it too. Then again I hope I'll not see her again for
next season Anime I don't need this combo lol<br />

<b>SpecialThanks is releasing their new mini-album next week</b> which is less
than impressive when I first heard the topic song music video, so hopefully my
perspective will change somehow. I've also heard
<b>ORESAMA is going to release a new album</b> on April, and the topic song...
probably is more digestible compared to the other singles I've tried to give
from last year, so I'll give it a listen when the time comes. Come on, I've
given high ranks for that one song last year, so I got to give them another
chance.<br /><br /><br /><br />I guess that is it. Not bothered to dive into
that stack of OVAs I haven't watched which I probably won't talk about it here
anyways but yeah, schoolwork is important I want to graduate anyway haha. Cya
guys next week then, and if you're kind enough to wish me a happy birthday
tomorrow over at my Twitter account it would make my day because my family made
mine today already. Until next time then.
