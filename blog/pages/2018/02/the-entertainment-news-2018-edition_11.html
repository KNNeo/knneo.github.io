BUT if you DIDN'T try to bypass that region restriction to watch the livestream just now, you have missed out. You know of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_head_recording target=_blank>dummy head microphone</a>? (It's <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording target=_blank>binaural sound synthesis</a> you peasants haha I'm an engineer) Yeah, they used the heck out of it. My headphone is breaking along with my heart and brain haha<br><br>Okay, time to talk about Entertainment. Thanks to a specific solo project I'm only spending Sundays to do this now. Yeah, still no progress. <span class=emoji title=üò©>*sigh*</span> I wish I can get this done and over with quickly. This one's the truth btw<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSan05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span class=head-title> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>I mean, can't Nishikata say something like "what's wrong with me coming here to buy books?" and cr*p out something like the soccer thing? He can buy nothing, you know.</div></blockquote>The new episode (#TakagiSan05) of this show reminds us once again that it isn't Takagi-san who is too smart, but Nishikata who is too dumb. Dear Nishikata, just keep the volume down next time, yes? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Anyways, story. Firstly, Nishikata is spending time studying alone instead of going out of his friends to play because if he doesn't score well he's going to lose his video games, courtesy of his tempered parents I assume. Still, Takagi-san feels bad about it in many ways than other, and decides to teach him... on the stuff that won't appear in the test lol. Takagi-san you cad. (Just think of it the other gender way, okay?) Also, I like the cut to Yukari-chan because she also seems to have that problem with video games lol, but in her case it's reward, which should be Nishikata's too maybe. Then again, didn't know video games are this much of a thing (my parents don't believe in them btw they think it's a waste of money), but seeing how two different people react to them - in failure - is fantastic lol. Then, there's the bookstore trip. I like how Nishikata is so worried about being found out something that he likes, even if it's something cheesy. Hey, that's what makes him him, people. Of course Takagi-san who passed by can't help but tease the heck out of him, even revealing to him her secret which turns out to be false, since she was lied to earlier anyways. Haha, whichever is true, I'll leave it to you to imagine. Lastly, in the rain. For starters, I will never say yes to lending my shirt to a girl (Rie-chan: "Ecchi"), even if it's the rain and I can see most of what's under her shirt haha (even I'm blushing lol), but then again Nishikata is as pure as he is gentlemanly, kindly gives his shirt away, and now that he lost the bet, he's probably going to parade the exchanged shirts with Takagi-san around the town so that everyone knows. Man Nishikata, you're an idiot. To end this, I like how many things can easily be avoided when Nishikata asks for more information, and also avoids the issue altogether. Although I must commend him for being concerned about his surroundings, even if it's a jerk like Takagi-san haha. Things everyone of us will do but not him easily summarises this show. Common sense is not in this boy, everyone. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsuNypdO1458464awSzhEJKIh1WFHkogk5ID-md8AddBR5UL1WChU2N-UHwQ8GIU12rrI-_Q4oneZ4GKmKbdpekTNz_cFc7oI7nY1TakpQ7Y2863v_xBgwW_XDDhajUSK6_54VF3xI_L7_/s320/takagisan05_yukari.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Man, I'm not even angry.

Well, with Hotaru gone missing (the manga reflects too btw refer to below to see if I've read it) Kokonotsu feels down, and so is the shop. Don't ask me why the dad is like that too, and how they got back the money to refurbish it back, but hey, at least it's back up. Sayashi got to enjoy a chat with him like they used to, and as usual Tou-kun is always at the wrong tempo lol. All in all, a great start to revive what is pretty much dead to Hotaru's appearance, and we may have something bigger in our hands. A competitior. Yeah, that modern day solution we all have come to know and (not where I live) always love: it's a convenience store. So yeah, finally one of the new characters will arrive as seen from the preview, and I can't wait to watch what is going to happen next. Will the store crush down Shikada Dagashi? Or will there be some kind of agreement? It all sounds impossible now, but I'd like it to happen. Hopefully with that huge-chested girl of the biggest sweets company in Japan who has gone missing for three story months lol<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQHERTVvB84meyr_72yw8DBl2wfi5O7qexpYUop6vbZ64Y8s4XEr9R8J-d81mnnwR_oKgh827Vs2uD54_hQBuCfAfhMFmK9ICzOtOSjRdSB1c9G3dvSSACo1CvNP6ehSMAOQCjYvzHgVL0/s320/dagashikashi_S2_05_punch.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When my Prof tells me &lt;insert excuse here> lol</table>P.S.

The new¬†<strike>nipple</strike>¬†episode (#SlowStart06) (lol) talks about a stay over. Hey, slice-of-life, everyone. Once again Shion is out of the apartment, which means Hana-chan can <strike>play</strike> uh I mean, study with everyone else for the day. Okay, maybe just the day. And with the help of Hiroe-san, they get through with great success, had a great dinner, and... well everything else seemingly falls into place. A nice touch for talking about being scared of stuff from Tama-chan which is quite typical of this series (which I'm starting to like), and also some way to present a different side of this show. All in all, I must say if I spoil more here you won't be able to enjoy what is in store. And if you have watched you'll know everything I say here will remind you of something wonderful in the episode. (I am SO tempted to spoil Hiroe-san's part) (AND THE BATH SCENES) (lol) On a side note, I think Hiroe is just trying to find excuses such that she doesn't have to dress well outside of her house. No seriously, wear pretty when throwing out the trash, yes?

Hotaru is missing for a season (in story), Kokonotsu is as run down as the shop, and the father broke the foot lol. Anyways, he restores it to its former glory, and upon thinking up of another strategy to win over the people, he notices someone has already done it. Cue, the convenience store! Yep, that's it for now. Other than that punch to Tou-kun's face, and that super detailed skeleton of You-san's bone break (lol), everything is as expected as you can see. I like the Anime. It takes it and adds a little more, which is good touch. And yes, the pace is perfect for just two chapters in an episode, and that's what is going to make me like the show anyways. Also, the manga. Yes Kotoyama-sensei, half the reason I started reading this is because I wanted to know more. Now that there's the Anime... well you're taking in the money anyway, so congrats haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=371 data-original-width=385 height=308 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1jEqpwV8ApBtZReSL71KfLFxxz27MKjnu9pOT9TX4VkM0MSDuKBRj4xKmJ0h1zKPssmuQGXFqRKdagqDYaWGFrFPfLUNkGZD4OiM07JJWzFtLqE9dpXfrShoQuYIO3zkQzL5it3oQYKIs/s320/109x4.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>No, this is not some ancient samurai drama lol You-san</table><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week brings us a couple of releases that... can't be compared together, so I'll talk about them separately. <b>Hanazawa Kana new single</b> is pretty good, I did give one of the two B-sides which is unusual for me anyways, but no cigar. No on-my-shelf release, sadly. Same thing with <b>nano.RIPE new single</b> which the official Twitter is promoting actively recently (I mean, even the illegal downloads?? They don't know), and despite it being the opening theme song for some yuri Anime, I still think it stands good on its own. Also, another B-side. Lastly, I don't think I want to talk about <b>LILI LIMIT new EP </b>considering I didn't like the preview I heard a couple of weeks ago and I still didn't like it when I heard it this week. Well, this is the other style of them I don't want to give, I guess. I'll pass, guys. Cya guys next release.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en> And yes, I did notice the recent official Twitter retweet phenomenon or what you call it, and honestly I don't care.

And we do have a romantic release waiting for us, and that is the <b>new single from Oohara Yuiko</b> (I'm trying to write it so it's searchable) which I've given a pass on her last season in Anime "Houseki no Kuni", if you thought the ending theme was terrible like I did. This one, I'll try to give. I want to burn that online voucher that online store gave me for my birthday.
