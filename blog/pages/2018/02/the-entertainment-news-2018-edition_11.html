I mean, if you never tried all of your means to go for the "Karakai Chocolate"
event with Takahashi Rie-chan (voices Takagi-san) in Japan, I can't blame you.
BUT if you DIDN'T try to bypass that region restriction to watch the livestream
just now, you have missed out. You know of the

you peasants haha I'm an engineer) Yeah, they used the heck out of it. My
headphone is breaking along with my heart and brain haha<br /><br />Okay, time
to talk about Entertainment. Thanks to a specific solo project I'm only spending
Sundays to do this now. Yeah, still no progress. <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> I wish I can get this
done and over with quickly. This one's the truth btw<br /><br /><br /><br />

The new episode (#TakagiSan05) of this show reminds us once again that it isn't
Takagi-san who is too smart, but Nishikata who is too dumb. Dear Nishikata, just
keep the volume down next time, yes? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, story. Firstly, Nishikata
is spending time studying alone instead of going out of his friends to play
because if he doesn't score well he's going to lose his video games, courtesy of
his tempered parents I assume. Still, Takagi-san feels bad about it in many ways
than other, and decides to teach him... on the stuff that won't appear in the
test lol. Takagi-san you cad. (Just think of it the other gender way, okay?)
Also, I like the cut to Yukari-chan because she also seems to have that problem
with video games lol, but in her case it's reward, which should be Nishikata's
too maybe. Then again, didn't know video games are this much of a thing (my
parents don't believe in them btw they think it's a waste of money), but seeing
how two different people react to them - in failure - is fantastic lol. Then,
there's the bookstore trip. I like how Nishikata is so worried about being found
out something that he likes, even if it's something cheesy. Hey, that's what
makes him him, people. Of course Takagi-san who passed by can't help but tease
the heck out of him, even revealing to him her secret which turns out to be
false, since she was lied to earlier anyways. Haha, whichever is true, I'll
leave it to you to imagine. Lastly, in the rain. For starters, I will never say
yes to lending my shirt to a girl (Rie-chan: "Ecchi"), even if it's the rain and
I can see most of what's under her shirt haha (even I'm blushing lol), but then
again Nishikata is as pure as he is gentlemanly, kindly gives his shirt away,
and now that he lost the bet, he's probably going to parade the exchanged shirts
with Takagi-san around the town so that everyone knows. Man Nishikata, you're an
idiot. To end this, I like how many things can easily be avoided when Nishikata
asks for more information, and also avoids the issue altogether. Although I must
commend him for being concerned about his surroundings, even if it's a jerk like
Takagi-san haha. Things everyone of us will do but not him easily summarises
this show. Common sense is not in this boy, everyone. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br />

The quote above fully summarises this new episode (#DagashiKashiS205) because
that is it. Well, with Hotaru gone missing (the manga reflects too btw refer to
below to see if I've read it) Kokonotsu feels down, and so is the shop. Don't
ask me why the dad is like that too, and how they got back the money to
refurbish it back, but hey, at least it's back up. Sayashi got to enjoy a chat
with him like they used to, and as usual Tou-kun is always at the wrong tempo
lol. All in all, a great start to revive what is pretty much dead to Hotaru's
appearance, and we may have something bigger in our hands. A competitior. Yeah,
that modern day solution we all have come to know and (not where I live) always
love: it's a convenience store. So yeah, finally one of the new characters will
arrive as seen from the preview, and I can't wait to watch what is going to
happen next. Will the store crush down Shikada Dagashi? Or will there be some
kind of agreement? It all sounds impossible now, but I'd like it to happen.
Hopefully with that huge-chested girl of the biggest sweets company in Japan who
has gone missing for three story months lol<br />

P.S. Thanks this episode Anime for putting on the focus for Sayashi because I've
never heard enough of Nu-chan (Numakura Manami) and I need more. I feel
satisfied now for some reason haha please don't hit me<br /><br /><br />

    What is with the weird opening from Shion and Tama-chan? lol
  </div>
</blockquote>
Yep, you didn't hear it wrongly. The
new&nbsp;<strike>nipple</strike>&nbsp;episode (#SlowStart06) (lol) talks about a
stay over. Hey, slice-of-life, everyone. Once again Shion is out of the
apartment, which means Hana-chan can <strike>play</strike> uh I mean, study with
everyone else for the day. Okay, maybe just the day. And with the help of
Hiroe-san, they get through with great success, had a great dinner, and... well
everything else seemingly falls into place. A nice touch for talking about being
scared of stuff from Tama-chan which is quite typical of this series (which I'm
starting to like), and also some way to present a different side of this show.
All in all, I must say if I spoil more here you won't be able to enjoy what is
in store. And if you have watched you'll know everything I say here will remind
you of something wonderful in the episode. (I am SO tempted to spoil Hiroe-san's
part) (AND THE BATH SCENES) (lol) On a side note, I think Hiroe is just trying
to find excuses such that she doesn't have to dress well outside of her house.
No seriously, wear pretty when throwing out the trash, yes? So that perverts on
the streets can-<br />

The "new" chapters (109-110) talked about EXACTLY what happened in the latest
episode of the Anime, so I'll go through this quick. Hotaru is missing for a
season (in story), Kokonotsu is as run down as the shop, and the father broke
the foot lol. Anyways, he restores it to its former glory, and upon thinking up
of another strategy to win over the people, he notices someone has already done
it. Cue, the convenience store! Yep, that's it for now. Other than that punch to
Tou-kun's face, and that super detailed skeleton of You-san's bone break (lol),
everything is as expected as you can see. I like the Anime. It takes it and adds
a little more, which is good touch. And yes, the pace is perfect for just two
chapters in an episode, and that's what is going to make me like the show
anyways. Also, the manga. Yes Kotoyama-sensei, half the reason I started reading
this is because I wanted to know more. Now that there's the Anime... well you're
taking in the money anyway, so congrats haha<br />

This week brings us a couple of releases that... can't be compared together, so
I'll talk about them separately. <b>Hanazawa Kana new single</b> is pretty good,
I did give one of the two B-sides which is unusual for me anyways, but no cigar.
No on-my-shelf release, sadly. Same thing with <b>nano.RIPE new single</b> which
the official Twitter is promoting actively recently (I mean, even the illegal
downloads?? They don't know), and despite it being the opening theme song for
some yuri Anime, I still think it stands good on its own. Also, another B-side.
Lastly, I don't think I want to talk about <b>LILI LIMIT new EP </b>considering
I didn't like the preview I heard a couple of weeks ago and I still didn't like
it when I heard it this week. Well, this is the other style of them I don't want
to give, I guess. I'll pass, guys. Cya guys next release.<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">

    And yes, I did notice the recent official Twitter retweet phenomenon or what
    you call it, and honestly I don't care. Remember what I am tweeting for.

Talking about next week... hey it's Valentine's Day! And we do have a romantic
release waiting for us, and that is the <b>new single from Oohara Yuiko</b> (I'm
trying to write it so it's searchable) which I've given a pass on her last
season in Anime "Houseki no Kuni", if you thought the ending theme was terrible
like I did. This one, I'll try to give. I want to burn that online voucher that
online store gave me for my birthday. One of them expired but I still got
another hehe I'll see about it<br /><br /><br /><br />This is it then. I will
talk about my motto for Klassic Note soon after my school semester ends in May
probably, and then will I go full on to complete the anniversary stuff I've
planned so much and yet to execute on. <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> I hate reports. Cya guys then, and
until next time... I guess I have to see the doctor again for my sinus
infection. I hear going for surgery is faster and easier too. Man, when will I
ever learn to seek medical assistance for flu as soon as possible? Haha bye
