You know of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_head_recording" target="_blank"  >dummy head microphone</a>? (It's<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_recording" target="_blank"  >binaural sound synthesis</a>you peasants haha I'm an engineer) Yeah, they used the heck out of it. Myheadphone is breaking along with my heart and brain haha<br /><br />Okay, timeto talk about Entertainment. Thanks to a specific solo project I'm only spendingSundays to do this now. Yeah, still no progress. <span class="emoji" title="üò©">*sigh*</span> I wish I can get thisdone and over with quickly. This one's the truth btw<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSan05">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    I mean, can't Nishikata say something like "what's wrong with me coming here    to buy books?" and cr*p out something like the soccer thing? He can buy    nothing, you know.  </div></blockquote>The new episode (#TakagiSan05) of this show reminds us once again that it isn'tTakagi-san who is too smart, but Nishikata who is too dumb. Dear Nishikata, justkeep the volume down next time, yes? <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> Anyways, story. Firstly, Nishikatais spending time studying alone instead of going out of his friends to playbecause if he doesn't score well he's going to lose his video games, courtesy ofhis tempered parents I assume. Still, Takagi-san feels bad about it in many waysthan other, and decides to teach him... on the stuff that won't appear in thetest lol. Takagi-san you cad. (Just think of it the other gender way, okay?)Also, I like the cut to Yukari-chan because she also seems to have that problemwith video games lol, but in her case it's reward, which should be Nishikata'stoo maybe. Then again, didn't know video games are this much of a thing (myparents don't believe in them btw they think it's a waste of money), but seeinghow two different people react to them - in failure - is fantastic lol. Then,there's the bookstore trip. I like how Nishikata is so worried about being foundout something that he likes, even if it's something cheesy. Hey, that's whatmakes him him, people. Of course Takagi-san who passed by can't help but teasethe heck out of him, even revealing to him her secret which turns out to befalse, since she was lied to earlier anyways. Haha, whichever is true, I'llleave it to you to imagine. Lastly, in the rain. For starters, I will never sayyes to lending my shirt to a girl (Rie-chan: "Ecchi"), even if it's the rain andI can see most of what's under her shirt haha (even I'm blushing lol), but thenagain Nishikata is as pure as he is gentlemanly, kindly gives his shirt away,and now that he lost the bet, he's probably going to parade the exchanged shirtswith Takagi-san around the town so that everyone knows. Man Nishikata, you're anidiot. To end this, I like how many things can easily be avoided when Nishikataasks for more information, and also avoids the issue altogether. Although I mustcommend him for being concerned about his surroundings, even if it's a jerk likeTakagi-san haha. Things everyone of us will do but not him easily summarisesthis show. Common sense is not in this boy, everyone. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span><br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LItaIjXyvCI/Wn_Z__wtAjI/AAAAAAAAlKA/S17pUhKkiqsRkOuq1tAvNYCWeY-kOWqLgCLcBGAs/s320/takagisan05_yukari.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Man, I'm not even angry.

Well, with Hotaru gone missing (the manga reflects too btw refer tobelow to see if I've read it) Kokonotsu feels down, and so is the shop. Don'task me why the dad is like that too, and how they got back the money torefurbish it back, but hey, at least it's back up. Sayashi got to enjoy a chatwith him like they used to, and as usual Tou-kun is always at the wrong tempolol. All in all, a great start to revive what is pretty much dead to Hotaru'sappearance, and we may have something bigger in our hands. A competitior. Yeah,that modern day solution we all have come to know and (not where I live) alwayslove: it's a convenience store. So yeah, finally one of the new characters willarrive as seen from the preview, and I can't wait to watch what is going tohappen next. Will the store crush down Shikada Dagashi? Or will there be somekind of agreement? It all sounds impossible now, but I'd like it to happen.Hopefully with that huge-chested girl of the biggest sweets company in Japan whohas gone missing for three story months lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dfMR8ClgmCU/Wn_ekEWIe3I/AAAAAAAAlKM/IJsE2SIeDvEH9FZaiRIYl7RStMPQ4hErgCLcBGAs/s320/dagashikashi_S2_05_punch.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        When my Prof tells me &lt;insert excuse here&gt; lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. Thanks this episode Anime for putting on the focus for Sayashi because I'venever heard enough of Nu-chan (Numakura Manami) and I need more. I feelsatisfied now for some reason haha please don't hit me<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SlowStart06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Slow Start</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    What is with the weird opening from Shion and Tama-chan? lol  </div></blockquote>Yep, you didn't hear it wrongly. Thenew&nbsp;<strike>nipple</strike>&nbsp;episode (#SlowStart06) (lol) talks about astay over. Hey, slice-of-life, everyone. Once again Shion is out of theapartment, which means Hana-chan can <strike>play</strike> uh I mean, study witheveryone else for the day. Okay, maybe just the day. And with the help ofHiroe-san, they get through with great success, had a great dinner, and... welleverything else seemingly falls into place. A nice touch for talking about beingscared of stuff from Tama-chan which is quite typical of this series (which I'mstarting to like), and also some way to present a different side of this show.All in all, I must say if I spoil more here you won't be able to enjoy what isin store. And if you have watched you'll know everything I say here will remindyou of something wonderful in the episode. (I am SO tempted to spoil Hiroe-san'spart) (AND THE BATH SCENES) (lol) On a side note, I think Hiroe is just tryingto find excuses such that she doesn't have to dress well outside of her house.No seriously, wear pretty when throwing out the trash, yes? So that perverts onthe streets can-<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6kkkOnKv2FA/Wn_mBG0IqQI/AAAAAAAAlKc/vOYGsaWC3swYEFVhALVm6yryspL1K4meACLcBGAs/s320/slowstart06_mystery.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Well technically I'm not spoiling anything here,<br />but WTF is with        the cinematic view? lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S.

Hotaru is missing for aseason (in story), Kokonotsu is as run down as the shop, and the father brokethe foot lol. Anyways, he restores it to its former glory, and upon thinking upof another strategy to win over the people, he notices someone has already doneit. Cue, the convenience store! Yep, that's it for now. Other than that punch toTou-kun's face, and that super detailed skeleton of You-san's bone break (lol),everything is as expected as you can see. I like the Anime. It takes it and addsa little more, which is good touch. And yes, the pace is perfect for just twochapters in an episode, and that's what is going to make me like the showanyways. Also, the manga. Yes Kotoyama-sensei, half the reason I started readingthis is because I wanted to know more. Now that there's the Anime... well you'retaking in the money anyway, so congrats haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="371"          data-original-width="385"          height="308"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GoeaBX3Ks_E/WoBKOR192XI/AAAAAAAAlLQ/-w2Y3e0Iy_0IvL0bl65OO1Y77bBYAPUMACLcBGAs/s320/109x4.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        No, this is not some ancient samurai drama lol You-san      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week brings us a couple of releases that... can't be compared together, soI'll talk about them separately. <b>Hanazawa Kana new single</b> is pretty good,I did give one of the two B-sides which is unusual for me anyways, but no cigar.No on-my-shelf release, sadly. Same thing with <b>nano.RIPE new single</b> whichthe official Twitter is promoting actively recently (I mean, even the illegaldownloads?? They don't know), and despite it being the opening theme song forsome yuri Anime, I still think it stands good on its own. Also, another B-side.Lastly, I don't think I want to talk about <b>LILI LIMIT new EP </b>consideringI didn't like the preview I heard a couple of weeks ago and I still didn't likeit when I heard it this week. Well, this is the other style of them I don't wantto give, I guess. I'll pass, guys. Cya guys next release.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">  <div dir="ltr" lang="en">    And yes, I did notice the recent official Twitter retweet phenomenon or what    you call it, and honestly I don't care.
