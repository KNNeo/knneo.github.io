I don't do any schoolwork. Nothing. Whatabout other days, you say? Well... it's definitely more than how much I do todayhaha<br /><br />Okay, school is sad. Entertainment is not. Not even my mom canstop me enjoying whatever is in front of a monitor. Let's begin. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DagashiKashiS207">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi 2</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Unlike many other Anime girls I know this Hajime will get beat up by me    every time she says something that represents her laziness haha I know she    resembles me <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>  </div></blockquote>The new episode (#DagashiKashiS207) brings us another #finally in this Animeseries the production has teased since the beginning: The slacker and homelessof a failure Owari Hajime. (I mean, her name totally suggests that in case youdon't know it means 'beginning (of) end' lol) To say there's anything we cantalk about her positively will be an overstatement. She literally has nothingmuch we can talk about lol. God, I'm so going to relate her to myself very soon.Well, the upside is I'm not living alone on rent, so that's good news maybe.Still, Hajime-san chose to get kicked out of the vibrant staff community that isin the convenience store and settle for the shop? I mean, she just wants to tidethrough life I guess, and considering she is at her last resort, Kokonotsukindly takes her in. Problem only comes when it's not only between them thatthis new hire is in the shop, as Sayashi becomes the first to be surprised atthis announcement that Kokonotsu is... oh well, I don't know how to describehaha. Well, you know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, it'll be good to see what will happenbetween these people considering Hajime has no knowledge of dagashi (okay I'llsay she knows Art), and maybe having someone other than the Endou siblings toopen their minds on may be good once in a while.<strike>I mean, if you're not sick of the main cast I am</strike> NO I AM NOT DOYOU NOT HEAR HOW CUTE SAYASHI IS AT THE END??? lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oGOkpfvSKAM/WpIlIIa3f5I/AAAAAAAAlcg/OXwAd1huheIvkz2a0ffew0HzyoWOXeIewCLcBGAs/s320/dagashikashiS2_07_cubism.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Now I wonder if the original author Kotoyama-sensei drew this on the        manga lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. I assume the "-su" syllable on Hajime's speech is supposedly of aparticular accent but I can't figure out who... I feel bad for the show onceagain though as it still deserves the full length episode treatment just so wecan get to know more of her before other people come in.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSan07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    THE MOTHER??? WE GONNA GET THE (REAL) SKILLED TEASER ON BOARD NOW?? Oh we    don't get to see her face oh well haha  </div></blockquote>God, I love those Nishikata Takagi-san thoughts haha they are the best. Okay,the new episode (#TakagiSan07) really takes a lot of things to a new level, andI like. The show. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, the episode. There may be too many things I cantouch on (literally), so I'll try to sum things up. Firstly, Nishikata buys thenew volume of "100% Unrequited Love" (yes I'm making this big to shame that oneguy) which is literally them but reversed roles lol, and Takagi-san manages tocatch him buying it once again. I mean, just guessing makes it easy to evenassume - as a friend - that he is buying such a thing, so why bother to bet?Man, he's just dumb. Then, there's the punishment which I wouldn't callotherwise, but yeah Nishikata get to shop with the girl for a swimsuit. Ofcourse that other couple must appear to make things worse (only for Nishikataapparently), and I think we all had a blast imagining Takagi-san naked. (And ifyou did, I'm calling the cops you pedophile lol) Then, there's the allanticipated summer part of the series, which of course, is wonderfullyrepresented by the secondary team of cast. (Again, if you expected anything elseI'm calling the cops) Lastly, Nishikata once again stupidly invites Takagi-santo his house to do homework, with just a simple bait of letting him copy herhomework. Of course Takagi-san is smart enough to only bring the work she's donethat does not matter, and just enjoy her time at his house. I mean, she's theonly one that's enjoying all of this all of us are sweating if I'm not the onlyone doing so haha. One last thing: I honestly think the new ending theme songdoes not suit the series. And yes, I <i>am</i> a fan of Chatmonchy and I'veheard this before.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jpa5LHDfPmQ/WpIt52o0jqI/AAAAAAAAlcw/evD_WeBI_HIMq0IJdxgw7CodXpq5BxiZgCLcBGAs/s320/takagisan07_pass.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        #Nishikata3me Someday I want to do this too you lucky bastard haha      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. TIL Manga "Karakai Jouzu no (Moto) Takagi-san" was not about Takagi-san'smother, but her child. Oops. Be sure to check out<a href="https://twitter.com/Y6W9v/status/960746372528881664" target="_blank"  >the other serialisations</a>related to the show too. Man, the author is creating a vibrant world with justtwo people<br />P.P.S. "What type of swimsuit do you like?" I prefer the oneswith the laces- Wait, she not asking me? Damn. "How did it come to this?"Because you're dumb? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />[Omake: I feel embarrassed somehow to saythis but I did kind of trick a girl into doing revision at my place hehe so yeahNishikata you lose MUAHAHAHAHA (maybe I'll talk about it at the end of this postI don't know)]<br /><ul>  <li>Do not freak out at the sight of your nemesis (lol)</li>  <li>Do either be a straight guy or be a straight out liar; Do not be both</li>  <li>Do not say yes to everything without listening to others</li>  <li>    Do not agree to anything sudden especially if you have a schedule to follow  </li>  <li>    Do not find stupid excuses unless you want to otherwise get intimate with    someone  </li>  <li>    Do your own homework (lol) and do not resort to copying others (lol) even if    you have to (lolol)  </li></ul><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SlowStart08">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Wait so the one girl likes salmon that much she looks straight in the face    at Eiko and drags Tama-chan away? Can someone explain what level is that    on?? lol okay I get it  </div></blockquote>Okay besides the fact that we may be seeing an episode in Anime history aboutnudist beaches lol, the new episode (#SlowStart08) encourages us to meetfriends, talk to others, and buy swimsuits while we're at it haha. There, Isummarised it. Even hidden-behind-Eiko-to-try-out-swimsuits Kamuri would beproud haha man I didn't notice that tbh. Okay, the episode. There's so much totalk about I don't even know where to do it properly anymore haha. Firstly,Hana-chan's got homeroom duties to do. She forgets, reaches school late to doit, and her partner Takahashi kindly finishes it for her. Honestly saying I'lljust return the favour by doing all the duties after school, but hey, I guessHana-chan is not that enthusiastic. Then, the friends kindly (this word is<i>so</i> overused) introduce her to the classmates in the room. And yeah theteacher is right: There is no need to know everyone in class, considering thetwo friends who do naturally know all of them and you're the shy person. Still,it's good to know. (Also, add in those newbie seiyuus!! lol) Not forgettingHiroe-san who recently got interested in the packed lunches from Shion lol, themain girls go out to shop for swimsuits. Beach episode warning, everyone. Just,not the nude kind haha. Anyways, the jokes in this show are stellar (whichexplains why I have to be the straight guy for each and every one of them) and Ican't help but think of the demographic of the audience in this show becauseit's literally a bunch of guys watching this show meant for girls haha heywhatever fits man tight underwear also count hehe<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8f456uMesNY/WpI3dNG_P4I/AAAAAAAAldE/VS401Lc-Wro6btPMm8tDBM-ivyrIzGvhgCLcBGAs/s320/slowstart08_cry.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Hover/Tap if you want to know what makes Tama-chan cry          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ipCmhMZTEWM/WpI37Wxp7CI/AAAAAAAAldI/D_msqsbW4fQBG1HnRkvRvXayyz4XPsVkQCLcBGAs/s320/slowstart08_boobs.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            HAHA BOOBS (no, no GIF) (thanks CSS)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Never thought I'd ask myself this question but are English names easier toremember or Japanese family names? Hmm... sorry Hana I'm trampling on you onceagain haha SOMEONE GIVE SOME LOVE TO HANA-CHAN!!<br />P.P.S. I'll say it once,and I'll say it again - HANNEN HIROE FOR BEST GIRL!! haha I can't takeschoolgirls at my age anymore sorry<br />[PLEASE MAKE ME STOP THE DESIRE TO DOGIFS THERE'S WAY TOO MANY ON THIS]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi</span>  </div></blockquote>The new chapters (113-115) (And I'm sorry for missing the first one because itbelonged to last week) continues on the recent Anime episodes which are... farfrom boring to say the least. Owari Hajime became the new part-time worker forthe dagashi shop transiting quickly from the convenience store opposite theroad, and of course, that surprises Saya-chan. Apart from the extras the Animeput in from Kokonotsu thinking of a part-time hire in the room instead of comingfrom outside the house to the over-exaggerated faces of Kokonotsu (this is afirst btw), everything is as per se in the animation. Can't wait to see whathappens next though, although from what I see here we will need Hotaru-chan tocome back REAL soon or otherwise we'll just forget about her and move on lolplease don't I know Sayashi may be best girl but- (lol)<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="324"          data-original-width="520"          height="199"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VB4z_fY8WBE/WpKyVcWq_bI/AAAAAAAAldc/qfEsz5iK0bQARHnHV2IehDzDvW22JMYNACLcBGAs/s320/x9.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">FOUND IT HAHA</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week is a rather quiet week, but then again I think you can guess whatexcuse I'll give for not finding more new songs every month anyway haha. I'vegained some interest in <b>Awesome City Club </b>(yes it's a name, and theyreleased a best album only three years after debut; as a measure average isfive)&nbsp;following Friends last week so I may need some time to give a couplemore songs sometime by the end of the month hopefully. I've get finalised myreview for <b>SCANDAL's latest album</b> but going how their style goes I mightas well give up haha. Lastly, I think I'm going to give one of<b>Fujifabric's latest song</b>&nbsp;form last year because it's uniquely weirdin melody and overall feel, and it's somehow getting me addicted for somereason. It may be perfect representation for my state now though, so that'sgood. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />I've yet to hear from SpecialThanks yet so I'll get tothat by the end of the month, maybe tomorrow because it's going to be hecticreal soon. Next week didn't bring any prominent releases so I better concludethe ones I'm in review now then.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is it then. It'skind of late and I need an excuse to do this shorter every week. Man, I'mgetting lazy. Then again, I can't wait to end school life soon. Well, mainlythat project actually. There's two quizzes this week too, so... (Audiencewhispers) Oh, that incident? (refer to Takagi-san Omake above) Sure. In anutshell, we arranged to meet for revision before exams (she initiated it, shebold girl) (she knew my results aren't good anyway so she said why not studytogether) twice at the nearby community center where there are seats but Iintentionally led her to start later in the morning on the second and since it'snear my place and the center is full by the time we want to start near noon...you can guess what happened then. My mom came home early so we aren't the onlytwo who can keep this secret anymore GODDAMMIT MOM!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys then, anduntil next time... I wish this world is full of girls who take initiativebecause they want company. Hey, she may have a partner but I can always use someproductive company hehe thanks Kristie (oops)<br /><br />[P.S. How's the CSS?I'm still in learning but this is just a small touch which will prove fun when Iwant to spice up the website for those who took notice really]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
