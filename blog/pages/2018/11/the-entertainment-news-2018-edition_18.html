I'll try to finish in the next couple of days, I promise.<br /><br />Let'sfinish this and sleep early I seriously need more sleep haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH19">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Ash is not just sick, he's lovesick. You know, just like how Golzine is of    him as he is of that boy haha  </div></blockquote>Hey just in case you guys didn't figure out Ash Lynx was quite an Americansenator in the late '90s lol they manipulate history like you don't even knowhow. In thie new episode (#BANANAFISH19) which I must say fills my brain withnothing but boys love, talks about more of the life after Ash, you know,submitted to Golzine because of that little boy lol. Anyways, it wasn't good, ashe's probably just resisting helping Golzine out to take over the world as weknow of it. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he's involved in world affairshaha. On Eiji's side, he found out that Lee helped in making Ash submit toGolzine, and hates him for it now. And now, he wants to save him? I don't know.What's even the point to that now? Well, considering his physical condition now(if he isn't faking it) he may not even be able to make it out of that partyhimself, let alone out of that crowd of protection, it would seem. But hey,someone's face gives a lot of motivation to a person, you know. Even if it'stransgender-related I don't know haha. Blanca however, has other options besidesleaving for the Carribean after he's made his stay. Lee found out his historyand that he was a soldier fighing for the Soviet Union in the Middle East to sumit up, because no one should know about this apparently, but Lee managed to doit himself. And so, Blanca decided to form a contract with him, but just to behis bodyguard. No guns, no fighting, just protection. If you need firepower Iguess this guy beside you won't be it. And against Ash too? We shall see. All inall, a mote content-filled episode to make sure you can catch up to what hasbeen happening for all characters in the story now and quite a set-up to thenext episode where the party starts and we may see Ash leave the clutches ofGolzine? I mean, without anyone covering for him it may be tough. We shall seeit for ourselves, yeah?<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DVoErQ3UDSQ/W_Edh-IBgKI/AAAAAAAArio/AffpU3RbsL8WOrbmVp0VsFcqay7fD7KSACLcBGAs/s320/bananafish19_affair1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How to trick someone that your friend is gay lol what          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgZfhmppNX4/W_EdhvEfIvI/AAAAAAAArik/aub7MWcc540KtLqbYaNIMlAqhI7VuZXZQCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish19_affair2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How to trick someone that your friend is gay lol what          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. I like how Lee or even Eiji gives so much of a f**k to this situation aboutBanana Fish and all even though Ash don't even give a shit about the whole thinglol really? I thought this show was about the gay-<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="UzaMaid07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    >&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;">Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Normally you'd notify someone that they're being let go a month ahead of    time" lol Misha breaking labour laws right there  </div></blockquote>Wow even I just forgot that Midorin was a masochist haha Misha-chan what haveyou gotten yourself into haha. The new episode (#UzaMaid07) proves that firingthat awesome yet irritating maid off was a bad choice, and we have acounter-example to demonstrate that. Ah, I love this Russian tsundere especiallywhen she doesn't know she's in it haha. Well, there's two parts to this as usual(man, stop updating the eyecatch already haha) so let's talk about themseparately. Firstly, we have to deal with Tsubame being fired as a maid. Well,Misha had to. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yeah, and by finding a replacement which wasn't anybetter at the one thing Misha wished Midorin was better at, and that is cooking.So yeah, she had to either eat trash (which Midorin liked cooking them) or justeat outside food which obviously wouldn't be any healthier since it's, you know,never geared to take care of your body. That probably was the only downsidethough as Misha got to enjoy less irritating stuff from that ex-maid and stillgets the other maid stuff from Midorin done quite well. Yeah, just the food.Okay maybe also the fact that she doesn't have to deal with a full-on masochistlol. So Misha decided to ask for Tsubame back. Just for the food. And if it'snot obvious enough, it was all Tsubame's plan to leave anyways because she knewthat she had already gained the trust of Misha's stomach as much as you haveevery other reason to hire someone else to be her replacement, and to be honest?I expected that too actually. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Second half bring us a (balanced) day inthe life of Tsubame (with Midorin) working in the house and also shows us theextent of how much of a masochist this Midorin is because she is quite anextreme one to be honest. Although with reference to last week's episode of hergetting referred to trash and peed by a dog please show some self love Midorinit's real disgusting to have to deal with scat and all those stuff. *imaginesMidorin being happy reading this* Oh well anyways (haha), the life of the maidis mostly justy house chores, dealing with meals, and the occasional spying onthe kid. Yeah, including that last one which is totally not suspicious andillegal. Also, that Tsubame clean's only Misha's room is kinda creepy haha. Imean, which one do you want: a lolicon who expresses love so much it'sirritating, or a masochist where whatever you say or do will have a positiveeffect, even if it's something bad. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I'll leave you guys to think aboutit yourself and by the way the show's selling Misha figurines with Russianblonde hair and with a changable clothes lineup better than Barbie Doll? If soSIGN ME UP haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IiYv6eZRTpA/W_Eo0h98oxI/AAAAAAAAri8/NwFnaJhJhcc5DBAs0bgXRbeAeYglWadogCLcBGAs/s320/uzasugiru07_disgust.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When you know you ate something terrible lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I9dLMLgU0TM/W_Eo0VtdUdI/AAAAAAAAri4/VmT-YafO7g43nZqnXD31MUvljl7GzeDAgCLcBGAs/s320/uzasugiru07_doS.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When you know you're dealing with a masochist lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "I licked up the curry I had leftover last night this morning" Wow Morikawacan you don't AND THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY ACTED SICK lol<br />P.P.S. Ladies, ifthere's one thing you can take away (food pun not intended) from this episode isthat (and may I quote Tsubame) winning over someone's stomach is the best tacticever. Ladies, you hear that? Well I'm not so picky but if you make food thestandard of Midorin I'll just eat outside lol<br />[Omake: I really enjoyedNu-chan (who voiced Tsubame) getting irritated by Midorin (voiced by M.A.O.) tobe honest totally liked it also Midorin's disguise it's getting all the<strike>lesbians</strike> cross-dress fans excited haha not me btw]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HondaSan07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Gaikotsu Shoten'in Honda-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It's not really that interesting in real life!" Wow the author burnt    himself there lol  </div></blockquote>The new episode (#HondaSan07) brings two things that we'll go to love and hatein life as a bookstore staff, and I'll leave you guys to say which one was thelove and which was the hate lol. Firsly, wholesalers. In case you aren't awareof how it's designed, bookstores get their books from wholesalers - places whostock up the supplies - which are then taken from the publisher either directlyor through the inventory network as far as one can stretch across the countryconsidering how big your franchise is. So yeah, it can be hard to keep up withstock. Aren't you glad there's online shopping now? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And then, there'sthe party. Not that I don't know how to drink alcohol (yeah, thankfully), butgoing to a drinking party won't be fun. Well, not if you're a nerd like me andsome of the others in the store, so Honda-san volunteered himself for the task.As much as it's a time to bond, it's also good time to learn about stuffhappening around working for a bookstore, and that... someone was an author ofone of those hot-selling books which just recently became an Anime. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Yes, the author's writing about himself. Read on the original work or look atearlier episodes for the background. All in all, not that it's mundane like hedescribed it himself lol, but that since this is Slice of Life you gottaappreciate what happens with such a workplace, and how your books appear in yourhands as they will today. And I'm not talking only of Japan; next time relatethis to your local bookstore and you'll get what I mean.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GhgW8tZHs6o/W_LBtv8q3wI/AAAAAAAArl4/cpJGMiSzhsEGuS60ciEV45Quq_CKrHcMgCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan07_crowd.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            What it feels like being raped lol<br />(Man, what's with all the            masochist references)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bdwLPVRsmZk/W_LBtZB_89I/AAAAAAAArl0/1GH1f_pZqcQFTcIUqaGw7887zhv8bqVAACLcBGAs/s320/hondasan07_order.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            What it feels like being scolded at but in a good way lol<br />(Man,            what's with all the masochist references)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Since I thought about talking of that list of manga artists that I knew,let me go through them starting this week. Or when I have nothing to write herelol *ahem* Tite Kubo, as you all have known, is famous for his big work "BLEACH"which made 300+ episodes of Anime and FOUR MOVIES goddamn, and sold millions ofcopies just in the Soul Society Arc himself. What was less known about his workwas his previous work "Zombiepowder." which I actually liked its characters andaction but its story borrows too much on earlier major works of that time, sayDragonball for example. So yeah, he eventually stopped it with one arc of storyin four books. The reason he gave when he stopped was that (other than thereason above) he was pressured by his manager and publisher to come up with thiskind of story, and it doesn't represent his own creative work. So yeah, nowonder it was so good? I loved it though, and prayed every day that it'llcontinue. I even name my self-created characters after his artwork. She's notthat fierce in my story though, just the image. Maybe I'll prove my point when Ican finish writing APoL- oh yeah one of them was in<a  href="http://apol.strikingly.com/blog/chapter-14-where-despair-is-reality"  target="_blank"  >Chapter 14</a>!

No, not talking about Run-chanor Tooru, the other one. Anyways, the three went to a cat cafe because someonewants to try out her skills on her resume lol, and in case you don't know whatthey are these are places where you can hang out with cats, situated as a cafe.So yeah, as the name implies. So this Hira-chan apparently can make cat soundsbut only one that's in pain so maybe don't make more of that sound alaready?Haha this series just needs more dumb people, and I don't mean Run-chan orSatou-sensei lol<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="362"          data-original-width="497"          height="233"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZlZ9YPr3CCo/W_FpljCtTbI/AAAAAAAArjc/jgbcFy-Ev38_HKeZDUXq_HYFYu4wWl5lACLcBGAs/s320/109-2.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">#SeiyuuGoals</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay, not much on new releases, but I did do some digging, literally.<b>wacci's new album</b> got some conclusion in Klassic Note, as I only pickedout a couple of songs I'll only give, which is fine btw I think this is goodenough imo. <b>fumika's cover album</b> is just a listen for fun for now, andI'll see if I can give more time so I'll give a couple of songs. Then again,it's because she chose more recent songs to cover anyways.<b>TrySail's new single</b> is... short of fantastic despite leaving theelectronic genre, and I'm only prepared to give the B-side. The topic song? Meh.<b>LuckLife's new single</b> was a hit and go for first impressions since it'sbeen some time since I listened to them (I still haven't heard of their latestalbum) so I'll have to listen again to see if I can even give the topic song.Lastly, <b>Tokyo Karan Koron's new mini-album</b> was... okay, and I want togive new songs from them, so... again, I'll need more time next week.<br /><br />Speakingof next week, besides re-reviewing the above releases, we have a couple of newreleases upcoming. <b>BLUE ENCOUNT's new single</b> for Anime "Banana Fish" willbe out, and as of now I've watched the music video and heard the topic songand... man is it hard to give. Kind of explains how I didn't give that one songI heard from them 3 years ago and joined the group of artists who represent themale voice in Klassic Note. (Be sure to read on the Klassic Note Spirit to learnmore) <b>GLIM SPANKY's new album</b> will be out too, and I have listened to thetopic song and honestly I'm not impressed. There's the one music video/topicsong from a couple of months ago which I'm probably prepared to give right now,so that's something to remember for now. <b>ClariS' new album</b> also appearsnext week, and honestly I don't know what I'm expecting, so fingers crossed forthat I guess. It's the second time the new duo is releasing new song and theprevious one wasn't that impressive so... we shall see.<br /><br />On Twitternews this week,<b>Survive Said The Prophet's new single releases in December</b> for Anime"Banana Fish" (yes, the new ending song), and what the f**k did I just watch amusic video of. Yes, I know of <b>Fuchigami Mai</b> and her solo music debutearlier this year, but that doesn't mean I've been giving her songs. And this,might be her first. If I can remember you, Mai-chan, I'll give. On other news,<b>Kotobuki Minako's new single</b> is coming out early next year, along withMai-chan's new mini-album. It's not the same week though, just same month.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OkayI'm done here I can barely keep my eyes open. I've also been watching streamersplay Pokemon Let's Go on the day it releases which is yesterday and... I thinkI'll love the game overall but hate the catching mechanisam because motioncontrols, man. I'll be getting myself the game as part of a surprise for my sis'birthday present which is, you guessed it, a Nintendo Switch console. So yeah,Black Friday sales hopefully will give me an offer. I know of Singles Day, but IREFUSE!! Haha no I got a new phone anyway. Surprising how the Google Pixel 2phone case came from Amazon faster than the phone itself which was imported butsold on a local online store haha. Oh well. Cya guys next week.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
