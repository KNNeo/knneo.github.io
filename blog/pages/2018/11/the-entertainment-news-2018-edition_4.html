Well I'm tired after sleeping for an afternoon so let's finish this quick, yes?
(Audience: What?) Yeah, and if you can't sleep and want to read more of my
spelling mistakes thank goodness I did not forget the two new posts for The
Klassic Note Spirit this week. I really need to finish the last few ones up
before my posting catches up with my effort to complete the series lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Sounds like fair trade when you say "I'll kill your enemies and you'll kill
mine", isn't it, Lee? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, the new episode (#BANANAFISH17) did not
feature Ash's confrontation with Lee - oh no, not yet - but brings us a new guy
to do a nostalgia talk. But before that, things. Following last week's escape
from the hellhole, Ash manages to reunite with Eiji and the gang, and that's
good news, to say the least. The two have a good time (read the postscript for
details lol), and continue to find out what the true identity of Banana Fish is.
Meanwhile, that Lee (the one who will only be alive once all this is done) took
himself to strike a deal with Golzine. So, a trade serial murder of sorts, I
would say. Golzine helps to get rid of his family not including him because then
what's the point (haha), and he offers everything he knows of the situation to
him, including how to get Ash back. And that, if you needed more hints, is to
actually freak the sh*t out of his primal instincts which he has been trained
for. To complete the equation, Golzine got back his old friend Blanca, who also,
if you need more hints, probably taught Ash the ways of killing. Hey, sounds
familiar? You know, every genius killer needs a mentor, so I guess this man is
it. He stalked the shit out of Ash, went from retired and rejected off Golzine's
offer to accepting the challenge, killed the crap out of the man who Ash is
trying to interrogate posing as a prostitute (it's a long story lol) from a
building like, halfway across the cityscape... Guys, we have a new contender.
Golzine may be old, but this Blanca guy is quite above the crazy level compared
to Ash and the old man, and that probably has got him worried. Can't wait till
their eyes meet and someone has to die lol I wonder who maybe Eiji? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />

P.S. The worst thing this series has given us is (the insinuation of) gay sex.
There, I said it. You guys know I'm straight, right? "Not gay"?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S.
Applauding Ash's intelligence for figuring out so far what Banana Fish is made
out of as he pointed out the chemicals likely to be in the drug, while Lee tells
us the facts really makes Ash real close to finding out the truth. All but never
knowing it, which is pretty impressive for someone his age. Also, Lee was smart
to assassinate all people blocking Golzine's path by keeping his plan to "only
kill where Ash approaches them" and that is as clean as it is smart how long did
they think of this, the author? lol<br /><br />

Okay NOW I believe the maid will be of some use because if under threat we can
send this ex-servicewoman to the rescue haha you poor girl. Wow it's only just
halfway through this series and this episode (#UzaMaid05) is already introducing
us to another irritating person haha. Well, Misha-chan is cute so naturally they
have to talk about this, but yeah, the girls in class (who think they are cute)
are getting jealous of the Russian chick lol. Specifically, Morikawa. I mean,
it's nothing wrong, but hey, it's irritating to try to be cute and there's the
one person who can do it effortlessly? (Sorry to all girls in the entertainment
industry haha) I mean, she does not have that experience, and so Morikawa
decides to challenge Misha. To what? To... getting an outfit on the streets
within an hour which will make them cuter? I have a feeling I've seen this
before lol. It just ended up being a storytelling of Tsubame to Morikawa about
war haha. That, and Tsubame just got her first discipline lmao. Well, give the
kid some money would you, parents? Then again, she may have spent too much just
to stand out on the streets. She kind of did though but not compared to that
pure blonde hair hehe (#NotLolicon). And then, there's the sports festival.
Besides drinking too much iced coffee (lol why), the kids get to fight for... I
don't know what, but hey, it's a school thing. That, and many things happened
that ended up involving Tsubame as the replacement for Morikawa who was supposed
to be the OP (overpowered) one in the class, now became too OP because this is
elementary school and there's an adult on the field lol (Totally reminds me of
that
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji" target="_blank"
  >one kid with the butler</a
>
reminding him to not stand out too). Finally, Tsubame and Misha got together for
the three-legged race, and honestly? Misha seems to be enjoying it. Not as close
as the mother because I don't think she is as ripped as the maid lol. Yet
another wonderful episode to remember by just forgetting about the fact that
this show is going to be voiced by a lot of cute girls (I'm only in for the maid
here lol not for the pecs though) so it's nothing but high-pitched voices which
I hate to be honest but this show has the laughs so I'm still liking it I swear
JUST GET THE PECS OFF MY EYES lol<br />

be like "You want to be friends so we can be cute together?" and they probably
will be picked up as an idol group? Hey, just suggesting if you need more Anime
sequel ideas<br />

    Just avoiding Honda-san's answer, I would say publishing comics on black

    too little I have to guess the colour of Rukia's Bankai?? Oh it's white lol

On this super real and erotic episode (#HondaSan05) of this bookstore staff
series we have more queries that kill lol, famous people killing bookstores
because they Tweet (yes as in Twitter), and a killer phone call which almost
brought Honda-san to the nearest police station haha. Okay, one at a time, shall
we? Firstly, which one is worse? Dealing with someone who literally wants to buy
a book for everyone in his village (lol not a China iPhone news reference) (well
I can't find the article liao maybe it's fake news?) or dealing with another
passionate foreigner? Hey, didn't know you had to deal with this many foreigners
as a Japanese, so I'm going with the latter. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I must say, these are
truly better than any other complain king that is a local, but with their
enthusiasm also comes with their questions like "why are things like this in
Japan" that probably a professional who is not Honda-san should answer but hey,
he's just a bookstore staff. You can't expect a perfect answer. (Nice one, by
the way) Next, is apparently the best publicity the bookstore can have but is
also itself a double-edged sword, which is from a manga author. You know, social
media is all the hype now, but I didn't know that one retweet of a bookstore
(especially by a famous author) online will draw so many people to go buy them.
Well, considering they are signed too this will cause some inconvience for the
staff, I'm sure. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> No, it's not worth it it's double the work for the
same pay, man. I can work less harder haha. Lastly, Honda-san receives the
deadliest phone call he can have: someone threatening him because of a bookstore
experience by chancing upon the #EroGate as I would like to call it. It is true
that many may have chanced upon something at the bookstore accidentally which is
kind of overboard and you know, with puberty naturally you'll start to like that
stuff which will ruin your life, and I guess you come back to reprimand the
staff for accidentally showing you stuff? It happens, man. Blaming people and
stuff. Thankfully, Honda-san handled it like a&nbsp; pro (see I told you he's a
pro <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>) and make the customer feel like he's not cheated *<a

Haiz damn bored when you know that Anime theme song releases this week and it
doesn't. Well,
<strike>Apple Music don't release Anime songs on time</strike> Anime music
labels don't happen to stream their songs online too, so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's then
talk about what I listened to this week.

is... nothing great. To be honest, it might be their most disappointing album
yet. Second was probably their best here, first was shabby, and this one... I
didn't even give the topic song. I may only give one song only which on first
impression barely passes, mind you, so I don't know how bad I shall describe the
release in general tbh.

was probably better than the previous mentioned, but then again I only managed
to give the topic song because it has her vibes and the music video saw her
dancing for the first time in her solo music career haha. Anyways, not giving
the B-sides, and I did watch the music video in full in case you thought the one
on YouTube was in full, and... she's great. As a person. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Lastly, thank
goodness to the parent company Lantis for releasing the one music video from

but... well, I haven't got to it yet. So
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ujZz7nFkS0" target="_blank"

will be a good start. Let's see if I can even give the opening theme haha<br /><br />On

for the final time will likely not make it to my shelf mainly because I still
have to give it three songs before it passes and... I only gave chance to two.
Too bad, my girls.

suffered from the same fate too, but mainly due to the overplaying of similar
style with a whole lot of uninspirational melodies. What happened to you,
Kajiura-sensei, seriously. Anyways, probably will give one of them because I
brainwashed myself on the album over the weekend so hopefully that will help as
a last spurt to their end. Yeah, it's ending.

which I found out just last week, and I have Apple Music Japan and they are in
there, so... that's a good start. Other than that, maybe I'll check out older
releases like how did I miss <b>Anime "Gamers!" Character Song Album</b> for
some reason? I don't know man, it's tiring to follow-up to these stuff. Good
thing

  tired so... Cya guys next week and until then... Until then... Argh I'll put

  then"... (ending)</strike

Well since I wrote this on the midnight of a Tuesday (not joking here) then I
might as well write something decent for ending since that placeholder... Okay
never mind. Cya guys next issue, and hopefully by then, I'll cement some of the
compilations that I'm due to announce soon. Real soon. Like,
