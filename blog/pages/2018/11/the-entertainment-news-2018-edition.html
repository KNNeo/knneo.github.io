Hey, guys. I've been busy this weekend. Good thing it's not about work even
though I think I'll be worked dry by next week haha enjoying while it lasts
tbh<br /><br />What have I been doing? I've been rushing to finish The Klassic
Note Spirit, for starters. As you can not see because I just said it got
delayed, I brushed up the posts and pushed all of them until Year 10, so yeah,
that'll be done with the (oops) announcement next week. Yeah, we're getting to
it, finally. So yeah, until then, I guess. For now, let's get this week done and
over with I can't wait to play Nintendo Switch games I just bought- oh, no
console yet? I can't wait to finish Mafia III and rebuild Sammy's Bar then.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay let's move on.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH20"> <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>  <span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH</span> </div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"> <div style="text-align: center;">  "Food hasn't tasted this good for so long" I mean, you like to eat trash,  Ash? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> </div>
</blockquote>
Haha I love how Lee dug himself the grave in which Blanca protects him and he
can't do anything on his own or even instruct Blanca to do anything lol Defense
Mode right there haha. I must say, this new episode (#BANANAFISH20) must be a
good exhibition of whatever underground powers we have now in the storyline.
First, we have the old man. An experienced fellow, someone who still has a
strong desire but wants control over the world, lacks of the intelligence to act
diversely when necessary. Golzine is one heck of a power, but is not going to be
one without people around him. Secondly, we have the getaway kid. He always has
friends who can help, he likes the little boy, and he's way too smart for even
the government to handle. Ash Lynx has always lived up to his surname for some
reason, and when he gets to bite back as he falls he makes sure he balances the
scales. Then, we have the careful leader. He asked for power by killing his
brothers, he doesn't believe in the ways of the extreme in America, but he knows
when to not hold back especially when he has to and has a bit of brain on that.
Lee Yut Lung (for the last time I'll spell his name in full here since it's been
mentioned so many times this episode) is a China underground lord, but he may
have found power which makes his decisions way more important that he thinks to
act in. Finally, we have the observer. There to make minor decisions that
matter, knows where to take sides to control the situation, and a skilled
assassin and killer himself. Blanca has shown the ways of battling the
intelligence that is Ash, deal with old friends like Golzine, and control little
leaders like Lee. However he still can't play with the likes of the lynx, who is
more likely playing him way too much than he wants. On this episode, we went
from Ash half-blind in a party to the subways to a museum and to the safety of
himself and the two gangs who decided to save him out of his hell hole. Yeah, he
probably ate little and the IVs were basically just drugged I assume, but he's
still fine, this super, super fit boy haha. Anyways, it's exciting to see things
level itself out once again, and with Lee's apprehensive approach falling in
shambles and giving Ash the edge on his own homeground again, it'll take more
time for the no-brainer boss Golzine to get his hands on his favourite boy once
again, I guess. We shall see, Blanca. We shall see.<br />

P.S. It's like we know Blanca for a couple of episodes and Eiji be like "so this

</blockquote>
"I'd love to keep you in, but this maid right here was too expensive and too
good not to hire" is if I'm Misha-chan haha if only you knew. In this
quote-filled new episode (#UzaMaid08) where if Tsubame marries Misha (and this
will be a fact when I say it) the marriage won't last long lol, we live a day of
the rich. Specifically, Midorin's rich family at the biggest hotel in the area.
Yes, finally Misha gets to live the rich life for once. Sorry,
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/yasui" target="_blank">Yasu</a>hiro, your name
is as poor as your financial situation lol. (I wished your daughter will
understand your situation, but...) So yeah, it happened. Misha sleeping on the
same bed with Tsubame. Okay, to phrase that correctly, with Midorin in between
because you know, "insecticide repellant" haha. Many things happened that are
sure to make you laugh as much as be in disgust (referring to Midorin most of
the time), but it's the father who got the most shame out of this right in front
of his house lol. This show is real good in the sense that even for a moment
they wouldn't let you think otherwise (besides the quote above maybe) that none
of them would not step in to say what is necessary of their character in any
situation, and they did, which is a good thing. Then, there's the panties
stealing incident. Or incidents, I would say. Firstly, on Misha's. I mean, it's
way too natural to point Tsubame as the culprit considering she called it out
herself, but I hope you had guessed it like me along the lines of "she just
placed it somewhere and forgot", which she did, so that's that. And then,
there's her panties missing, that lolicon maid. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> This one wasn't that
complicated considering it concluded quickly, but suffice it to say that the
small animals wanted something comfortable lol. Hey, the maids aren't the only
ones that are sick in the mind haha. To conclude, congrats Midorin on mastering
the stock market and if you're rich enough instead of a cleaning service can you
open a community stock trade company and make people like me rich too? Thanks in
advance! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />

P.S. Midorin has a rich hotel room to stay in but doesn't want to =&gt; Misha
wants to stay in it because it's expensive =&gt; Tsubame wants to stay in it
because of Misha =&gt; Midorin has a rich hotel room to stay in and wants to
stay in now. Ah, how it all comes around...<br />P.P.S. "I wish someone would
trap me in a place like this" Yeah me too... Wait, Tsubame you didn't react???
Oh she's not M <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />[We really need Nu-chan to scream more haha. Also,
another GIF for your own pleasure. Nope, it's not just for Midorin only btw]<br />

<div style="padding:4px 8px; border:1px solid var(--foreground); border-radius:5px;"> [Update 2018.11.28: Sorry for the delay because that Nintendo Switch arrived at my place on Monday so gotta test it out and yesterday was because of Super Mario Party and just now that motherf**ker of Windows Update popped out a restart while I was typing. And this post was published in Blogger already so it won't autosave. Let's do this again, shall we?

Oh, my name tag" lol Honda-san  </div> </blockquote> In this new episode (#HondaSan08) of this wonderful series which will never make you forget what kind of people you are dealing with, we have people who will appreciate buying at the bookstore. Like someone who will buy in bulk because he probably got scolded for an accident and is compensating for it, for example. Like someone who is buying for someone else because... because they can't make it to a bookstore, for example. Spoiler alert, it was because they're in prison lmao. And yes, I didn't notice the finger until Honda-san screamed about it haha they did show you in the cut though I just missed it BECAUSE I DON'T JUDGE THEM HONDA haha okay let's move on it's freaking me out lol. And then we have kids. It's great and all, but just don't go into the adult section haha. Then again, I don't think the bookstores in Japan will put BL books right in the entrance nor will they put it in the restricted area since as long as it's not physical I guess we're fine? Well, just don't kids. The mother is right you can't get out of it once you're into it hehe. And we also learnt that some of the bookstore staff are actually lolicon haha. Then, there's foreigners. Hey, I think I won't be as surprised as them seeing familiar work in Japan, but I'll definitely talk about it non-stop, just like the one time I went into a bookstore with my friends recently. When we walked into the Japanese section with all the manga and magazines I can't stop talking because I was the only otaku there technically haha. (They sold seiyuu magazines too apparently but I think that's just a coincidence lol) Lastly, a production perspective of Honda-san the author himself being adapted into Anime, but with a proper face. Haha not that his personality will balance his looks out, but man it wouldn't be what is now, isn't it? So yeah, thanks for not turning this show into some Shoujo series that I wouldn't watch lol<br /> <div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"> <table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" >  <tbody>   <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;">   <img    border="0"    data-original-height="720"    data-original-width="1280"    height="180"    src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4a3uG3FBYCY/W_6GLxRnyOI/AAAAAAAAr5c/Y5t5IRJPs-MKu47CzcM2qVuvzCMYnb6MQCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan08_cute.jpg"    style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"    width="320"   />  </td>   </tr>   <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">   How you know you're into kids.

<blockquote class="tr_bq"> <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>  <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span> </div>
</blockquote>
Wow this was quite a week in Klassic Note, and I don't think I'm done with it
yet. Did I say that every week? Okay, in this peak week of the season which is
near December, firstly <b>BLUE ENCOUNT's new single</b> is rather disappointing
at the topic song as I've heard earlier but that one B-side is kind of okay.
They remind me of SPYAIR btw, as mentioned in my Tweet. So yeah, no wonder I
never gave their songs even from two years ago. So yeah, this one is for the
Anime in fear of not being able to give the ending theme which comes next month.
I think they are fine though, but SPYAIR technically has filled that gap back in
2010. Sorry, guys. <b>ClariS' new album</b> came in weak to be honest, and after
showcasing their topic songs at the front half of the tracklist the rest of it
proves diverse but weak in melody for most of them. Don't get me wrong; I was
real thrown off by whatever that was before the last song.
<b>GLIM SPANKY's new album</b> is by far the most disappointing of releases
reviewed this week as their new songs failed to capture my attention whatsoever,
so I'm sticking with that one song which was released as a commercial months ago
and was only in an album release after like, 4 months in YouTube.<br /><br />I
also sort of caught up on earlier releases before this week.
<b>LuckLife's new single</b> wasn't that impactful, but that also meant I did
not skip any of the songs on first review, which means I still like their style.
Sadly, I think I'll be taking the topic song for now. The B-sides aren't that
good compared to BLUE ENCOUNT at this point to be honest.
<b>Tokyo Karan Koron's new mini-album</b> which was released recently also
wasn't that memorable, but I think I can give the topic song which I heard last
month while waiting for it to release and maybe one more if I have the mood for
it. For now... <strike>I'm feeling a little moody</strike> I'll update next week
haha. I also got disappointed with <b>Asakura Momo</b> and her 1st album after
noticing that it was missing the one song which I totally wanted to give from
her 2nd single if it appeared again after I missed it last year, so I went back
to the single to give it. Literally. I said sorry to my past year self and gave
it. So yeah, she'll end Klassic Note Review this year, it would seem. Oh also,
her 4th single after 3 months of "hibernation" is out on Apple Music, in case
you liked the topic song as much as I did which is A LOT haha<br /><br />Next
week... ah, next week finally brings us the long-awaited (at least for me)
<b>Cidergirl's 2nd album</b> after being impressed by their first album months
ago and knowing of this news. I'll see if this can hold up even just in melody.
Man, artists these days... Ahem. Also on the list next week is
<b>fumika's new song</b> after whatever that cover album is so I'll give myself
a heads-up because I missed her releasing new songs already tbh. *Looks at
Twitter like feed* Wait, that's it? Well, might as well catch up on "new" songs
from last week then lol (Hey, it's new according to people who listen to the
same damn thing every year lol)<br /><br />In Twitter this week, you must have
noticed my comments and promotion of releases available
<b>"This Week on Apple Music"</b> (Get it? Read through without pausing and
you'll get it),
<b>some artists are releasing new singles upcoming January</b> including Minase
Inori, Kotobuki Minako (as mentioned last week) and Amamiya Sora. Yeah, all
technically idols by the way. Not too surprising after you see Klassic Note 2017
tbh. I can't wait to make sure this doesn't happen to my Top 20 songs this year
haha *shakes head*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay that's about it. If like
last week I'm not bothered or just plain busy to fill in the blanks here so be
it haha. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I think I need more sleep
even though my brain wants me to finish that Bar so I can be fulfilled playing
this sub-par game people call Mafia III lol bye
