I hope you guys are enjoying your weekends. I sure am not. I'm too busy working
OT that I did pretty much everything below the moment the weekend starts before
work, so that I could try to not screw up when I'll see the results of my own
efforts on coming Monday. Fingers crossed if anything bad happens because I may
not even make it on time. You know, I love sleeping, so staying awake overnight
won't be fun.<br /><br />And sorry for not having any manga in recent weeks. I'm
planning to read up on the K-ON! Shuffle series after next week is over (same
thing btw, so...), and I'm also planning to get my first set of Japanese manga
books. Yeah, I'm going to need a shelf to keep books soon haha. Meanwhile, I'm
just reading them casually for now and at work hehe let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Why Ash? Why talk about kids porno in front of Eiji?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the new
episode (#BANANAFISH18) is what we mentioned before, bringing in the fear of Ash
with his only weakness as of now: the Japan boy. Remember Blanca, that
professional of a killer who retired but is back by Golzine's orders to lure Ash
out to surrender? And so he did. After killing enough people to make it look
like accidents even though it's just his big gun doing it all (sex pun not
intended), Golzine and the others found out where Ash was hiding: on the
apartment near his hideout. That, and how important Eiji was to Ash. So yeah,
Lee's plan of instilling fear in Eiji by targetting his only weakness
technically worked, and Ash took to surrender all of his current possessions
which could work as evidence against the old man, to Lee. So yeah, all is done,
yes? Well maybe. The end of the episode leaves us with a big question on hold:
will any of them honour their promises? You wanna guess? I don't think so
though, if Golzine has other plans. If you need a reminder he's into little boys
so... yeah, I suppose he likes Japanese too lol. The more interesting part of
the episode this time around are maybe two things: why Lee was so surprised that
Ash is willing to sacrifice everything for Eiji's survival (because why not),
and whether Blanca will ever, EVER help Ash in any way. In both situations, it's
basically due to Ash seeing a speck of light in the darkness and resorting to
any means to protect it. Living in a live of danger, even I would like that life
of hope and happiness which Ash wouldn't be able to get the moment he was born.
So yeah, maybe that is why. Even with the mentor's advice, it wouldn't work on
Ash too. Not that I'm implying anything with regards to gay sex (lol), but it
seems like so; It seems like the author was just promoting love over everything
else in hindsight. Well, would be better with a girl but you know, they gotta
make it compelling to make it good. And so they did. Blanca may be right though,
that Ash is the successor (not to be head prostitute lol, but) to Golzine's
everything once he dies, so why not all of that instead? The story does real
well in the series to make sure emotions are stacked well so that even we have
to follow Ash's decisions to give up everything for one person's safety. (Sorry
Ibe-san they didn't mention about you haha) Anyways, I wonder where's the
liability to make this fall apart, for Golzine isn't going to get whatever he
wants that easily to be honest. Ash has fought before (without Blanca), he'll do
it again.<br />

P.S. "Hey I'm (Blanca) enjoying my retirement getting rid of you" would be a

I've got I wanna marry a little boy" haha Ash please don't<br /><br />

But seriously what's with the wide angle camera animations we got here? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
The new episode (#UzaMaid06) brings us a new character, and to be honest I'm not
quite ready for it, but whatever I'm no masochist I don't have to feel this much
haha. It's Midorin, previously Tsubame's superior but also, a real masochist. I
won't talk about the many stories which are mentioned in this episode because
I'm as bored as Misha-chan at this point lol, but suffice it to say Midorin
found someone to look up to, but more than just in formality in a workplace, it
seems. That, and Misha-chan took it to her hands to not only use her fancy of
Tsubame and specifically her cooking as bait to fish her out (literally), but
also to get rid of that irritating maid that has been in her house all this
time. That'll be interesting to watch because the dad probably won't disagree on
this (I mean, the father's got a good share of her weird antics), but that then
still depends on whether Midorin will be able to do her job. You know, cook
spectacularly (probably not), take care of the kid as efficiently as when you
pull that alarm that's on every kid in this show lol, and more importantly, not
be distracted by anything else. For the last one, I have a feeling Midorin would
not be able to do. Anyways, this was a wonderful episode of stories (a lot of
them), wide angle shots for some reason, and so many puns if I list them all out
I'll have to do a dozen of postscripts so I wouldn't go watch the show youself
you masochist haha<br />

because I can and if only there'll be a Twitter/Instagram account where Tsubame
posts all her images of Misha-chan it'll be about a dozen every hour haha]<br />

  </div>
</blockquote>
In this new episode (#HondaSan06) which got me engrossed once again to how
wonderful this series is, we got a strong guy for a new colleague, a sorcerer as
a manager, and fans who are literally that superhero Two-Face lol. Firstly, the
bookstore got a transferred staff who worked, to translate, at logistics. So
yeah, he's strong. He makes carrying boxes of books and paper like he was
carrying a pebble. Not even breaking a sweat, this guy. On the other hand, he's
probably going to be the kindest customer-facing person in the store which
already beats all the women in the house lol. Secondly, we have a legendary
manager. Unlike many others, this guy anticipates book stocks better than the
pros can do at playing with the stock market. Upon the death of a manga author,
book stock can already be arriving the next day as if by magic, but I guess the
only downside is it's going to be hard to search through everything which I
would say is their fault so whatever haha. Lastly, this series teaches us about
the purposes and the creation of book fairs inside the store. With more releases
participating, of course it'll bring up the popularity of the store, but it also
drew in freaks who can't stop thinking of getting their hands on whatever you
put inside those books. If you have not been reading Klassic Note Reviews, like
CDs those are called special gifts. Also known as "tokuten" in Japanese, these
small gifts are exclusive to the release and kind of a way to encourage buying
typically First Edition or pre-order stock to drive sales, I believe. That, and
there actually are fans who will ask about whether they can get their hands on a
copy and that THEY MUST and that THEY ONLY WANT THE GIFT which is NOT FOR SALE
by the way (Don't look at me I only bought from the auction site once, I swear)
and the staff still have to ensure NOT TO LAY HANDS on them even though they
have to package them? Yeah, therefore, also to prevent theft from just looking
at it, they flipped it around to the illustration instead of the photo on the
other side, which many fans blindly ignored it and confronted the staff like
they owed them money. Retards. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Haha another wonderful day at the store,
and I can't believe there are more stories to behold. "We're halfway there,
guys, we can do this!" Haha said the manager while preparing for the fair facing
a wall of unpackaged books lol<br />

P.S. Once again, too obvious of a voice because I can recognise it anywhere,
that
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/165617/Majutsushi" target="_blank"
  >mage bookstore manager</a
>
was voiced by, yours truly, the guy who voiced Kurotsuchi Mayuri in BLEACH. God,
his voice is so good.<br />P.P.S. Thanks to this show for showing us what it
means to prepare for a bookstore fair. I never gave a sh*t even in the bookstore
fairs where I'm at, so... maybe when I go to Japan I'll take a selfie of them
cut-outs to appreciate their efforts. *salutes*<br /><br />

Keeping this short and writing this early as I have work to do blah blah blah
look at intro haha. I forgot about

which dropped off this week, and also that they got signed into a major label so
congratulations (RIP online YouTube music videos), and the album is... I didn't
give the new topic song. I did give two songs though, one being that one song
they sang months ago after their 1st album, so that's good.

was okay, and I think I can give a couple, but a couple more it isn't qualified
for. Then again it isn't bad, but you kow, Klassic Note is all about melody
so... most of them already couldn't make it pass the checkpoint haha. I also
concluded on <b>Kalafina's best album</b> by letting them go with a "blaze", if
you get what I mean. I may finally be giving up on
<b>Chatmonchy's best album</b> as personally I think the mini-album in June was
more pivotal to their end than this. Stay tuned next week to see if I mention
them again here lol<br /><br />Talking about next week... *searches "14" on my
Twitter likes page* (FYI 14th November is next Wednesday which is when most
Japanese music releases are officially out) (if you need me to explain why they
have digital pre-release and on-store flag days I'll do that for KN10YEARS
maybe) we have

which I'll probably not give any songs considering Aki-chan and Yoshioka Kiyoe
didn't make the cut either, and

    >TrySail's new single</a

(try clicking anything else in there from like, after Valentine's Day next year
haha) which will probably be a pass again. The topic song isn't terrible, so
that's a good start.<br /><br />On Twitter news this week (sorry for the
spamming of overlays for PC viewers because I see the agony in moving the mouse
through this paragraph),

listen to songs, but I'll try. Really should go listen to some indie artists
sometime maybe no promises even to myself<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm done.
Cya guys next week then, and until then... Honda-san will be up provided if I'm
not dead from lack of sleep tomorrow, pop-ups will arrive when I'm able, and
hopefully you've been reading up on The Klassic Note Spirit because I took time
writing it. It's going to be hard finding thumbnails for next week's posts so
I'm finding ways to do it now. Enjoy your weekend while it lasts, yes?
