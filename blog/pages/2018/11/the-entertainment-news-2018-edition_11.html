I sure am not. I'm too busy workingOT that I did pretty much everything below the moment the weekend starts beforework, so that I could try to not screw up when I'll see the results of my ownefforts on coming Monday. Fingers crossed if anything bad happens because I maynot even make it on time. You know, I love sleeping, so staying awake overnightwon't be fun.<br /><br />And sorry for not having any manga in recent weeks. I'mplanning to read up on the K-ON! Shuffle series after next week is over (samething btw, so...), and I'm also planning to get my first set of Japanese mangabooks. Yeah, I'm going to need a shelf to keep books soon haha. Meanwhile, I'mjust reading them casually for now and at work hehe let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH18">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Someone ate some (of the salad)" WELL NO SHIT haha  </div></blockquote>Why Ash? Why talk about kids porno in front of Eiji?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the newepisode (#BANANAFISH18) is what we mentioned before, bringing in the fear of Ashwith his only weakness as of now: the Japan boy. Remember Blanca, thatprofessional of a killer who retired but is back by Golzine's orders to lure Ashout to surrender? And so he did. After killing enough people to make it looklike accidents even though it's just his big gun doing it all (sex pun notintended), Golzine and the others found out where Ash was hiding: on theapartment near his hideout. That, and how important Eiji was to Ash. So yeah,Lee's plan of instilling fear in Eiji by targetting his only weaknesstechnically worked, and Ash took to surrender all of his current possessionswhich could work as evidence against the old man, to Lee. So yeah, all is done,yes? Well maybe. The end of the episode leaves us with a big question on hold:will any of them honour their promises? You wanna guess? I don't think sothough, if Golzine has other plans. If you need a reminder he's into little boysso... yeah, I suppose he likes Japanese too lol. The more interesting part ofthe episode this time around are maybe two things: why Lee was so surprised thatAsh is willing to sacrifice everything for Eiji's survival (because why not),and whether Blanca will ever, EVER help Ash in any way. In both situations, it'sbasically due to Ash seeing a speck of light in the darkness and resorting toany means to protect it. Living in a live of danger, even I would like that lifeof hope and happiness which Ash wouldn't be able to get the moment he was born.So yeah, maybe that is why. Even with the mentor's advice, it wouldn't work onAsh too. Not that I'm implying anything with regards to gay sex (lol), but itseems like so; It seems like the author was just promoting love over everythingelse in hindsight. Well, would be better with a girl but you know, they gottamake it compelling to make it good. And so they did. Blanca may be right though,that Ash is the successor (not to be head prostitute lol, but) to Golzine'severything once he dies, so why not all of that instead? The story does realwell in the series to make sure emotions are stacked well so that even we haveto follow Ash's decisions to give up everything for one person's safety. (SorryIbe-san they didn't mention about you haha) Anyways, I wonder where's theliability to make this fall apart, for Golzine isn't going to get whatever hewants that easily to be honest. Ash has fought before (without Blanca), he'll doit again.<br /><div class="popup">  <span class="initial"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P_xMYvokV_A/W-ZQ_1tQYNI/AAAAAAAArV0/fOROnc85kXUMxB5LbUgXyd5fGoJBsKB8wCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish18_blanca.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Because he looked so good, I decided to give him another shot.          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gI7juTcpIrA/W-ZQ_1jJEXI/AAAAAAAArV4/qh_KX20spJ8ejKvIQEsSlFj5pufVbz2nwCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish18_eiji.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            #NotSpoilers Eiji is fine btw he's just sleepin'          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ></div>P.S.

It's Midorin, previously Tsubame's superior but also, a real masochist. Iwon't talk about the many stories which are mentioned in this episode becauseI'm as bored as Misha-chan at this point lol, but suffice it to say Midorinfound someone to look up to, but more than just in formality in a workplace, itseems. That, and Misha-chan took it to her hands to not only use her fancy ofTsubame and specifically her cooking as bait to fish her out (literally), butalso to get rid of that irritating maid that has been in her house all thistime. That'll be interesting to watch because the dad probably won't disagree onthis (I mean, the father's got a good share of her weird antics), but that thenstill depends on whether Midorin will be able to do her job. You know, cookspectacularly (probably not), take care of the kid as efficiently as when youpull that alarm that's on every kid in this show lol, and more importantly, notbe distracted by anything else. For the last one, I have a feeling Midorin wouldnot be able to do. Anyways, this was a wonderful episode of stories (a lot ofthem), wide angle shots for some reason, and so many puns if I list them all outI'll have to do a dozen of postscripts so I wouldn't go watch the show youselfyou masochist haha<br /><div class="popup">  <span class="initial"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aEvXvLSi_zE/W-ZaDnID4lI/AAAAAAAArWI/30hHhi-lrM8tAPs_qFy844pz0jZB5MLGwCLcBGAs/s320/uzasugiru06_house.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The less than spectacular wide angle animation shots this episode          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5QiEbTirj94/W-ZaDt9RBOI/AAAAAAAArWE/_YKzdrFLutku7aFqdI3XYmW-CMxsO9AKACLcBGAs/s320/uzasugiru06_trash.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The less than spectacular wide angle animation shots this episode          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ></div>P.S.

That one fan that Honda-san received a call on is LITERALLY me    when I saw special gifts for CDs when I started buying them I'm like "I hope    they don't get fingerprints on them" lmao (Eh, now? Not so much haha)  </div></blockquote>In this new episode (#HondaSan06) which got me engrossed once again to howwonderful this series is, we got a strong guy for a new colleague, a sorcerer asa manager, and fans who are literally that superhero Two-Face lol. Firstly, thebookstore got a transferred staff who worked, to translate, at logistics. Soyeah, he's strong. He makes carrying boxes of books and paper like he wascarrying a pebble. Not even breaking a sweat, this guy. On the other hand, he'sprobably going to be the kindest customer-facing person in the store whichalready beats all the women in the house lol. Secondly, we have a legendarymanager. Unlike many others, this guy anticipates book stocks better than thepros can do at playing with the stock market. Upon the death of a manga author,book stock can already be arriving the next day as if by magic, but I guess theonly downside is it's going to be hard to search through everything which Iwould say is their fault so whatever haha. Lastly, this series teaches us aboutthe purposes and the creation of book fairs inside the store. With more releasesparticipating, of course it'll bring up the popularity of the store, but it alsodrew in freaks who can't stop thinking of getting their hands on whatever youput inside those books. If you have not been reading Klassic Note Reviews, likeCDs those are called special gifts. Also known as "tokuten" in Japanese, thesesmall gifts are exclusive to the release and kind of a way to encourage buyingtypically First Edition or pre-order stock to drive sales, I believe. That, andthere actually are fans who will ask about whether they can get their hands on acopy and that THEY MUST and that THEY ONLY WANT THE GIFT which is NOT FOR SALEby the way (Don't look at me I only bought from the auction site once, I swear)and the staff still have to ensure NOT TO LAY HANDS on them even though theyhave to package them? Yeah, therefore, also to prevent theft from just lookingat it, they flipped it around to the illustration instead of the photo on theother side, which many fans blindly ignored it and confronted the staff likethey owed them money. Retards. *laugh* Haha another wonderful day at the store,and I can't believe there are more stories to behold. "We're halfway there,guys, we can do this!" Haha said the manager while preparing for the fair facinga wall of unpackaged books lol<br /><div class="popup">  <span class="initial"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IHqgHI7RDOE/W-wWAoFZG4I/AAAAAAAArck/QKCvXq1Iws4dIsyxpqZTP-Y1O3YhrFnfACLcBGAs/s320/hondasan06_honda.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Now I know why they got a skeleton to do the reactions lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z7X2BoQfWQ8/W-wWAshQFuI/AAAAAAAArcg/VPcF6fUrjWEJPbKCE7zigu9FvUCuyRqaQCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan06_punch.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            #StopWorkplaceViolence lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ></div>P.S.

Stay tuned next week to see if I mentionthem again here lol<br /><br />Talking about next week... *searches "14" on myTwitter likes page* (FYI 14th November is next Wednesday which is when mostJapanese music releases are officially out) (if you need me to explain why theyhave digital pre-release and on-store flag days I'll do that for KN10YEARSmaybe) we have<b  ><a    href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/cover-life/1440422529"    target="_blank"    >fumika's cover album</a  ></b>which I'll probably not give any songs considering Aki-chan and Yoshioka Kiyoedidn't make the cut either, and<b  ><a    href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/azure-ep/1537901247"    target="_blank"    >TrySail's new single</a  ></b>(try clicking anything else in there from like, after Valentine's Day next yearhaha) which will probably be a pass again. The topic song isn't terrible, sothat's a good start.<br /><br />On Twitter news this week (sorry for thespamming of overlays for PC viewers because I see the agony in moving the mousethrough this paragraph),<b  ><a    href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1054685187253067781"    target="_blank"    >yanaginagi is releasing a best album</a  ></b>come early 2019 and<b  ><a    href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1060003941134598144"    target="_blank"    >ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION will release their new album in December</a  ></b>. That's it, actually. Maybe I missed something or I didn't have enough time tolisten to songs, but I'll try. Really should go listen to some indie artistssometime maybe no promises even to myself<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm done.Cya guys next week then, and until then... Honda-san will be up provided if I'mnot dead from lack of sleep tomorrow, pop-ups will arrive when I'm able, andhopefully you've been reading up on The Klassic Note Spirit because I took timewriting it. It's going to be hard finding thumbnails for next week's posts soI'm finding ways to do it now. Enjoy your weekend while it lasts, yes?<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
