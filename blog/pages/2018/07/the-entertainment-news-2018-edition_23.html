Hey. So it has come to my mind I will be reviewing a couple more Anime episodes
every week, so in order to reduce the content on the now I would call "Main"
issue, I'm going to do this like how those newspaper presses like to do: slot in
an extra issue for either latest news or some extra content compiled for the
release. Introducing for the first time in Klassic Note Web Reports: The
Entertainment News - Anime Extra!!!<br /><br />"It's the extra! It's the extra!
Come grab a copy to read all about it!!" I wished a newspaper boy would read
this haha<br /><br />(*Bear in mind that this only contains half the Anime
episodes reviewed for the week as late night Sunday Anime is technically not
within reach for the Sunday main issue. Be sure to check out the main issue too
for more... Anime reviews.) (No one cares, huh.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

God they gotta start the show with something out of the world like armpits okay
it's not alien we just don't... okay let's talk about the other stuff haha. The
new episode (#AsobiAsobase03) seriously always wants to one-up that going to
school Anime as they did their own Anime Betrayal scene too. Damn, it's not a
coincidence after all. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> The story goes, as usual, in three parts.
Firstly, I spoiled the story above. So yeah, the girls were playing as usual,
and Kasumi hates the punishment of doing work, of course, shadowed by her
experience with her sister, but this time around, Olivia gets to set the rules,
just without the work part. So armpits? Sure. Thing is, they've got a stink bomb
amongst them. I won't say who, but it's the one who put the most makeup haha.
Next, is the teacher? Wow didn't expect the English teacher to be in focus at
any point, but yes
<strike>this is now</strike> she is now the adviser. And with no minimum amount
of members and occupying an unregistered room brings us to our last part: the
takeover. The Shougi Club recently filed permission to use the classroom where
the girls are in, and instead of conciliation, the Shougi Club president decided
to play a game with them. I mean, it's a good choice considering this is a
pastimes-themed Anime, but yeah, guess who won. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> As everything might
seem status quo now, we do have some sort of development, although I must say
it's still riddled with absurd jokes, crazy actions and... seriously horrible
reaction faces. No seriously, can we just stop that? *speaks in Hanako's voice*
<i>It's disgusting.</i> <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> OKAY THE TEACHER PART OF THIS EPISODE IS STUPID
WHY PUT AN ADULT IN THIS SHOW THIS IS FOR CUTE ATTRACTIVE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WITH
SPECTACULAR NEWBIE FEMALE VOICE ACTORS DAMMIT lol (I mean, I gotta scream like
them somehow)<br />

P.S. In case you need a reminder, go watch episode 1 on why Kasumi has a problem
with people settling who does work using games haha<br />P.P.S. Eh just a
reminder to all who are making new social media accounts please note that all
new passwords must contain at least one capitalised alphabet, non-capitalised
alphabet and a numerical digit. (So, the teacher's suggestion doesn't apply.
Might I suggest "Kekkon&amp;Hayaku69" lmao)<br /><br />

Wow, that was quite a comeback. Considering the lack of an ending theme FOR THIS
SEASON??? And the fact that the opening theme is not done by the one Linked
Horizon, you got to think the stuff from this new episode (#AttackOnTitan38)
onward could be nothing but a haphazard attempt to make sure audience like us
don't forget about them. And yes, my suspicions have been confirmed. This season
in particular focuses on two main things which will blow your mind BEFORE we
even get into the plot. Red Dead Redemption 2 and... Captain Levi for some
reason. Okay, the former is reference to the... bunch of killers with...
air-powered guns? I don't know now. We're in the... 13th century, right? Weird
things aside, let's talk about plot. Several things were mentioned in
recollection to what happened in the previous season, that the Scouts now have a
mission to track down whoever did all this to them, those weird, fully grown and
matured Titans with some level of conscience, but also the importance of Eren
(as a growing human-Titan hybrid similar to those out there who kicked his ass)
and Christia/Historia (considering she knows a lot and she's of royal blood?) in
this particular case. Problem is, I'm totally speculating because this show is
not that interesting and it's constantly surfacing in this episode all the time,
we have a lot of rats in out midst. Yes, remember there was only one in the
first season of the Anime series? Well now... I can't even count. The Military
Police in city might be involved, but also this can go up even further to... I
don't know, maybe the King knows something of the Titans which will lead to an
eventuality where we see a world of Titans through the obliteration of humans in
its entirety? Hey, they didn't tell you about the other districts under this
kingdom. Well, at least we <i>know</i> there's a kingdom now. All in all, too
much plot, plenty of conspiracy, and little action. Was Attack on Titan like
this before? I mean, it's despair up till now, but this... we going emotional at
some point? Hopefully. All this politics is making me sick. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />

P.S. It doesn't need to take more time to figure out that much in this show, I
suppose. They like to give it away many a times when they expected you to
notice. I mean, it's the season premier episode anyways. We've got some ways to
go from here.<br /><br />

No seriously what's with the dope opening theme song lol okay this show. And
hoho I like this show has the gossip 'cos what are you going to do in the Edo
period (covering 16th-17th century) anyways? Firstly, some context as to why I'm
watching this. I was here because of Mikakoshi. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, I was here
because she tweeted about her in this show. So yeah, and it's been some time
since I watched a historical-based mystery Anime, so here I am. And boy, am I
wanting to continue with this series, it's quite interesting. Now, the first
episode (#Tsukumogami01) makes me think that the tsukumogami are like a
paparazzi squad where they can go eavesdrop on others to help solve mysteries in
the district. Then aside, the story goes of a rental shop (in this case it's not
just specific items like DVDs(?), bicycles, umbrellas (lol China) and cars etc.)
who lends items to people who might have a need for it. Say, you want a change
in accessories. You don't have to keep buying them because in this pawn shop you
can "sell" your current one and switch it with another, technically speaking. So
yeah. But the exception in this Edo period shop is, many of them are possessed
by gods. (We're not talking about single-entity overlords here like Jesus and
Buddha, mind you) Gods which manifest out of care of the items treasured by
humans. Amongst them are (I'm going Yachiru naming mode here because I don't
remember their names) bat brat, moon head, fake smoker, miniature female shop
owner and hair comb rabbit lol. They live in the shop Seiji and Okou are in (the
latter being the female elder sister here), and first up we have... well this is
literally a gossip episode so I'll leave it for the tsukimogami to give you some
sweet headlines, but yeah, it's a marriage come unwanted. So... you know we're
going to hear this often, but yeah, if you had no choice but to sell your
treasured items for survival, you gotta do it. That's too bad. On the other
hand, just die with it already the god in it is more important than you haha.
Lastly, I would like to compliment on how well this show was done. The animation
is great, the story is told well with modern society references in case you
never lived in the Edo period in Japan lol (they need to explain the koku thing
though), and there's sick theme songs to get the kids in. All in all, it may
make of quite a history lesson that I've never seen before, and this might take
be on a journey. My last time was that Koisento OVA back in 2010 which
technically is not an accurate depiction of history anyways. but yeah, I
expected that kind of theme songs. So yeah, sorry Shishido Kavka; Kuraki Mai
will be next on my music list.<br />
