Hey.<br /><br />Tomorrow marks a point. Well, it sort of marks a point
considering I'm not in a full-time job yet, so... tomorrow technically makes me
officially unemployed. I know I said this weeks ago already, but this time...
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay life talk over let's get to entertainment<br /><br />I hope you
noticed the "Anime Extra" post of the previous issue.
<u
  >Because half of the shows I watch are going to be aired on Sunday late
  night,</u
>&nbsp;I can only watch them earliest on Monday so hopefully that extra post
will be done on the same day for now. This is still assuming I have the time to
watch them all when I have a job (I don't for now) and push the reviews early so
they don't have to wait a week around. (Well no one cares anyway) That's the
best compromise I can think of now. Screw you Anime; next time make it before
Sunday, yes? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH04">

Hmm... it's just filling up the blanks on this story? The new episode
(#BANANAFISH04) talks about... more plot developments it seems. And yeah,
Arthur's guys did get to Eiji. Well, it was an easy lead, and... well let's just
say someone died in the crossover before Shorter could do anything. Yes, that
one China guy Eiji met in the restaurant. Moving on, Ash struggles to stay in
prison after that realisation that his cell mate is technically his enemy, but
hey, apparently it's the only one who will care about him too. Changing cell
mates, Ash has got to deal with more trouble which he takes on gracefully, but
that's not the point. To get him out will be the focus on next episode, where he
and Max will (chances are) be allowed out of prison and hopefully, be able to
continue the investigation under the eyes of the mafia. Thankfully, (innocent,
stupid) people like Eiji refuse to go away from the mystery, owing to the one
Ash Lynx for all these, decide to stay and help. I mean, go home, kid. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
All in all, an interesting episode more for information than on action imo, but
hey, at least we did see some fighting. Maybe not so much next week, maybe. Then
again, at this point we still can't be so sure of what Banana Fish was. Ash
talked about an address, and that is supposedly going to lead us to more. Man,
this is going to be a wild goose chase, I swear.<br />

P.S. Not like I have good deduction skills, but I'd like to believe this was
developed over the war. Remember when Max said Griffin "depended on drugs to
survive"? And this drug lasted thrice as long as LSD? So yeah, you gotta take
something to not feel the pain. Then again, they didn't tell the guy about the
side effects, I assume. And the mafia is trying to popularise this? Hmm, we
don't even need a serial killer incident to get this under the police
microscope. Well, not unless the whole system is corrupt anyway lol<br /><br />

We're not even halfway through guys don't do the ending so quickly though
Andou-san haha okay the new episode (#ChioChan04) touches us in... many
(illegal) ways than you can imagine. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Firstly, cigarettes. Okay, nothing
bad was taught here I hope, but yeah, Chio-chan talked about how cool she
could've been and to be honest, I'd like to try that myself someday. The "you
dropped something" thing. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Stupid things aside (lol), the girls decide
to have a shoot-off (as in taking pictures of each other) to see who's cooler,
and man, did the animation quality go up real fast haha. They almost are going
into the muff thing after school but the teacher found out about their "toy"
right at the entrance of the school for some reason, and no one else will
believe Chio-chan is cool and can smoke. No really, don't take those pictures
out Chio-chan you'll get you and your friend in real trouble. Next up:
Andou-san?? Yeah, that bike gang leader is delivering newspapers now. (He's
actually doing a proper job now...) While trying to shoot me on the foot for not
finding a job yet (though I totally agree with them that working sucks HAHA),
Chio-chan had to help him out in doing his job because... Manana does not know
of the legend yet. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I mean, it was just a joke two episodes ago,
remember? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But yeah, it also perfectly appeared to be somewhat of a
farce to the initial betting Manana suggested before she approaches some random
guy to ask if he's enjoying his job. (Don't approach me btw
<strike>I won't say I will enjoy my job no matter what it is</strike>&nbsp;I
don't have a job yet haha) (No seriously those people who took the papers are
a**holes) Lastly, Manana gets a chance to rectify the situation we saw in the
first episode where Chio-chan jumps into the trash upon seeing the most popular
girl in class greet her and wants to go to school with her. I mean, besides the
right way of just looking behind you in surprise (I mean, why not?) (I can just
flaunt about how interesting I am to Hosokawa-san anyways haha) Manana suggested
making the most awkward expression to signal to the other person you acknowledge
him/her but did not ignore her because you have no idea if he/she is greeting
you? Well it didn't work anyway look behind you instead guys lmao<br />

I think I missed this one so I'll talk about it since there aren't any new ones
since... 5 months ago? Damn. Oh well. The "latest" chapter (59) continues on the
heroine contest in the school, where Usami is still angry at Uchimaki for
helping the Manga Club out so he's at Imari-chan's side. Well, cross-dressed I
guess it's not a problem, until you notice that it is. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oops that's too
much of a spoiler? Hmm... I was looking forward to the live drawing of Usami of
Colette-chan though. Well, it's pretty much the same thing but... well read for
yourself, yes? And considering this was so much later than before, read the one
chapter before too, yes?<br />

Hmm I think I know why but I'll keep mum for now, since it has yet been another
quiet week in Klassic Note, but I've come to give more songs as far as I can,
considering I'm still holding much stricter requirements for giving songs this
year. I try man, but the new ones out there are just continuing to disappoint.
(Release mentions are going to be all over the place so if you would forgive me)
<b>Natsukawa Shiina's 3rd single</b> kind of rocked the Oricon charts in Japan,
but here... maybe not so much. I rejected her B-side through and through so yeah
Nan-chan your single-on-my-shelf streak is over, even then giving the topic song
was... kind of a challenge. It's not as bad though compared to the one song in
<b>Kuso Iinkai's new EP</b> I have to give just because it fits my mood now,
another from <b>Amamiya Sora's 2nd album</b> because she's cute in it hehe, and
another from <b>miwa's best album </b>because... I recalled giving "Delight"
from 2013 and "We are the light" sounds like it. So yeah, ignoring the beats and
giving the melody. Finally, <b>Niitsu Yui's debut album</b> was reviewed by me
again giving faith to her, hoping that I'll pick up another tune or two like her
previous work, but nah, one was the best I can give. Which also officially
closes my review of all of the releases mentioned above. Now to the real new
songs.<br /><br /><b>Hanazawa Kana's new single</b> was so close to be on my
shelf (it'll be her first if it happens) but I rejected the only B-side instead,
leaving still me trying to give her the topic song because it wasn't good imo.
(I'll watch the tie-up Anime at some point I've got 5 shows this season now lol)
I'm also hooked to the
<b>Anime "Tsukumogami Kashimasu" opening theme song</b> for some reason after
listening to it on Monday (details in Anime Extra and my Twitter feed), but
suffice it to say I have to give Shishido Kavka again now. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I also took
a listen to <b>NICO Touches The Walls new EP</b>, and... it wasn't as good as
the last one tbh. Lastly, I gave a listen to&nbsp;<b
  >Cider Girl and their full album</b
>
which was released last year and I regret not knowing them because they sound
cool. I would say their coolness only will last as far as Cocoro Auction where
at this point they are still in theme, and once they have to write their own
songs it'll be a very different feel. I can see it coming already. Which also
explains why I didn't give anything outside of the album even though two new
singles have been released this year.<br /><br />Next week I'll spend some time
listening to the
<b>new theme song releases for Anime "Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro"</b> I just got my
hands on just now, and also hopefully not delay all the songs I've mentioned so
far in giving them. Yes, at this point most of the songs I give this year needs
some level of brainwashing. That or I ignore them enough and I don't care to
give them anymore. My latest victim of this phenomenon which I'm not proud of is
H ZETTRIO. Remember they weren't mentioned after the one time earlier this year?
Haha now you know.<br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm done. I'm sweating as I'm
typing this right now even though I should be calm and collected so I can sleep
later. Well, it's not going to be possible considering I have a graduation
ceremony to attend (my graduation, to be specific) and I still can't tie my
double-sided tie lmao why did I buy this oh because I had to use that voucher I
got for the suit haha cya guys next week OH NO it's tomorrow my apologies
hopefully I'll be done early so I can do this, yes? Bye bye<br /><br />[P.S. Is
this how kids do long sentences without punctuation on the Internet I think I'm
doing pretty well sorry if reading on it sucks though I proof read all my posts
and I think I can still handle it just read like a denizen on the Internet
you'll get used to it haha]
