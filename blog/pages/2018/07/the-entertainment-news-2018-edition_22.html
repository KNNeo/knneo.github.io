This week, I was a liar. I lied to everyone around me that I wasjob-hunting. So you see this is why you should write a blog you can write thingslike this so you don't feel so bad about myself I should start sending my resumesoon haha<br /><br />Okay let's start we need to buff up (my resume too, but) myentertainment every week for this season so I can appropriately de-stress<strike>in case I</strike>&nbsp;I can't bear to say that I still want to bealive lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Do it at home" DAMN SHE NAILED IT ON THE LOT OF THEM  </div></blockquote>Goddamn Hanako is a national treasure haha she teaches us the real life stuff,ladies. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The new episode (#AsobiAsobase02) of the series (in which Ihaven't even given the theme songs yet) still gives us as many endings as youcan imagine, which seriously makes me flare up like the ending song andpossibly... be giving my next death metal song since Anime "K-ON!" in 2010. No Iswear, this show is weird. Now that I'm no longer a student and I can't do thatput-your-stuff-at-your-back (literally) stunt anymore, let's talk about theepisode. (As you can see I'm trying to put as many jokes in my review so youguys will go watch it) Three main topics are raised today introducing to us moresecondary characters that we can handle. Firstly, the new student councilpresident. Don't ask how she got elected (KILL ME BABY I'll never vote for thatfour-eyed bi- *cues male voice* -tch no matter what), but suffice it to say nowshe has to be in the position to approve stupid clubs like these. Hey, she gotherself covered when she said she'll play with anyone to get - in contrary towhat anyone desires - whatever she wants, to say the least. Next, is basicallyfemale audience bait. But heck, do girls watch this? I see it as a disaster ifyou're like, in middle school and you watch this show lol. On the other hand, asHanako mentioned in total jealousy, you don't need makeup to be famous, but asOlivia said, it's practice. Yeah I get it but *looks at quote* haha you get italready. Then again, someone must be doing a terrible job of makeup to make itlooks like a school bully incident haha. Lastly, is<strike>Honoka</strike> Hanako's revenge to her soft tennis club. Surrounded bypopular girls who want popular guys and a coach who wants her back desperately,you can guess that the non-title match between the two clubs (I wouldn't callthe latter a club) will go. If you didn't laugh at Kasumi breaking the custom<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hagoita" target="_blank">hagoita</a> you needto grow a nerve. And as I continue to stretch on my laughing nerves this showwill get me somewhere. I can feel it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And I think it will too for youguys. Well, if you can take gags in the first place. This one is not foramateurs. *plays death metal music*<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu9geFl4HNA/W0yOkuTWFvI/AAAAAAAAoiA/N5Rbb1B6XUYUoLAuT-_S5_Jcrpsu1653gCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase02_olivia.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I've heard of "one ear in, one ear out" but not with the same mouth            lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JHvd5lHcd_w/W0yOkj-KV5I/AAAAAAAAoiE/ojgFIImBV1QUTHw4HmDm8peDQeMsHTBAgCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase02_eyecatch2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I seriously want the drawings to be good.            <a              href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fc-kmIQl5l8/W1SSgH0-6jI/AAAAAAAAosM/FpakFZbjNfoRBFXuEm1TxZYWL4kcZD7MgCLcBGAs/s1600/0716b.png"              target="_blank"              >I seriously do.</a            >          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. YOU GUYS THINK I CAN LEAVE THIS REVIEW WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE SUPERRIPPED FEMALE(?) TEACHER WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW MAKEUP??? I'm pretty sure someonewill know the reference here but I'm popular so I don't know tehe<br />P.P.S.Like seriously, must they give those fugly faces when the girls are supposed tobe at their best? I mean, Hanako looks better in the screwed up makeup then thenormal animation of her for some reason lol<br />[Let's see... looking at thecredits (and MAL) I know Olivia is voiced by the one who did for Joe-kun if youremember "PriPri Chii-chan" and Kasumi is voiced by the one who... get this: shevoiced Akane-chan in "Tsuki ga Kirei" OMG]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    I mean, if you're into little boys and you listen to Eiji OF COURSE you have    to protect Ash hehe  </div></blockquote>Wow. I seriously don't know whether to continue with this series or not, but Iwould have to say I should. The new episode (#BANANAFISH03) continues on Ash'sadventures as he is admitted into prison, but of course, he's not going to havea good time there. But this episode is also pivotal not because of the...homosexual references, but of the truth. We have finally been given some clue,or as far as there is, about what Banana Fish is. It's likely an organisation.Person unlikely, since it got so many rumours and people who knew about itkilled. And its latest truth-seeker had to sacrifice his life for it, as seen inepisode 1. The drug, is apparently part of the likely drug trafficking systemrunning in the underground, which would explain how this has never been seen bymany, even the... not to legal doctors. Sadly, this investigation which has beenhanded over to the innocent boy Eiji, may end right here as Arthur - instead ofthe prison boys who have been dispatched by Dino and should have tortured themain guy to get information out of him - has gotten in the tracks. What willhappen next? Man, this show makes cliffhangers so good, it made the kissingscene look like a joke. And I still believe it is. Although I would most likelywant to assume that this is the reason why it probably did not get an Animeadaptation 20 years ago, this show still delivers great quality in terms of plotportrayal and everything else in between. Maybe now is a good time to think ofhow to give the theme songs.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jF-8VfijuZg/W1Rt6MpdaII/AAAAAAAAorA/4eGWy5unW5QzISOa82JUdg80abcxDq4xwCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish03_eiji.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I mean, if you can get past this part, there's a good mystery behind        this show.      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ChioChan03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Have a drink every time they say Bloody Butterfly" lol (oh you guys don't    know drinking games?)  </div></blockquote>And... that's why they put the boob physics into the show IT'S FOR KABADDI???Lmao and welcome to the new episode (#ChioChan03) where we talk about bikegangs, kabaddi and physical tests that Chio-chan tries so hard to be on theborder? Man, this show has everything haha. And by the way, Chio-chan is WAAAAAYtoo cool to be on this show lol. Okay, the episode. Firstly, the boring stuff.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The bike gang leader as we know of now as Andou, is seen again in thepark as Chio-chan is on her way (to school of course) and... she decides to makesure people don't speak of her "name" again haha. So yeah, they do up a decent"show" to make sure the members do not question their leader again. But man,that was quite a show. I like how the one guy is not scared of a high schoolgirl but totally freak out when Andou tells him he'll get killed lol. Okay, nowfor the fun stuff haha. Didn't know I was actually that invested into givingyuri until this particular episode (and you thought the kissing thing in theAnime before this was weird) but yeah we're introduced to another new characterKushitori, and it all started from a joke. Yeah. Hey, you wished your journey toschool was this funny. Okay, besides laughing my hardest in this series and thisseasons of Anime with Manana-chan (Omigawa-san can we get more of your laughsplease?) As female voice actors are my fetish as what fellow female schoolmatesis to Kushitori-senpai, as expected she cannot resist when you play with herKabaddi Club against the rules (I'll leave you guys to figure out what my fetishis in this scene hehe). You learn these in video games? Man, I gotta play gamesmore. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All in all, it was a total joy to laugh at, and man this showjust keeps getting better with those sexual references. Stellar cast, I must say(<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span> fetishism), and I think Chio-chan and Manana-chan will have to sign upfor secondary clubs to practice their yoga lmao. Just to end this, I like how wehave no idea Kushitori-senpai is a freak until they draw close up animations onher face haha this show is fantastic<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_k4pGFTJso/W1R3LR9MtkI/AAAAAAAAorM/trQmssn6Z_soiwSJyZ5mMya9QU_2SswWgCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan03_hug.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Here's your only hint for the statement "Kushitori-senpai likes            girls" haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SWnbUodlPl8/W1R3LT0g4HI/AAAAAAAAorQ/vmEPdJgPG7EfiQLyiwYNSTnKF23OyvWBACLcBGAs/s320/chiochan03_hosokawa.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            You know you wouldn't be this happy when you get touched lol<br />(No            I cannot show that stuff this is a family website)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Heck, it sucks to even be a basic form of the human bodylol  </div></blockquote>"We got bored of the main girl, so we changed focus characters" haha no that'slikely not the intent buy as you can see they can't always let Kana-chan takeall the limelight lol. The new episode (#HatarakuSaibou03) still is not enoughto convince me to continue with this show, to say the least. (But the openingtheme song is burnt in my brain liao so...) Let's talk about what is keeping meaway from this show and giving me the creeps. Firstly, the emotional storiesbehind it. As you have watched it, the one naive T cell, after muchintroduction, suffers from an unusual character? I mean, this sure is weird inthis show, and most likely not any level of depiction of how the human bodyworks (no really, no one has proven that your body cells are pussies), but ifthis is how they get the kids in (with the kids as platelets too) then I'm notgiving it. Next, is how straightforward silly is. I know I don't mind thesekinds of shows, but every episode of seeing an enemy and clearing it every time(well, until a virus mutation happens in this case) is getting kind ofrepetitive, because you know how eventually wins. Thirdly, introductions. Iwon't say it's the subs I'm watching this show with is getting in the way (it'sto improve readability as the narrator reads it all out) but suffice it to saythat every time a cell needs to be introduced it kind of breaks the momentum ofthe show significantly, and that kind of pisses me off. I mean, you know actionshows don't do too much introduction- Oh they do? No wonder I'm not watchingmost of them haha. Lastly, the jokes. Sorry but, I'm entertained, not having alaugh. Unlike the previous show in review above (lol) this one is not cut outfor jokes. I guess I'll only get the puns and everything else... let's just sayit's more lame than funny. So yeah, I may not be giving this show after all."Food poisoning"?? No, not interested. You guys can have a laugh if you enjoyedit though; I'd rather take care of my body than watch it.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C8MwkwJR6aM/W1R--eg5RrI/AAAAAAAAorg/bi9Lh2JZ2nQgCsd0xVDFkWZMRI9-NELGACLcBGAs/s320/hatarakusaibou03_sorry.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        MFW this show is popular but I didn't enjoy it lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S.

Hey, #manga_irl, everybody.So yeah, it covers from accidents to sleeping in bathtubs to pampering your petcat to horror stories to Nagi-chan's dad... wait I thought this was not forcanon? Haha anyways it was a quick and funny read. Man, A Channel is stillinteresting as a slice-of-life story. And I'm still wondering why I haven'twatched that OVA episode which is on hold for like, two months already. (Oops,but yeah even if I watched it I might not do a review here)<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="317"          data-original-width="245"          height="200"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PvNNA4QjHCQ/W1SPSdnQYGI/AAAAAAAAosA/2xdRQbBAO7YKQ_5ht_gIwcx4L-7WWC1ewCLcBGAs/s200/115.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="154"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I mean, if you were the father you'll like your daughter hehe      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote><strike>This week is a dull week</strike> I mean, every week is a dull week ifI'm going to judge like this haha. Okay, let's talk about the<strike>stuff</strike> music I've listened to this week which are good. Let'sget <b>[Alexandros] new single</b> out of the day because (1) I'm not watchingthe real live action movie of BLEACH and (2) man that was a terrible single.Yeah, you guys heard this here first. No seriously, it sucked. Especiallycompared to my impression of them in 2016. Then again, their performance thisyear isn't spectacular, so let's move on. <b>Kuso Iinkai's new single</b> isn'tthat interesting too as the topic song failed to catch my attention so I'mdiverting my mood to the B-sides and hopefully I'll give one of them I'm intoone of them at the moment so that's good news. <b>FINLAND's 2nd full album</b>,as mentioned last week, was... not as bad as I thought. It's like a betterversion of SHISHAMO (sorry, girls) but then again I can't really love thathigh-pitched vocalist you're no Hashimoto Eriko (from Chatmonchy) dear girl.Nonetheless I'll give a couple more songs while I'm at it their melodies aredecent anyway. Lastly, <b>Natsukawa Shiina's 3rd single</b> is NOT going up onmy shelf anytime soon since I can reject her B-side. The topic song though... Ifeel for her screams, and I did mention I like that cry which is present on herprevious single but this has taken it to a thousand, so...<br /><br />Well nextweek's going to be boring at Klassic Note (unless I exclude those releases I'mlazy to write on my Excel document now) so<b>I may go back to a couple of releases for the month</b> I say I want to givechance again, like miwa's best album and Niitsu Yui's "debut album". Also, I'veonly given one (and that's with a female vocalist too so that's going to affectresults this year) of the many indie artists I've listened to last month, so Imay go back and dig around again. Wish me luck.<br /><br />This week in myTwitterverse (it's a term, apparently) <b>Sambomaster's new single</b> hasrevealed itself on the Internet in a short music video on YouTube and digitalrelease two weeks before official release,<b>LuckLife's new music video</b> (the song) is real disappointing, Y<b  >oru no Honki Dance's new music video</b>(the song) is amazing as usual, and I might want to give<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mFrhS3ywEE" target="_blank"  >these guys</a>a chance. We'll see about that next week. Oh, and if you live in the USA chancesthis<a  href="https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi?ytid=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8mFrhS3ywEE"  target="_blank"  >VEVO music video is blocked in your region</a>. I learnt it through my quick coding session this week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Iguess this is it for this week. Cya guys next week, where... I hope I won't beemployed yet I'm quite enjoying this freedom haha. Also, the new GTA Onlineupdate is coming soon, so I gotta prepare for that. (Audience: I thought youdon't play GTA anymore) (Well, not when you have <strike>friends</strike> afriend to play with) (Man, I wish I could play with Aki-chan she plays it) Untilnext time, guys. I hope you're gainfully employed and getting good money fordoing... I should consider a government job instead private companies are toomuch for me lol<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
