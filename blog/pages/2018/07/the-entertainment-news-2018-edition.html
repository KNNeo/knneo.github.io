Well, it sort ofmarks a point considering I'm not in a full-time job yet, so...<strike>tomorrow</strike>&nbsp;today technically makes me officiallyunemploye<br /><br />Okay I stole that from yesterday's post but it isn't wrong.So yeah, my university study concludes just now when I noticed the reception'sfood is the only thing I'll remember besides the people you know of in school.No really, that's it. Haha come on Anime is waaaay better than studying. Okay Ican't say that now because work WILL be worse than studying.<br /><br />I missstudying.<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay let's move on.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase04">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Man, what has Shougi become... *looks at Kiriyama Rei* GOOD REFERENCE haha  </div></blockquote>Did I just not get what a Lord of Pastimes is about? Well then again it's notthat so okay she's just a slut haha (I did say I can swear in this segment) Thenew episode (#AsobiAsobase04) gives us BUTT PLAY??? YES GUYS WE GOT IT WEFINALLY GOT IT haha okay chill everyone we've got the front half to talk aboutfirst. Wow... I don't even remember the first part haha. *looks at episodeagain* We're introduced to Maeda, who... is a thing in Hanako's home (well let'sassume he's an advisor/butler at this point) and mainly serves as advisory tothe poor kid when she was little. And as a kid, she learnt of the human ass.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Man, I can't even keep this clean. (I'm referring to the butt) Okay, tosum it up, Hanako learned the wrong things and now it has passed on to the othertwo. We then later in the episode found out that it's actually a thing?? Please,PLEASE make me stay far away from this alien inbreed of a disaster lol. Next,the teacher's life. Not really because her friends aren't that crazy, buttalking about the Lord... apparently her friend just sent a bitch to their clublmao. Okay, you can watch it yourself I'm spoiling it after the thumbnails haha.(Seriously though this is some different level of real-juu) (&lt;= refers towomen who's only purpose in life is to get laid no really Wikipedia said it)Then, there's sumo. No really, if Olivia's description of paradise which ispractically muff and actually exists, I'll make sure to make that my new fetishlol. Thankfully, there are easier ways to learn sumo without actually having tostrap a loincloth and be fat haha. Problem again is, once the rules areexplained, they just skipped all the levels and go to the professional leaguealmost immediately. I mean, it's not the first time. Lastly, if this part detersyou from watching this show again, I can't blame you. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yep, they aretalking about rated 2D content, also known, as hentai. I mean, they didn'texplicitly say it until that Maeda jerk came in with this laser (lol), but yeah,Kasumi is into BL. There. Now that you got it, go watch the show to... see itfor yourself? Oh well, this show is weird anyway I didn't expect to see thisthough BRING IN THE ANIME'S DOUJINSHI QUICK I NEED TO READ IT lol no seriouslyHanako you got to spoil the ******* somehow haha (no I cannot anymore this placeit going to get flagged)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oDv3fCtBGoQ/W155E_PWFYI/AAAAAAAAo7A/w_Jz-d7ZH9cg3LuqZD_bF5MQ-eHWypxSACLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase04_joker.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Nice            <a              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(character)"              target="_blank"              >The Joker</a            >            reference right there lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VHegpGo2BQo/W155FXDIKDI/AAAAAAAAo7E/-UQ_ZwEEMpsXXTc-in6kVPdMQJPWaEnSQCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase04_BL.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            That's a "too pure pure girl" face right there haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

"Was there a Batman villain who looks like that?" LMAObest joke of the episode haha (I have a feeling I'm not understanding a lot ofreferences in this show though if anyone is kind enough to point them outthat'll be great)<br />[GIFS FOR FUN!!!

WHAT??? Oops spoiler warning too late it seems, but manthis new episode (#AttackOnTitan39) is too good I can't stop spoiling it sosorry if you're here first (which I doubt you should be) before watching theshow because that's going to be your downfall. Nope, I'm not shooting you toadvance my motives because I don't have any. The other people in this episodethough, that's a different story. Kenny was hating of the Military Police, butnow has more power than required to get rid of Levi's squad. As mentor andsenior with a different objective than Levi himself, this will of course come toconflict sooner or later. And hell they did. After quite a struggleunfortunately Eren and Historia got taken away, and we're on our journey to thetruth. Hopefully. What I can deduce even halfway through the episode is stillcorrect even till the end: the royalty is to be replaced. Sadly, this might noteven happen. Get it? I have a good hunch (and hopefully I'm right) that thecurrent King is not a direct heir (you know, marriages) and that a direct heirhas been traced. You know, and then there's all the killing thing to make surethe succession will never come to fruition... typical change of power thinghappening in the kingdom. Problem is, this might just be a Trost districtproblem. Mainly because Historia is in the district, but more importantly it'sthe only place probably still unknown to the existence of... I would like to sayhuman-controlled Titans. And we know they exist. Titans with a mind of theirown. More questions still are waiting to be answered though, so I'll not guesstoo much at this point. I mean, if you know I'm wrong then shut up or I'll tieyou up on a chair and pluck your nails off one by one haha jkjk I won't do thatI'l just slit your throat because there are cowboys in the medieval timesapparently lol (pussy talk shortly after this thumbnail below)<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jnBfTA4E3yQ/W18ECeds2gI/AAAAAAAAo8c/2iPyfjacHQEvvyymf52ejhLuCA2TeT1_gCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan39_cowboy.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        2018 just found its new definition of the word "badass", people.      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. "Why was it me who shot first?" "Because the other person hesitated." BOOMLEVI YOU GOT JEAN REAL GOOD THERE haha no really Armin because Jean is a puss.And you're female, right? Yeah. Jean's a <i>real </i>fucking pussy haha<br />P.P.S.Wow that the latest in Anime Betrayals right there, confessing to torture oncecompared to your superior who will never budge. Good job, boy. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Tsukumogami02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Haha that Tsukuyomi is literally me after getting insulted I just hide in a    corner lol  </div></blockquote>No seriously, they're going to make you watch that little intro every week untilit ends, I swear. Also, what is new in this episode (#Tsukumogami02) of<strike>God-forsaken items</strike> okay I'm just joking those "gods" are cutebtw. This week we talk about Tsukuyomi, originally an art scroll meant for themost grand of celebrations and celebrations. You thought you looked good in themirror? Ask this guy. Unfortunately, some of his friends kind of took it too farto look at the mirror too often. Well in this case change its image every othernight. Even a human would freak out lol. And this time, it's no marriage stuffanymore we got over that haha, but it's a matter of fighting over a woman? Wait,we're not done yet? Okay. Story goes that an ancient paintings collector has itspaintings in weird arrangements (it's contents, to be specific), like historicalcharacters in normal aesthetic paintings, if you don't want to know referenceslike I do. But I do know of<a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter"  target="_blank"  >Kaguyahime</a>(I was close to watching a<a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Princess_Kaguya"  target="_blank"  >Studio Ghibli movie</a>about it too hmm maybe I should do it) and her story of bamboos, but mostimportantly, she likes to gaze at the moonlight at night. Yeah. And guess what?That owner's shop has a tree that's blocking it! I mean, as much as I would liketo argue about how stupid those tsukumogami are fighting over this princess (Imean, Ohime looks waaay better imo) when they do not know of her trueintentions? Man, these guys are shallow. Way too shallow. As for Tsukuyomi, hegot really smug after everyone discovered his true purpose despite its rarity inits use. He also served his purpose by putting himself in the limelight(literally) by you know, acting as the moon replacement since the only otherthing we couldn't do is to chop the tree down. Haha okay maybe that was somevery important wood so maybe not. All in all, I love how the storytelling is inthis show, and man am I excited for another tale of the mysterious. With thisone I don't even intend to continue with Detective Layton anymore really<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u9jxJj8uCkE/W18SicZoJcI/AAAAAAAAo84/XcwAyI21xy4WDUoKHfvtkxjc0pZq7ehEgCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami02_flirt.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How you think you could woo a woman          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R2aJz5yn0gA/W18Rl8v160I/AAAAAAAAo8s/la2FGIEyYuERFrQbyF6Wpz97VJKGnDP5gCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami02_wink.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            What happens the moment you flash your best image lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.
