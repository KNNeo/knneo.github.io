Hey.<br /><br /><strike>Tomorrow</strike> Today marks a point. Well, it sort of
marks a point considering I'm not in a full-time job yet, so...
<strike>tomorrow</strike>&nbsp;today technically makes me officially
unemploye<br /><br />Okay I stole that from yesterday's post but it isn't wrong.
So yeah, my university study concludes just now when I noticed the reception's
food is the only thing I'll remember besides the people you know of in school.
No really, that's it. Haha come on Anime is waaaay better than studying. Okay I
can't say that now because work WILL be worse than studying.<br /><br />I miss
studying.<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay let's move on.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AsobiAsobase04"> <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span  ><span style="font-size: large;"> Asobi Asobase</span> </div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"> <div style="text-align: center;">  Man, what has Shougi become... *looks at Kiriyama Rei* GOOD REFERENCE haha </div>
</blockquote>
Did I just not get what a Lord of Pastimes is about? Well then again it's not
that so okay she's just a slut haha (I did say I can swear in this segment) The
new episode (#AsobiAsobase04) gives us BUTT PLAY??? YES GUYS WE GOT IT WE
FINALLY GOT IT haha okay chill everyone we've got the front half to talk about
first. Wow... I don't even remember the first part haha. *looks at episode
again* We're introduced to Maeda, who... is a thing in Hanako's home (well let's
assume he's an advisor/butler at this point) and mainly serves as advisory to
the poor kid when she was little. And as a kid, she learnt of the human ass.
<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, I can't even keep this clean. (I'm referring to the butt) Okay, to
sum it up, Hanako learned the wrong things and now it has passed on to the other
two. We then later in the episode found out that it's actually a thing?? Please,
PLEASE make me stay far away from this alien inbreed of a disaster lol. Next,
the teacher's life. Not really because her friends aren't that crazy, but
talking about the Lord... apparently her friend just sent a bitch to their club
lmao. Okay, you can watch it yourself I'm spoiling it after the thumbnails haha.
(Seriously though this is some different level of real-juu) (&lt;= refers to
women who's only purpose in life is to get laid no really Wikipedia said it)
Then, there's sumo. No really, if Olivia's description of paradise which is
practically muff and actually exists, I'll make sure to make that my new fetish
lol. Thankfully, there are easier ways to learn sumo without actually having to
strap a loincloth and be fat haha. Problem again is, once the rules are
explained, they just skipped all the levels and go to the professional league
almost immediately. I mean, it's not the first time. Lastly, if this part deters
you from watching this show again, I can't blame you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yep, they are
talking about rated 2D content, also known, as hentai. I mean, they didn't
explicitly say it until that Maeda jerk came in with this laser (lol), but yeah,
Kasumi is into BL. There. Now that you got it, go watch the show to... see it
for yourself? Oh well, this show is weird anyway I didn't expect to see this
though BRING IN THE ANIME'S DOUJINSHI QUICK I NEED TO READ IT lol no seriously
Hanako you got to spoil the ******* somehow haha (no I cannot anymore this place
it going to get flagged)<br />

P.S. I like how most if not all Anime can only dig on the subject on marriage on
those middle-aged women who are working *looks at Yokoshima Naruko* man they
just gotta<br />P.P.S. "Was there a Batman villain who looks like that?" LMAO
best joke of the episode haha (I have a feeling I'm not understanding a lot of
references in this show though if anyone is kind enough to point them out
that'll be great)<br />[GIFS FOR FUN!!! I mean, I gotta relate to the theme of
the show for the title]<br />

</blockquote>
EREN WILL GET EATEN??? WHAT??? Oops spoiler warning too late it seems, but man
this new episode (#AttackOnTitan39) is too good I can't stop spoiling it so
sorry if you're here first (which I doubt you should be) before watching the
show because that's going to be your downfall. Nope, I'm not shooting you to
advance my motives because I don't have any. The other people in this episode
though, that's a different story. Kenny was hating of the Military Police, but
now has more power than required to get rid of Levi's squad. As mentor and
senior with a different objective than Levi himself, this will of course come to
conflict sooner or later. And hell they did. After quite a struggle
unfortunately Eren and Historia got taken away, and we're on our journey to the
truth. Hopefully. What I can deduce even halfway through the episode is still
correct even till the end: the royalty is to be replaced. Sadly, this might not
even happen. Get it? I have a good hunch (and hopefully I'm right) that the
current King is not a direct heir (you know, marriages) and that a direct heir
has been traced. You know, and then there's all the killing thing to make sure
the succession will never come to fruition... typical change of power thing
happening in the kingdom. Problem is, this might just be a Trost district
problem. Mainly because Historia is in the district, but more importantly it's
the only place probably still unknown to the existence of... I would like to say
human-controlled Titans. And we know they exist. Titans with a mind of their
own. More questions still are waiting to be answered though, so I'll not guess
too much at this point. I mean, if you know I'm wrong then shut up or I'll tie
you up on a chair and pluck your nails off one by one haha jkjk I won't do that
I'l just slit your throat because there are cowboys in the medieval times
apparently lol (pussy talk shortly after this thumbnail below)<br />

P.S. "Why was it me who shot first?" "Because the other person hesitated." BOOM
LEVI YOU GOT JEAN REAL GOOD THERE haha no really Armin because Jean is a puss.
And you're female, right? Yeah. Jean's a <i>real </i>fucking pussy haha<br />P.P.S.
Wow that the latest in Anime Betrayals right there, confessing to torture once
compared to your superior who will never budge. Good job, boy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br />

<blockquote class="tr_bq"> <div style="text-align: center;">  Haha that Tsukuyomi is literally me after getting insulted I just hide in a  corner lol </div>
</blockquote>
No seriously, they're going to make you watch that little intro every week until
it ends, I swear. Also, what is new in this episode (#Tsukumogami02) of
<strike>God-forsaken items</strike> okay I'm just joking those "gods" are cute
btw. This week we talk about Tsukuyomi, originally an art scroll meant for the
most grand of celebrations and celebrations. You thought you looked good in the
mirror? Ask this guy. Unfortunately, some of his friends kind of took it too far
to look at the mirror too often. Well in this case change its image every other
night. Even a human would freak out lol. And this time, it's no marriage stuff
anymore we got over that haha, but it's a matter of fighting over a woman? Wait,
we're not done yet? Okay. Story goes that an ancient paintings collector has its
paintings in weird arrangements (it's contents, to be specific), like historical
characters in normal aesthetic paintings, if you don't want to know references
like I do. But I do know of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter" target="_blank" >Kaguyahime</a
>
(I was close to watching a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Princess_Kaguya" target="_blank" >Studio Ghibli movie</a
>
about it too hmm maybe I should do it) and her story of bamboos, but most
importantly, she likes to gaze at the moonlight at night. Yeah. And guess what?
That owner's shop has a tree that's blocking it! I mean, as much as I would like
to argue about how stupid those tsukumogami are fighting over this princess (I
mean, Ohime looks waaay better imo) when they do not know of her true
intentions? Man, these guys are shallow. Way too shallow. As for Tsukuyomi, he
got really smug after everyone discovered his true purpose despite its rarity in
its use. He also served his purpose by putting himself in the limelight
(literally) by you know, acting as the moon replacement since the only other
thing we couldn't do is to chop the tree down. Haha okay maybe that was some
very important wood so maybe not. All in all, I love how the storytelling is in
this show, and man am I excited for another tale of the mysterious. With this
one I don't even intend to continue with Detective Layton anymore really<br />

P.S. "That one guy from last week referred me to you" WELL THAT FIGURES haha
SERIOUSLY MAN WE DON'T RUN A DETECTIVE AGENCY HERE *looks at tsukumogamis*<br />P.P.S.
"This time we'll all be lent to the guy" Yes I agree so we can ALL get into the
gossip haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm done. Time to send resumes
tomorrow now that I have my new profile picture done today hehe I gotta take the
occasion to do it there's that photo-taking machine in school anyways. With now
I'm going to look professional. As a poor, job-seeking individual.
#ThisYearResolutions now include getting myself a job, hopefully with some
training because I suck haha cya guys on Sunday
