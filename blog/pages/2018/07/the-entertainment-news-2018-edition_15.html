Wow I'm just lazy now. Hey, did you read this on Monday? I'm sorry~<br /><br />Yeah
yeah I'm definitely in a very lost position in life now, as I try to dedicate
myself to a full-time duty I don't even want to do in the first place haha. Is
that how you describe job-searching? Good. Read the fun stuff below instead. My
life is... as silent as I want to make it right now. And my dad is retiring at
home with me. These are going to be some rough months ahead lol<br /><br />Also,
bad idea to be watching one Anime on Monday and the rest today. But hey, this
issue don't wait for Mondays. Then again, maybe it should? I'll see if I have to
adjust this post release schedule at any point. I'll let you guys have a
heads-up when I do.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Man, don't you love idiots without a chest for you to slap on so you can openly
slap her face?? Seriously, what's wrong with this show? If you thought this was
a Pop Team Epic ripoff I would not be surprised. The opening theme turned out to
be quieter than any ending theme I've heard in years, and... everyone has a
problem in this show apparently. Okay, about the show. You wished this show will
take itself more seriously, but considering how random and crazy this show takes
comedy compared to the ones we saw last week, I'm going to have a hard time
giving this one, to say the least. The story from the first episode
(#AsobiAsobase01) follows three girls and we'll start with Ksaumi, who hates to
play mini-games because she keeps losing to her elder sister and at some point
it became a way to be told to do stuff instead. However, classmate Hanako and
transfer student Olivia are playing games that much it's pissing her off, and
that's where the hilarity ensues. Considering I've only seen the video preview
before this, I must say I am kind of impressed on the presentation of this
Anime. Again, I don't want to (<u
  >I promise this will be THE ONLY SEGMENT I will use swear words</u
>&nbsp;if I continue because if I don't I'll have to fuck Kasumi's titties
haha)&nbsp;bitch on how long this is compared to Fumikiri Jikan (which is way
better imo), but hey, this eventually became just a Club for the girls to play
around as much as they want. And I mean that even in financial budget terms
because Hanako is a rich kid lol. Take her stupidity in trying to get laid but
duped by a locally-raised foreigner while working with the class English loan
shark, you've got quite a weird show going on here. But as Olivia mentioned, she
kind of enjoyed these games, and she kind of wet herself saying so (insert
random sketchy face here) so I guess we're fine. For now. You think the truth
will be out someday and they'll have to close the club because no one gets laid
and they will beat each other up? Your guess is as good as mine. For now, the
dangerous teetering of the relationships within the trio is sure to bring about
more plot developments considering hopefully they can't stop talking about each
other's chests haha just joking I checked it they don't do hentai here THANK GOD
BABY *licks water puddle on floor* Yeah and try saying those capitalised words
in Olivia's seriously American-accented English lmao it's PISSING ME OFF haha<br />

P.S. That's your latest Detective Conan reference right there, ladies and
gentlemen. *cues theme music* "Shinjitsu wa tada hitotsu" lol<br />P.P.S. Okay,
less crazy opinion and more honest perspective on this show. Because it reminds
me of stupid shows like Pop Team Epic which I don't want to watch, this one in
contrast has a theme, which is playing games. So yeah, it is still watchable,
even if it is just finger wars and poking between fingers and that kid pool at
this point lol, but yeah, I kind of like how this has a theme so I won't go kill
myself after hearing the punk rock for an ending theme because seriously WHO
WROTE THIS SONG haha also I'll think about whether I should give the animation
it's real sketchy imo okay maybe besides the boob shot<br /><br />

The second episode (#BANANAFISH02) obviously didn't give us further info on what
the title of this story means, but hey, there's fast-paced development. That's
what I'm going to appreciate for the rest of the series, if I were to continue.
As of now... I'm not sure. Since the capture of Eiji and Skipper from the
previous episode, Ash has entered the fray by stepping into his surbodinate
Arthur and Marvin's trap. With only the Japanese cameraman assistant or whatever
boy escaping from this fiasco, it would seem that the purpose was mainly for the
guys to ask about that one bottle that was stolen from Dino likely, passed on to
Ash, and he took it to his underground doctor for analysis. Apparently, the only
pure sample. So yeah, we don't know what it is yet, but it's definitely
significant now that the whole justice estate has to be involved now. As you can
see, Dino isn't really a kind stepfather. Since Ash is in it up to his neck it's
no wonder why he wants his stepson to... step out of the way sooner. Although he
still has no idea where that bottle went, he still got to like, beat the shit
out of him to say the least? Well that's till next episode. But until then,
can't help but wonder about the... rated content present in this series. I mean,
not that I'm cowering on seeing kid's pornography, but hey, I'm not
<i>that </i>sick. Haha don't worry guys if you haven't seen it yet (the Anime or
the real thing) neither have I. I mean, they censored it so you guys can still
watch this late night show. But seriously man, practice safe sex. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />

P.S. I'm still praising animation studio MAPPA for making this show look so
pretty considering this is a rather late adaptation of the original manga from
20 years ago. The theme songs though... I'll think about it when I give this
show. The opening sounds dope though<br /><br />

Uh... why? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, if you don't know what I'm laughing at it's
perfectly fine but if you did read the one above while thinking about LGBT then
maybe, maybe you'll know. The new episode (#ChioChan02) really, really just...
just... Hey I wish I don't have to give a review I can't stop laughing to but I
have to so let's. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (&lt;= You're going to see this a lot) The first part
introduces us to (I suppose we'll see him more often) (as a weakling lol) the
one guy who didn't zip his pants in the opening theme which we don't know of his
name, got trashed hard by the main girl in the weirdest cutscene ever. You would
think this is some seiyuu hierachy episode or something lol but it isn't I
think. The other half is more interesting as it finally introduces us to the
third and last main girl Manana (yes it's spelled like a fruit) who is
considered to be Chio-chan's only friend. Well, not until she finds out about
her BFF being friends with the popular Hosokawa and... well it's a sh*t show
over here so I'll not spoil too much so you can laugh more haha. Suffice it to
say that Hosokawa is a good friend (I mean, we all want to be friends with her)
(don't ask about the stripping in the opening theme I have no idea wtf that is
yet), she likes running with strangers in the evening, and likes to be honest.
So yeah, being deceived by the likes of Manana's stories and that president is
perfectly normal. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, wonderful episode especially the rapport
between the two idiots lol but I'm just wondering when the animation quality is
catching up I thought I have a problem with my ears (no girls you all are fine
it's just me) but I think it's affecting my eyes too lol<br />

Really, they are trying to sell you on this game by making sure its target
audience is into cute stuff. Like kids, for example. I mean, they gotta avoid
the pain by averting your attention somehow haha. So is in this new episode
(#HatarakuSaibou02) of the human body features the only part of the body you
wish there was a livestream of so you can watch kids wash... whatever that thing
is all day haha. Looking at the credits, I'm still impressed at the huge number
of voice actors used for each episode of the Anime. (Skip this part if you
aren't interested but I'm surprised that names like Nakahara Mai - who voices
the boss bacteria this episode and also in my impression, from Servant x Service
- and Iwami Manaka - who voices one of the half a dozen voices on the platelets,
I assume the leader; outside this show of course, the starring girl of one of
the last season love stories - are in this episode for some reason) (You'll have
to trust me on this because I can't find evidence for this and I can read
Japanese on the episode itself) Okay, the episode. We talk about an "abrasion",
and if you're still unaware of what that is, it's a scratch that can happen in
which blood comes out. Technically it symbolises a hole in the edge of the inner
body (well it's more than that if you dive deeper) (get it?) and guess who's on
edge now? (pun not intended) The lost-as-usual Red Blood Cell got dragged into
(pun intended) the hole that was made in the world (just like how blood gushes
out of your wound) but was saved by... you guessed it. However, the problem was
to deal with the bacteria which can invade the body for the time being until...
I mean, if you don't know any of what I am talking about go bump your elbow
towards a wall or something. The platelets (those cute little kids) will
eventually appear with the protein enough to bind the edge of your skin properly
but until then, it's going to be a mini war between any bacteria and the white
blood cells. I know this feels like a kids' show but seeing the amount of blood
(what do you call the blood that comes out of white blood cells again?) (and the
bacteria too?) or gore that is happening each episode I wouldn't consider this
kid-friendly. And yeah, I think the technical terms are getting into me as
pretty much every new one they have to introduce them one by one. The bad guys
in this show is just the need-more-technical-introductions, waaaay less cool and
super-duper weak versions of those in action Anime lmao. Don't ask me about the
ending, because I don't know why there's so much emotional attachment between
blood cells. Next time you have a heart attack (or a boner) you can thank these
two lol. I had a great laugh so far though besides the technical explanations
(the subtitles made it worse tbh) so I'll give it another episode. But going at
this rate this body better go get a full body checkup it's like half dead
already by now lol. Oh, the end of the series is going to be where the body has
to do kidney dialysis and the red blood cells will have to leave? OH NO lmao<br />

P.S. And then you accidentally fly out of the "abrasion" to find out you got
stuck on to a sealed wall and that's just because a plaster has been applied lol
"hey we cannot take any more risks here"<br />P.P.S. Btw did you guys get the
one word pun said by the White Blood Cell? "It's nothing but a scratch" lol<br /><br /><br />[And
no, no Dropout from last week. And yes, as you can see by the effort I put in, I
definitely like the joke shows this season. Those two will be the likely
candidate to stay if I can't stand biology and hate child sex lol]<br /><br />

Well I thought I would be buying the illustration book of BLEACH for Tite Kubo
but I guess this came out so I don't have to? Haha just joking Kubo-sensei I'm
still thinking about it. But seriously, this. Yeah, if you read it by now,
congratulations. But seriously, there isn't as elaborate of a copy of the Harry
Potter series as this. (Well, Zombie Powder feels like One Piece too so I won't
say much) (It's still better than this though imo) But yeah, it's the
we-use-magic-to-tame-dragons-so-we-maintain-peace-for-the-real-world kind of
thing again. It's not BLEACH definitely, but for something that came out of the
author like, 15 years after his previous work, you gotta think there's some
uniqueness or something. (Someone pointed out the highlighting of characters at
the end of the chapter) I'll keep it short here so you can read the rather
lengthy story yourself. Story goes that the... government? They decided to
protect the dragons from the people since 200 years ago from present because
they can't co-exist but also because the dragons act like reverse Dementors that
in this case, sucking up bad memories in order to become evil and wreck havoc.
(Man, please do that to me, dragons) So yeah, they gotta be "protected". And
protected they are, because non-evil dragons look great. Of course, history does
not allow all of them to be "taken care of", especially where there are those
which can disguise themselves only to be hunted by the "wizards and witches"
which also take care and deal with these dragons. In the world of "Reverse
London" which yes, this story is situated in England, your friends are dragons
in disguise, we don't get to see panties, and the monsters can be exterminated
in an instant by low-ranking witches. Just saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all an
interesting read, but seriously Kubo if you need to copy ideas try something
else I want the Fantastic Beast series to be good lol<br />

And the winner is... nobody. Well, that's 2018 me based on my first impressions.
I swear my like, 2010 self will be more generous to these girls despite the fact
that I'd rather listen to FINLAND (which I will review their new album next week
instead) because I want some Rock music instead of any of these bullsh*t lol.
Okay, serious talk. (I'm trying to be optimistic here so take my words with a
grain of salt) <b>Niitsu Yui's 1st album</b>, as expected, isn't a revolutionary
takeover, and refraining from listening to the preview I know I can only give
those songs which haven't been "greatly improved" by producers which might
influence her previously independent production. But hey, what am I to say?
There is advantage in making music sound better in release anyway. Did you watch
those live performances Yui so much want to perform that is like her previous
album? That'll give you insight. It's even more obvious listening to the album
since I didn't like most of the melodies. <b>Komatsu Mikako's 4th album</b> is
dangerously bad, and yes Q-MHz I think I may have reached my limit. So yeah, I
only took a couple of songs which barely passed by expectations in protest of
how terrible this is- Did you guys even hear her previous album where were those
songs?? Okay. <b>Amamiya Sora's 2nd album</b> is better than the others
mentioned above to say the least, but nonetheless it has been bombarded with a
bunch of new songs which just try to be Anime. Man, if Kawada Mami doesn't miss
these types of music production, I don't. So yeah, I gave those that aren't.
What a surprise. I tried to give the others, I promise. I tried. Lastly,
<b>miwa's best album</b> might get me interested in yet another old song, which
hopefully will turn into another review for the year because I've not been
getting them- Oh wait did I not review Ajikan yet? Oops.<br /><br />I'll review
<b>FINLAND's latest album</b> next week because I've given a listen to them from
some weeks ago where I searched for new songs to listen, and they turned out
waaaay better than that Rabbit band lol.
<b>Natsukawa Shiina's 3rd single</b> will also (hopefully) appear next week, but
judging from what I've heard so far I may just reject her single because she
sings EDM. Because she likes it. Not that I don't, but you gotta give a
convincing melody to make me put it on the list. And that, I'm having my fingers
crossed.<br /><br />In other news, the guys uploaded
<b>Komatsu Mikako's music collection</b> (short of the new album) on Apple Music
Japan so thanks TOY'S FACTORY,
<b>Roys apparently released their first formal release</b> in May so I decided
to give them now, <b>ClariS new single</b> for Anime "Hataraku Saibou" (I'm
still holding back for now) releases 15th August AND... by the time you read
this hopefully I'll confirm the list of
<b>new music videos which will be added to my YouTube playlist</b>. Have a
listen to them if you can't afford to pay for music, yes? (No really, most
people just don't, unlike me)<br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />Hey, it's the ending already. I would like to proclaim
that it's been two years since I embarked on the journey (which has indirectly
influenced my life negatively which is) of mobile games which changed my life
entirely. And the best way to repay these girls is to give them money. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
No joke; I did this last year. Maybe I'll spend it on DOAXX instead of
Alternative Girls instead their new theme song isn't good haha<br /><br />I'll
see about it I got some Google Play credits from those surveys I took hehe
