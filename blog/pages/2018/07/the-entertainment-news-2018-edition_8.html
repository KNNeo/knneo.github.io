This week I'll be talking about the new Anime which areaired this week for the new season, so be sure to check those out. Otherwise...if you're here to know about my life I seriously don't think my boring life willinterest you that much. Army life is boring anyway so no thanks haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote>Celebrating the 20th anniversary of the original work back in 1998, Banana Fishtells about a... mysterious code which arose in war times and is apparentlyuncontrollably taking peoples' lives. I'll give a bit more context before we getinto the episode itself because there is quite some stuff we can talk abouthere. Origin for this show's hype (well, hyped at least from after I've watchedthis) came from dear Komatsu Mikako because she knows of the original manga.More on that later but she seems hyped, and... for me personally I see the storyhas potential and I'm watching this because I want to see for myself less of theplot because I did get to read a chapter of the manga beforehand but more ofproduction, because as rough as the context can be on like, historicalgang-filled America where they use English on a Japanese show, this one was realimpressive. The first episode (#BANANAFISH01) talks about a little on the originstory, where Ash and his buddies were resting in wartimes and are attacked bytheir comrade, blurting out the code "BANANA FISH" between his teeth. Yearslater after war ended, this has since appeared multiple times as Ash rises up asa local gang leader, seeing people die while uttering the code too.Investigations on this aren't active at this point as he still has to deal withhis everyday problems with his stepdad Dino, his subordinates who might notlisten to him, and... a photographer duo from Japan? Yeah, well this is Ash'sway of keeping his distance with the police, so it makes sense for that 17 yearold kid Eiji to exist in this show to say the least. The general story forcontext now is where (though not explicitly stated in the Anime itself) Ashmanages to steal a necklace with a bottle full of powder from his father, whichof course is so important the dad wants to beat the shit out of him to ask whereit went, tasked this to Marvin the surbordinate which then associated himselfwith Arthur to take the boy down. Hey, all in the day's work in a gang fromAmerica haha. All in all, the show does give promise in terms of production,from cast (all sound the same and no girls so...) to animation (the cameraangles and detail in drawing is really good) and everything in between despitethe slight lack of music at the right times, this proves to be the biggestcomeback for an anniversary remake of the story yet. I might just hang out (punnot intended) for a couple of rounds (pun not intended) to see if I can like it,but for now I'll hold back. The story has got me hooked though to say the least,so I'll see what happens.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UXpPTumzdWQ/W0HeSpLo9DI/AAAAAAAAoQI/ViMDqhe3s-cYOCQ-2rIrcAN1O2Gwz57GQCLcBGAs/s1600/bananafish1_powder.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I appreciate the detail and smoothness in animation, MAPPA.      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. In case you wonder, I read the first chapter of the manga only, whichvaguely translates to be only remembering the plot from the start to probablyabout where Arthur and Marvin are meeting up in the bar against Ash. Inperspective that's about half this episode only. I know no more.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ChioChan01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Once again, WHY DOES THIS GET FULL EPISODES BUT FUMIKIRI JIKAN GETS THREE    MINUTES??? WHAT THE F-  </div></blockquote>Somehow it's some f**ked up like if your neighbourhood is stopping you in everyway possible to let you go your usual route to school, but yeah, I'll blame thegirl too lol. The first episode (#ChioChan01) of this Nichijou-level comedyseries surrounds you with just one objective: going to school. Hey, simplepremise for a story, right? Must be boring, right? YOU ARE DAMN WRONG. Withmysteries on how she got herself into any predicament and solutions which willblow your mind, there is entertainment at every corner (pun intended) onChio-chan's road to school. I mean, what else can go wrong, right? The episodeshows us two examples in which I'll not extrapolate to explain everything, butI'll talk in general on what happened instead. (The details in this show are toomuch so I'll leave the spoilers for you guys to watch) Firstly, roadconstruction. Well, assuming you left the house on time to give some leeway sothat things happen you can go to school on time (Wait, you guys don't dothat???), you should have time to take the detour as needed to go to school.That is, if you're not Chio-chan. Here's where the assumptions get thrown intothe dustbin (more on that later), but suffice it to say she overslept (she's agamer btw) and dozed off while wearing her shoes at the front porch (lol),and... now she gotta find a way to compensate for that time. So yeah, what wouldyou do? I mean, we would likely run through the detour at this point, but no,it's Chio-chan we're talking about here. In the most ingenious way possible, shethinks that climbing up the nearly telephone pole to the roof is the best way toget past... everything. The roadblock, people (she introvert btw), boob physicslol, problems... everything. And you know, things happened along the way whichyou must check it out yourself, but all in all this is a good introduction tothe person she is. Unfortunately she is probably still shamed from (spoileralert) walking out of a love hotel lol, but yeah, she wasn't late. That, I canfeel you, girl. I'm afraid to be late for school too. Nothing to do withstanding with delinquents, but yeah, the fear. The other half of the episodeintroduces us to the next main character <strike>Hoshikawa</strike> Hosokawa,and in all the impossible story routes possible to be taken, she waves hello tothe main girl. Yeah, she. The one famous girl in class. I mean, I know it's fordramatic effect, but sure, Chio-chan gets a new friend. From here we can see herawkwardness sprouting from her introverted personality from playing assassinvideo games all day (you wished the Creed was this cool lol), and how she triesto avoid awkward conversations and escapes human contact even if peoplegenuinely want to go to school with her. I mean, all you have to do (if you'renormal like the rest of us) is to have manners and formality. Start with "Whydid you call out to me?" (it may be because of the love hotel image butwhatever) would be the easiest I can think of, but hey not to worry, this is notTakagi-san so I won't be doing advisories here. Or maybe I should. I'll thinkabout it. This show is too god to not comment. Production wise, the openingtheme blew my mind as much as the rest of the episode did (thanks for the safeRock music tunes Kadokawa), once again Oozora Naomi who voiced<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/149765/Chio_Miyamo" target="_blank"  >Chio-chan</a>did wonderful in almost every scenario I can think of (I laughed the hardest ather voicing where the old man is brushing his teeth lmao), and the only downsideI can think of besides hearing lengthy backstories is the animation is not doingenough justice for the acting. I know about the sweat and garbage stuff flyingin slow motion (lol), but I'm talking about the rest. The normal stuff, whichcan be improved. But that can be forgiven, for this is going to be the best showI'm into this season. See how long I've written this already? You know it'sgoing to be good. If you like ridiculous stories coupled with some level ofcomedy and entertainment, this is the show. Naomi-chan, you're going to befamous this year, I swear. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CkNoE5NHPxw/W0GJsmvjAZI/AAAAAAAAoPg/-7jaYgvWSvY_Amt-AB2BQcS3iHgL8rjwACLcBGAs/s320/chiochan01_photoshop.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            NAILED IT haha what COULD have happened <i>thanks sensei</i>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XnOvHtlc1Sc/W0GIwc-HxMI/AAAAAAAAoPY/pzeE4uCy9T4HbNWZgp7xy4AUFSoxf1Q3wCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan01_preconstruct.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Reminds me of a certain            <a              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=918Wj9kx0Zo"              target="_blank"              >preconstruct mechanism</a            >            in "Detroit: Become Human" lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. I like how they stop immediately when people saw the love hotel image ontheir phones because you know, just get the front part where Chio-chan thinksshe's climbing down but photoshop this one in and that's it haha the productionteam is just lazy<br />P.P.S. Once again because I know I'll be scolded bymentioning it too much, but<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/22329/Naomi_Oozora" target="_blank"  >Oozora Naomi-chan</a>acting as a Tokyo-accented character is as rare as it is impressive.

Let's talk about the series in itself. As expectedthe story is really technical terms heavy, but thank goodness to theirsimplifications (ie. "in other words") I might not hate this show. This Animetalks about the biggest thing that will make my goosebumps come back every timeI watch this: the human body. Sorry for being such a hater for human biology butyes, I hate it. Not at least after I've watched this show, because to be honest,I enjoyed it. The first episode (#HatarakuSaibou01) gives some light content bybringing an introduction to many things happening inside the human body, asdetailed as they can make it without boring us to death, literally. We startwith a new(?) or more likely lost red blood cell (voiced by the lovely HanazawaKana-chan) delivering stuff to various parts of the human body. And by the wayif you catch no ball (or blood cell) in any of what I'm saying please go back tolike, elementary school science, thanks. A recent germ infection caught on thebody, and considering the body itself is probably lacking in white blood cellswho are the immunity of your body system, they had to call in special forces.Thankfully through the brains(?) of the cells they work together to eliminatethe last of those screwed up things in their world. So yeah, biology as younerds like it. Happy? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Production wise thanks Aniplex for making theshow awesome overall, the theme songs aren't as deterring as I thought (thanksto ClariS for the ending theme btw), and... I had a good laugh. Since I enjoyedthe show, I may just stay to watch a couple of episodes considering this feelsmore like an educational show than a comedy one, but I beg to differ. They aretrying to make this fun for everyone to watch, and I appreciate the effort.Other than that, there's cute stuff once in a while lol, and you already knowI'll be giving this show chance the moment you put the most popular female voiceactress in as the main girl haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UfnlnC8m91I/W0GTjIMfsII/AAAAAAAAoP8/xFTaoYQz9qMioYSIAJ_mC0vzP0rK9wApgCLcBGAs/s320/hatarakusaibou01_shock.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        When you got found out by your parents for doing something private        lol<br />(That's the germ btw)      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S.

Haha besides summarising the chapter, it wouldseem that past events do have their consequences, as Ikuto talks about how hissister is constantly clinging onto animals in the island because they are toocute (they are btw) and hugging them with overflowing affection (hey can I getsome love too? lol) and... I think the animals are scared of her now. Even theisland's troublemaker may also hate her too. Maybe. That or it now has a regulartarget to prank on, which will be a good thing since it'll ensure the safety ofthe village as it's being distracted by the half-youkai who can lock on to hispresence despite all its disguises. That seaweed though...

Reason is mainly because they, unlike many new artists like them, arenot using studio production to their advantage by making it sound a littledifferent thus a little more attractive to the listener. THE ORAL CIGARETTES isa good example of such a thing, and (the last of) Chatmonchy is a negativeexample. <b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's new mini-album</b> on the other hand isnot a disappointment as I quickly found myself immersed in the English songs oreven Japanese songs with simpler melodies (I mean, they gotta avoid that simplemelody copyright) and at this point I think I made my point on Twitter how goodit is with enough attention from their band members. I think I'm happy withthat. The new songs, not the social media attention haha. I mean, if you want tofollow them, retweet<a  href="https://twitter.com/SIMAC_Official/status/1014433676636053504"  target="_blank"  >this tweet</a>and change your Twitter avatar to their album cover for another week you mightget a free T-shirt so don't say I didn't inform you about that you got until the15th haha. But seriously man give them a listen. For me it's just a break fromlistening to those... J-Pop songs that makes me want to throw up lol<br /><br />Nextweek brings us a whole set of releases which if I remember makes me a genius.*refers to Excel document* <b>miwa's best album</b> after 8 years of releaseswill be pitting against <b>Komatsu Mikako's new album</b>&nbsp;(which isn'tgreat as of now), <b>Niitsu Yui's comeback album</b>&nbsp;(good impression as ofnow) and <b>Amamiya Sora's 2nd full album</b>&nbsp;(I mean, I showed up for herniconico live lol). Man, this is going to be a good fight. Certainly tiring forme but hey, I used to enjoy listening to hundreds of songs every week. Nowadaysit's like a chore somehow. I gotta gear myself back to listening to songsinstead of listening to YouTube videos. (Yes, not watching, listening. Like whatI'm doing right now as I type this)<br /><br />On music news,<b>ClariS new single</b> (before I actually watched the Anime to know of it)will be released next month as ending theme songs for Anime "Hataraku Saibou",the best Anime theme song of the year (I called it here) has its<a  href="https://twitter.com/Masayoshi_Oishi/status/1015580113071583238"  target="_blank"  >full music video</a>on YouTube now (thanks <b>Ooishi Masayoshi</b> for your free music),<b>Aimer's new single</b> will be released in September and initial previews aregood, I'm definitely giving<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5fgZrmGzak" target="_blank"  ><b>Uesaka Sumire</b>'s new topic song</a>a miss (it's mostly because of the incompatible singing voice imo), and I wishedI can listen to <b>Porno Graffitti's new singles</b>.
