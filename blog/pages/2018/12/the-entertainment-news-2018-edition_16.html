Hey.<br /><br />I can't believe my whatever sinus infection is not over yet.
Coughing on Thursday night, I had to see doctor on my work leave day, and had to
say no to that Malaysia outing with my colleagues because with the way they work
I'll be more sick by the time I come back home now. I haven't packed because I
knew this will happen though haha<br /><br />It wasn't that fun at home though.
I didn't manage to do anything in faith of sleeping will help improve my
condition but seeing as I am *cough* now I don't think I've recovered. Hey, 1x
useless body right here, if anyone wants it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> No wonder I wasn't getting
laid the girls knew just by seeing my fugly face lol<br /><br />Let's move on to
less sad things, shall we? The only things that are making me happy this week
are getting sad too. Can I just have a solo crying session now? It's been some
time since I did that lol okay moving on~<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

In the still pretty sad new episode (#BANANAFISH23) of this series, we now know
what this series is all about, and it's not underworld action, fight scenes, or
conspiracy and lies. It's about love, and not specifically gay love, okay? (lol)
As mentioned by Blanca most clearly in this episode many times to Ash and even
to Lee, it takes a lot to love. And to lose that will make one go crazy. To lose
that will make one lose meaning in life. (I mean, I've never been loved so that
makes me one of them lol) To lose that will make one choose other insane options
instead of protecting others. In this episode, Ash was stopped by Blanca so that
he can help protect Eiji from... probably the most wanted criminal in the state
right now. And Ash? He's taking it in maybe. It was of good reason that Blanca
did that for him even just as a trainer, but hey, it's also of concern. For
Blanca, it would seem like his state of professionalism is over. He'd rather
take emotions into his own hands, and help protect Ash by saving Eiji, which I
might say is a real noble act even after hearing of his story. Lee's wasn't much
to pity though, as his one was just quite brutal, even though his standpoint is
what we have been thus far until Blanca decided to change sides, which is to
whoever can't feel love then should make others also feel the same. That need
not be so, as Blanca has exhibited this much in the episode to (1) join Ash and
his actions to stop the Banana Fish plan/save the people in the building, (2) to
give him one last chance to see Eiji who is in hospital now and is often visited
by the cops, and (3) to disobey all his own actions as a professional, meaning
he has to go against Lee and Golzine now. On Golzine's side though, things have
started to take a turn. We see in the last part where Foxx decided to take
things into his own hands, and being the most underhand of them all, he will no
doubt heartlessly drug as many people as possible in the Mental Health Institute
(which mostly are the gang members from Ash who were captured, mind you) (and
Max) and even kill the proprietor in order to advance on his selfish plans,
whatever that may be. What his plans are though... well I guess he's a military
guy, and he's internationally well-known, so... maybe he wants the fame to
himself too? If the story goes in this direction, I wonder if Ash will make the
ethical choice again (as he did to Shorter) and end the lives of the people in
the building himself. #RIPGolzine anyways it was a good run old man haha hey at
least you get to f**k all the little boys you want in Heaven lol<br />

*looks at flashback intro* Tsubame must be nosebleeding right now looking at
this <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, the new episode (#UzaMaid11) really brings us a lot of
fourth wall references like the fake end and how no one mentions Midorin's age
but since it's shown on screen the girls know lol. Okay production jokes aside,
it's interesting to see how our very query about Misha's place is going to be
unveiled to us in the next episode in the most cliffhanger way possible: making
the maid mistakenly step into forbidden territory. Hey, the Anime adaptation got
to end somewhere haha. Okay, setup first. In a nutshell, Misha invited
Washiwashi to a stayover, and heck even Morikawa-san knew about it. I know
Tsubame will know about this we're not concealing the plan from her unlike the
last time lol. So yeah, in an effort to live life with a bunch of friends, Misha
ended up having two friends up at her place. It was great and all, and the usual
antics from that irritating maid kind of throw Midorin and me off lol, but yeah,
it was all in an effort to reach the plot twist. So yeah, if you watched the
episode already then I can say it here anyways, which is actually the two guests
being afraid of the dark - Washiwashi and Morikawa - that accidentally led them
to the mother's study room (hey, it's "accidentally", Misha-chan) (also,
should've got the door locked) with them stepping on dust all over the room and
knocking the bear on the chair over. No really, it's not Halloween yet, the
girls are just freaking out for whatever reason. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Stupid things aside,
the reality came in when Misha noticed someone entered the room without her
permission, and in an effort to not let Misha lose her friends, Tsubame noticed
the situation and immediately admitted it was her. Why though? If it was the
classmates' fault (actually both are in the wrong) then why push the
responsibility to herself? On the other hand, it's logical for any of us
watching this episode to think the production was forced to weave a convincing
story so they can make Tsubame the scapegoat, but even if this is not the real
story then what can Misha do about it? Kill the people who did it? So what? What
if Tsubame loses her job? That's it? Isn't it more troublesome to find a more
dedicated maid who can take care of the house? To be honest, there are many ways
to hide the truth behind your past while still letting people dig- well, clean
up the place a bit. Not referring the dust to ashes on this one because I'm not
that cruel to shit on people's past, but suffice it to say I'd like Misha to
wake up her own mind when we reach possibly the last episode next week. Heck,
it's childish to think like this, Misha. There, I said it. Happy now? *looks at
Midorin* Okay, could you just stop getting high over there please? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We
shall see how this lesson will be taught considering no one around her is
technically close to her. Anime, prove me wrong.<br />

  "It's when the healing stops working that it's time to move on, I guess" Wow
  I'll take that advice in well, paper bag head. The new episode (#HondaSan11)
  is all about extremities, because the production thought you didn't get enough
  mood swings watching this series because you're likely just laughing all the
  time lol. Okay, mood swing number 1: fear. Hey, who knew that after 10
  episodes of those snippets dealing with bad customers we can still get more,
  and heck they just changed the setting to like hell? Lol seriously, but yeah
  it's when times get tough is when... you call the department head haha. Hey,
  you gotta. We don't get paid this high to deal with that one freak who can't
  handle
  <i>only </i>getting one book which is selling like hotcakes. But hey, it was
  fun to watch, to say the least. Man, that namecard is real solid where can I
  get the printing on that for mine? Oh, only in hell? No thanks. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Mood
  swing number 2: happiness. The reverse, actually. When you actually know of a
  good customer, asks when necessary, and still thank you for helping out. Hey,
  did you even know that work is all about helping out? If you are not helping
  out on anything but just furiously getting stuffed with money, you're not
  going to be happy working. And as paperbag head said, you're better off
  quitting. Which may be never. Hey, when one's passion for a job is strong, it
  takes a lot to change one's mind. Still, if you need me to live a sh*t work
  life, I'll leave I tell you. Not for now though, I've got much to learn as
  much as... not leaking anything here, my company's product isn't great. Oh no
  don't kill me please I could use two hands to <strike>mastur-</strike> do
  programming haha looks like we're ending this series with Christmas it seems
  hehe took a look at the official website to see if this is the last thankfully
  not<br />

Anime theme song feel they did last season? Nice try, guys. But I've heard of
your style 3 months ago so this is not surprising or fascinating already to be
honest. Also, not to forget that

after quite a release this year and me not giving them, I'll try to give more
this time around. No promises here, guys. Your music isn't as impressive as I
thought you guys are. Hey, impressions are deceiving in Klassic Note. I hope
you'll forgive me. (Audience: Who you're taking to now?) Oh. That, and maybe
I'll listen to the albums mentioned above again, I guess. I want to give chance.
I seriously do.<br /><br />This week was quite a ride on Twitter, with

and other streaming media - (one of) the first artists from Lantis to do so -
which is great to say the least celebrating their 5th anniversary album (Wow,

in March next year following that many digital singles singing for summer and
fall but I only liked the spring one which was in March this year hehe sorry
guys I'm very picky when it comes to songs<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I guess
that's it then. One more week of work after having to face my colleagues for
MIA-ing on that trip (because it's easier to book accomodation in bulk) before I
can get to enjoy my last week of this year at home, probably doing up everything
Klassic Note for KN10YEARS and song awards this year. Heck, I haven't even come
up with a list yet. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Can I just shrink the rankings to 10 songs instead?
Oh hey, maybe I can just give 20 songs this year instead of the 20++ songs every
year lol. We shall see. Or actually, I shall see how. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay *cough* cya
guys tomorrow for Honda-san or else next week then~
