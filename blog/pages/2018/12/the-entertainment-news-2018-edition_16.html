I haven't packed because Iknew this will happen though haha<br /><br />It wasn't that fun at home though.I didn't manage to do anything in faith of sleeping will help improve mycondition but seeing as I am *cough* now I don't think I've recovered. Hey, 1xuseless body right here, if anyone wants it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> No wonder I wasn't gettinglaid the girls knew just by seeing my fugly face lol<br /><br />Let's move on toless sad things, shall we? The only things that are making me happy this weekare getting sad too. Can I just have a solo crying session now? It's been sometime since I did that lol okay moving on~<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH23">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "He doesn't exist for your salvation" wow Blanca got him good there  </div></blockquote>In the still pretty sad new episode (#BANANAFISH23) of this series, we now knowwhat this series is all about, and it's not underworld action, fight scenes, orconspiracy and lies. It's about love, and not specifically gay love, okay? (lol)As mentioned by Blanca most clearly in this episode many times to Ash and evento Lee, it takes a lot to love. And to lose that will make one go crazy. To losethat will make one lose meaning in life. (I mean, I've never been loved so thatmakes me one of them lol) To lose that will make one choose other insane optionsinstead of protecting others. In this episode, Ash was stopped by Blanca so thathe can help protect Eiji from... probably the most wanted criminal in the stateright now. And Ash? He's taking it in maybe. It was of good reason that Blancadid that for him even just as a trainer, but hey, it's also of concern. ForBlanca, it would seem like his state of professionalism is over. He'd rathertake emotions into his own hands, and help protect Ash by saving Eiji, which Imight say is a real noble act even after hearing of his story. Lee's wasn't muchto pity though, as his one was just quite brutal, even though his standpoint iswhat we have been thus far until Blanca decided to change sides, which is towhoever can't feel love then should make others also feel the same. That neednot be so, as Blanca has exhibited this much in the episode to (1) join Ash andhis actions to stop the Banana Fish plan/save the people in the building, (2) togive him one last chance to see Eiji who is in hospital now and is often visitedby the cops, and (3) to disobey all his own actions as a professional, meaninghe has to go against Lee and Golzine now. On Golzine's side though, things havestarted to take a turn. We see in the last part where Foxx decided to takethings into his own hands, and being the most underhand of them all, he will nodoubt heartlessly drug as many people as possible in the Mental Health Institute(which mostly are the gang members from Ash who were captured, mind you) (andMax) and even kill the proprietor in order to advance on his selfish plans,whatever that may be. What his plans are though... well I guess he's a militaryguy, and he's internationally well-known, so... maybe he wants the fame tohimself too? If the story goes in this direction, I wonder if Ash will make theethical choice again (as he did to Shorter) and end the lives of the people inthe building himself. #RIPGolzine anyways it was a good run old man haha hey atleast you get to f**k all the little boys you want in Heaven lol<br /><div class="popup">  <span class="initial"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cwrz0Vg5MrQ/XBZPNnVX4pI/AAAAAAAAses/mbA74HT7T6gbFX1kDC2vzXDkTFPOltV_wCLcBGAs/s320/bananfish23_kneel.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This series in a nutshell          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2pYq5TS3CWw/XBZPNYm2D-I/AAAAAAAAseo/bSnQ9gxcZUIxV1cl9kSST3H1GHGFh2GxACLcBGAs/s320/bananfish23_shock.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            TFW you noticed your gay porno in that private hotel was leaked            online lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ></div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="UzaMaid11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Your existence in the first place brings me embarrassment" Haha Misha got    her good there haha I just LOVE these tsukkomi  </div></blockquote>*looks at flashback intro* Tsubame must be nosebleeding right now looking atthis <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, the new episode (#UzaMaid11) really brings us a lot offourth wall references like the fake end and how no one mentions Midorin's agebut since it's shown on screen the girls know lol. Okay production jokes aside,it's interesting to see how our very query about Misha's place is going to beunveiled to us in the next episode in the most cliffhanger way possible: makingthe maid mistakenly step into forbidden territory. Hey, the Anime adaptation gotto end somewhere haha. Okay, setup first. In a nutshell, Misha invitedWashiwashi to a stayover, and heck even Morikawa-san knew about it. I knowTsubame will know about this we're not concealing the plan from her unlike thelast time lol. So yeah, in an effort to live life with a bunch of friends, Mishaended up having two friends up at her place. It was great and all, and the usualantics from that irritating maid kind of throw Midorin and me off lol, but yeah,it was all in an effort to reach the plot twist. So yeah, if you watched theepisode already then I can say it here anyways, which is actually the two guestsbeing afraid of the dark - Washiwashi and Morikawa - that accidentally led themto the mother's study room (hey, it's "accidentally", Misha-chan) (also,should've got the door locked) with them stepping on dust all over the room andknocking the bear on the chair over. No really, it's not Halloween yet, thegirls are just freaking out for whatever reason. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Stupid things aside,the reality came in when Misha noticed someone entered the room without herpermission, and in an effort to not let Misha lose her friends, Tsubame noticedthe situation and immediately admitted it was her. Why though? If it was theclassmates' fault (actually both are in the wrong) then why push theresponsibility to herself? On the other hand, it's logical for any of uswatching this episode to think the production was forced to weave a convincingstory so they can make Tsubame the scapegoat, but even if this is not the realstory then what can Misha do about it? Kill the people who did it? So what? Whatif Tsubame loses her job? That's it? Isn't it more troublesome to find a morededicated maid who can take care of the house? To be honest, there are many waysto hide the truth behind your past while still letting people dig- well, cleanup the place a bit. Not referring the dust to ashes on this one because I'm notthat cruel to shit on people's past, but suffice it to say I'd like Misha towake up her own mind when we reach possibly the last episode next week. Heck,it's childish to think like this, Misha. There, I said it. Happy now? *looks atMidorin* Okay, could you just stop getting high over there please? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Weshall see how this lesson will be taught considering no one around her istechnically close to her.

The new episode (#HondaSan11)  is all about extremities, because the production thought you didn't get enough  mood swings watching this series because you're likely just laughing all the  time lol. Okay, mood swing number 1: fear. Hey, who knew that after 10  episodes of those snippets dealing with bad customers we can still get more,  and heck they just changed the setting to like hell? Lol seriously, but yeah  it's when times get tough is when... you call the department head haha. Hey,  you gotta. We don't get paid this high to deal with that one freak who can't  handle  <i>only </i>getting one book which is selling like hotcakes. But hey, it was  fun to watch, to say the least. Man, that namecard is real solid where can I  get the printing on that for mine? Oh, only in hell? No thanks. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Mood  swing number 2: happiness. The reverse, actually. When you actually know of a  good customer, asks when necessary, and still thank you for helping out. Hey,  did you even know that work is all about helping out? If you are not helping  out on anything but just furiously getting stuffed with money, you're not  going to be happy working. And as paperbag head said, you're better off  quitting. Which may be never. Hey, when one's passion for a job is strong, it  takes a lot to change one's mind. Still, if you need me to live a sh*t work  life, I'll leave I tell you. Not for now though, I've got much to learn as  much as... not leaking anything here, my company's product isn't great. Oh no  don't kill me please I could use two hands to <strike>mastur-</strike> do  programming haha looks like we're ending this series with Christmas it seems  hehe took a look at the official website to see if this is the last thankfully  not<br />  <div class="popup">    <span class="initial"      ><table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_05nJ3Qp4sI/XBemVUe3SsI/AAAAAAAAsgs/2lCV-ypQM_EAJgB_x02wKkGTV_x4nS8HQCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan11_tears.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">WORK HEAVEN</td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table></span    ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"      ><table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tpmTxTqHRhI/XBemVWV4NuI/AAAAAAAAsgw/teQO9k-yKHwqmQwaHMi2yOKGieasL7WngCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan11_thrust.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              WORK HELL (lol)            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table></span    >  </div>  P.S.
