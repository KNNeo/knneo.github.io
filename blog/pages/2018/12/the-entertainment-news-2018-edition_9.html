Hope that's some inspiration forsomeone to break out of listening to only popular songs and move on to listen towhat you really want, and always have that burning desire and passion to ask formore of your music.<br /><br />Okay, serious talk over let's get to theentertainment this week haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BANANAFISH22">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "You could have anything you want" Yeah, but I have to be a sex toy to an    old man?? No thanks bro haha  </div></blockquote>Little do you know Blanca is the hidden character the director of this Anime hasused to make sure Eiji doesn't die lmao okay serious talk people. The newepisode (#BANANAFISH22) is all about proceedings, and I think we have gottensomewhere, to be honest. Spoilers for later, but let's talk about what happenedearlier. Firstly, remember that one ambush squad that took Ash and his friends?Whoever that person is, Foxx? Anyways, life is cruel in many ways than other,and this guy isn't any better. I would argue that he's on the same level asGolzine, but only on the level of disgust when it comes to threatening people totalk, in this case Ash. Hey, he knows everything, so yeah, sexual violationseems to be a thing for old men. What did I tell you, you little cun- Okay, I'mnot doing it here. So yeah, but he smoked his way out, this young boy (puntotally intended, by the way), and pretty much helped once again by Sing, Cainand Eiji, which Ash rapidly reprimanded on, who is also the one to getconsolation after that... violent session, by the way. That aside, Max is alsocaught by Golzine, and is also tortured by Foxx to reveal whatever he knowsabout the incident. I mean, shouldn't have tipped the old man about his credit,really. Anyways, he gets to stay alive since Ash has blackmail against Golzinewhich hopefully he knows, but we just don't know for how long. Hey, that manwill live he's too small to bother. Talking about small boys lol, everyone isstruggling whether to do anything with the boy, considering he's Ash's biggestweakness right now. Hey, that Lee guy isn't very happy. And Blanca, on the otherhand, is getting worried. Not that I'm clear about why the kid getting killedwill change anything but Ash himself, but hey, that might just be it. So yeah,it may be too late though, as Lee already instructed the rats to find the righttime to take action. So Eiji got shot (notice that it's near the heart not onit) and man did it turn Ash into a maniac. I guess so then, this is literalproof of what happens if you f**k with his boy lol. That's all we get for nowthough as consequence, as we see how Eiji can survive this ordeal this timearound. Remember he isn't as strong as Ash is, so maybe he may not last. Golzineinterested in keeping the boy alive? Better get the best doctors to save himthen. And if he's alive and you get Ash you get another boy to play with lmaoAsh please don't shoot me even when I'm shot dead lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2VEhq-WJcyc/XA0Hz0M5ZmI/AAAAAAAAsSc/AiCXW38UxeIQmI2p9pzvDErLWNQkqXddQCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish22_ash.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The ending was too sad, so here's Ash looking at Foxx.<br />Reminds            you of him looking at Golzine, yes? lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-28CfYdsQ_84/XA0Hzubz7oI/AAAAAAAAsSY/HAynifKUeQkujz5cXEFxLd98SrQQxXB7gCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish22_foxx.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The ending was too sad, so here's Ash looking at Foxx.<br />Reminds            you of him looking at Golzine, yes? lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "We'd just be sucked dry by the Lees and Golzine anyways" Hey, Sing's got apoint there, man. I'm not even joking. The Downtown is f*cked as far as we knowof it.<br />P.P.S. "I just don't get why you hate Okumura Eiji that much" I'mlike "Because I wanna be the b*tch instead and he took it!" lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="UzaMaid10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Let's make this vacation a success, without that woman around" lol you all    have this problem in real life? Haha  </div></blockquote>Uh oh, have I been using the wrong word this whole time? It's not "father", Iguess? Well stepdad is also good, Yasuhiro's a nice guy, Misha. The new episode(#UzaMaid10) gave us a touching ending. And I'll take that for this season ofAnime I'll watch, to be honest. Okay, what happened. Yasuhiro managed to arrangea hot spring trip up in the mountains, and Tsubame wasn't supposed to know aboutthis, so yeah of course Misha is excited to see the<a  href="https://www.google.com/search?q=capybara&amp;oq=capybara&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1263j1j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"  target="_blank"  >capybaras</a>so off they go, as secretly and as quietly as possible so that the maid willnever know of this real family trip. And with this much precaution made, youmust think that something must have screwed up for them to see the maid in thehot spring and yes they did, for Misha still doesn't know of the old womandisguise she has been using to eavesdrop on her conversations recently lol. Thetrip was fun though, as much as it is irritating with the maid there, forstarters. Then, there's the incident. Since Misha doesn't like to listen to hisfather, of should I say, stepfather's words, she went off to the mountains tofind that panda on her own. Yeah, wild panda? Your father should have moreknowledge than you, little kid. Kudos to her for knowing that the so-calledpanda was actually a breed of bears with panda-like skin, so yeah, disaster mustbe coming her way, yes? Not when she got found by the maid though, and her...story sort of scared the mother bear away. I'd like to think it's because shethought that was the mother, but yeah the show determined that it wasdisgusting, and really Tsubame stop talking about marriage already it's realirritating. And also engagement, and stop creating words to use for you two tobe together lol. Jokes aside, this was a good lesson to show the familyrelationship between father and daughter, and it's touching to say the least.Now you'll know Misha, that there is someone who is concerned about you andwants you to be safe. I'd like to say it's the maid but no, it's yourstepfather. So yeah, give Yasuhiro some respect, yes? He deserves a MVP thisepisode, really. I know the capybaras or even the panda would've been a betterMVP, but... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MdY21HPtI5w/XA0QvlZhZuI/AAAAAAAAsSw/x2lTLlgDqh4UTn02a3hKZ3Jln5wjvyzAQCLcBGAs/s320/usasugiru10_blood.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I can guarantee this is MOST DEFINITELY NOT a kids show lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BkHztnOO_y0/XA0Qvkt-u-I/AAAAAAAAsSs/6Um8QqNwFcEkoJJ6qgwQmtfsdmMZ9LAjwCLcBGAs/s320/usasugiru10_morikawa.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            TFW you're mentioned in an episode even though you're not scheduled            to appear again lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

"It's organised in a way      logical to anyone, it's orderly and easy to understand" So that means you      are a retard? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;    </div>  </blockquote>  The new episode (#HondaSan10) of this still really funny series is two  questions people ask themselves in the line of work, whether at a bookstore or  just real life: what makes of a best person for the job, and should we take  the initiative to learn new things? The answer to the first question wasn't  that easy, as Honda-san quickly found out he wasn't that much of a competent  worker in a bookstore. (Maybe that's why he took on the writing business  because remember, that is him when he is working he's writing his story now)  He did find someone else more suitable for the job though, maybe way too  suitable, is Fullface, the only person in the workplace who tidies up things  so well he tidies up other peoples' stuff so that they can find the stuff.  Man, that's already in a new level of tidiness already. Not OCD mind you, this  is just your usual chap who is kind and is real good at organising stuff. As  usual, organising items takes a special kind of skill. And I don't care what  any of those idiots commented about what type of people is best working at a  bookstore if you want to work there go ahead passion will tide you over haha.  In the second half, we're greeted with a flashback story, going back to tell  the story of how Honda-san got his current position as in-charge of the  foreign comics section. It didn't come as interest, no no, but thanks to the  manager I suppose he got a chance to be interested and come close with it, so  yeah, it's a kind of learning and getting used to before you really can do it  as easily as something you're already good at. And it says a lot about working  in general: never be stuck at one single task you're good at and learn to be  diverse so you can help out others when there is a need to. That's... what my  supervisor told me in a meeting today lol. Anyways, good introduction at this  point to all the book publishers lmao, and if you know all of them then don't  read this blog post nerd you're probably hating me right now haha<br />  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DLKoYes2W7M/XA56FX6miGI/AAAAAAAAsW4/97-mhIWZjeA2S0Ms9aC8fbDd8zOLbPxNwCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan10_thinking.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Me when I think about something and I don't speak my mind lmso            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k0ukMVOitCk/XA56Fh-sPYI/AAAAAAAAsW8/j6bdct9fQoAv6egC33Nv1-4VWmE_lRLWwCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan10_kouDsha.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Okay I think that's the only one I can confidently tell who she is              with that stick lol            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

The "new" chapters (143-146) talkabout the conspiracy unveiling, and that (for the last time here) Ciel Ciel wasactually a fluke all along, taking inheritence of the family heir, andcontinuing its business. That's all everyone knows though, for we still havemany secrets unknown to man, heavily disguised within the Yard and peopleinvolved here and there. Still, more than an accusation, other Ciel has ensuredthat at this point, he would be prosecuted and even framed as the killer of manyfor starting the cult of drawing blood (which makes no sense considering hewouldn't want to save his brother because we know he's technically dead) asstated by Bravat, but more importantly, assumed Phantomhive identity and doingeverything else in his rightful place, I would assume. For this, other Ciel didprepare a lot for it, or at least, had a lot of backing. Undertaker was hissaviour and now protector, Elizabeth knew about the truth early and decided thatCiel Ciel was deceiving her all this time and living a lie she shouldn't havedone (although I would argue that living a life with a living dead maybe worseof a lie) so now she sides the older brother, Bravat used Ciel Ciel as cover toeverything that has happened (and the Yard knew about how it came around becauseCiel Ciel was also the Queen's Watchdog) with the music halls and stuff, andother Ciel has managed to point all the evidence henceforth to the youngerbrother. I mean, anyone wants to question his existence at this point? Whetherhe's even really dead? Oh well, might as well arrest Ciel Ciel and Sebastianfirst I guess, said the Scotland Yard, and off the left. Literally, running awayfrom the dirty society known as London now as wanted criminals. They managed tonot get their Funtom Corporation back which is bad for financial prospects forthe group including the servants, but they did manage to catch up with theirfriend who runs the photography studio who can lead them down to the sewers,nonetheless also tipping himself off to the Yard so he can live. Anyways, theguys are stuck underground now, Sebastian can't ruin the place like a demonuprising even though we've seen that happen which was the point of this storylol, but hey, look who showed up. More on the next few chapters if I canremember this series is still running, I guess. This story is taking a realturn, and I actually like it.<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="472"          data-original-width="795"          height="189"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Wb_8uKBGmds/XAzey16uCCI/AAAAAAAAsRo/fiTPfcN39Y4oYPJik0FJxJw30SeYPHWDwCLcBGAs/s320/14418.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I would argue that this is the most infuriating and saddest moment in        this arc so far      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S.

He has escaped from shinigami hands as one of them,created ways to rise the dead to the living, and intefered with human affairs. Imean, he's most definitely not considered a shinigami now, but with his powershe's going to be hard to defeat. Hey, remember every narrative has to have anevil villian? I think we found him.<br />P.P.S. Referring to the thumbnail, Isay "infuriating" because I was angry that Lizzy sided with the wrong people. Imean... not that the fact that other Ciel was unreal, but also - as she saidherself - that she wanted belonging. Imagine if the whole family went up inflames. She would've lived a different life now. No more princess stuff, andprobably swordfighting like her mother. So why? Why even choose?? To patch upthe hole in your heart? You've got to be joking me.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Wow I wasn't feeling well this week, so as an excuse I didn't do much listeninguntil like, today to be honest, so let's talk about what I've given so farbecause I still did. Man, that passion needs some pushing even if you're ill,yes? First things first: <b>Asakura Momo's single review</b> will be next weekinstead since I don't have time to do everything which was the past two postshere AND get some sleep after taking medicine so that can wait, yes? Besides theflashback singles are coming their way too, so maybe I can do them together...?Hehe surprise surprise, everyone. Hey, be sure to check out the 10th anniversaycompilations for <b>KN10YEARS</b> first, yes? Get a feel of what songs got intomy personal lists. I'll update with previews in due time as I promised on thepost itself.<br /><br />Okay, this week in reviews.<b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new album</b> was last to be reviewed in what I'llbe mentioning this week, and I'd like to give this more chance after hearing itonce. Besides, I think I can give more songs despite the nostalgia feel ofgiving us something closer to their earlier albums which didn't stick with meever since they re-released their 2nd album, so... I'll try. We'll talk moreabout it next week. Moving on, I gave <b>SHE's new single</b> a chance, and Ithink it's great, at this point. First impressions aren't good though, because Ithought the entrance after the introduction was weak and the verses weren't asgood as the chorus but the latter was so good and I remembered that the formerwas actually their style which was softer than your usual pop band, so I gaveit. And a B-side too, because it reminds me too much of Sunrise In<strike>Your</strike> My Attache Case (SIMAC, SIMAC...) in singing Englishsongs, and it's not too shabby, honestly speaking. Which is why I gave it too soyeah, that's Klassic Note recognition of English proficiency right there lol.<b>7!! new album</b> after the leaving of their drummer wasn't that impactful,it seems, as most of their songs lack of the power of melody to keep meinterested, which is like simple and easy to listen. So yeah, not decided onthat yet I may just give one song maybe. On a livestream this week I also heardan English song I liked from someone else's playlist on Spotify (lol I know) soI decided to give <b>John Mayer's new single</b> a chance. It's just one songthough, and this guy hasn't released anything for a long time, so this is prettygood for starters, I would say. 24 million views on YouTube, his music video.You know he's good as much as he's popular, I'm sure. #ExceptionCase, people; Idon't give popular songs all the time, at least, not outside Japan. Lastly,<b>a flood of circle's impressive triple A-side single</b> is actually notfantastic, so I just gave one of them, the first one. It's produced by yourstruly from UNISON SQUARE GARDEN, so I can understand why the other two songs arelike that, but hey, no excuse for not making songs I like, understand? Thenagain, it's very like the band to be like this though, so I guess the producernailed it for them. I'm just... not that interested in them, I guess.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Next week isn't much anyways in new releases (sorry, SurviveSaid The Propher), so let's talk about Twitter and new releases next year. Hey,gotta get hyped about something.<b> KANA-BOON is releasing a mini-album</b>which is going to be out by the year ends so that's cool (pun intended), Aimer'snew single has been confirmed for next month for yet another triple A-sidebecause demand for her singing is soo much it's overflowing,<b>TrySail is releasing their 3rd album</b> on February next year, and THREEreleases are due on the same week next year in February, which are<b>The Floor's mini-album</b> ever since they major debut,<b>Hanazawa Kana's new album</b> because it's her birthday week again, and<b>Numakura Manami's 2nd album</b> after their announcement on a livestream onFriday. Man, they can just drink in livestreams now, these guys. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>Impressive line-up for next year though, but it's all in February so that's kindof sad. Also, I need to write down new releases lest I forget about them, man. Ican't keep relying on Google feed to tell me everything lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thisis about it, then. I'm still coughing for some reason after taking antibioticslest they tell you that a phages injection may just solve anything in the nearfuture (trust me, watch YouTube videos, kid) haha but yeah, my body isdeterioriating as we speak. Yeah, exercise exercise blah blah blah and they saylive life your way, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> It's never true. What a reality to live in,really. Just like I have to do for company trips and that socialisation tripnext weekend... it's never in your control. And always done for some reason; tonot be left out. But I like the world I live in, which is here as you can see. Inever regret being here, and I'm content with sharing everything here even ifit's not the way it's supposed to be done. Cya guys next week then, and untilthen... I hope you're not as alone as me, to say the least. Take some advicefrom me and get some friends, yes? *silcnce* Oh well haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
