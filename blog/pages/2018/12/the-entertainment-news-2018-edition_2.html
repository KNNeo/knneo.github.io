Okay, I have bad news, and I think not seeing another post, you should've seen
this coming.<br /><br />I had a bad sore throat and a wave of fever over the
weekend, so I ended up not doing much. I was only better this afternoon so I
finished this up in order to actually, report this bad news. Also, I've not yet
confirmed on the #KN10YEARS plan so far due to my workload, so for now hopefully
I'll confirm it along with the final post in the Klassic Note Spirit series
which will end by next week. By then, I can't believe you're impatient over
this, but if you are... read through the other years again, yes? Let's start
with this week's stuff first.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I wouldn't say that the guy's undefeatable, because Ash, man, he can always come
out into the light because he can't be killed. Ask
<strike>the director of this show</strike> Golzine and you'll know haha. The new
episode (#BANANAFISH21) continues on the manhunt for Ash, and his current gang
may not be holding up. That's mainly because of two things. Firstly, Lee (that
one guy) is not trusting Sing anymore so is technically taking his brother
hostage, that Lao guy. But of course, it was pretty easy to let the guy go which
also means there was a trade-off, expertly suggested by Ash with his
conversation with Cain. So yeah, poo guy Sing is probably going to lose his
trust even for his own fake family lol. Then, Golzine hired someone again. You
know, old man can't do things along let alone say command an army of soldiers,
so he hired someone to do it. Dirty trick, I must say, but it worked. And Ash
did not lose because he fell out of strategy, but the usual blackmail method was
used on him, after he was quickly targetted and his gang mates quickly taken
into attention, wherever the angle might be. This ranged from cutting the line
that is the mind control drug ie. the scientist who is behind it, to you know,
Max and his family, Cain's gang leader kills and so on. Thanks to a talk with
Eiji, Ash remembers that the same tactic used on him can be used on the enemy
too, but that may be too late as their last gunfight didn't go too well. So, Ash
gave up. Again, not that he's not smart enough or the gang is too inefficient,
but because Golzine was again, cheating. Hey, fair play, ladies and gentlemen.
What will happen next and will Ash manage to escape once again or will that Lao
guy ever betray his gang? We shall see. We shall see.<br />

Haha I like how the SAME EXACT MUSIC can be used on when Tsubame is flirting
over Misha as when Midorin is flirting over Tsubame lol. The new episode
(#UzaMaid09) talks about two things which might be simple in origin but totally
expanded to make it as entertaining as possible, so let's talk about it.
Firstly, Kumagoro's episode is here, ladies and gentlemen. Well, it's only when
it has to go to the doctor which it ABSOULTELY HATES haha of course (I mean,
which pet likes getting checked on by a vet?) so it tries to run away. Well,
it's rather easy, and it ended up on the streets. Spoilers on whoever got it out
of the street and into their house, but on Misha's side they had a hard time
finding it, to say the least. It was not until.... well you can watch it
yourself, but a retired police dog who sniffed out the location of the ferret
which made them easy to find the pet and get him back. Well, someone kid was
holding on to it and it was Morikawa's younger sister btw to yeah, haha. Today I
also learnt that Washiwashi has two younger brothers who made her fat lol, in
the second part of the episode, where the snow is falling and someone needs to
exercise. So, following a meaningless showdown from Morikawa at school the girl
decide to have a snowball fight. I seriously thought that Washiwashi was skilled
but I guess she just wants to slim down lol (kudos to secondary character focus
on this show though), and with the help of that one moving snowman lmao, they
were able to defeat the one person since the other classmates technically
weren't giving a shit haha that was fun. And yeah, I hope Misha you'll be able
to get over your mother, with the initiation of Kumagoro and a new snow memory
to remember by, which probably got ruined by the maid but whatever I can't see
her face anyway haha<br />

  Didn't expect this show to have its hentai segments but hey we've been talking
  about books and rated stuff thus far this is unavoidable? Haha in the new
  episode (#HondaSan09) we talk about the life cycle of books in a bookstore,
  especially when you can only hold that much stock. Hey, my mom would make a
  terrible bookstore staff to be honest she just keeps and never throws (or
  sends back, in the book's case) her sh*t haha okay books. Because of supply
  and demand, we know that books which do not sell well after a period of time
  may get run over by the newer, more popular books which will likely occupy the
  shelf of various genres instead of some books which we don't even know the
  author *looks at Honda-san* haha. So, the staff gotta call to the supplier to
  send them back, which in turn will send back to the publisher. Hey, you know,
  we went through an episode of this with that new guy who can carry tons of
  books, remember? So, the problem here is more likely the lack of expectations
  of sending them back, from sentimental reasons to only part of the series is
  left like the middle or back volumes which is very common by the way (people
  just buy the first volume, for example, and thought it wasn't good so they
  didn't buy everything, and this does not align with the standard supply
  numbers of each volume when it was first on display) to having to send so many
  of them because they really suck haha, it's all in the day of life as a
  bookstore staff. On the contrary, supoer popular books which sell out almost
  instantly are hard to find, hard to stock, not to say hard to keep a copy for
  oneself. Lastly, Honda-san you're totally right: no one comes to a bookstore
  to ask for an e-book version because they can find out about that online, and
  mainly they are here for the hard copy. So yeah, never mention that to a
  customer, yes?<br />

The "new" chapters (133-134) talk about a gum and a familiar candy bar we might
have seen before. Firstly, didn't know Kokonotsu hung out with Sayashi for
lunch. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> That, and they decide to reveal whatever the heck his father
prepared for Kokonotsu for lunch in his bento. I mean, besides the obvious lack
of substance due to the weight of the box, it should be obvious to him that he
should ask what the father placed in his lunchbox is nothing but two bars of
gum. It's fun, it's a party prank, but it's not lunch, <i>Dad</i>. So yeah,
Sayashi was kind enough to spare him some bread. Poor Kokonotsu, is this what
life he has been leading now? I could easily sue You-san for child abuse, you
know. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Then, there's the snow. Hajime-san was tasked to go to a school
apparently probably for dagashi, and Kokonotsu has warned about the dangers of
not seeing the path in the case of snow, and it happened. Hey, everyday life in
a nutshell, people. That, and she almost fell into the snow if not for Hotaru
who was also lost, and did not help much since they both fell into the thick
snow anyways lol. They talked about survival, that familiar snack bar called
Snickers and they somehow concluded that it was a dagashi since it was cheap as
it sold around the world. Little do they notice that they were just resting
nearby the shop lmao this series<br />

This week was a slow week in Klassic Note compared to last week. Evidently, I
have not been spending time finding new stuff to listen to at this time of the
year. Well, there's the Nintendo Switch to blame so... haha. I confirmed on
<b>Tokyo Karan Koron's new mini-album</b> with a couple of nice songs (and real
addictive too), and <b>Cidergirl's 2nd full album</b> was, like some of them
before, real disappointing. I'll say it here, and I'll say it again, that if
your album didn't have melodies to remember any style out there you can give me
will not pass. Sorry, guys. Maybe next time. Even the single topic songs did not
hold up despite me hearing it the second time round.<br /><br />Next week brings
us the much anticipated <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new album</b> after two
years of going semi-quiet, and I hope this time around it will be good. Going
blind this time round, so I expect surprises, even though from listening to the
best albums earlier this year I doubt I'll have the mood to enjoy this. Yeah,
that's it. Huh. I may really need to find songs to top up the song list for the
year actually. Even though I doubt I have to I don't force myself to complete
the song list to the nearest number I'm comfortable with. Not anymore.<br /><br />Not
much has happened this week on Twitter besides the promotion and more
announcements on the upcoming releases next year apparently, so I'm not going to
mention any of them here. I think I'm running down on the account already, as I
continue to post lesser and lesser each week. I know, I think I'm getting tired
of this. Because of work. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This shall be it
for now, I guess. If you read on Honda-san last week you'll know I spent quite a
good amount of time on that birthday present for my sister which came three
weeks early apparently haha, but hey, I don't want to wait for the Christmas
queue. She wants to buy more games though, so yeah, I'm just the starting fuel
here. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cya guys next week then, and until then hopefully I'll be better.
Better on which aspect, I have no idea. Maybe mentally. It makes everything else
better. And I'm not talking about
