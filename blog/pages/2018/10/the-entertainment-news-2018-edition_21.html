So once again, no more Anime Extra from this week onwards because... it's only
Honda-san now which is a half-length show and I'm not going to open a post OR am
I going to wait six days to post my review, so it'll be here. At the time it's
posted, tomorrow. I know it's confusing, so I'll do it again below, yes?<br /><br />Oh
yeah, the weekly post. Well technically I've done three more over the weekend,
so be sure to read them all. KN10YEARS is starting this week (I'm not going to
promote this thing on Twitter because it's not going to do anything spectacular
anyway), and hopefully by December I can finalise my compilation lists and
announce it here. Let's get this week's stuff done and over with. (Spoilers: Not
for music I don't have enough time or mood to listen to new songs)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Aw man, no sex?? But seriously, if you didn't intend to change TV channels so
bad when you see Ash dancing, I want to because I am most definitely NOT GAY
haha. Okay, the new episode (#BANANAFISH15) brings back Golzine (finally), lets
Eiji off the bat from Lee (it's going to be the one guy in their family who in
charge now so I'm not going to say his first name or whatever) and reveals that
firstly, Ash is not dead. I mean, if that isn't any more obvious to any of you
you're as dumb as the local media lol. So yeah, Ash is sent to the Mental
Institute (which was established recently, for some reason) (2012?? I thought
this story was created 20 years ago!) not to be killed of course, and if it's
any surprise to you, to be experimented. By the CIA it would seem, because now
that they took charge, and apparently they got rid of Golzine's role in the
whole thing. Hmm, good time to do that I guess, but the old man's back and he
needs to get a hold of the situation. Thankfully he's still friends with Kippard
who now runs the project, so he's not totally off the hook. Ash, on the other
hand, is in another predicament, as we find out more about the drug. Scientists
have found out weaknesses that will eventually make recipients of the drug
stupid (not joking), and to remedy that they have to test new samples on smart
people like Ash I guess? Hey, we're already seen like two retards who now talk
like robots, so... <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Fortunately, it was just a jab... of anesthesia, and
Golzine did sort of spare his life so he could see his "kid" come and take
revenge on him? Haha you wish. Likely for salvation, and to remedy the current
situation. Because now it's no longer only Ash vs Golzine as we continue to
uncover the bigger conspiracy with the government being controlled by other
private organisations? You're welcome, capitalism. So yeah, that is that. I
don't want to make myself seem more complicated explaining this lol. On the
other side, Eiji manages to "escape" after hearing of Ash's "death", and now is
in the... care? Of Shing, that Chinese leader who was previously with Shorter.
#RIPShorter but hey, this guy here is still kicking and alive. It wouldn't do
much for Lee to let Eiji go, but why not? He is not of threat and "easily
retrievable" (lol), so that's not going to be a problem. For now, everyone
rather deal with how Ash is making his escape, considering that this lab
apparently gives public tours which is great and Max is dumb enough to introduce
himself to Golzine about him writing a report on his deeds. Man, this show's got
drama and makes it easy to understand haha. Ash's brain though, not that easy to
comprehend to be honest. "Prodigy" may be an understatement for this
18-year-old.<br />

Little does she know that if you leave the house that maid will ravage the shit
out of the room like there's no tomorrow and make it look like normal before you
even return haha. This new episode (#UzaMaid03) actually details on why it sucks
to be attractive in looks. Hey, not an everyday phenomenon even for those who
put on makeup (and it's reality for me already), but you know, Misha is a good
exception. But seriously, never crossed my mind when I think of why I'm never in
the same school as those in international schools. Partly because of social
status I believe, but yeah, blending in for most of foreign students will be
rough. I mean, I would say otherwise for university but, kids are insensitive.
And that can mean a lot of problems. Like for example, how our girl Misha here
end up not wanting to go to school because of all the unwanted attention. And
so, Tsubame tries to convince her to go to school. It worked of course, dressing
up like a student and going with her which she promptly rejects (lol can't you
disguise yourself as the teacher?) making her think that she should go to school
herself to avoid the nightmare that is the maid lol. And so she did. (We will
not talk about what happened to Tsubame when she HAD to monitor the kid in
school) And it turns out, it wasn't that bad. I mean, because there's something
worse than her not going to school haha. Okay, story goes that she and another
girl take care of a couple of hamsters in class (and that's why you don't buy
one male one female) who to be honest is best character this episode because not
only did she not blame Misha on her absence but also helped her with
schoolwork... Okay, back to the hamsters. Because mainly due to the teacher who
thought taking care of one hamster cage is easier than two, it quickly became a
disaster since the two hamsters were having it off like rabbits. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So
yeah, Misha took it to her hands to resolve the issue and - of course with the
help of other classmates - perhaps make things a lot better for the class. And
this, is how you make an impression, kids. Don't be an emo kid; be proactive.
And that's what Misha should be: a girl who can stand on her own, instead of
mourning over her mother's passing. The father is right though: It takes time
for her to forget about it before he can try to convince her to lead a normal
life, but hey, the maid did kind of do it through negative encouragment so
that's good haha. Honestly this show is great. Just... ignore the pecs and her
stealth skills in the toilet lol she hid UNDER the stairs wtf<br />

To answer your first question, Honda-san? Yes I have seen people in suits come
into otaku bookstores you should watch Wotakoi haha oh they are not customers?
Okay, the new episode (#HondaSan03) has practically made Honda-san break his
shoulders. And again, it's with customers. But first, not customers. They are
called salespersons, however they do not sell directly to consumers but to
bookstores. And with heavy changes in supply and demand (even if demand is just
the one guy who bought 200 copies) this can be either a wonderful meeting or the
worst encounters in the day of a bookstore staff ever. From running out of stock
or screwed up orders to trying not to accept too much novelty they cannot afford
to stuff as decor for the store, there's always something to worry about. Then,
there's customer trivia. Because people are often lost when they want to find
new stuff to read, it's hard for any of the staff to come up with some good
recommendation off their minds. So, they pop open that staff room door and ask
the others. And when you thought trivia games were fun, wait till you can come
up with something better than these guys the moment that one French guy had
pretty much no clue to give you and he wants to buy something for the
granddaughter. I mean, Honda-san did pull it off in the end so that's good. That
and probabky his shoulders too I would think lol

promise now I've got a reputation to maintain<br /><br />

I didn't give anything this week. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> What to do? They aren't all that
impressive to give off the bat! But yes I did listen to a couple of releases
this week. <b>ORESKABAND's new song</b> was okay, and still better than that
other band I'd rather not talk about now because I rejected their digital
singles two times now (it's Yogee New Waves), so I might just give it. Who knows
when these girls are going to come up with something soon, and I'd rather not
wait.

wasn't impressive to be honest, and even their topic song turns out going in
from one ear and out of the other. I did mark one song though so I'll see if I
can give that or not. <b>Kuraki Mai's concept album</b> was still in the
questionable area as said from last week, so I'll need time to give them. <span class="emoji" title="*sigh*">üò©</span>
No new songs already?<br /><br />Talking about new songs,
<b>the theme songs for that maid Anime</b> above are going to be released. Yeah,
I have to give one of them. Ugh. I just hope the opening theme isn't a
disappointment because there is NO FREAKING WAY I'll give the ending haha<br /><br />In

what... I listen now. Oh well. Those were a good two years tbh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's
it then. If I have the mood I'll do the attachments on the post. Cya guys next
week then. Well actually tomorrow but you probably won't notice the one part pop
up in here so... next week then. And hopefully by then I can complete the rest
of Klassic Note Spirit to publish all of them in schedule. Yeah, got like three
more years to go haha
