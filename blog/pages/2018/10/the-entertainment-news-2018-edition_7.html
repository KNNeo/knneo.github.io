I'm not feeling too well so I'll not do the super fancy stuff for this week.
Tomorrow too probably.<br /><br />Yeah, the cold's caught up to me. I may have
to take my first work MC in my life. Yes, I didn't take MC even when I was in my
internship. So yeah, so much for that record. <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span> Let's finish this quick.
Thank goodness I was "well" when I watched the shows for this week.<br /><br />...<br /><br />You
think this post will look better without the category names? Just the titles?
Well, Klassic Note will have its own title but as large as the Anime ones. You
think it's good? Maybe I'll do that for next week haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I mean, Ash may not have that man-killing drug which can ruin his world, but
he's got his gay boyfriend Eiji. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> The new episode (#BANANAFISH13) after
a week of hiatus (damn you tornado you were bad AND a nuisance) returns to
conclude the final battle between Ash and Frederic- Oh I can't say that yet?
Arthur, for you guys will be more familiar with that name even at this point.
Whoever that black guy is (sorry for the racism) set up a place for them to
fight in a duel to the death with nothing but knives, but you know Arthur is not
going to let himself lose even though we know he will lol. So yeah, he called
the train in. Well, not helping much for Ash and the other witness(es)
considering it was held in a train station platform where trains can run, and
Arthur just managed to send a beast which can fire guns out of the windows lol.
After defeating all of them, Ash managed to sneak into the train to catch up to
Arthur. All this eventually led up to Ash thinking about his potential death
ahead of him whilst fighting his nemesis? Well, I wouldn't say so. Firstly,
Arthur was quite a pussy. Even back then he didn't get a gentlemanly fight with
Ash, and now he's trying to avoid conflict as much as posssible. It's as if he
hates violence lol. Second, he rejoices at his advantage which builds on his
confidence. Kind of like me, but he's controlling the mafia. It's fine if he's
me, but not when he's a gang leader. For playing too many tricks up his sleeve,
this man shouldn't even be called a man at this point. In the end, the two did
get into a proper duel but on the overground train tracks at the eyes of
sunrise, with half the police force and the gangs "observing" down below.
Spoiler alert: Arthur lost. Oh well. Ash didn't come up unscathed either, as the
police arrive to take down everyone present, including Eiji. Hey, did I mention
he was here? Thanks to the one guy that said he couldn't keep the secret anymore
(oh just keep your mouth shut once for the sake of your boss, would you?), Eiji
found out Ash was going to risk his life once more. And like any gay partner
(lol), he rushed to witness the side Ash said he doesn't want Eiji to see. Yeah,
much like those mafia shows where the wife shouldn't bear witness to the number
of people the husband murdered. Hey, I may be drawing parallels here but now
that the new parallel between Ash and Golzine is drawn, I really wonder what
will happen next. Golzine still has things up his sleeve though, so he wouldn't
be going away without a fight. That, or he may have applied for his migration
which I don't think any country will take him? Haha cya guys next week to find
out<br />

"Hey, you need a replacement wife?" Is LITERALLY the first thing that came into
my mind when watching this show lol. Wow this series man. Translated as "The
House Maid Is Too Annoying!", this show is... definitely in the laughable region
of comedy. And honestly? What brought me here is only the fact that Nu-chan (who
plays the maid) was in it. That's it. For what is in this show, I have no idea
besides watching the trailer. But as of now, I think I have a better picture,
and I may just want to watch this for laughs every week. This first episode
(#UzaMaid01) gives us a simple and quick introduction (you'll know why I say
'quick' here) of what happens when you marry a Russian and have kids lol. Kamoi
Tsubame is a woman. A woman with great aspirations. I mean, being a jet fighter
pilot as a woman in Japan? Many would dream of getting such a job. Well first
you gotta be ripped to even be in the Air Force which most women wouldn't want
which we will talk about later, but hey, she's living the life. Unfortunately,
she doesn't like it. A great episode to teach us about #JobChoices in life, and
she quitted her job in search for something she thought would be impossible to
get as a job: taking care of a cute kid while letting the kid wear the clothes
she makes for some reason. Well, I would otherwise suggest for the former along
the lines of a caregiver or an elementary school teacher, but the job agency
isn't helping much, and technically I can't think of any on the latter, so oh
well. Anyways, she ponders about the time she got struck by the idea seeing that
cute Russian girl on the garden with her mother, and still till date was
determined to make her ideal job happen. Fast forward a couple of years and she
is out of a job, constantly searching for that dream job and then noticed the
house she was admiring all along is finding a maid. Great! It totally fits her
bill! Taking care of the laundry, cooking, and the kid... this just might be the
best job for her ever. Sadly, there's a catch. The kid is a pain to take care
of. This was also why the father had a hard time finding a maid after (sorry for
saying this) the mother passed away. Misha, the kid, was a playful one. And she
did not exclude Tsubame in making sure she gets the hint by pouring on her muddy
water in the living room and on a couch, which no doubt I'll freaking kill my
kid if he/she ever does that lol. And against all odds, Tsubame was not even
rejective of this kid, and turned out liking her more. There are more subtle
hints which I'll not dwelve into since it'll probably be talked about in future
episodes (lolicon), but for now we just need to know there's a desperate maid to
take care of the kid, and there's a rejective kid which will keep her
mischevious character in check. Which is honestly a good thing for the father
and for us. For the father since it'll solve his problem of not having someone
take care of the house during the day, and great for us because we'll get to see
11 more episodes of this fun ensue. What will happen next in the cosplay
pedophile dress-up gag comedy series? Your guess is as good as mine. Meanwhile,
two things will stand in my way of giving this, mainly the ripped maid (I mean,
if she dresses up appropriately as a maid lol I wouldn't even mind, but that
school PE outfit...), and the theme songs. The ending theme song was technically
a rap. <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span> Much as this show is annoying, I want to give it, so we shall
see.<br />

P.S. The theme songs are more annoying than this show tbh they should rename
this show to "Teema Kyoku ga Uzasugiru!" [Theme Song(s) Are Too Annoying!]<br />P.P.S.
Okay this was so important but I gotta say that that pet in the house (whatever
that is) heavily reminds me of

The new chapter (162) tells us about one of those unusual phenomenon that
appears around the island, namely the harvest of the heavenly eggplants. Due to
it's active nature (as with most plants in this island) it can only be harvested
by ninjas for their quick speed and stealth abilities every decade when they
decide to spread their seeds haha. So yeah, Shinobu and her sister Mikoto are up
for the task. Up to the Eastern forest they go (Shinobu was lost again lol), and
they did find those things. They move though (well, it's normal in that island),
so it'll take some effort for the girls to be able to "harvest" them without
getting into any sort of danger. Or will they? Well by the time you finish
reading this chapter they've already stripped down and are using leaves to cover
their bodies (which will not be shown here) so... you can guess how well this is
going haha. More next chapter, I assume. Will they get the harvest? I guess so.
How much can they tease us already? (What, who?) <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />

This week was not much but we still can talk about it. To be honest? I got lazy
with the research I told myself to do last week, so I only listened to a couple
of <b>Polkadot Stingray singles and EPs</b> (not going to list them all here
because there's like, four), and... I must say I'm not fancy of their style, and
I'm not talking about genre. You get what I mean. I also didn't took much time
but review

and... I get a good feeling now on what type of music they are going for, so
I'll see if I have the mood to give another one. Polkadot Stingray too, just so
you wonder. They are pretty good if you dive in further to find out about them.

dig the mood and style these guys give me. Real cheerful and strong in beats.
I'll also spend more time giving those <b>ROCK IN JAPAN FES 2018</b> live

I guess secretly for some reason, so now I can go full on nostalgia and hope
that I can give more of those non-electronic songs I have loved. <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm
done. I'll try another dose of Panadol and get a good night's sleep and see if I
can recover. Good chances it won't happen but fingers crossed I don't want to go
through the trouble of submitting MC haha. Also, I'll do up the pop-ups if I
have the time at work (well, if I DO go to work I will lol) and stay tuned
tomorrow to see if I did wait for 2 hours just to see the doctor, get some pills
and a piece of paper. Oh government hospitals only give A4-size paper they don't
know how to save paper like private clinics do haha
