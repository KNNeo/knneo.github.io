Well I've been out doing a lot of things just now including having dinner with
my family, getting that wooden automatic watch strap adjusted (hehe) because
that big mall near my place doesn't even have a watch store for some freaking
reason (for context there's two before it was renovated), and watching some
livestream. So yeah, I have to wake up early tomorrow to travel halfway across
the country so if you'll excuse me I'd like to finish this quick<br /><br />Should've
read the manga earlier today haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I like how the whole escape involves Max's decisions screwing up with Ash's
escape with the Professor lol sometimes in life man you just don't know. The new
episode (#BANANAFISH16) completes Ash's escape under the supervision of Golzine
and action of whoever that took the role of the old man for the Foundation. Hey,
remember last episode when Golzine told him to escape? And that's why he's just
watching now, probably also because he has "no power to do anything anyway". You
know, legal stuff. But now, I guess everything's back to normal? Okay, what
happened first. Firstly, what Ash did to escape. He was planning to escape
alone, but he knew he needed evidence to tell the world once he leaves, so he
brought the inventor of the drug with him so he could tell the full story.
Secondly, Max and Ibe-san's involvement. Well it's mostly Max's fault, but
suffice it to say their participation during the events that occur while Ash
escaped were nothing but a hindrance. As a result, the Professor has been bonked
on the head by a security guard, Ash has been brought up and down an elevator
and he still has to save their asses after he successfully escaped with a
hostage AND without their help. Thanks, old men. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, they
managed to disguise themselves and leave which was great mainly because Golzine
let them do it, but also in consequence Ash found out that Eiji is missing. I
mean, we know where he is (for now), so there's nothing to worry about maybe. So
next, Ash is going after Eiji. Which will likely involve his engagement with the
Lee brother (the only one left who is still sane and is in New York) which may
get dirty if you want to compare it to the trash chute the three fell in or the
time the guys have to watch a doctor and nurse make out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, this show
has everything to laugh to and I like it! <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span><br />

P.S. I mean, the fact that Golzine has created a genius which surpasses anything
that the government has made technically makes him one of the most revolutionary
people in history ever. Well, ignoring that Ash may be a genius as a kid before
he was under Golzine, I guess.<br />P.P.S. I sure hope Mikakoshi watches this
because she has not been mentioning this on Twitter (I suppose she is busy) or
she just doesn't want to talk about it because I think it's a good...
watch-bait? Yeah haha<br /><br />

You also want to stay at home, play games all day and laze around? What a
coincidence because me too, Misha!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> #SlackLife haha anyways in the new
episode (#UzaMaid04) of this fantastic series which is still bombing you with
pecs, lolicon and small animals (I totally dig the last part for some reason)
and to top it off, displaying how much of a life you can have over the weekend.
Well, if you're Misha-chan, that is. The first part brings us into the life of
Misha over the weekend, and with an assignment pending I'm even glad she can
forget about schoolwork until only at the end of it all. Hey, #StudentProblems,
am I right?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay. Thanks to the father being busy over the weekend,
the maid has to stand in because how can you just leave a kid alone at home?
(Okay now I'm sounding like a lolicon) More importantly, it's also because she
doesn't know what to write for the assignment, as it's an essay for your future.
Hey, I know I'll have problems doing that as a kid and boy am I glad I'm smart
enough to write some cr*p to make up for it back then and not write what I am
now doing my first full-time job (lol), but still. Thanks to the maid, she
figured out what to write. It may be too realistic for a second grader (who is
about 8 years old), but hey, there are more realistic things she can do as a
human haha. Which brings us to the other half of the episode, where Misha brings
her closest (human) classmate/friend Washiwashi (lol) to her place because she
keeps showing off her animal squad to her. (And that's how you know Misha has a
close resemblance to Tsubame it's literally Tsubame if she led Misha's life but
with small animals) To think that she's living the life of a satisfied person
(refer to Asobi Asobase for the significance of being a ”<a
  href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu"
  target="_blank"
  >riajuu</a
>”) based on the things she do now seemingly being of a popular person (inviting
friends over, playing around with them etc.), you can only guess how good this
afternoon after school has become. Of course Tsubame can't get her hands off the
classmate, but just slightly, she behaves herself until she gets to tell the
girl to wear one of her hand-made clothing. Well, what do you know. No
Misha-chan dressup. I'm as sad as

right now tbh haha. Anyways, the girls had a good time, Tsubame stoned so hard
she's rather die (please do so then haha), and... Misha's a lucky girl because
she doesn't have to worry about money now. Well, sucks to be your father then

one week)<br />P.P.S. "You push when it's time to push, and pull back when it's
time to pull back" It's just like Taichi haha you want more of this? (Audience:
We didn't ask for-) "I'd rather shave all my hair then let you touch it!" Haha
this is just so wrong anyways you want more- (Just as an endnote if I can put

If you need an episode to describe why there are literally a thousand faces in
this series, look no further. The faces, I mean. Specifically, the smile. This
new episode (#HondaSan04) of this short episode series makes us wonder why we
aren't smiling enough. Heck, I would smile all day if I'm paid more than a
bookstore staff haha. Okay, for the whole thing they feature Honda-san going to
this training session for the staff, and apparently it's just a sacrifice done
for all stores for the sake of customer service lol. I guess it is important to
train the staff even for a bookstore franchise, and we technically can't just
change faces in an instant lol that guy, so yeah, Honda-san had to go through
Hell, literally. It's like boot camp but only for the face muscles haha. There
are a couple of things to take away though besides the cr*p that is learning how
to smile: Honda-san may have found someone to like (hehe) and he is actually
taking this course easily. I mean, Okitsune-senpai probably got it worse maybe
we don't know we won't get to see it please don't I don't want to see it too

Haha the new chapter (132) (again, take the word "new" with a huge grain of salt
as I'm aware of the Japan serialisation, thanks) talks about mufflers. How boys
seemingly want one from a girl. And Sayashi can't make one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, not
that she dodged knitting class in school or refused to go to the store where his
childhood friend resides and watch the girls to find him for sweets (lol), but
just that she's not that type of woman. And yeah, so is Hotaru apparently.
<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, apart from thinking that Hotaru-chan is only good at sweets
(mostly on eating them probably) I can't think of anything else even in games
that she is good at. So yeah, again proving Sayashi is a genius, and it'll
probably take an old lady from the village to teach her to make a proper sized
muffler probably for Kokonotsu becuase that tiny one for the brother must be a
good April Fool's Day joke haha<br />

The new chapter (163) concludes on the journey to search for the legendary
eggplants, and if you need a recap they only can be harvested by ninjas because
they are hard to catch, only catch them in the forest every decade, and the
eggplants spread pollen which can have adverse personality effects on people in
its immediate surroundings, as seen from Mikoto and Shinobu when they came back
from the harvest. Everyone had a great feast of the eggplants and- Wait Shinobu
was affected too? You bet! Haha actually Mikoto being poisoned technically will
be a normal villager in the island which will be a good thing maybe until you
remember this story is a harem fest so one less (or two if Mikoto stalks on that
carpenter lol) of them would be easy on Ikuto to be honest haha<br />

Wow this was quite a week in Klassic Note, probably the busiest. And because so
I did not have enough time to finish them all. So let's talk about what I
listened to this week. I confirmed on <b>Kuraki Mai's new mini-album</b> after
like what, 3 weeks in review? Yeah, and also because I saw that music video with
Mikakoshi in it haha happy birthday Kuraki-san.
<b>Anime "Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!" theme songs</b> are... you just need to
know I only gave the opening theme because I'm kind and that is your
stereotypical theme song so I just closed one ear giving it haha.

is actually rather good, but if this was what she was focusing on after her 2nd
album in 2016 I would say it didn't change much. Her further emphasis on pop
styles make me want to give less songs but it's not as bad as the melodies
because most of them aren't that good and it took her livestream to burn that
topic song into my brain and I just gave it because I have the mood and I
listened to it too much on one day and that day is Wednesday when it came out
haha. Lastly,

was... man, I can't give 70s Japanese songs, I guess. That, and it sounds so
like her album because it's mixed to her style and while her singing on them
were great those aren't spectacular melodies. I'll see if I can even give any of
them because fumika probably did better in Klassic Note in terms of cover songs
given lol (Aki-chan, this might be the <strike>first</strike> second release I'm
going to reject I'm sorry)<br /><br />Talking about cover songs, I've yet to
listen to (we're still at releases this week btw)

ever since her solo debut earlier this year (yes Ikimonogakari vocalist blah
blah) so I'll give a listen to that next week. Also on the pending list is

    >Kalafina's 10th anniversary best album</a
  ></b
>, which I think is the final, but still not enough to get into my shelf mostly
due to lack of new songs I've given over the past few years. That, you can blame
Anime mostly on it. What are they going to do besides sing for Anime? I mean,
write good songs because they are better without credit? Someone tell
Kajiura-sensei that please<br /><br />Next week brings us a couple of releases
we should definitely take note of besides
<b>Anime "Gaikotsu Shoten'in Honda-san" theme song single</b> which I better try
to give one of them (opening theme probably, ending is better maybe),
<b>Numakura Manami's new single</b> because she's cool and it's been some time I
gave her a song, and

because why not? I'll be looking forward to that in particular but as from the
preview tracks in Apple Music (three of them) I'm getting worried already. (Did
I say that last week? If not then forget about this lol)<br /><br />Lastly on
news from Twitter because you're too lazy to go check out my liked Tweets,

hopefully (some guy on Twitter said he can see some of the tracks on Spotify)
(some, bro, isn't ALL haha), and that stupid girls group from Korea (haha) which
I gave the one song this week (oh I forgot to mention them above?)
<b>TWICE is releasing a new album</b> which is actually their first album in
Japan released like two months ago PLUS that one song. Re-released. Full
package. It even writes "Repackage" on the title. Totally intended to rip
people's money off. Hey, thanks marketing; you know idolism best.
#CapitalismAtItsFinest lol I'm not that dumb this one song is all you're getting
(I DARE YOU to compare the tracklist in

with

desktop? You've not been using

tomorrow- Oh I said that already haha. Cya guys tomorrow for Honda-san, and next
week... if I have Internet access over the next couple of days I'll try to do up
the pop-ups. But with my luck I think I'll have to mobile tether just to even
get work done because I don't know the client location's Wi-Fi password?? Oops I
think I spoke too much haha bye
