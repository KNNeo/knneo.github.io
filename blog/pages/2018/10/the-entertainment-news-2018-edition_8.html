Well, it's fixed now, so...<br /><br />Well, since I don't havemuch to talk about here besides the fact that I just took 2 days MC, I hope Idon't get fired and I can still be fired to do whatever I need to do that is notwork haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan48">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Is it wrong not to be special?" And then the mother's like "He's cute" lol    she into Anime too?  </div></blockquote>The new episode (#AttackOnTitan48) of this series which is still going finallytouches on the super-touchy topic we have avoided since someone's mother goteaten: Eren's past. It came from a sudden recall from the triggering of memorieswhen Eren was apprehended by Reiss, and some familiar face surfaced. Nope, it'snot Historia because we're done with her saving the people behind the walls, butthe Commander. Remember that bald-headed guy who taught Eren and the othersduring training? I bet you do. He was the one who technically held the closestrelationship with Eren's father. And so, they asked him for a story. A story ofa bystander. I like how throughout this series besides despair the show alsocontinues to emphasise the will for humans to progress, to become stronger, andto be braver. Well, mostly it's for the purpose for defeating Titans so they canstop being behind the walls (a good reflection of society today btw, thinkemigration), but still. The Commander starts his story with a reality check:that Eren's father is outside the walls, wiped of his memories. A good reminderthat he's probably also around the place where the Reiss were trying to pass ontheir Titan power to control and also, to erase the memories of people who willtherefore have no recollection of the past. Well, apparently the father canremember his own name and what he's good at, so I guess that's pretty good for astart. Instead of being prosecuted, the Military Police at that time along withthe Commander who was then just a small fry of a Scout, took him in. Eventually,the father became a practitioner who continued to save lives. That is, howeverprobably, till he discovered the Titan power. I mean, he probably could haveeavesdropped on a conversation and got into it, as we have seen a couple ofepisodes ago. The Commander did try to stop his actions for letting his son takerevenge for the mother, but was without much help. In the end, he thought hewasn't special enough to lead the Scouts to victory (I kind of agree; Erwin wasbetter tbh), and he wasn't special enough to influence others probably. That,could use some reflection. For now today we have Eren bravely doing everythingjust to exact revenge for her mom, even without knowing the full story whybecause the father said so and injected him with Titan power for some reason.Hey, I could do halfway through life without knowing what it means, so can he.That, he now has to bear the truth for himself. There are still questionslooming behind this story though (Is all this good enough reason to fightTitans? Maybe considering what we know of now, yeah), but I guess that'll be fornext time. Meanwhile, they are ready to take back Wall Maria, hopefully, to givethe people behind the walls their homeland, and more free space. I mean, theystill didn't know whether Berthodt that lot will ever come back, so might aswell enjoy expansion for now.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t3t04NFZS9c/W7s7p_WKUoI/AAAAAAAAqnY/mW9C1fmdpBEoQfBVtxPK7z3Kesj7XAfAQCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan48_father.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Eren's father is just weird.

Your. Fucking. Lady- <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>Wow, that intro must be the best summary of the main story thus far. Hey, if youguys are missing out, this one's got you covered. In the new episode(#Tsukumogami11) of #TheGossip (damn did I miss using this hashtag lol) isprecisely what you SHOULD NOT do to win the heart of a man. I'll say this once,and I'll say it again. This is as bad as a stereotypical type of conflict inrelationship dramas, and it always has the biggest consequence if it isn'tresolved. And that is jealousy.Especially when it turns evil. RememberHansuke-san and her uh- I mean, HIS story about how he came to the town? Yeah,it was a sad one. Moreover, it was actually a common trick. Is this how peoplein the past trick their husbands to liking the wife? Man, I'm so glad I wasn'tone of them back then. Still, in this long story in which we have pursued, ittook this long for us to know the whole story. So yeah, it started with anencounter with Sataro-san's tsukumogami in the area, and he told the "gods" thefull story. Of course, those two already know so who cares haha. Story goes thatthat incense burner Suou was missing. Story then goes that Okou exchanged hardthat hairpin which was given to her and made it worth 80 ryo to afford anotherof those. Well, similar in design, but still. Turns out, one of my manysuspicions for filling up this gap was correct: It was destroyed. Well, myintinuition was that both incense burners were destroyed which forced Sataro toleave, but that will not explain why Okou didn't get screwed for the rest of herlife even up till now. So yeah, only the one which was bough to replace wasdestroyed. And surprise surprise, it was Sataro himself. He decided to leavebecause he knew this was set against him, and leaving was still his primaryoption, and that he would never be happy with whatever his life was now, and Iagree. Not that I'm siding Okou, but these kinds of marriages are rather commonas a change or match of social status. And people normally want to change theirsocial status upwards. You know, parents. So Sataro had to leave in anycapacity, but man did he destroy what could be worth another plot of landcondensed to a work of art able to be placed on one's hands. However, Seijidecided to find out more of the truth, coincidentally after helping outKatsusaburo-sama solve his problem of suspecting Sanae still having a goings onwith the previous lover. And yes Hansuke was right, that it's important to tellthe partner everything in his/her face. *laughs at that idiot* And he did, soall is well for him. Reflecting upon Hansuke's story, Seiji then realised thatthis might just happen to Okou too. Yeah. Not a coincidence because women backthen didn't have much creativity but very wily (which explains why women alsoneed education lol I'm getting feminism tagged), but it can also happen to her.Okou, I mean. And Seiji was right. And of course, that b*tch couldn't have doneit without assistance. Not prosecutable by law, but evil in nature. Women,people. In case you haven't thought about that possibility yet. *shakes head*And overlooking in the final episode preview, it would seem that Sataro isback?! Hmm, he was seen in the town, but what does that all mean...? Does thatmean he's back in search of Okou? (I mean, he could've avoided coming back inany capacity) Does that mean he's escaping once again from where he settledafter he left? So many questions, and a list of crimes behind his backapparently, what will conclude of this series?? I tell you, that hashtag is sobooming, I'm the only one using it to vent my frustrations haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qlfCwqKBbsM/W7tFtSOCkpI/AAAAAAAAqns/VQfxGJer55YpMGeRFjw7JMzJNxHzxe8yACLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami11_shock1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I am with these guys on reactions tbh #SoMuchShock          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5T_ru3_I6uk/W7tFte5DZAI/AAAAAAAAqnw/5fSnQQvMFgAYZL-i1afmZJpaf6648SPcwCLcBGAs/s320/tsukumogami11_shock2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I am with these guys on reactions tbh #SoMuchShock          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Said every father ever lol    this one  </div></blockquote>Wow, another show in this new season which amazes me so much I must talk moreabout it. Don't ask how I got interested in this, but the only thing I came into know that it has jokes. About work. Specifically, about work in a bookstore.I mean, I had that Anime experience before, and I think I did mention to youguys about it, and that is Denkigai no Honya-san. Not that I'm drawing parallelsfrom it, but I can conclude what I saw just from the series introduction forthis series: It's Yojouhan Shinwa Taikai storytelling of Denkigai no Honya-san.Let me explain why. In this first episode (#HondaSan01) of this half-lengthseries (yes it's only 10 minutes long excluding theme song), we came to know ofbookstore in Japan in general. And yes, despite the daunting narration off thebat, the perspective in the story is totally correct about the worldview: peoplefrom all over the world are interested in Japanese books, and some came herejust to get their hands on a couple of them. Don't ask how they would otherwiseunderstand Japanese in order to read them (and that's why there's licensedtranslations of those books), but hey, I guess there are people who will spend aday reading a book just like me lol. Okay, let's talk about Honda-san. I guessthis is your image-based face-change type of Anime, where real faces aren'tdrawn (I mean, look at the customers and tell me why they don't draw some cutefaces for the staff) (*looks at denk!girls*) and everyone looks like they're ina GTA heist (video game reference btw) lol. Ignoring that completely, Honda-sanseems to be not at hand as a bookstore staff, frantically worrying about how toserve customers, and do a good job at... at his job. Of course, that's why wework, right? For interest, but also at interest of the customers, hoping toserve them the best they can. But of course with all forms of work you know sh*tis going to hit you the moment you realise what is in front of you, for example,a list of names on a piece of paper or when someone holds their phone for you tosee typically a manga cover... hey, just another day in the job. That, and I'mreal impressed this show didn't break momentum. Which is why I talked about bothshows in my initial conclusion above. It has all the antics you would know ofrunning a bookstore (OTs dealing with new books, limited edition stuff which isliterally the whole shelf over there upstairs haha) but told in a faster pacethen expected. And that's not a bad thing. Coming in with some knowledge (not ofBL, but) of how the bookstore runs, this comes a more of a refreshingperspective of the story, and I'm sure in future episodes the other charcterswill be introduced so we truly know what Honda-san is dealing with in hisworkplace that's getting his confidence on check. That, and he should brush upon his English are those younger voice actors who can speak better English thanhim?? Oh he newbie too? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We'll give chance, this show. I laughed. That'sgood enough of a passing requirement. That Sunday time slot though... feels likeI'm the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/uke" target="_blank">uke</a>" (lookat definition no.5) having to watch this show lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SlWnmlR_x4w/W7tNMg0djsI/AAAAAAAAqoE/2KAn93ViqesR3aWnuE2qmXP8sGkyCpE1wCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan01_ikemen.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I must say, job familiarity is an assurance and also a boost of            confidence no matter how many times it appears lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vkZpQA9OXzc/W7tNMoAfDXI/AAAAAAAAqoA/Kq4tiuaqQso3Nn-rq5p8CmhIAq__vBLlgCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan01_pose.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I must say, job familiarity is an assurance and also a boost of            confidence no matter how many times it appears lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;"  >If you believed any of those in the intro when they ask about impressions on  bookstore staff, you CLEARLY haven't watched Anime lol</span><br /><span style="text-align: center;"  >P.P.S.

Howto say... if I live in Japan, I wouldn't buy books in stock just like that onehardcore fan who probably got interested in a series so bad he immediatelybought the whole series. Because if it were me I would have those books on myshelf that are only one or two books of it because I stopped as I didn't like itenough to buy the next volume on my nearest bookstore. Well, ignoring my slothof actually going to buy one, it still is good to have some motivation behind towant to conitnue reading the story even though the whole series is out. Thatdesperation will drive one's interest, I believe. Becuase if you bought thewhole stack like that guy and didn't like it after the 2nd volume even thoughyou read the 1st from your friend... you're going to be wasting a lot of yourown money.<br /><br />I'm done. Cya guys on Sunday. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
