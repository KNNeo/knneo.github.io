The new episode (#AttackOnTitan48) of this series which is still going finally
touches on the super-touchy topic we have avoided since someone's mother got
eaten: Eren's past. It came from a sudden recall from the triggering of memories
when Eren was apprehended by Reiss, and some familiar face surfaced. Nope, it's
not Historia because we're done with her saving the people behind the walls, but
the Commander. Remember that bald-headed guy who taught Eren and the others
during training? I bet you do. He was the one who technically held the closest
relationship with Eren's father. And so, they asked him for a story. A story of
a bystander. I like how throughout this series besides despair the show also
continues to emphasise the will for humans to progress, to become stronger, and
to be braver. Well, mostly it's for the purpose for defeating Titans so they can
stop being behind the walls (a good reflection of society today btw, think
emigration), but still. The Commander starts his story with a reality check:
that Eren's father is outside the walls, wiped of his memories. A good reminder
that he's probably also around the place where the Reiss were trying to pass on
their Titan power to control and also, to erase the memories of people who will
therefore have no recollection of the past. Well, apparently the father can
remember his own name and what he's good at, so I guess that's pretty good for a
start. Instead of being prosecuted, the Military Police at that time along with
the Commander who was then just a small fry of a Scout, took him in. Eventually,
the father became a practitioner who continued to save lives. That is, however
probably, till he discovered the Titan power. I mean, he probably could have
eavesdropped on a conversation and got into it, as we have seen a couple of
episodes ago. The Commander did try to stop his actions for letting his son take
revenge for the mother, but was without much help. In the end, he thought he
wasn't special enough to lead the Scouts to victory (I kind of agree; Erwin was
better tbh), and he wasn't special enough to influence others probably. That,
could use some reflection. For now today we have Eren bravely doing everything
just to exact revenge for her mom, even without knowing the full story why
because the father said so and injected him with Titan power for some reason.
Hey, I could do halfway through life without knowing what it means, so can he.
That, he now has to bear the truth for himself. There are still questions
looming behind this story though (Is all this good enough reason to fight
Titans? Maybe considering what we know of now, yeah), but I guess that'll be for
next time. Meanwhile, they are ready to take back Wall Maria, hopefully, to give
the people behind the walls their homeland, and more free space. I mean, they
still didn't know whether Berthodt that lot will ever come back, so might as
well enjoy expansion for now.<br />

Wow, that intro must be the best summary of the main story thus far. Hey, if you
guys are missing out, this one's got you covered. In the new episode
(#Tsukumogami11) of #TheGossip (damn did I miss using this hashtag lol) is
precisely what you SHOULD NOT do to win the heart of a man. I'll say this once,
and I'll say it again. This is as bad as a stereotypical type of conflict in
relationship dramas, and it always has the biggest consequence if it isn't
resolved. And that is jealousy.Especially when it turns evil. Remember
Hansuke-san and her uh- I mean, HIS story about how he came to the town? Yeah,
it was a sad one. Moreover, it was actually a common trick. Is this how people
in the past trick their husbands to liking the wife? Man, I'm so glad I wasn't
one of them back then. Still, in this long story in which we have pursued, it
took this long for us to know the whole story. So yeah, it started with an
encounter with Sataro-san's tsukumogami in the area, and he told the "gods" the
full story. Of course, those two already know so who cares haha. Story goes that
that incense burner Suou was missing. Story then goes that Okou exchanged hard
that hairpin which was given to her and made it worth 80 ryo to afford another
of those. Well, similar in design, but still. Turns out, one of my many
suspicions for filling up this gap was correct: It was destroyed. Well, my
intinuition was that both incense burners were destroyed which forced Sataro to
leave, but that will not explain why Okou didn't get screwed for the rest of her
life even up till now. So yeah, only the one which was bough to replace was
destroyed. And surprise surprise, it was Sataro himself. He decided to leave
because he knew this was set against him, and leaving was still his primary
option, and that he would never be happy with whatever his life was now, and I
agree. Not that I'm siding Okou, but these kinds of marriages are rather common
as a change or match of social status. And people normally want to change their
social status upwards. You know, parents. So Sataro had to leave in any
capacity, but man did he destroy what could be worth another plot of land
condensed to a work of art able to be placed on one's hands. However, Seiji
decided to find out more of the truth, coincidentally after helping out
Katsusaburo-sama solve his problem of suspecting Sanae still having a goings on
with the previous lover. And yes Hansuke was right, that it's important to tell
the partner everything in his/her face. *laughs at that idiot* And he did, so
all is well for him. Reflecting upon Hansuke's story, Seiji then realised that
this might just happen to Okou too. Yeah. Not a coincidence because women back
then didn't have much creativity but very wily (which explains why women also
need education lol I'm getting feminism tagged), but it can also happen to her.
Okou, I mean. And Seiji was right. And of course, that b*tch couldn't have done
it without assistance. Not prosecutable by law, but evil in nature. Women,
people. In case you haven't thought about that possibility yet. *shakes head*
And overlooking in the final episode preview, it would seem that Sataro is
back?! Hmm, he was seen in the town, but what does that all mean...? Does that
mean he's back in search of Okou? (I mean, he could've avoided coming back in
any capacity) Does that mean he's escaping once again from where he settled
after he left? So many questions, and a list of crimes behind his back
apparently, what will conclude of this series?? I tell you, that hashtag is so
booming, I'm the only one using it to vent my frustrations haha<br />

Wow, another show in this new season which amazes me so much I must talk more
about it. Don't ask how I got interested in this, but the only thing I came in
to know that it has jokes. About work. Specifically, about work in a bookstore.
I mean, I had that Anime experience before, and I think I did mention to you
guys about it, and that is Denkigai no Honya-san. Not that I'm drawing parallels
from it, but I can conclude what I saw just from the series introduction for
this series: It's Yojouhan Shinwa Taikai storytelling of Denkigai no Honya-san.
Let me explain why. In this first episode (#HondaSan01) of this half-length
series (yes it's only 10 minutes long excluding theme song), we came to know of
bookstore in Japan in general. And yes, despite the daunting narration off the
bat, the perspective in the story is totally correct about the worldview: people
from all over the world are interested in Japanese books, and some came here
just to get their hands on a couple of them. Don't ask how they would otherwise
understand Japanese in order to read them (and that's why there's licensed
translations of those books), but hey, I guess there are people who will spend a
day reading a book just like me lol. Okay, let's talk about Honda-san. I guess
this is your image-based face-change type of Anime, where real faces aren't
drawn (I mean, look at the customers and tell me why they don't draw some cute
faces for the staff) (*looks at denk!girls*) and everyone looks like they're in
a GTA heist (video game reference btw) lol. Ignoring that completely, Honda-san
seems to be not at hand as a bookstore staff, frantically worrying about how to
serve customers, and do a good job at... at his job. Of course, that's why we
work, right? For interest, but also at interest of the customers, hoping to
serve them the best they can. But of course with all forms of work you know sh*t
is going to hit you the moment you realise what is in front of you, for example,
a list of names on a piece of paper or when someone holds their phone for you to
see typically a manga cover... hey, just another day in the job. That, and I'm
real impressed this show didn't break momentum. Which is why I talked about both
shows in my initial conclusion above. It has all the antics you would know of
running a bookstore (OTs dealing with new books, limited edition stuff which is
literally the whole shelf over there upstairs haha) but told in a faster pace
then expected. And that's not a bad thing. Coming in with some knowledge (not of
BL, but) of how the bookstore runs, this comes a more of a refreshing
perspective of the story, and I'm sure in future episodes the other charcters
will be introduced so we truly know what Honda-san is dealing with in his
workplace that's getting his confidence on check. That, and he should brush up
on his English are those younger voice actors who can speak better English than
him?? Oh he newbie too? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We'll give chance, this show. I laughed. That's
good enough of a passing requirement. That Sunday time slot though... feels like
I'm the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/uke" target="_blank">uke</a>" (look
at definition no.5) having to watch this show lmao<br />

><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hmm I'm immediately here after writing the above
so let me share a bit about my thoughts on buying manga if I was in Japan. How
to say... if I live in Japan, I wouldn't buy books in stock just like that one
hardcore fan who probably got interested in a series so bad he immediately
bought the whole series. Because if it were me I would have those books on my
shelf that are only one or two books of it because I stopped as I didn't like it
enough to buy the next volume on my nearest bookstore. Well, ignoring my sloth
of actually going to buy one, it still is good to have some motivation behind to
want to conitnue reading the story even though the whole series is out. That
desperation will drive one's interest, I believe. Becuase if you bought the
whole stack like that guy and didn't like it after the 2nd volume even though
you read the 1st from your friend... you're going to be wasting a lot of your
own money.<br /><br />I'm done. Cya guys on Sunday. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
