Well, hello everyone.<br /><br />This is not going to be an illusion as I'm
changing the format of this weekly news column once again. Hey, gotta stay fresh
once in a while, yes? This time, it's for visuals instead of interactivity, and
I'm sure you should've noticed that right below. Other than that, I had a
wonderful weekend. My colleagues sure are not though. It's the first weekend
before project deployment so I got a rough week because of that. Sadly, my time
will come and I will have to live through that sh*t too haha okay let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The new episode (#BANANAFISH14) brings us two new theme songs (which I'll talk
  about later), but also escalation and change in direction to the whole
  situation we know of now. Following Arthur's death and arrest for practically
  everyone bearing witness there, we now have Ash in Emergency and hopefully,
  recovery in process. (Yes, I know of the ending, hold on) Many people are
  involved behind the scenes now which will decide Ash's fate and the whole drug
  situation and everything else in between. Remember, Ash taking revenge on
  Golzine and the Banana Fish thing are technically two different things. And
  surprisingly, none of them involve Golzine at this point. Well, he's only
  coming back next week which aligns pretty well with our schedule next episode
  lol, but saying that may only be a consolation. Meanwhile, that Lee youngest
  brother wants to change things around likely with a reverse execution of the
  Banana Fish plan set in place now which he is testing on his own brother for
  some reason, the local Police department are losing out to the FBI which will
  take over Ash's condition in the hospital because Golzine's "friends" knew
  about him and even blatantly gave him an IQ test to take which he aced (lol
  why), and Max may be able to scare the world differently by uncovering the
  Banana Fish incident, to assert (I assume) national or even global pressure on
  the current situation. Unfortunately, at this time, the FBI side kind of won.
  Besides them, Lee probably sent an assassin badly disguised as a nurse to drug
  Ash's IV drip and couldn't do much to Eiji which he bailed and kept in his
  place, and Max's plan has yet to take off. So for now, Ash has been
  transferred (by the FBI) to the Mental Health Institute which spoilers, he was
  pronounced dead. I mean, it'll take more than a local news announcement to
  kill him, that's for sure. But this has its psychological effects, because
  this may make some back off their plans and maybe change them hopefully driven
  by other motives now maybe, and hey Eiji's room has a TV, so he knows of it
  now. This will no doubt set in place a different story to tell probably not as
  what the old man planned when he comes back, and I still can't imagine what he
  has up his sleeve considering his "friends" are technically taking over the
  situation. Well, maybe they're just keeping the dude so they can "await
  further orders", I guess? I hope so. Other than that, I'm not IQ 180 so I
  can't figure out. So if you're like me, stay tuned for next week, and enjoy
  the new theme songs in the meantime, yes? They're quite good tbh

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  And today I learnt that that thing is called a ferret haha. Beat me up however
  you want Misha because I'm not a fan of those things lol. (Okay I am but I'm
  tsundere like her, can?) In the new episode (#UzaMaid02) of this series...
  Tsubame became friends with Misha? It's too good to be true, right? YES,
  you're right. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Another thing you should've figured ouf of this show is
  also that tsundere-ness can be a naturally born trait. Wait, no? Misha is
  though. This show continues to be comforting as more truths are revealed. More
  things are around to explore as we continue on building the relationship
  between that irritating maid and that super cute Russian girl. Hey, we gotta,
  right? Firstly, building that relationship indirectly. I mean, in case you
  don't know accepting that friend request online is vastly different from
  knowing a friend in school/work, Tsubame tries to be friends with Misha from
  the game she is playing. Considering she has no friends and only has Kumagoro
  (which doesn't bite, for the record), this must be easy to befriend her, or so
  the maid thinks. And so, the journey begins. Didn't expect this show to go
  full on Wotakoi-level enactment of online RPG and the characters here, but
  yeah, some girl posing as a weird old dude is fighting alongside a
  military-sniper maid disguised as a supposedly super-rich kid playing a kid
  character lol. It obviously didn't last long though, and as soon as Tsubame
  blurted out the one word, Misha knew it was too good to be true. I mean, I'll
  pretend to like ferrets too if you'll befriend me, Misha. I just... don't play
  online RPGs. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next, is a forced trip into the mountains. As much as I
  would like Tsubame to not keep mentioning about someone's mother (I'm somewhat
  glad it's only once this time round?), this time she ended up talking about
  her own father. But that's for another episode. For Misha, it's a day and a
  half of wonderful food and wildlife cooking, a visit to the zoo and
  scenery-viewing all along the mountainside. Man, you WISHED your mom was that
  good to you haha okay we promised not to touch on that. *touchy touchy* Haha
  all in all, a wonderful episode which continues to add on to the craziness of
  the plot, the reminders of this story about how tsundere the lady is compared
  to how sickening the maid is her affection (not desperate to be honest, only
  desperate to be friends), and how it all ties together to what a kid should be
  experiencing at this time of age. A lot of fun, a good friend (she doesn't
  have any though, so the maid is a good option tbh), and someone to talk to.
  You can see from when she immediately shares her experiences with the father
  that this kid needs someone to talk to. Not joking. Going at this pace I can't
  wait to see more things up Tsubame's sleeve to try to befriend this kid, but
  man please stop showing the pecs or I might just to go the gym someday lol. I
  think I need a maid here but I don't have a super-cute younger sister
  Tsubame-san can you still drop by? I need to pass my fitness test haha

P.S. TIL Tsubame was 28 and Misha has no friends. Okay the latter was so typical
I can't even be surprised lol<br />P.P.S. You know it's going to fail when your
introduction is "I'm a classmate from Misha's class in school" lol at this point
I haven't seen what's ahead yet fyi (Edit: They didn't make it fail immediately
lol)<br />[Well it was originally supposed to be 12 episodes of Kumagoro for
thumbnail, so... I'll do a tribute here every week instead of a GIF HAHA lol
okay maybe not I'll get over the obsession soon]<br />

  WTF DID I JUST SAW I SWEAR I SAW PANTIES okay then again I already feel like
  leaving when they give me that kind of introduction. (Hocchan, I heard you
  there~) (I checked the credits and I saw your name~) Nonetheless, I finished
  watching it. The first and last episode I'll be watching gives less than a
  good summary of the situation. Well, they gave it in half an episode, to be
  honest. Ignoring that super-deterring introduction of
  I-don't-know-why-it's-not-the-sister-dreaming-instead kind of scenario,
  apparently we are met with a guy who cannot write what he imagines. Hey,
  sounds like me already. Unfortunately, unlike me, I don't have a younger
  sister. From here on, I shall compare this show since it's most closely
  related to, you guessed it, "Eromanga-sensei". THREE THINGS THAT ARE SIMILAR
  TO EROMANGA SENSEI!!! (ImoImo01) It features a sibling pair. Not as in in love
  with each other Oreimo style kind, but yeah. Too stereotypical until I want to
  kill myself, and also half the reason I wanted to investigate what this was
  about. (2) It's a harem! Yeah, and I HATE IT. Not being sadist here, but yeah,
  this one is definitely it. If I get a hundred yen every episode they feature a
  female character with this guy, I'll be able to buy their Blu-Ray box by the
  end of it. (3) It's about light novel production. No matter how you look at
  it, even if it's not direct, this is most definitely picking on the recent fad
  that is on the behind the scenes of Anime and/or Light Novel production,
  starting from when the author gets chosen by his/her manuscript. Hey, I got
  bored of that years ago, bro. Not fresh already. And I like how it's even
  burned into the story where the one which won the award talks about brocon
  too. And now, THREE THINGS THAT WILL MAKE ME NOT WATCH THIS SERIES!!! [1]
  Boobs. I mean, I think I did casually mention this every season but never got
  to mention in a one-episode review, but yeah, not real. And what's more, it's
  distracting me (I'm being serious here) (no really, I am) from the plot which
  will not make my impression for the show and the plot in general fair. That's
  what I think now. Which brings me to my second point. [2] Ecchi scenes. They.
  Are. EVERYWHERE. From imagining the sister literally to censor bars even just
  bending over to panty shots (*looks at Nagasarete Airantou*) to putting hand
  in between boobs... you know where this will be going. And these mentioned are
  only from Episode 1. If you have the mood to watch all these feel free, but
  I'm not one of them. Well, not now. I don't think I have been in it tbh. [3]
  THE PLOT. Not that I'm not liking these kinds of stories and that Kondou Reina
  for younger sister is not cute, but the main girl is THE OPPOSITE to what
  anyone wants for a sister, so that's honestly quite a turn-off already. (Not
  that I'm hating it actually, but still also) Because of how it is as you've
  seen in the episode, the sister who won the award wants him to take over the
  role of which his own work lost to. For many reasons than other I would reject
  the offer even if I like her so much I imagine her naked. No really, not
  joking. I'll not live life with any more pride for substituting in someone's
  work as mine. Also, it wouldn't sound correct and even though I know this will
  be a plot line in the near future, I still don't like it. And that, is how you
  reject a series. Yes, my decision is final. I'm not going to watch this
  series. Not even for Kondou Reina. I'm sorry. *does a

P.S. "I was possessed!" Haha yeah you were possessed by an otaku that's for
sure<br />P.P.S. Is there NO ONE in this show that DOES NOT have a rack?? Oh
yah, the sister. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />[Okay, a little snippet to recommend anyone to
watch this show: Kondou Reina (haha), the plot line may be similar but it's
actually a fun one considering if your definition of "fun" is breast rubbing and
nude scenes, and... that's all I can think of so be sure to like it if you think
these are good reasons to watch it haha]<br />

  Okay we may have missed a couple of chapters so let's get back to it! The new
  chapters (129-131) in a nutshell are "Kokonotsu has matured", "Baby Star is
  retiring" and "Hajime-san is useless" haha man. Okay, one at a time. Firstly,
  remember Hotaru-san is back? Well, basically the final episode of Anime season
  2, but this time, it continues. Kokonotsu considers the opinions of the editor
  who judged his work, and Hotaru-chan is back visiting his shop again. Weird,
  isn't it? How everything comes back like that. Which brings us to our next
  point: Has Hotaru done her mission? If all is possible then Yo-san joins
  Shidare Company, Kokonotsu joins her, and Hajime-san can tend the shop... You
  know where this is going. The perfect ending, I must say. Won't happen though,
  I think. Next, is Hotaru-chan thinking of product mascots again. This time,
  with Baby Star Ramen. Yeah, not like we know of, but the kind of made it a big
  deal, so.... AND finally, Hajime-san finds out she is done. Mostly because of
  the father's return and this sudden motivation to tend the shop (lol sun
  rising from the west liao this one), Owari-san may have just met her
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/owari" target="_blank">end</a>. Get it?
  (That was, a Japanese word pun) I would stand by Hotaru-chan though, as she is
  still thinking too much until Yo-san remembers they're not earning money, at
  least. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> but for now Hajime-san, start looking at the newspaper for
  jobs. You're going to be let off REAL soon. Or maybe not considering Yo-san
  likes to neglect his duties he can't hold that motivation for long haha

  I had a lot of fun listening to songs this week, not a lot of exploring though
  but let's talk about them.
  <b

      target="_blank"
      >The Floor's 1st album</a
    ></b
  >
  in a major label was actually quite a listen, but sadly it falls under the
  similar styles category so I can only give based on melody and mood as I
  generally like their happier songs. There are a few of mention though so
  that's good. I also got into

      target="_blank"
      >Polkadot Stingray's latest mini-album</a
    ></b
  >
  so far, and I've given one of the topic songs maybe becuase I think it's rad
  haha that's pretty much it for them I guess.

      target="_blank"
      >Kuraki Mai's new concept mini-album</a
    ></b
  >
  was... weird. To be honest? If this was the concept album I wonder what her
  normal relases are. Becuase compared to Shishido Kavka her concept album was
  full or normal (though electronic) songs but her normal releases were rather
  disappointing. Hey, if

    target="_blank"
    >Mikakoshi likes this woman</a
  >
  I gotta give her another chance. Kuraki Mai, I mean. She's a much-loved
  veteran in the industry, you know. Sadly the album didn't cut it as far as
  uniqueness goes. I'm not digging the traditional songs anyway. I got the Anime
  ending theme already, that's good enough.
</div>
<br />I have no agenda for next week though, so... finally I might just go find
someone else to listen? Sure, or that Twitter or Apple Music Japan remind me
what's next, yes?<br /><br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Talking about Twitter, I've yet to listen to
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://twitter.com/Yogees_band/status/1049675857243992065"

  and

      target="_blank"
      >ORESKABAND</a
    ></b
  >
  who both released new digital singles this week. I mean, Yogee New Waves was
  like, their second since the mini-album and the first wasn't great, and
  ORESKABAND was like... when was the last time I heard of them? So yeah, will
  give them a listen next week I guess. The
  <b>new theme songs from Anime "BANANA FISH"</b> was pretty good, but they are
  still far from release as far as I can tell, so we'll have to wait. Finally, a
  series that I can like the theme songs. Will still miss King Gnu though tbh, I
  haven't even reviewed their single yet. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Also, just a reminder that

    >that Tweet</a
  >
  now haha yeah you bet I remembered that I'll do it for Mocho too lol well with
  the new embed I probably won't have to do this from now
</div>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay, I'm done. I gotta set up for next week
too. Work-time fun, I mean. I probably need to kickstart my #KN10YEARS plan even
if no one gives a f*** about it, and it'll be in due time. (Spoilers: It's next
week!!) Cya guys next time then, and until then... I need more personal time. A
salary is not enough to sacrifice my time to do what I like- Aw man I can't
change to a Google Pixel 2 because of work? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
