CSS magic, baby~<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DagashiKashiS210">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi 2</span>  </div></blockquote>For once, the new episode (#DagashiKashiS210) comes back right at Kokonotsu onhis aspirations, just when my mom hits me when I want to get work lol. Anyways,the story. Shikada Dagashi gets delivery services, and unexpectedly, it's thatpiece of cr*p of a dad who is still in hospital who supposedly did not call forthe delivery. Right back at the son who actually complains about hishospitalisation, he asked whether the son has been continuing on his mangadrawing, considering he's so enthusiastic in running the shop. Funny I alreadynoticed that the moment he was talking to himself last episode on the Internetstuff, but yeah, he's just busy. That's what happens, "Dad", when someone elsedoesn't want to seriously take care of the shop. Man, and that's not worse offthan Hotaru-chan who just left him. How sad can Kokonotsu get? Well with friendswho can barely help him, and a deadline to target so that he can get a chance atbeing a real manga author... Makes you wonder what will happen next. For once,we're going to see progression. And what more of a progression is there otherthan seeing a familiar figure that stands out so much, you thought it'sHajime-san lol I meant the huge rack haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P6Crz0-MdRk/Wq3K5QUCBoI/AAAAAAAAlzc/z24FvrMRDVsDBrJRhWNg5O0r9QxbEP3mwCLcBGAs/s320/dagashikashi_S2_10_hospital.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        How did that toe become a leg injury?

No really, can Ijust show him porn and wake him up now?? lol Okay the episode. The two decide tocompare heights, and what's the best way to do it? Without using a wall even ifthere are plenty around? Things we only do with our siblings (you guys don't?),these guys are doing it. Can't help but make the class think that they are goingout, huh. On the other side, we have the wonderful trio who somehow didn'tmanage to solve Yukari-chan's problem of "finding someone to flirt with" lol mancan we just ignore the sh*t out of that idiot and get to this already? (I DEMANDA SEASON TWO haha) On the other hand, Nishikata is now worse than machinelearning, failing to understand human tricks and constantly falling into them,even obviously given a way out. (Then again, not everyone knows how to twist aquestion in one's favour) So yeah, for the lead up to his plan two ask a "wouldyou rather" question is tricky for him to say the least, but to get himimmediately just by the options he came up with... Takagi-san is not just smart,Nishikata is just dumb. Let's take a while (it's been some time) to talk aboutthe questions and how (I) people would normally answer them, without theembarrassment. (All questions assume we're against Takagi-san, but not asNishikata)<br /><br /><ul>  <li>    "Tasty drink with fever VS disgusting drink" - We'll take the disgusting    one, but throw it away. Simple. And the tasty one if I'm against Takagi-san.    Then again, she won't ask such a question  </li>  <li>    "No allowance VS No teasing" - This one has its problems since Takagi-san    didn't answer the "for life" part, and I don't want to assume her family is    rich... I don't tease people anyway. Do you guys do it? As a hobby? lol  </li>  <li>    "She disappears VS Get teased by her forever" Can we change the latter    option to be "be with her forever" because I'll take that any time of the    day haha also you cannot choose the former option because the Director says    so lol  </li>  <li>    "Zero scores for life VS Kissing" I don't kiss schoolgirls <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also,    life is not all about tests to be honest; Nishikata needs to be woke about    that. So much to sacrifice just to kiss? She didn't even say kiss where?    Ever seen kissing on the back of the hand before?  </li></ul><div>  I'll count the last one void since it's incomplete and I can't do handstands  either haha #DamnYouTakagiSan you got me</div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UycZbMFm5Ys/Wq3UYpGNo4I/AAAAAAAAlzs/Jim00X3SRaYy6c4ZKlST3no6Jiiyq0hGACLcBGAs/s320/takagisan10_backs.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Seriously I'm totally enjoying this haha #DamnYouNishikataSan          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9AQwiChTbZs/Wq3UcznDJSI/AAAAAAAAlzw/_RG4Q96gbJ8YPtdZc1UjvXiv_BmWhP4pACLcBGAs/s320/takagisan10_invitation.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            And I hope these guys have woken him up about being with            Takagi-san.<br />Well clearly, he hasn't.

You bet it's all the push-ups haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> BTW is  the "just fit" thing in the manga? Anyone can confirm that for me? lol</div>P.P.S. Hey I must say, the last questions in this episode perfectly summarisesNishikata's feelings for Takagi-san. But seriously, when we getting the episodewhere Nishikata watches porn? No? Not even using his phone? Haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="3Lion41">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Sangatsu no Lion</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Well, this is good enough." And then his inner thoughts haha the old geezer    can't stand her grandkids taste in food lol  </div></blockquote>Let me get this out of my gut first before we don't talk about the old man:being him sucks to see generations of women before and after him help him out inthe shop. There, I said it. The new episode (#3Lion41) has plenty to talk about,so let's get the best parts out of the way first. The festival. Aside from theabove stuff I've mentioned, I'm actually impressed personally but Hina-chan'senthusiasm, maybe because she's relieved off that burden of a classmate inschool which we'll talk about in a while, but yeah, it's doing good for thefamily. Hey, even Kiriyama came in to help too, so that's good news. Also, wegot some more insight into the life of the traumatised classmate Chiho. Onceagain, I'll never understand this because I don't have this weak of a heart forsociety to think I'm good to bully (I'm male too so that sucks haha), but atleast I know one thing: That living in a world of care and concern will helpremove that past. But of course, as the story has mentioned, it comes back tohit her once in a while. Well, time's the best medicine but the problem is itslong. So, I guess it'll be some time before she can put that away. On the otherhand, the school hasn't let their hands of the mastermind that is Takagi (notthat other show that one is cute haha) but the head teacher just decided to wrapit up, I guess. Not wrong from his perspective, but it's hard to explain life toa kid. Try doing that yourself. You'll end up just dictating your lifeexperience and totally forgetting that your life is just one but many who haveexperienced otherwise. Hey, if the parents/surroundings make who you are andthey are bad, don't be like them. Oh well, she doesn't have to hear this anyway.We may be in for more positive stuff next episode (I LOVE the festival part btwtotally cute and lovely) as the season draws to an end, and I haven't decided onwhich theme song to give. Ugh, my head hurts as bad as Chiho lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WE8pYUjrP6E/Wq3dI4I4jaI/AAAAAAAAl0A/tZpYbqnvL5MbT434h8XDgsDiFtwebt0MgCLcBGAs/s320/sangatsunolion41_momo1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            And since I can't resist seeing Momo-chan again, here's a couple of            her reactions.<br />This one is her after eating something            awesome...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xyCpx1aJY0Q/Wq3dKF0w3hI/AAAAAAAAl0E/YcIx7XNz7GUpHR7224ON2wFJPpL5fLZQgCLcBGAs/s320/sangatsunolion41_momo2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ...

"Anime magic", we call it haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SlowStart11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Slow Start</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "(We're) going to invade!" Man, Kamuri-chan with all the puns lol  </div></blockquote>Just a good reminder that it's summer and not Thanksgiving (which happens aroundNovember), the new episode (#SlowStart11) is about - you guessed it - the summerfestival. Screw holiday assignments because we're going to have a blast! Andyeah, you bet Kamuri-chan can eat. Also, that boysih accent. Also also, thepuns. Didn't notice half the jokes came from her instead of the livelyTama-chan, who can't help but be spoiled of her opinions of her friends thanksto her two elders lol. To liven things up, we add on more of the regular (andeven irregular) cast so that we can gather everyone around for... a summary?Yep, as much as Tama-chan said it's starting, it's about to end for us. Sorry,guys. Not spoilers already at this point lol. Anyways, the episode. Highlightsinclude (I will always mention the niche stuff, just so you know) theinteraction between the teacher and Eiko, Hannen showing herself off from themoment she was suggested to go to the festival by Shion ("camouflage" lol) toher revealing yukata (hehe), Sachi's seriously sadistic replies to Tama-chan whokindly fixed her sandal, and the end card. You suck if you didn't notice thevoice actresses' lovely drawings of their own characters. All in all, wonderfulepisode - or if I'm underestimating it - an awesome episode to show the wondersof slice-of-life Anime, and all in all we may have to end it on an emotionalnote?? Hey, I wonder. Hana-chan, are you going to say it? Are you?? We shall seeit ourselves next week.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7qtUfqqBblc/Wq3mKw8mJUI/AAAAAAAAl0U/ht6LJiUXw1gM4uuuVD5jZs9tzvF3F9tZwCLcBGAs/s320/slowstart11_tomato.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            My best laugh this episode is...

I may be biased here btw]<br />[Edit:Okay the banging on the screen one wasn't good so I chose another one lol youmay have noticed an animated thumbnail above (it's tap and hold on mobile, andclick and hold on desktop)]<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VTF8vEuVKbU/Wq3p_V0a5kI/AAAAAAAAl0o/11F30chMijANQ9rPgfjVUUVWT-9SubshQCLcBGAs/s1600/slowstart11_jumping.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        This is also me when my holidays arrive lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Nagasarete Airantou</span>  </div></blockquote>Our biggest hint this new chapter (157) is that a human also is counted into thelist of beings with "Eye of Kairyuu-sama". The end. Okay, just joking. Let'scontinue where we left off. Story is that Machi (the shrine maiden from the Westof the island, the older one) is interested in special beings and how they tieto Kairyuu-sama. Well now that we know of her hidden intentions of noticing sheis being spied on (lol), there is also little myth about this being untrue, asthe Priestess of the island has also revealed the one human who is also underthis category. This chapter also clarifies why certain beings are outside of theequation, especially the tiger (Lord of the North) and the cat (Lord of theWest, also Suzu-chan's sensei) because they were both apprentices of the oldgrandma in the village. Yeah, that old-woman-turned-kid-youkai was also amartial art practitioner. Other than that, we now only have one mystery left tosolve, and what has that got to do with the recent events that have happenedconcerned the Lord of the island? Hmm, things are getting interesting all of asudden...<br />P.S. Most of the images are either too many text or just panties.So I opted for neither. I spoiled most of the stuff here already so if you wantpanties so read it yourself haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>As I'm writing this I'm still thinking whether to give RUANN's first major songfrom the start of the year. As of now, maybe not. Which means I'll be giving theother theme song, I guess.<br /><br />Talking about that,<b>UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's new single</b> sounded disappointing to be honest, butthen again their style in composition and music flows in the single, and I can'tsay I hate it, but I'll give it critical review as a conclusion to this...reluctance ever since I heard this in the Anime.<b>Yogee New Waves' new EP&nbsp;</b>is probably the best of the releases whichcame out this week, and I must say it's mostly because I've gotten used to theirstyle maybe. <b>TrySail's new single</b> is on the shelf already,<a  href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/974117633908924416"  target="_blank"  >just in case you didn't know</a>. I've yet given a listen to FLOWER FLOWER's new album (as a closure to theirpresence in Klassic Note tbh I'm not liking yui's new style), and I've given alisten to <b>Anime "Slow Start" Charatcer Song Album</b>, and... thanks to theone guy who was producer to the album, I literally picked the most familiarstyle which is reminiscent to Hanazawa Kana's albums (does "<a  href="https://twitter.com/roundkitagawa"  target="_blank"  >Kitagawa</a>" ring a bell?), so yeah, Eiko-chan's character song. But seriously, me givingAnime over mainstream even if it has been some time since my last Anisonreview... my brain is broken somehow lol. <b>Roys </b>(the girls I've given theAnime ending theme song but gave up watching the show on) released a new digitalsingle yet again for another show, and I don't think it's bad but man, where'sthe formal release? Okay never mind I haven't made my mind yet on that one<br /><br />Onnew news, <b>SID is releasing a new Anime best album</b> which - you might haveguessed it - has most of the songs I've listened to over the years. Two songsare stopping me from buying that album off the shelf right now, and one of themis a self-cover of their own composition written for LiSA (if you found themusic video I tweeted familiar) so yeah, still mulling over that one.Technically it's their song, which sounds familiar to a situation I have to dealwith when YUI (the one in 2010) released her self-cover of STEREOPONY's... 3rdsingle, yeah, topic song "I do it". Hmm, I'll probably give it I guess it's ashort song anyway, the SID one. I've also not gotten my hands on<b>Ryokuoshoku Shakai and their 1st full album</b> (from here on it'll be"Ryokushaka") as mentioned last week, and damn, I really want to give themchance. On other news, <b>Kalafina is broken</b>. Like, literally. As summarisedperfectly in the Tweet below, we have little to anticipate once the next release(in Fall apparently) gets around after the shuffling:<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">  <div dir="ltr" lang="en">    You know that the moment they remove Kajiura-sensei (the only composer) from    the group, Kalafina has officially ended.<br /><br />Oh well. Company stuff,    I guess.<br /><br />FictionJunction still around? lol  </div>  â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote)  <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/973832157138472960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank"    >March 14, 2018</a  ></blockquote><script  async=""  charset="utf-8"  src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br /><br /><br />This is it, I guess. It's kind of late and I could use somesleep after a day of productive work... done from home. Man, I can't do work athome the distractions are too many. Maybe getting a government job is better.Without Internet and limited mobile data (if I make it happen) I'll be morefocused on the job. Yeah, my mom is nagging on me finding a job already. To behonest? If you don't have the skill set can you go brag about having them? Ican't, and I'm not a confident person by nature, so yeah, job hunting will belater, I suppose. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully by then I can finishthat project of a project (there's two active and I cleared one just now)("cleared" as in "I did my part liao dear partner it's up to you to do the rest"lol) someday within the next two weeks. And I'll update when I get to reviewTrySail next week with the revival of my phone, the dear Nexus 5X. Yeah,currently living with my Nexus 5 which, with the terrible battery life, stilldoesn't have that infamous LG bootloop problem till date. Hey, I hope HTCdoesn't have this problem with Pixel phones. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤ž">*fingers crossed*</span> Haha okay bye<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
