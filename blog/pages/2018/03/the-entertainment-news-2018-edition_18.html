Well with the recent marketing campaign (lol) on Reddit (I just posted one with
the link to here), I think for the benefit of those who come here to stop
talking about my affairs.<br /><br />I mean, come on, Anime is WAAAAY more
interesting than my project life haha<br /><br />Talking about projects, I hope
you guys noticed last week on the click/tap and hold thumbnails I slotted into
the Takagi-san thumbnail not as a Halloween surprise, but in case you missed it
go give it a try. CSS magic, baby~<br /><br /><br /><br />

For once, the new episode (#DagashiKashiS210) comes back right at Kokonotsu on
his aspirations, just when my mom hits me when I want to get work lol. Anyways,
the story. Shikada Dagashi gets delivery services, and unexpectedly, it's that
piece of cr*p of a dad who is still in hospital who supposedly did not call for
the delivery. Right back at the son who actually complains about his
hospitalisation, he asked whether the son has been continuing on his manga
drawing, considering he's so enthusiastic in running the shop. Funny I already
noticed that the moment he was talking to himself last episode on the Internet
stuff, but yeah, he's just busy. That's what happens, "Dad", when someone else
doesn't want to seriously take care of the shop. Man, and that's not worse off
than Hotaru-chan who just left him. How sad can Kokonotsu get? Well with friends
who can barely help him, and a deadline to target so that he can get a chance at
being a real manga author... Makes you wonder what will happen next. For once,
we're going to see progression. And what more of a progression is there other
than seeing a familiar figure that stands out so much, you thought it's
Hajime-san lol I meant the huge rack haha<br />

Technically Takagi-san, if you're in my face that's another way of cheating lol.
In the new episode where Nishikata hasn't got rid of his 'acute embarrassment
syndrome' as I would like to call it (#TakagiSan10), the easy solution to not
getting pranked by the girl is just to not get embarrassed. No really, can I
just show him porn and wake him up now?? lol Okay the episode. The two decide to
compare heights, and what's the best way to do it? Without using a wall even if
there are plenty around? Things we only do with our siblings (you guys don't?),
these guys are doing it. Can't help but make the class think that they are going
out, huh. On the other side, we have the wonderful trio who somehow didn't
manage to solve Yukari-chan's problem of "finding someone to flirt with" lol man
can we just ignore the sh*t out of that idiot and get to this already? (I DEMAND
A SEASON TWO haha) On the other hand, Nishikata is now worse than machine
learning, failing to understand human tricks and constantly falling into them,
even obviously given a way out. (Then again, not everyone knows how to twist a
question in one's favour) So yeah, for the lead up to his plan two ask a "would
you rather" question is tricky for him to say the least, but to get him
immediately just by the options he came up with... Takagi-san is not just smart,
Nishikata is just dumb. Let's take a while (it's been some time) to talk about
the questions and how (I) people would normally answer them, without the
embarrassment. (All questions assume we're against Takagi-san, but not as
Nishikata)<br /><br />
<ul>
  <li>
    "Tasty drink with fever VS disgusting drink" - We'll take the disgusting
    one, but throw it away. Simple. And the tasty one if I'm against Takagi-san.
    Then again, she won't ask such a question
  </li>
  <li>
    "No allowance VS No teasing" - This one has its problems since Takagi-san
    didn't answer the "for life" part, and I don't want to assume her family is
    rich... I don't tease people anyway. Do you guys do it? As a hobby? lol
  </li>
  <li>
    "She disappears VS Get teased by her forever" Can we change the latter
    option to be "be with her forever" because I'll take that any time of the
    day haha also you cannot choose the former option because the Director says
    so lol
  </li>
  <li>
    "Zero scores for life VS Kissing" I don't kiss schoolgirls <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also,
    life is not all about tests to be honest; Nishikata needs to be woke about
    that. So much to sacrifice just to kiss? She didn't even say kiss where?
    Ever seen kissing on the back of the hand before?
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
  I'll count the last one void since it's incomplete and I can't do handstands
  either haha #DamnYouTakagiSan you got me

where Nishikata watches porn? No? Not even using his phone? Haha<br /><br />

</blockquote>
Let me get this out of my gut first before we don't talk about the old man:
being him sucks to see generations of women before and after him help him out in
the shop. There, I said it. The new episode (#3Lion41) has plenty to talk about,
so let's get the best parts out of the way first. The festival. Aside from the
above stuff I've mentioned, I'm actually impressed personally but Hina-chan's
enthusiasm, maybe because she's relieved off that burden of a classmate in
school which we'll talk about in a while, but yeah, it's doing good for the
family. Hey, even Kiriyama came in to help too, so that's good news. Also, we
got some more insight into the life of the traumatised classmate Chiho. Once
again, I'll never understand this because I don't have this weak of a heart for
society to think I'm good to bully (I'm male too so that sucks haha), but at
least I know one thing: That living in a world of care and concern will help
remove that past. But of course, as the story has mentioned, it comes back to
hit her once in a while. Well, time's the best medicine but the problem is its
long. So, I guess it'll be some time before she can put that away. On the other
hand, the school hasn't let their hands of the mastermind that is Takagi (not
that other show that one is cute haha) but the head teacher just decided to wrap
it up, I guess. Not wrong from his perspective, but it's hard to explain life to
a kid. Try doing that yourself. You'll end up just dictating your life
experience and totally forgetting that your life is just one but many who have
experienced otherwise. Hey, if the parents/surroundings make who you are and
they are bad, don't be like them. Oh well, she doesn't have to hear this anyway.
We may be in for more positive stuff next episode (I LOVE the festival part btw
totally cute and lovely) as the season draws to an end, and I haven't decided on
which theme song to give. Ugh, my head hurts as bad as Chiho lol<br />

Just a good reminder that it's summer and not Thanksgiving (which happens around
November), the new episode (#SlowStart11) is about - you guessed it - the summer
festival. Screw holiday assignments because we're going to have a blast! And
yeah, you bet Kamuri-chan can eat. Also, that boysih accent. Also also, the
puns. Didn't notice half the jokes came from her instead of the lively
Tama-chan, who can't help but be spoiled of her opinions of her friends thanks
to her two elders lol. To liven things up, we add on more of the regular (and
even irregular) cast so that we can gather everyone around for... a summary?
Yep, as much as Tama-chan said it's starting, it's about to end for us. Sorry,
guys. Not spoilers already at this point lol. Anyways, the episode. Highlights
include (I will always mention the niche stuff, just so you know) the
interaction between the teacher and Eiko, Hannen showing herself off from the
moment she was suggested to go to the festival by Shion ("camouflage" lol) to
her revealing yukata (hehe), Sachi's seriously sadistic replies to Tama-chan who
kindly fixed her sandal, and the end card. You suck if you didn't notice the
voice actresses' lovely drawings of their own characters. All in all, wonderful
episode - or if I'm underestimating it - an awesome episode to show the wonders
of slice-of-life Anime, and all in all we may have to end it on an emotional
note?? Hey, I wonder. Hana-chan, are you going to say it? Are you?? We shall see
it ourselves next week.<br />

pun because I know they are going to
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/wafuu" target="_blank"
  >a traditional Japanese abode</a
>
haha also if you need help deciphering what Tama-chan wished for in the summer
festival...<br />P.P.S. YESH MARINKA IS THE BEST haha no really so obvious she
wants the Eiko hug to the furthest sandal shop possible lol<br />[OMAKE!!! TWO
GIFS BECAUSE I LIKE TAMA-CHAN SOOOOOOO MUCH!! I may be biased here btw]<br />[Edit:
Okay the banging on the screen one wasn't good so I chose another one lol you
may have noticed an animated thumbnail above (it's tap and hold on mobile, and
click and hold on desktop)]<br />

Our biggest hint this new chapter (157) is that a human also is counted into the
list of beings with "Eye of Kairyuu-sama". The end. Okay, just joking. Let's
continue where we left off. Story is that Machi (the shrine maiden from the West
of the island, the older one) is interested in special beings and how they tie
to Kairyuu-sama. Well now that we know of her hidden intentions of noticing she
is being spied on (lol), there is also little myth about this being untrue, as
the Priestess of the island has also revealed the one human who is also under
this category. This chapter also clarifies why certain beings are outside of the
equation, especially the tiger (Lord of the North) and the cat (Lord of the
West, also Suzu-chan's sensei) because they were both apprentices of the old
grandma in the village. Yeah, that old-woman-turned-kid-youkai was also a
martial art practitioner. Other than that, we now only have one mystery left to
solve, and what has that got to do with the recent events that have happened
concerned the Lord of the island? Hmm, things are getting interesting all of a
sudden...<br />P.S. Most of the images are either too many text or just panties.
So I opted for neither. I spoiled most of the stuff here already so if you want
panties so read it yourself haha<br /><br /><br /><br />

As I'm writing this I'm still thinking whether to give RUANN's first major song
from the start of the year. As of now, maybe not. Which means I'll be giving the
other theme song, I guess.<br /><br />Talking about that,
<b>UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's new single</b> sounded disappointing to be honest, but
then again their style in composition and music flows in the single, and I can't
say I hate it, but I'll give it critical review as a conclusion to this...
reluctance ever since I heard this in the Anime.
<b>Yogee New Waves' new EP&nbsp;</b>is probably the best of the releases which
came out this week, and I must say it's mostly because I've gotten used to their
style maybe. <b>TrySail's new single</b> is on the shelf already,
<a
  href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/974117633908924416"
  target="_blank"
  >just in case you didn't know</a
>. I've yet given a listen to FLOWER FLOWER's new album (as a closure to their
presence in Klassic Note tbh I'm not liking yui's new style), and I've given a
listen to <b>Anime "Slow Start" Charatcer Song Album</b>, and... thanks to the
one guy who was producer to the album, I literally picked the most familiar
style which is reminiscent to Hanazawa Kana's albums (does "<a
  href="https://twitter.com/roundkitagawa"
  target="_blank"
  >Kitagawa</a
>" ring a bell?), so yeah, Eiko-chan's character song. But seriously, me giving
Anime over mainstream even if it has been some time since my last Anison
review... my brain is broken somehow lol. <b>Roys </b>(the girls I've given the
Anime ending theme song but gave up watching the show on) released a new digital
single yet again for another show, and I don't think it's bad but man, where's
the formal release? Okay never mind I haven't made my mind yet on that one<br /><br />On
new news, <b>SID is releasing a new Anime best album</b> which - you might have
guessed it - has most of the songs I've listened to over the years. Two songs
are stopping me from buying that album off the shelf right now, and one of them
is a self-cover of their own composition written for LiSA (if you found the
music video I tweeted familiar) so yeah, still mulling over that one.
Technically it's their song, which sounds familiar to a situation I have to deal
with when YUI (the one in 2010) released her self-cover of STEREOPONY's... 3rd
single, yeah, topic song "I do it". Hmm, I'll probably give it I guess it's a
short song anyway, the SID one. I've also not gotten my hands on
<b>Ryokuoshoku Shakai and their 1st full album</b> (from here on it'll be
"Ryokushaka") as mentioned last week, and damn, I really want to give them
chance. On other news, <b>Kalafina is broken</b>. Like, literally. As summarised
perfectly in the Tweet below, we have little to anticipate once the next release
(in Fall apparently) gets around after the shuffling:<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">
  <div dir="ltr" lang="en">
    You know that the moment they remove Kajiura-sensei (the only composer) from
    the group, Kalafina has officially ended.<br /><br />Oh well. Company stuff,
    I guess.<br /><br />FictionJunction still around? lol

<br /><br /><br />This is it, I guess. It's kind of late and I could use some
sleep after a day of productive work... done from home. Man, I can't do work at
home the distractions are too many. Maybe getting a government job is better.
Without Internet and limited mobile data (if I make it happen) I'll be more
focused on the job. Yeah, my mom is nagging on me finding a job already. To be
honest? If you don't have the skill set can you go brag about having them? I
can't, and I'm not a confident person by nature, so yeah, job hunting will be
later, I suppose. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully by then I can finish
that project of a project (there's two active and I cleared one just now)
("cleared" as in "I did my part liao dear partner it's up to you to do the rest"
lol) someday within the next two weeks. And I'll update when I get to review
TrySail next week with the revival of my phone, the dear Nexus 5X. Yeah,
currently living with my Nexus 5 which, with the terrible battery life, still
doesn't have that infamous LG bootloop problem till date. Hey, I hope HTC
doesn't have this problem with Pixel phones. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤ž">*fingers crossed*</span> Haha okay bye
