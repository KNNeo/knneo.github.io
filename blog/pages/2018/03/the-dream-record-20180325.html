This one is way too cool to not talk about it, so let's do it. Recent context include a read on the latest Anime for the next season, and probably a couple of action shows got me somehow. Then again this is some martial arts action so it doesn't matter haha<br /><br />Let's get to it. Since this is the first time I'm doing it on my PC instead of my phone (where most of my night dreams I remember come from), I'll stylise this a bit so it looks like a recollection. Again, I just had dinner so I don't remember much so... don't expect too much lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"A dozen people (friendly team, from now on) in torn out clothes rush to a small underground car park. Running down from an entrance, they pass the open fare gate into the middle of the park which is the size of a small building lobby. The leader with a tall build starts looking around him only to notice the rival team which is dozens in number is closely behind them. As the friendly team try to run out of another one of the available exits, he heard a distinct voice echo through the chamber. "You think you can still get out of here?" Underlings from the rival team start populating the car park through the multiple exits, slowly caving into the friendly team.&nbsp;</i></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>With nowhere to go and the rival team closing in as close as to within hand's reach, the leader did a hand gesture and suddenly everyone got thrown back. Emerging is a overpowered leader much more muscular than its usual self, as if he was a mutated superhero. The rival team start charging at him and immediately gets beat down. The friendly team quickly take action and attack the rival team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Minutes later, the leader exhausted his powers, leaving most of the rival team lying on the ground. He shouts to one of the exits. "Get him out!" The rival team leader emerges from the smoke that engulfs the underlings and himself, revealing his naked muscular chest, and an exhausted pant. He walks confidently yet slowly into the middle, with his face shown in anger. "I know you wouldn't die that easily." The friendly team leader takes out what looks like a vape pen, and takes a smoke. As he stays alone in the car park smoking as the fumes cover the whole chamber, the rest of the friendly team can be seen walking out of the underground into the streets.&nbsp;</i></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"It was a scared spell. His master only gains the power of the Lord for only a moment, and is taxing on his physique. You might have remembered the last time he came back ridden with scars and had to take three months to recover. The smoke is to trigger the poison from his attacks just in case his opponents didn't die. For us the attacks wouldn't harm us, but if you're underground, that's a different story." "But lady boss, why did you-" The underling was quickly interrupted. "Sshh. Only he is allowed to exhibit his power. That's the house rule. Even though he broke it once when we were outside the island in order to save a certain someone."&nbsp;</i></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>A few minutes and a flashback of the icy mountains later, the friendly team walk in to recover their leader's body."</i></blockquote><br />Yeah, all this, is in Cantonese. Yep, it's&nbsp; Hong Kong setting. I mean, if this kind of scenery didn't remind you of any of those action shows, nothing will. Also, I'm not a Cantonese speaker, so you can imagine how terrible the dubbing was in the dream. No, I'm serious. The smoking part reminds me of the look of BLEACH's only zanpakuto creator Namaiya, where the steam is represented here as poison and tobacco. After that, I don't really remember. I don't recall watching anything martial arts recently other than BLEACH, and I don't think you can call that fighting, so whatever haha. Okay, gotta finish my dinner now. (Audience: Wait, you haven't-) Cya guys later tonight haha<hr><h4>#The Dreams</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
