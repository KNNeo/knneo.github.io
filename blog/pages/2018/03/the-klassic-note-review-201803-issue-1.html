I wanted to do this <strike>ASAP</strike> as early as I can (I'm NOT using that abbreviation EVER), and I don't want to really do this on a holiday (have a Good Friday everyone), so here we are. <strike>I've got less than half an hour to do this so let's do it. And no, I'm not rushing for my report. That's already submitted this morning. Well you know, DST screwing up with YouTube viewing times. Goes to show how stupid an arbitrary use of time can be on top of an arbitrary use of time already. Talking about you, GMT. Okay, let's move on.</strike> Okay I just realised I've got another hour. Past self telling me to do this early. See, past self takes care of future self. Sorry, England. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br />Today we're starting off the new year of Klassic Note Reviews, and if you have been on Twitter you know who's appearing first. Yes, the MusicRay'n girls are back. Not that group who just went on a hiatus. The other one.<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />TrySail - WANTED GIRL [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/14/25/VVCL-1188.jpg?v=3" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/14/19/VVCL-1190.jpg?v=3" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/14/20/VVCL-1191.jpg?v=3" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Anime Limited Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Ignoring the Anime cover art, feels and looks like they're doing a spy movie parody, and it looks pretty good. Gotta love that Nan-chan butt lol)<br /><br />Origin: I feel like I shouldn't do much of an introduction since I've not failed to review <a href="../../2015/05/the-klassic-note-review-201505-issue-1.html" >every</a> <a href="../../2015/08/the-klassic-note-review-201508-issue-1.html" >single</a> <a href="../../2016/05/the-klassic-note-review-201605-issue-2.html" >one</a> <a href="../../2016/06/the-klassic-note-review-201606-issue-1.html" >of</a> <a href="../../2017/06/the-klassic-note-review-201706-issue-1.html" >their</a> <a href="../../2017/07/the-klassic-note-review-201707-issue-3.html" >singles</a> till date including this, but hey, you should know them by now. They sing in all the latest Anime you (might) watch, and recently they announced another single which will be out in June (I probably will be reviewing it too if all goes as well as this one), they cute, they sing well... you get the idea. If the likes of Amamiya Sora (Limited Edition cover, in blue), Asakura Momo (in red) and Natsukawa Shiina (in yellow) can't cater to any of your idolism tastes, then I'm sorry. Otherwise you'll be glad to know this voice actress-led idol group has been doing well, and as of now on their journey to their 3rd album. This time, they sing for a... I would say, "show targeted at younger kids" mainly because I don't watch it (lol and I watched PriPri Chii-chan) (for three seasons straight) but hey, it doesn't stop them from having a good song. And this single may just prove that. Something I couldn't miss out, as usual.<br /><br />(1) WANTED GIRL<br />This feels like some dangerous song, something exciting, something lively... and that's what the song gives in terms of the mood. And yes, I'm hooked into it the moment I hear it. The rest of the song kind of falls in well so I won't complain, the lyrics can be quite a mouthful (it's been two week and I still can't sing to the words) (and I can be considered a pro already), but other than those this song is surprisingly good, and I'm liking it. This is the kind of song you'll like the more you listen to it, and honestly I may be hooked. Still better than being tied up, if you did watch the music video haha poor Mocho<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Sanpomichi [Trail]<br />As usual, this is the deal breaker. But I won't say it is so, because my reason for it is "I just don't want to give this song in the future", and I think you may recall my experience with this two times already with three singles, so yeah, I'm future-proofing Klassic Note as you can see here. Then again, this three-beat tempo isn't bad on the ears, it feels very nostalgic to their earlier B-side songs which are pretty easy-listening so I decided to give it. The usual rant can come from a kind of unnatural bridge part of the song but that's okay I gave it anyway. I just feel more glued to the melody and the overall feel of the tempo. I mean, you don't get three-beat tempo songs every time, even though when they appear they usually are good. (<span class="emoji" title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> Kalafina) ("Not anymore they aren't" <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/973832157138472960" target="_blank">Ouch</a>) So yeah, I felt a beat when I hear these kinds of songs, and for TrySail at least it's hitting on me, and I like that.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: Not a bad single, and probably still close to one of their best, may be overwhelmed by the B-side, but the topic song is also good since the credit probably (this is an Anime thing now) gives more freedom to the composition of the song, so yeah we get a good single. Would not really recommend you to listen to it if you didn't like their single B-side styles, but yeah, this single is pretty easy to give even at first listen.<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br />(Again, sorry for the tone of informality in the review. This is what happens when you finish writing a 48-page report with a formal tone. <span class="emoji" title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span>)<br /><br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />And the best part. You want pictures, don't you? I mean, their newly established LINE accounts probably will have more images than my blog will ever have- Oh they can't post their stuff there besides event comments? Okay then here it is:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="1185" data-original-width="1600" height="236" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Lrm6AUN_LJk/WrzZ76oNfeI/AAAAAAAAmLg/XPJUbRNf9boNjhDhzCzXyGiSs415RSa4QCKgBGAs/s320/IMG_20180329_192159.jpg" width="320" /></div>Seriously, I totally expected full on Bond movie silliness when I saw the initial music video preview and the cover art but... yeah maybe they didn't take it that far. Though I would say <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/976099335522807808" target="_blank">the music video is a joy to watch</a> haha I know I didn't buy Limited Edition I don't have to to watch it anyways hehe<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="1185" data-original-width="1600" height="236" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1J48mTGyqiU/WrzaBUXxt1I/AAAAAAAAmLk/23fxHtFAArgjH8ZpxB0p7x0m_o1vPoUFACKgBGAs/s320/IMG_20180329_192317.jpg" width="320" /></div>Opening inside, instead of the usual three part folding of the jacket, it's... three different scenes? Sure, you do you, SACRA MUSIC. After that, not much to mention actually, what I saw is what you'll get. (Oh you can't see what's behind? Pay them money, idiots.)<br /><br />Now for the fun part, the <b>special gift</b>. You guys should know I have quite a history of choosing the one thing that'll make ordering the single (yep it's not only the B-side I lied in the review I'm sorry) much MUCH more worth the current value, and this is no exception. So here's a good summary of what I find and prioritise in finding one, which is typically a "bromide" ie. a photo of the group but it can be anything.<br /><ol><li>Close-ups: I won't explain why here but THERE IS NONE. Yeah, #disappointment right at the start. But it's not abnormal since it's a group photo it's less likely to be close ups too. Although I would beg to differ because the "adrenaline!!!" single wasn't like this</li><li>Watermark removal: I'm not a Photoshop expert or will I ever even though I study signal processing (the engineers which give you Photoshop in one click), but yeah if the store/"not for sale" watermark is not behind a solid background then... that one is out. If all are like that then it'll bring me to the next criteria...</li><li>Phone presentation as wallpaper: You guys may know I love to put the girl(s) I like as my phone wallpaper, and yes even though three girls will be a squeeze (man do I want to squeeze any of them haha what) I still want to fit them in, this means size criteria will be considered so things like watermark better not be in the way (sometimes they will), if it's a group photo they better stand close to each other</li><li>Availability: Animate Online Shop has its stock go down quickly and so will my chances of getting one for myself especially AFTER release date; I have access to all the stores besides Sofmap, Shiseido typically is in short of stock so that'll have to go, and unless all has been taken then I'll smile at Sony Music Japan Shop to beg them to give me one haha</li><li>Topic: Typically if it's a solo artist you'll see (especially when I start saying "MusicRay'n") them in multiple outfits, so yeah, whichever looks better. Since the topic here is only one which is them in black and white I don't have to choose. Good.</li></ol><div>So yeah, considering all of the above (my brain neurons are weird) then it'll leave me with (technically) <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://trysail.jp/s3/skiyaki/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/148873/content_%E3%81%A8%E3%82%89%E3%81%AE%E3%81%82%E3%81%AA.jpg" />Toranoana</abbr> and <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://trysail.jp/s3/skiyaki/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/148872/content_%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89.jpg" />Tower Records</abbr> (yes, the watermarks on a gradient floor was one, and WTF is HMV doing) and I went with the latter since... Ten-chan was closer the center. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">ðŸ¤­</span> Yeah, stupid reason. On the other hand, to make me choose between these two is a ridicule. You don't know how happy I was with choosing the special gift on their previous single haha</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Okay this is long enough so I shall stop here. Heck, I thought I wouldn't be able to write this much after all the YouTube video watching and... yeah, that writing which shall not be mentioned. Cya guys next time then, and I hope, I HOPE, I'll be reviewing another release soon. SID's new Anime best album is lining up to be the next candidate real well so that's a start. Have a good weekend, everyone. (Me too w00ts)</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S.
