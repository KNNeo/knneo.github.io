The new episode (#FumikiriJikan03) just gets funnier every time you watch it,
this time it's interaction between teacher and student. And you're right sensei,
you should keep your mouth shut. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, maybe not since it's kind of
manners to talk to students but yeah, normally people don't want to. Age gap or
whatever, at least don't screw up the introductions, yes? And that's where the
landslide happens because the girl looks like she got an or**** or something lol
and really she's just trying not to laugh at a seemingly professional figure. I
mean, you can laugh girl; the teacher totally sh*t on himiself this time. Now
it's gotta be a talking point in class later haha sensei you lucky she is quiet

I know I should'nt be "Jougasaki-ing*" this episode (#TadaKun04) but yeah
Pin-senpai you've gone WAY too far in describing breasts lol okay let's talk
about the rest of the plot. Hmm since this is a character development episode
again (last episode was that cat lol) let's go into some level of detail. Of
course, it's about love. Firstly, I'd like to compliment the production for
making the story resound so well in everyone's minds: an otaku's trip to a fan
meeting. Yeah. Haven't happened to me, but I feel this is going to be what it's
like someday lol I'm already 25 (<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/people/21517/Sora_Amamiya"
  target="_blank"
  >Ten-chan</a
>
I'm coming for you someday I promise) Okay back to the episode. Reality check
because it's really, REALLY hard to get into a fan meeting event limited to a
hundred people (You don't even know; FYI do you know idol concert tickets in
Japan are also randomly allocated? Yeah you still need to have some luck to be
one of them) so yeah undoubtedly one will get excited. But as expected,
Pin-senpai is your stereotypical, shy, awkward and totally fanboy... fanboy.
Which becomes a problem. Considering all that you're meeting someone who is
famous, beautiful, and... right in front of you?? Yeah, he got to rehearse with
the chairperson of the class. I mean, if you have been noticing Alec-san (well,
I have) then you'll know her sixth sense is spot on because she put two and two
together so HINAko won't sound unfamiliar anymore. Eh? That's it? Not really,
for she's the only one who noticed it though lol. Fast forward to the meeting
where (here's where I compliment the story writer) Pin-senpai dresses like a
punk from the 80s lol and has to change out to a more... normal outfit which is
whoever loses that scissors paper stone between the three guys (lol sorry
Tada-kun) and then... Pin-senpai ran out of time to speak to the woman. Yeah, he
flubbed it. Script (because it's in the other set of clothes), attire,
articulation... he screwed it up bad. Despite the catastrophic failure, we get a
hint from HINA-san which is quite literally, an awakening for the guy. Maybe.
But yeah, I thought that was it. I guess it's not. Even the phone call kind of
cemented it. I guess I was wrong then. But yeah, the day will come to light
where that idiot senpai can link them up someday which is like in 5 episodes
haha, and so will Teresa-chan. Links back really well, and makes you think more.
But yeah, I don't think it'll have much of an impact as Alec-san mentioned, but
it'll be a hell of a reveal. More than Pin-senpai and HINA-san or not? We'll
have to see it for ourselves.<br />

    "Narumi couldn't remember which pair of underwear she was wearing" SHE GONNA

I'm going to summarise the quote above as a general opinion of the whole episode
because in this new episode (#WotaKoi03) if you didn't laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME
the girl refers to herself ie. "Narumi..." (or "Narus..." lol) you didn't laugh
enough at this lovely show haha. And yeah, you bet I got bought in with the
(spoilers right after this section) KISSING SCENE!!! WHOO!! Man, when's the last
time I saw one of those in Anime?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I'm sorry if the capitalisation
also made you see spoilers lol I just can't help but) So yeah, I'll be giving
this show, and it's not because of this only, I swear. The episode talks evenly
about two things I've been inquiring since the first episode, which are
otaku-related events, and socialisation events with the four of them, the main
characters. So yeah, both got answered well. Firstly, it's all but jokes in the
Co***** event (I mean, there's only the one) as Narumi rushes to finish her
latest work and managed to sell it to interested patrons. Hey, in case you don't
know what is happening (I'm not an otaku btw) (well not entirely) doujinshi
which are better known as indie manga publishers push their work on these
seasonal events (that makes 4 times a year, "spring event" in real life is
actually this weekend) along with many other enthusiasts including games,
cosplayers, and... rated content. Yeah. So the guys obviously are interested in
all these stuff, it was a joy to see the confusion that Hirotaka gets sitting
there and selling BL ("boy's love", meaning gay) manga alone haha, and yes the
cosplayer. So yeah, that is settled. I'm okay with all of these, actually,
mainly because it's entertaining instead of irritating. Second half then talk
about Narumi
<strike>getting laid</strike> playing games with Hirotaka when she thought
they'll be all alone... it's a sleepover!! *horn sounds* So yeah she didn't
really get it, but she still got it. It's hard to determine even as of now what
kind of stuff Hirotaka-kun likes besides games (<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Mario Kart) but yeah
apparently it's also 2D girls with huge boobs (#realitycheck) and... her. Hey,
I'm loving this story already. Comparatively not as epic as that Anime original
above (sorry author, Anime production has gotten better in recent years) but I'm
liking the mood of the show already. A kissing scene this early? They totally
sealed the deal for this guy who almost wanted to be out because of those...
I'll think of a way to give the theme songs somehow haha *rolls eyes*<br />

It's been some time already, so let's catch up to what I've missed. The new
chapters (137-139) were worth the wait, though I did not intentionally wait for
it I just forget this still exists lol licensed manga sucks haha. Okay, the
plot. The last time we were here, the (from here on unless otherwise stated,
I'll use to reference the brother) "other Ciel" got killed, the brother. And the
(now) Ciel Ciel did something... weird. He managed to be able to, by witnessing
his brother's death, summon upon the demon for some reason. Hey, it's the story,
so hold on to your horses for a moment. So yeah, it's (unnamed) Sebastian,
seeking the one who called him from hell, apparently. So yeah, Ciel then decided
to exact revenge on whatever the heck happened to his family up till this point,
and yeah, with power. Ultimate power which will make him
<strike>hit the goal without actually doing it himself</strike> okay he wants to
do it himself anyways, so yeah demon, you're out of luck. The other half is
merely talking out the conditions of the contract which will cement the demon to
not - by any circumstances - not do his duty or kill Ciel the moment he can
before his goal is reached. Hey, idiot-proofing course at 10 years old; didn't
your school teach that today? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyway, it'll be spoiler from here on,
but yes he gets three wishes (cliche) and they are, within the time of the
contract, (1) to not lie to Ciel regardless of circumstances - Sebastian has
done quite well up till now unless there are some things he himself do not
understand, though to think about it he actually might know who did all these to
the Phantomhive family, so... he's lying? (2) to obey all orders from Ciel
without fail, especially under command - which explains the "it's an order" and
"yes, my lord" thing after what, 137 chapters? That, Sebastian has done pretty
well too, not that we know if he has done anything behind his back lol (3) to
protect Ciel at all costs - which will explain his near-deaths despite Sebastian
being the one getting killed over and over again and he can still make sure Ciel
is not dead good job Yana-chan-sensei haha but yeah this one is easy. But makes
you wonder, what about the betrayal part though? Well, technically it's covered
in the lying and obeying orders too so yeah that's in it too. Which brings us to
the big question back to the original arc we probably forgot: what happened that
made other Ciel (which we have learnt is the REAL McCoy, the older twin, and the
prospective leader of the house) appear? Isn't he stabbed and gutted to a mess?
Hey, remember the blood transfusion thing? Remember.... Undertaker?? Yeah, this
is going to get real cringy in the next few chapters. Hopefully.
Yana-chan-sensei, I demand a conclusion. Try to do it within the year, yes? I've
gotten tired of waiting. Like Sebastian, for Ciel to exact his revenge.

    The hallucination of Kokonotsu of Hotaru-chan in the omake lol

</blockquote>
The "latest" chapter (124) with omake concludes the 7th volume of the manga, and
man, you guys know the plot already. Kokonotsu went to the review for new manga
artists... and failed. I don't want to say how similar it is to my life right
now (lol) but yeah this boy is reflecting it hard. Not until he got harder after
seeing the huge-chested girl in front of his eyes haha. Okay, jokes aside, we
know this is going to conclude because the author has recently announced the
ending to this series (it's volume 11, but we're WAY far from this here), and
hell yeah will we get an ending. I hope. I don't think this is it, which is why
this will only get more interesting. Will Kokonotsu pursue his dreams as a manga
author or...? We just have to wait to find out.<br />

Now that I have some time to breathe (and forget about that proj-) (not deja vu
I wrote this first lol)&nbsp; I've set down to give more songs. And man, I hope
this won't end up to be a fortnightly thing where I only update my list of songs
less frequently than like, twice a week. Yeah, it was a thing. Okay, the
releases. I threw <b>Yuuki Aoi's new single</b> out of the window because
obviously that's not her voice for some reason (screw you Anime it's your
fault), I finally concluded on giving <b>yucat's latest mini-album</b> by just
giving the one song I've been listening to for a month lol, I've also started
giving songs from <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION bootleg compilations</b> because I
totally miss their old style of alternative rock (when it still was 10 years
ago), and I finally got hold on that
<b>Game "Alternative Girls" and their character songs</b> namely because I
remembered that the label behind it finally is releasing their stuff on Apple
Music Japan (so yeah Miyaka you're in the list), which... won't help make a
better impression on the latest release. It wasn't good, to be honest. And I've
been lenient since last year, mind you.<br /><br />Finally I've gotten those
old(er) releases out of the way, let's talk about the latest stuff released this
week. <b>Aqua Timez's new album</b> is... I think my tweet summarises it
well:<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">
  <div dir="ltr" lang="en">
    As of now it's like this. Pretty generous, I would say.<br /><br />Dear Aqua
    Timez, I still like your music, but it's waning. And I'm worried. I will
    surely give more if small changes were made (to suit my tastes lol)<br /><br />Good

But then again I'm not really in the mood to give, and they are kind of holding
on to their pop style which I like as shown in the topic song which I'm giving
as of now, so they'll stay for a week. Although I better give them more before
next week comes up. (Later paragraph, guys) Also, since I've given the Anime
"Wotakoi" as it is called, I have to, you know, give at least one of the theme
songs. And hey what timely release is <b>sumika's new mini-album</b> which
featured that opening theme song and... I don't want to argue. The song can get
used to maybe. I'd love to pinpoint what I dislike but nah I'll learn to like
the weird transition in the verses lol.<br /><br />Next week brings us quite a
couple of albums actually, and I can't wait to get my hands (literally) on them,
including <b>Tomatsu Haruka's new album</b> after her best albums since 2016 and
<b>Middle Kids is releasing their debut full album</b> (if you do not know of
them they currently represent the Australian indie artist voice) after their
first release last year making them the only English artist in Klassic Note in
2017 lol. Well, the following week is crazier but I'll leave this here for
now.<br /><br />Latest Twitter activity include
<b>Tsuji Shion's latest attempt in writing a new song</b> "Sekai de YEAH" based
on her Asia journey (yes, Singapore is included yeah my hometown &lt;= see what
I did there?) and you can view the music video on the website which I liked that
Tweet (hehe go there and watch you lazy idiot) and <b>Yoshioka Kiyoe</b> - the
voice of Ikimonogakari - is finally announcing her solo debut (yep, without the
two composers) with... a song cover which is for a commercial, but that's not
the point. Solo debut, people. We're going to get more- Well I wouldn't say
"Ikimono songs", but hey, she can sing anything. Blow my mind away,
Kiyoe-san.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm done. I'm ending this earlier
because it's exam season and... I got a paper tomorrow. The good news is that I
can afford to save some effort in studying for it because I intend to void the
grade or whatever you call it internationally. The bad news is that I cannot
afford to flunk it. Well it's not that far my project is way worse-<br /><br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />*cries*<br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />*wipes
tears* But yeah, going into that evening paper tomorrow with a light heart, I
suppose. Also, the idolism thing in this week's episode of Anime "Tada-kun" is
really making me want to meet the voice actresses I know especially when people
go to reddit to brag about their fan meets (dammit!). I guess I gotta do this
someday. I hope. Or not. Maybe not. That is such a far thing, it's not worth
pursuing. Besides, one can only like someone far away this much. And again, I'm
ready to throw away everything for anyone who can do the mutual love thing with
me anytime in the future. Not happening yet, so that's great. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay cya
guys next week then, and hopefully by then... I'll be halfway done with my
exams. Yeah. 'Tis gonna be a long week ahead.
