I know it's Joke Day, and I shouldn't be doing this on the day no one takes
anything seriously, but yeah, it's also a Sunday. So whatever. I still watch
Anime and listen to new songs. Besides, I made my jokes already. Changing my
cover photo on Facebook to a random K-pop group is making me new friendships
lol<br /><br />Next year I'll put the Chelsea logo as cover photo haha okay
let's start<br /><br />(Note:

  >The one Tweet on @KlassicNote</a

is my rejection for ever giving a sh*t for K-pop that's why you don't see a
cover image change haha)<br /><br />Once again, sorry for the last post; didn't
expect Sangatsu no Lion to be THIS long and I only watched this after dinner
should've skipped that nap lol<br /><br /><br /><br />

Wait, they just move the tables on seat change? WTF? Okay, the focus on the last
episode (#TakagiSan12) of the series. I call that "Critical x2", Takgai-san.
<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Thanks, Anime. Thanks for ending on a happy note, literally. And I
like. Can't unsee the last scene now. Let's go back a while to what happened.
Two things happened in summary. Firstly, there's the letter-writing trend in
class. This is vague enough to assume anything can happen, and Takagi gave a
Valentine's Day to Nishikata for fun, of course. And yes, it's no love letter,
but yeah, it still has the image of it. Well, because if she gave a guy the
letter, specifically Nishikata, and he says yes, it is no different from any
typical case. Nice job, author. Then, there's the separation. Haha, I make this
sound worse than Titantic, but considering&nbsp; they move the tables to prevent
STD transfer (lol) I may have to reconsider this analogy. Yeah, this just means
the couple(s) won't be sitting close to each other already, I guess. Yep. You
wish. After what seems like a dream, Nishikata (and me) woke up to see
Takagi-san beside him (and me, to a deja vu of this scene) (I swear I haven't
watched this episode before this) just because. Well, I won't reveal all of them
here, so be sure to find out yourself. And with the flashback, Nishikata decided
to give back the one thing be picked up? Wait, then why in the flashback Takagi
still has the handkerchief? #plothole Okay I'll overlook that I can't tell them
to change it already. (Or maybe I wasn't paying attention enough) All in all,
loved how this ended, and I must say, it is all about Takagi-san. And her sweet,
sweet infatuation for the gullible boy known as Nishikata. This, is a good
romance show. I know it's involving middle schoolers, but I want to see a high
school version. A college version. You know. I want to see them grow up. They do
that in all modern-day drama, why not this? *shock* I... I just got teased.

To sum it up, here's the last "Please No Nishikata Manual" tips for this
series:<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    You can just go home to find out who wrote the letter by: Putting the
    textbook away for a second, letting it drop, and do that to let someone ask
    you to take it out again, hopefully without the letter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Love letters are not an obligation to go out with whoever asked it; you can
    always say no.
  </li>
  <li>
    "There's going to be a seat change? Well, it's been (not) good knowing you"
    lol
  </li>
  <li>
    DO THINGS LIKE A MAN, NISHIKATA. The "like" and "lose" thing is relatively
    cheap compared to the embarrassment you take in every time and the push-ups
    you do every time you lose. (Okay, the "lose" part I can understand though)
  </li>
</ul>
P.S. One of the Joke Day... jokes I got tricked into was the announcement (and
full-on change of the website) of a new Anime of
<a

  target="_blank"
  >"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-chan"</a
>
ie. the girl as a kid, probably without Nishikata. Clearly, that was going to be
a future Anime original (if you knew the three manga serialisations) . Remember
how WWW.WORKING!! wasn't a thing like, five years ago? Personally I want
<a

  target="_blank"
  >Oohara Yuiko to sing the new opening theme song</a
>
and the new ending themes to be covers of kids' songs haha<br />P.P.S. Did I say
<strike>Takagi-san</strike> <strike>Yukari-chan</strike> Mina-chan was MVP of
the whole series? Like, did I say that?? Haha you guys don't know how attractive
were those eyebrows lol<br />[LAST OMAKE!!!]<br />

Hmm, let's end this on a serious note. The last episode of the series
(#DagashiKashiS212) focuses on the biggest cliffhanger this show has ever given
us: The return of Hotaru. And above all things unsettled, they add on to it as
if they want this to be a bigger mystery. But in this case, the Anime decided to
end things around Kokonotsu, it seems. Hotaru was busy getting herself a company
to run (man, this girl), Kokonotsu screwed up his manga interview (heck), Yutaka
was the elder brother of Hotaru for some reason (which shouldn't be revealed at
this time of the show), and You-san is back. Without a legacy. Because no one
wants him now lol. Well, not only that, but hey, if the sponsors need more
audience please help do a season 3 to resolve all these thanks! Okay, to
production. Again, I blame the lack of time for the episode that this kinds of
things are too easily summarised (I mean, "I've got so many questions to ask and
in the end I just didn't" is not a good summary) and simplified I just feel it's
missing out on something. I guess it's still better than the empty spaces
created in the first season of this series where too little was featured in each
episode, but this technically didn't make it better. I expected more, Anime. A
better ending theme song (ugh), a longer storyline (I guess you can't get too
many sponsors squeezed into one episode), and a better conclusion. But hey, I'm
not really complaining. But yeah, the only thing I laughed to this episode is
that Hotaru hear someone call Kokonotsu the manger. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Boy did I laugh it
out. I guess you just have to see this show with a level of casualness otherwise
it's hard to convince to watch this anyway. There is too little content to call
if development considering how little it is in season one and how excessive it
is in season two. But I'll say it ended on a good note. And that's pretty
important. Kokonotsu running in with Hotaru? I'd like to see that! (Yeah it's a
figment of my imagination, huh)<br />

P.S. Bear in mind I wasn't angry or disappointed, I was just unsatisfied.
There's so much going on the show (and the manga) I just want to see this as a
proper Anime that is not ridden with sponsorships is it really that hard???
*looks at Japanese bureaucracy* Okay nvm haha<br /><br /><br />

Just in case you need a clue of why they don't dare to say "ochi...ru" on
Hina-chan's test day,
<a href="http://jisho.org/search/ochiru" target="_blank">here's a hint</a>. The
new episodes to end the series (#3Lion43) (#3Lion44) is surprisingly, played
back-to-back. (Well, I consider a day's difference back-to-back), and I don't
know where to start now. Okay, since they feel totally different, let's split
all the things up to three main stuff: Hina-chan, Kiriyama, and everything else.
I'm giving this series a proper sendoff. Ready? Let's start!<br />

HINA-CHAN<br />The second last episode gives us the final focus on Hina-chan's
prescence in Kiriyama's life for the series. And it concluded well, with
Hina-chan's graduation from that darned middle school to his high school, and
everything else in between that the aunt suspected but didn't come true. But
hey, great pair, isn't it? And considering she's not going to grab hold of the
great Takahashi who is pursuing his dreams away from town, Kiriyama is a good
second choice haha. Okay, not that. But yeah, ever since his departure,
Hina-chan has changed a lot. She got into high school, for goodness sake. She
helped the family, got over the middle school bullying incident and is visiting
Chiho-chan (the REAL victim) from time to time, she got her hair cut... all in
all it was wonderful. [Insert moment for me to laugh at the hairstyle] Hina-chan
has come far since the first time we knew her as a bubbly and positive girl.
She's all grown up, this little girl. And as <strike>Akari</strike> a bystander
(pun not intended, YUKI-san) I feel happy for her.<br />

KIRIYAMA<br />For the main guy, it's a different story. He took a journey back
to visit his stepmother (hey she's still your mom), at the right time, at the
right location. From the mother's narration it feels like Kiriyama is holding it
all in considering (I think we've gone through this in season one) he's the
victim of a car accident, but I don't think so. Actually, he might just be a
good guy after going through all the trauma. Hey, sometimes, it takes an
accident to change us. That's why they are called life-changing events, man. But
seriously, as we have probably mentioned before, it's out of respect. To the
stepfather who he might cross paths but in the professional career, but to his
childhood who might otherwise got awry. Hmm what else... he gained some
confidence. And that is real important. Burying the past behind him, living
alone, and having help from the Kawamoto family definitely helped him out a lot,
and of course people from the shougi field (exceptions do apply) who are with
him, from Shimada, his best friend (self-claimed) Nikaidou, and more. All these,
he got it through his life of chess. That, you can never get from a broken
family. Really, this motivation is something.<br />

EVERYTHING ELSE<br />Well, from the grandpa trying to keep himself alive to pay
bills and see his kids get married (RIP Momo's wedding may she marry early to a
rich guy lol), Akari going crazy about teenager thoughts (I mean, she is still
one she just... works with men), Momo being Momo (haha) and more which went
throughout the episode and all, the show ended well by not bringing up too much
of shougi, which to be honest is not the essence of the show. This show meant to
tell a story. Even though it sounds like a bibiliography for a kid of chess, but
in reality it is about the kindness. The struggles. The joy. The pain. And
everything else in between which made this story touching and enjoyable. Really,
this show would be real different if the stepmother's dream was true haha none
of the three kids will do shougi like the father lol<br /><br />To sum things
up, I don't want this to end. Unfortunately I can't find any more supporting
evidence to say there's a season three. <span title="*sob*">😢</span> Now I'm feeling sad. I really want
this to go on. Forever. Is this it? For canon material? Hmm maybe, but I just
feel like it's missing something. But hey, as a grow-up story, it'll never end,
isn't it? *shock* I see. Then this is good enough. I'm satisfied. I may just
have gone way too much to ask for more. I mean, look at how long is this
already; I'm crying more than Hina-chan has ever cried in this show lol okay
I'll stop<br /><br />P.S. "What if the fever doesn't go down?" Then we're

for MVP this series haha I'll leave it to find out where it is yourself hehe<br />(Okay
let's give this show a little rant. WAY too little animations already tbh. I
think you noticed that too at the Kiriyama trip to visit the stepmother, but
hey, if it's for storytelling it works I must say so that's the least of our
problems)<br /><br />

Ah, so they took a later chapter and adapted into the Anime. And boy have I saw
that animated. The new chapter (121) played on the game that Tou-kun was
supposedly playing with Kokonotsu: the debt-collecting game. Well, just that the
new hire Hajime-san know nothing about it so haha you can see the problem. The
familiar 8-figure chocolate dagashi appeared for once (if you never had that you
have no childhood), and yeah it probably didn't have that dramatic of an effect
as it had on Tou-kun as it had on me I have no recollection of that stuff lol I
only eat Rochers haha<br /><br />

I'll give a short summary. <b>yucat's new mini-album</b> didn't hold up as much
as I thought it would be because I might just reject the one song I was about to
give too, <b>SOROR's new album</b> which literally started from me hearing the
one song from Kouno Marika was rather disappointing because it was remastered
ie. the styles for electronic music will change drastically in this case, and
yeah, I might just be skipping the album version and going with the single
version. On the other hand, I found a couple of melodies I might just want to
give. Reminds me of sasakure.UK's album I gave back in 2013 which... is probably
better than this because of the music style maybe.
<b>Cocoro Auction's new full album</b> (and finally under major label, not
independent) was kind of okay, but way different than I imagined. Maybe they've
moved on already? It sure was hard to give them songs based on melody, but even
then the style is such a turn off. I miss those melodies I give with a mellow
mood; kind of what I was here for in the first place. Well, next time then.
<b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new best album</b> features one new song, and
despite it being very Ajikan it still doesn't go down my alley. I mean, that
single from last year was way better.<br /><br />Outside Apple Music, we also
have a couple of releases to take note of. <b>Hayami Saori's new single</b> (for
Anime "Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card Arc") was okay in the topic song and I
seriously thought the second review of the year would be this, but I'm keeping
my wallet for now hehe.
<b>Anime "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san" ending theme album</b> also came out, but
now after what I've heard from the final episode I've regretted not voting for
the last ending song in the Twitter polls posted earlier this week. Well, I
don't really watch Anime on weekdays and this airs on Monday nights literally
the night before I go to school for the week... you get the point. I'm not
giving these though because to be honest they aren't as good overall, and I've
given Ikimonogakari and Chatmonchy. So oh well. Takahashi Rie (better known as
"Rieri") sounds great in this though. We getting the solo artist career soon?<br /><br /><br /><br />This
is it then. Again, sorry for the late post. I got to go for prayers (not church
btw) in the morning and I had to wake up early so half the day was burnt. And
even besides the long weekend with Good Friday over here it's still not enough
to touch on the stuff I missed (not written here, I mean) because of schoolwork.
And I'm not even done yet. Three presentations pending, a buttload of
assignments... this month is going to be crazy. Cya guys next week then, and
until then... oh when the new Anime coming out? I better check simulcast dates
first then. Bye!<br /><br />P.S.<br />

Nice joke. Aoi-chan. No really, the shot has got to be awkward. Then again, I
think I took a shot at that already haha no I was joking this is not enough for
my standards (oops)<br /><br />P.P.S. All Joke Day tweets are image archived
because they will disappear in... like 6 minutes maybe. Yes, including my tweet.
