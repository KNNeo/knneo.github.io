<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span><br /><br />I think I'm doomed. My final year project/thesis/whatever you
call that project which ends your university/college final year. Oh well, I
blame myself for submitting to peer pressure in choosing a professor and project
early. I think I would have gotten an easier life if I were to be chosen
somehow. My luck on extremely important events has been rather good anyways.<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span><br /><br />I

experimentation-based projects, I guess.<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span><br /><br />Okay, I'm
done. Remove ALL that negative feelings away, for we got some Anime to watch!

If you've only heard the word "eroi" for the whole video, you're not alone. The
new episode (#FumikiriJikan02) talks about women. Sorry, ladies. But yeah, it's
a classmate thing again. But this time, it's one of the guys against one of the
hottest female classmates in class. Well, if you're staring at her the wrong way
no one will blame you I guess, but yeah, I guess the overemphasis of this is
kind of irritating haha. Nonetheless, it's entertaining as heck, and yeah they
do make your wish come true (in Anime) by giving some form of interaction
where... Majima-san? (Sorry only heard the one word lol) Yeah, she does up your
tie. Well that's kind of cliche of a plot, but hey, he got laid. Well, about the
amount of time the train passes only though, as he stays stunned by her beauty.
But hey, a little background will make sense but no follow-ups will likely make
this anti-climactic, because this is likely what we'll get. No seriously, this
it it. Now go fap in a corner if you need to lol<br />

And hey Yui-chan isn't the only thing that shines so much it's brighter than
everyone else. Right, Alec-san? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The new episode (#TadaKun03) is
literally a whole episode from the cat's perspective (thanks production!!)
(also, voiced by
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/146/Akio_Ootsuka" target="_blank"

>), and boy did it bring up a different view. Well, at least, where the topic of
love is concerned. I mean, it fell in love lol. Okay, the plot. It shows another
lovely day of Tada-kun's life with Teresa-chan, and after a morning coffee the
guys so on a photo shoot to try to nail that competition prize, I guess. Sounds
short, but many things happened which focus on the details on what happened but
in the perspective of the cat. Interactions may be right or wrong (the old man
nailed it though), but all in all very entertaining to watch as it explains the
many reasons for the cat's reactions for the first couple of episodes, from
hating Ijuin to how it got fat lol. Also, we got quite a flashback as to how
Teresa-chan... got disciplines to behave herself and not act abruptly because
she is- Well you know haha. (Also, I don't care about Ijuin's backstory haha)
All in all, another wonderful episode to watch, and I shouldn't spoil too much
on this, but yeah since "Tada-kun won't fall in love" you would expect the
affection to come from somewhere, yes? Looking at you, Teresa-chan hehe (oh also
spoilers below so if you haven't watched) oh also Alec-san very interesting girl
as we have found out (remember the secondary character development thing?)<br />[NYANKO

P.S. I thought it'll be a good joke that Teresa-chan will switch hands just to
avoid an indirect kiss from a coffee cup oh this isn't Wotakoi?? Oops haha but
hey the cat knows what's up<br />P.P.S. "If a man and a woman stare at each
other for..." And I'm like "BRING THAT COUNTER UP" and it didn't happen. Hey,
it's only episode 3, guys. Gotta have a little more patience lol "If a woman
stares at her cup for more than 8 seconds..." <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />(Okay last one:
"It's not that sweet" followed by Tada-kun's voice reminded me of a certain
Anime episode titled "Life is not that easy" - winners who know where this
episode comes from will get a prize of knowing why.

</blockquote>
Hmm to be honest? I find the new episode (#WotaKoi02) kind of boring. Yeah, and
I'm not sure why. Let's break it down, yes? The episode just talks about the
not-so-confession confession from Hitotaka-kun (I can only remember this name)
and what happened after that... stalemate? Seriously? You guys haven't done
anything yet though? But yeah, this episode specifically deals with character
development, as we see Hana and the other guy try to get along as the four of
them start to hang out. It's real awkward though, the interactions, which made
me feel like the drama has been dragged out for some reason. The random kind of
unrelated stuff strikes back again like how Anime "Slow Start" does it, and it
seems irrelevant or even uninteresting at times, from whatever genre they're
talking about to the differences between reading books and gaming and stuff.
It's starting to get just a little boring. I don't know man, but if you're still
watching this you would definitely love the winks (lol), the somewhat awkward
interactions between the other two people who look like they have been in love
at some point but broke up already (I don't know) and their love for everything
otaku. That, I'd rather they not emphasise on this too much because the context
is not strong. And that makes it worse in comparison. For me it's either you
specify a certain something (like "100% Kataomoi" lol) or you don't, like Anime
"Gamers". It's kind of bad to be in between, where there's some and it's not
elaborated on. But I get where this is going; it's to show the side of
relationships with that obstacle of otaku and love for stuff but not real life
people. I get it, but I feel one should be emphasized more than the other would
be better imo though. What do you guys think? Do you think I'm quitting this
series already? I may just, and we'll see if I do next episode hehe<br />

The new chapters (158,159) (turns out I may have missed one of them) (wow Volume
26, huh) talk about the TRUE Lord of the South. No, not that cat who is sensei
to Suzu-chan. Someone bigger than that cat. Someone, who can punch a hole in a
cave without leaving a trace. Someone, who no one has ever seen before but yet
exists 100 years ago. The cat did go on to find out who the true identity of the
Lord is, but eventually... Hmm, sounds like an interesting tale. I guess it may
be boring at this long of chapters already, but somehow I can get into the mood
well with nosebleed (lol Ikuto), jealousy, some mythical tales (someday the
island will be able to link with the rest of the country maybe) and a lot more.
And that, I'll continue reading. Between Suzu-chan and Ikuto's sister Misaki...
man, Ikuto's a lucky guy. Haha and I think I said that from the very start
already<br />

This week didn't bring much music to the table, so I had to go back a little.
<b>yucat's latest album</b> has finally got so some conclusion and I'll be
giving one song and that's it, I suppose. I also took a listen to
<b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION bootleg albums</b> (if you follow on Twitter you
should know) and there are some classic Ajikan titles in there, really. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> I
miss good old Ajikan. Even the new song in the best album can't hold up by
itself. That's how far they are already. I also took some time to flip through
the songs from label <b>PONY CANYON Anime in Apple Music</b> to try to get
sources which are unlikely to find without streaming like that "Alternative
Girls" character song series which has been released by the label since last
year.<br /><br />Next week brings us<b> Yuuki Aoi's new single </b>which I may
or may not listen (now it's the latter instead of the former), and of course,
the much long awaited <b>Aqua Timez new album</b>. Yes. It has finally come. The
topic song isn't impressive, but that's not going to stop me from giving them
new songs. And I swear, they are still the longest-lasting Collection Artist in
Klassic Note till date, and I like that. It's been ten years, people. A lot have
fallen out of league, but these guys... that's why they are great. We'll talk
more on them next week.<br /><br />Some Twitter activities this week include a
confirmation of <b>miwa's best album </b>coming in July (when the tracklist
comes out we'll see if I can get most of the 28 songs or not chances are I can I
only missed like 3 singles haha),
<b>Chatmonchy's final (mini) album</b> confirmed for 27th June this year and a
final tour before ending their music career (see what I'm saying about falling
out of league?), and I've also done some sharing of my experience listening to
Horie Yui and Hikasa Youko back in 2013. Damn, those were good times.<br /><br />(Be
sure to check out the Klassic Note 2013 compilation "The Indisputable Anison"
for more wonderful Anime theme songs from that year)<br /><br /><br /><br />Well,
I'm done. Cya guys next week again then, and until then... I'm finding something
to forget about my... sadness. Yeah, you guessed it: Dead or Alive beach
volleyball!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well I'm just trying out
<a href="https://doax-venusvacation.jp/" target="_blank"
  >the freemium game in DMM</a
>
(don't say yes to the mature content warning and you'll still find this) because
they've been putting ads on their new character Tamaki (voiced by the lovely,
lovely Oonishi Saori) (yeah, and the character's sadistic too hehe) but I've not
gotten my hands (literally) on her though. It's hard to even play the game
considering I'm reading a bunch of Japanese text and got an inventory of
swimsuits and accessories enough to stuff my sling bag lol. (Ah then again it's
swimsuits, so... lol broke my joke) Well, I'm going back to look at swinging
babes, if you'll excuse me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I'm still not that pleased on the 3D
graphics of today though because clearly there's still a certain level of
conflict in graphics when they swing their hair, put their hands on the table
with a cloth for example, and so on. Don't ask me why, I just think it's still
unnatural. Half the reason why I'm not into these games yet. Well, I won't say
that now though gotta go back and swing those tit-
