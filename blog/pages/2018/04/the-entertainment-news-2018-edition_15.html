No, no karaoke this week. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Yeah, but then I've got quite a week. So I'm
glad that's over. It's not over yet though. I mean, will I ever? But yeah, I
still got a presentation to go which I don't even know if I can even pass (ugh
my chest hurts), and a project demo, I guess. But yeah, definitely better than
last week. I went to school on a Friday haha stuff students don't do well lol
not true the others stay at home anyway like Sagiri in Eromanga-sensei lol<br /><br />I've
got a couple more new shows to talk about, so let's get to it!<br /><br /><br /><br />

    I just hope it's not happening here
  </div>
</blockquote>
Okay for starters, I want to punch that Ai-senpai so much right now because I
love trains AND IT'S NOT A WASTE OF TIME WAITING FOR THE TRAIN TO PASS EVEN IF
YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT!! Haha okay, the first episode (#FumikiriJikan01) of this
short series is about trains. Well, not really. This show... is just simple, but
we gotta give it some context considering I live in the city with underground
trains lol. So firstly, context. Ever heard of railroad crossings? Yes, those
intersections where a permanent rail path goes over any road or pedestrian path.
In order to cut costs and not build overpass or underpasses, every time the
train passes by you got to wait there for a couple of minutes. These minutes
consist of: The train crossing barriers will come down, the traffic lights for
the incoming train warning will light up in sync (two red, one above one below
as you see in the Anime), and the train will pass. After that, the reverse
process happens and you get to move on. Of course, because there's these few
minutes, and that's where the drama happens. I feel sad for the show because
this can easily be a full or even half-length episode in itself (it's not) (but
seriously what's with Anime production today), and I'll have a joy watching it
not because of the trains, but because of the stories behind them. It may be a
lot of speech and little action, but I can see more people coming into this
story, creating a world we can like, somehow similar to Tsurezure Children where
in that case many school kids come to fall in love. Well, this one clearly is
not going to be what it is now after this episode, but it's a good start. I
might just take the three-episode rule and give it due credit for making it good
so far. What happens next? Considering we won't have much context after every
episode, it'll always be a mystery. Hey, at least it's good for re-watch
purposes when I have some time to kill haha<br />

P.S. Man, way too much for a 3-minute episode tbh, the write-up. I'll keep it
short next time. Also, the

  >opening theme song</a

sounds good. Sounds like all the newbie voice actors are getting their solo
music debut earlier than their major roles for some reason lol. We're on the
road to initiation here, Anime.<br /><br /><br />

</blockquote>
Aw man I'm liking that Pin-senpai already he can see chests haha okay the new
episode (#TadaKun02) goes a little in-depth to show that... I would like to say
this is not a romance show, but it still is, and this might easily just be
another typical romance comedy, if you haven't watched any before. I wouldn't
get used to these shows personally, but I like how this time this show will
stick with me. Hey, all in the day of making Anime originals, people. Let's talk
about the plot. Remember the "infiltration" I mentioned last week? Yeah, so
let's go in that direction instead of whatever is behind Teresa-chan right now.
The two transfer students living the Japanese life can be rough (lol Alec), but
it is not without comfort. They are quickly introduced to the Photography Club,
where the class president has joined in reluctance along with Tada-kun, that
narcissist, and introducing the most relatable character we can have among men.
<span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay I wouldn't say I like gravure idols anymore (I don't) (*fap fap*),
but I guess there's some meaning into putting Pin-senpai in this character. Not
to mention a hint of the idol Hina with the class president, and the many stuff
that happened along the way as they try split into teams and try to take
pictures of each other... Well, you get the idea. I generally enjoyed the
episode just like how I did last week, so I must say I'll be hooked to this no
matter what haha. On the upside, now that the characters have been established
(including that dog lol) and have concluded in some way what life should be like
in this show, we may be ahead of making the backstory happen. Oh we're not? Oh
well, I guess we can play around more often. And if you didn't notice the subtle
details about affections between the characters (Tada-kun's sister to that dog
lol) then be sure to watch the episode again. What's bad about the episode? To
be honest, if they didn't say it was a tradition in the club I'll be as bored as
Alec-san when they have to do this haha<br />

P.S. I like the idea of how Pin-senpai thinks he can get more budget and get

spoilers but, you can see where this will go haha)<br />P.P.S. Someone please
explain to me whether Teresa-chan was getting giddy or stressed or horny (oops)
(damn you Pin-senpai) when being flashed upon (by cameras, please) because it
seems Alec-san knows something. Hey, as I said, details in original Anime to not
be neglected, everyone.<br /><br />

"This episode was sponsored by&nbsp;Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata" was what I'd
like to say but since it's a show from the same production company I can't
complain haha. The first episode (#WotaKoi01) of this... romance series? To be
honest, it's all over the place. And I'm glad it all comes back together. Let's
talk about it. The show starts of with Momose-san, some girl who just started
working in a new company and surprisingly, where her childhood friend was also
working. So hey, sounds like a good time to catch up until someone mentions the
otaku stuff and you're like "I need to keep my reputation up so stop talking
about it already" and stuff, but honestly, the guy is right: Find someone who
will like what you do because I can honestly tell you, it'll be hard when the
married life comes and you notice you like to go out and the other half loves
his computer haha not my parent's story. Anyways, we're in an adult context
here, so don't expect school stuff anymore. To be honest, this show is about
work, but nothing to do with it, I swear. This is just the set-up for all the
romance stuff that is about to happen. For now, we established most of the four
main characters we will see most often. The main girl (<a
  href="http://jisho.org/word/%E8%85%90%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90"
  target="_blank"
  >fujoshi</a
>&nbsp;as I'll probably call here from now on), the main guy (<a
  href="http://jisho.org/word/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AA%E3%82%BF"
  target="_blank"
  >geota</a
>
as I'll call him), the main girl's colleague (<a
  href="http://jisho.org/word/%E3%82%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC"
  target="_blank"
  >cosplayer</a
>
as I'll call her/him) and the main guy's superior. We don't know much about the
last one yet, but the other three I think we have a good idea of it already
after this episode. The flow of the story though isn't that weird, I kind of
dislike the animation compared to the one above tbh, and the theme songs... will
need a little bit of "brainwashing" haha. All in all, I want to give this show
chance, I can see where this goes too (Comiket is going to be a thing here, like
it or not), so I'll definitely play the three-episode rule. To tie up to the
opening sentence, it's been some time since I've given a
<a href="http://noitamina.tv/" target="_blank">noitamina</a> slot Anime (the
last time was two years ago), so it's about time I get back on track. I'll see
how this goes. The main point here feels like romance so I'll see if it's any
better or worse than "Gamers!" that I watched last year.<br />

Yes, I've moved on with <b>SID's new Anime best album</b>. Past self deleted the
music video link to tell future self to forget about the review. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Sorry,
SID. You guys were close.<br /><br />Let's talk about new releases this week,
yes? <b>ORESAMA's first full album</b> was kind of okay, but yeah because their
style is kind of retro it's hard to remove that stereotype when giving the
melodies which are already not that impressive. Besides the topic song I have
another song which exhibits PON-chan's cuteness (&lt;= hint right there) so I
guess that's as much as I'll give it. <b>Goose house's new album</b> probably
was easier to give but compared to their previous album with the other member
this one was harder to give. I think it's mainly because they added new elements
to the song production making it sound more impactful but also more daunting,
making me harder to give the first few songs, to be honest. I still settled with
a couple of songs though including the one they even had a live version of it if
you had the right version of the release (mine's digital so yes it's in the
release), and I must say... the two mini-album release back in 2015 were easier
to give. And back then I thought I had to force myself to give the two songs
just to credit them for the year. This one? It was quick in decision, but not
painless. Sorry, guys. I expected something else apparently. Production is great
though, I won't deny it.<br /><br />I know there's not much next week for
Klassic Note, so I better go backtrack and give a couple of songs which I
promised to put in the list (<span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> yucat) and also find out new songs here and
there. For example, <b>Middle Kids</b> (the only English group I gave last year)
is releasing their first full album (congrats btw) in May, so be sure to check
them out. Hmm, what did I write on my Twitter feed... Oh yeah, Keiko has finally
confirmed her departure from <b>Kalafina</b> following composer Kajiura-sensei,
so be sure to check her comment out. I mean, I'm done with these guys last year
already, so whatever haha. Ah yes, PONY CANYON Anime division of artists finally
got their entrance in <b>Apple Music</b> (Japan) following K-ON! and other Anime
soundtracks, which also means Hikasa Youko (yay Yocchan!), Taketatsu Ayana and
Horie Yui will be joining the list of songs I can tag online now haha<br /><br /><br /><br />This
is it then. I need to take a good break so tomorrow I can continue to finish
that other project I need to present on Wednesday. You guys know data science is
a big thing now and is in high demand? Gotta learn that Neural Network
implementation code. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Cya guys soon, and until next time... I think I
may have to get a missed release that was supposed to be on my shelf. Who is it?
I'll reveal it in the next review I guess gotta get a discount from this lol
