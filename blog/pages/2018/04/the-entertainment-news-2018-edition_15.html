So I'm glad that's over. It's not over yet though. I mean, will I ever? But yeah, I still got a presentation to go which I don't even know if I can even pass (ugh my chest hurts), and a project demo, I guess. But yeah, definitely better than last week. I went to school on a Friday haha stuff students don't do well lol not true the others stay at home anyway like Sagiri in Eromanga-sensei lol<br><br>I've got a couple more new shows to talk about, so let's get to it!<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=FumikiriJikan01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Fumikiri Jikan</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Women can fall in love with each other too!" Haha yeah you're right though I just hope it's not happening here</div></blockquote>Okay for starters, I want to punch that Ai-senpai so much right now because I love trains AND IT'S NOT A WASTE OF TIME WAITING FOR THE TRAIN TO PASS EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT!! Haha okay, the first episode (#FumikiriJikan01) of this short series is about trains. Well, not really. This show... is just simple, but we gotta give it some context considering I live in the city with underground trains lol. So firstly, context. Ever heard of railroad crossings? Yes, those intersections where a permanent rail path goes over any road or pedestrian path. In order to cut costs and not build overpass or underpasses, every time the train passes by you got to wait there for a couple of minutes. These minutes consist of: The train crossing barriers will come down, the traffic lights for the incoming train warning will light up in sync (two red, one above one below as you see in the Anime), and the train will pass. After that, the reverse process happens and you get to move on. Of course, because there's these few minutes, and that's where the drama happens. I feel sad for the show because this can easily be a full or even half-length episode in itself (it's not) (but seriously what's with Anime production today), and I'll have a joy watching it not because of the trains, but because of the stories behind them. It may be a lot of speech and little action, but I can see more people coming into this story, creating a world we can like, somehow similar to Tsurezure Children where in that case many school kids come to fall in love. Well, this one clearly is not going to be what it is now after this episode, but it's a good start. I might just take the three-episode rule and give it due credit for making it good so far. What happens next? Considering we won't have much context after every episode, it'll always be a mystery. Hey, at least it's good for re-watch purposes when I have some time to kill haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpOZsJmGMwlDJGnwx6rlfeagGq0H18kf8FiXkkhvG2_zRNqpSDpqOA0-YjTxjp2GNhDmd-egiGRiedUz98vhIbZmknzgAREhX39aKWtamxQc6vf_kbFT0-xgHkR2KP5Jfjnx7midY1bUG3/s320/fumikirijikan01_train.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This series in a nutshell.<br>Also, this is what a train crossing looks like.</table>P.S. Man, way too much for a 3-minute episode tbh, the write-up. I'll keep it short next time. Also, the <a href=http://www.teichiku.co.jp/artist/komagata-yuri/ target=_blank>opening theme song</a> sounds good. Sounds like all the newbie voice actors are getting their solo music debut earlier than their major roles for some reason lol. We're on the road to initiation here, Anime.<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TadaKun02><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Come on, Pin-senpai I've gotten over gravure idols at the age of 10 bro get a life haha</div></blockquote>Aw man I'm liking that Pin-senpai already he can see chests haha okay the new episode (#TadaKun02) goes a little in-depth to show that... I would like to say this is not a romance show, but it still is, and this might easily just be another typical romance comedy, if you haven't watched any before. I wouldn't get used to these shows personally, but I like how this time this show will stick with me. Hey, all in the day of making Anime originals, people. Let's talk about the plot. Remember the "infiltration" I mentioned last week? Yeah, so let's go in that direction instead of whatever is behind Teresa-chan right now. The two transfer students living the Japanese life can be rough (lol Alec), but it is not without comfort. They are quickly introduced to the Photography Club, where the class president has joined in reluctance along with Tada-kun, that narcissist, and introducing the most relatable character we can have among men. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay I wouldn't say I like gravure idols anymore (I don't) (*fap fap*), but I guess there's some meaning into putting Pin-senpai in this character. Not to mention a hint of the idol Hina with the class president, and the many stuff that happened along the way as they try split into teams and try to take pictures of each other... Well, you get the idea. I generally enjoyed the episode just like how I did last week, so I must say I'll be hooked to this no matter what haha. On the upside, now that the characters have been established (including that dog lol) and have concluded in some way what life should be like in this show, we may be ahead of making the backstory happen. Oh we're not? Oh well, I guess we can play around more often. And if you didn't notice the subtle details about affections between the characters (Tada-kun's sister to that dog lol) then be sure to watch the episode again. What's bad about the episode? To be honest, if they didn't say it was a tradition in the club I'll be as bored as Alec-san when they have to do this haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEho1gQjVkXNJHMjMUtAXP4jcUt9GktQWMySj1sk0OuBjLCW3TuH1iWjvi_osz8AB1oP06a3ckAlBYB-q6vudWnIrjsmg2684pkGMEGMsbEX3LY1hI7zXEr-lv85sQQGjpda_YEUmvbIgwIT/s320/tadakun02_shogun.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>No seriously, is that a real signing by the actor who played the Shogun?? lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8d5GZqvtvdmc8t_JDcBQuR0VfPfnXuS9I359G9lpt7CgcjrihS6DgYwt6qygtfZ-ZyektBfG_enlwtCmVyFuVs-ymKXQdpTeF2VqcsLiIvo63WyCV5CwyrAG1mBMqOMmlxDqEZu9E9lwK/s320/tadakun02_alec.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When your friend wants to do something and you don't haha<br>(TIL Alec-san is tsundere hehe very appealing)</table></div></div>P.S. I like the idea of how Pin-senpai thinks he can get more budget and get nude girls the class president is a member of the club isn't she?? (Well, not spoilers but, you can see where this will go haha)<br>P.P.S. Someone please explain to me whether Teresa-chan was getting giddy or stressed or horny (oops) (damn you Pin-senpai) when being flashed upon (by cameras, please) because it seems Alec-san knows something. Hey, as I said, details in original Anime to not be neglected, everyone.<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=WotaKoi01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Otaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>*A kind reminder from the local Transport Authority on not running into train doors as they are closing* lol</div></blockquote>"This episode was sponsored byÂ Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata" was what I'd like to say but since it's a show from the same production company I can't complain haha. The first episode (#WotaKoi01) of this... romance series? To be honest, it's all over the place. And I'm glad it all comes back together. Let's talk about it. The show starts of with Momose-san, some girl who just started working in a new company and surprisingly, where her childhood friend was also working. So hey, sounds like a good time to catch up until someone mentions the otaku stuff and you're like "I need to keep my reputation up so stop talking about it already" and stuff, but honestly, the guy is right: Find someone who will like what you do because I can honestly tell you, it'll be hard when the married life comes and you notice you like to go out and the other half loves his computer haha not my parent's story. Anyways, we're in an adult context here, so don't expect school stuff anymore. To be honest, this show is about work, but nothing to do with it, I swear. This is just the set-up for all the romance stuff that is about to happen. For now, we established most of the four main characters we will see most often. The main girl (<a href=http://jisho.org/word/%E8%85%90%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%90 target=_blank>fujoshi</a>Â as I'll probably call here from now on), the main guy (<a href=http://jisho.org/word/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AA%E3%82%BF target=_blank>geota</a> as I'll call him), the main girl's colleague (<a href=http://jisho.org/word/%E3%82%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC target=_blank>cosplayer</a> as I'll call her/him) and the main guy's superior. We don't know much about the last one yet, but the other three I think we have a good idea of it already after this episode. The flow of the story though isn't that weird, I kind of dislike the animation compared to the one above tbh, and the theme songs... will need a little bit of "brainwashing" haha. All in all, I want to give this show chance, I can see where this goes too (Comiket is going to be a thing here, like it or not), so I'll definitely play the three-episode rule. To tie up to the opening sentence, it's been some time since I've given a <a href=http://noitamina.tv/ target=_blank>noitamina</a> slot Anime (the last time was two years ago), so it's about time I get back on track. I'll see how this goes. The main point here feels like romance so I'll see if it's any better or worse than "Gamers!" that I watched last year.<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoFUDis2qkX4rU-R7NkjhrjNSZh2WTGzbyfWyHh8eWRzQZ5DoIxwf2t4rQMvU7cc4CBcGnF5vmZG5wAzyVoFjnHzBGYaXNv8O2-QBCgEQLoSv-viV3xNDzldRaJ8AvGTRgcV3Wb5aaeFnN/s320/wotakoi01_look1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This show in a nutshell hehe<br><br></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZhkQGv9Oat86G9-ZExJP8BWa6If1a5KtfX9pGcmSIQlkwAHXpw1q2ElzCnObwatQfNu_n6MpggUoZAsY41t0-P4l-ZFN0wxIYMio1Vwd8ajbph3OkmxEQNvKVQij0MRMWnOoS1DVOdvZc/s320/wotakoi01_look2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I mean Momose-san things changed a lot for your childhood friend.<br>Looks, I mean.

I have plans to get the books in physical copy real soon, along with BLEACH and Kuroshitsuji maybe)<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Yes, I've moved on with <b>SID's new Anime best album</b>. Past self deleted the music video link to tell future self to forget about the review. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Sorry, SID. You guys were close.<br><br>Let's talk about new releases this week, yes? <b>ORESAMA's first full album</b> was kind of okay, but yeah because their style is kind of retro it's hard to remove that stereotype when giving the melodies which are already not that impressive. Besides the topic song I have another song which exhibits PON-chan's cuteness (&lt;= hint right there) so I guess that's as much as I'll give it. <b>Goose house's new album</b> probably was easier to give but compared to their previous album with the other member this one was harder to give. I think it's mainly because they added new elements to the song production making it sound more impactful but also more daunting, making me harder to give the first few songs, to be honest. I still settled with a couple of songs though including the one they even had a live version of it if you had the right version of the release (mine's digital so yes it's in the release), and I must say... the two mini-album release back in 2015 were easier to give. And back then I thought I had to force myself to give the two songs just to credit them for the year. This one? It was quick in decision, but not painless. Sorry, guys. I expected something else apparently. Production is great though, I won't deny it.<br><br>I know there's not much next week for Klassic Note, so I better go backtrack and give a couple of songs which I promised to put in the list (<span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span> yucat) and also find out new songs here and there. For example, <b>Middle Kids</b> (the only English group I gave last year) is releasing their first full album (congrats btw) in May, so be sure to check them out. Hmm, what did I write on my Twitter feed... Oh yeah, Keiko has finally confirmed her departure from <b>Kalafina</b> following composer Kajiura-sensei, so be sure to check her comment out. I mean, I'm done with these guys last year already, so whatever haha. Ah yes, PONY CANYON Anime division of artists finally got their entrance in <b>Apple Music</b> (Japan) following K-ON! and other Anime soundtracks, which also means Hikasa Youko (yay Yocchan!), Taketatsu Ayana and Horie Yui will be joining the list of songs I can tag online now haha<br><br><br><br>This is it then. I need to take a good break so tomorrow I can continue to finish that other project I need to present on Wednesday. You guys know data science is a big thing now and is in high demand? Gotta learn that Neural Network implementation code. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Cya guys soon, and until next time... I think I may have to get a missed release that was supposed to be on my shelf. Who is it? I'll reveal it in the next review I guess gotta get a discount from this lol<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
