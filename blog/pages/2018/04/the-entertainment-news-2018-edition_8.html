Oh yeah, don't ask why I'm posting this late again. Ask my mom. Oh, you can't
ask my mom. Well, it's her birthday today, and as celebration she ordered
herself (yep) a karaoke session and my family (was forced and) sang with her for
like... 2 hours. Thank goodness it's over because you guessed it, they don't
sing/listen to Japanese songs. Not like I won't totally embarrass myself by
doing so though. Still. It's hard digging up my history of Chinese songs to sing
to, considering I forgot almost everything lol<br /><br />Happy birthday mom.
This is the last time I'm singing with you haha<br /><br />Okay, let's get to
it. The new season of Anime has started, and I can't wait to talk about it. Even
though thinking about it Random Curiosity probably got it better than this...
English-deficient intellect lol. The other two that I've considered will appear
next week, so these two shall do for now.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Hmm... how should I talk about this show. First things first, I'm NOT going to
watch this series after all, and I'm here to talk about why. To get the last
thing out of the way, the theme songs are... less than passable. Then, there's
the starting part. This definitely feels like your usual romance storyline, but
if I compare to my experience of watching romance shows I'd rather not give it.
Given weird circumstances of just revealing a female in real life to be somewhat
of a snob and loner because of that, I don't think it's good enough of a case to
watch this (typically because I don't like main girls in shows who are like this
I guess), although at the end there's that countdown which if given as a cue to
end the Anime series it might still be good, but no. Then, there's the cast. The
impact based on the cast (I'd like to blame animation more on this) is not
strong enough imo to make me want to watch this till the end, so I'll pass on
that. Then, there's development, or plot line, as we call it. It does seem to
resemble many romance shows that have appeared in the past, but personally
speaking for a 2D guy with actions governed by an Anime character is... really
weird for me considering this is an Anime lol (A Marvel superhero would've been
more convincing you lolicon haha). And then, there's discrimination. Something I
don't think I'll see myself watching this far into the show but I did anyways,
but yeah. Considering the two are going out together with your typical cynical
class in Anime, it's going to see a lot of problems. That, and then the
slice-of-life stuff which of course we'll see... Iroha-san go naked for some
reason, maybe. Then again, Tsutsun (lol) doesn't deserve that, that stuff going
out with the girl. Maybe it's because I don't feel for the circumstances for the
boy who is still a hero compared to his friend Itou (which says a lot about
being the real otaku) (no really the ex-classmates story not convincing enough),
and that might be the pivot point for me to believe that just given this episode
someone who likes 2D stuff would actually care about a 3D girl, even if it came
from a pool cleaning session. So yeah, not convinced tbh. Then again, I'm not
into these types of storylines, so...<br />

Unlike the previous show I just watched, this one punches your guts away the
moment she sees it lol. No, I'm not talking about the main girl. The first
episode of this wonderful Anime original I must say (#TadaKun01) is a good
example of what happens when you start licensing your local shows to an
international audience. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, enough about Rainbow Shogun he's made it
to the opening quote haha. Let's focus on the main topic: the plot. In summary,
you get 4 people. The main guy (<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/people/513/Yuuichi_Nakamura"
  target="_blank"
  >Nakamura Yuuichi</a
>, if you still can't recognise his voice yet), his joke friend (thanks
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/65/Mamoru_Miyano" target="_blank"
  >Miyano Mamoru</a
>
once again literally THE PERFECT GUY to act such roles), the main girl (who is
surprisingly foreign and totally suitable for this role after the first time I
hear
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/44317/Manaka_Iwami" target="_blank"
  >Iwami Makana</a
>
from "<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/149318/Chiaki_Hoshinomori"
  target="_blank"
  >Gamers!</a
>" tbh) and her jerk friend (which brings us to the opening sentence) and you
get - you guessed it - a romance show!! Hey, perfect recipe as it is, I have a
feeling it'll only get better. Let's talk about the good stuff. You get subtle
jokes, crazy fictional references (the book, "always make your heart rain-" okay
I'll stop), an obvious plot hopefully with a conclusion (if you still didn't
hear the "-sama" reference from Alec-san), a wonderful cat with its own blog
(MVP this episode btw) and a basis to share in interests: photography. As you
can observe, it runs in the family. Tada-kun's family, to say the least. As for
Teresa? I don't know. What we do know is this will be one of the many great
avenues for them to socialise, and hey, who says this is not the best way to do
relationships? I'm totally in on this show already I'll tell you first, mainly
because of the joke levels of comedy that'll keep me around, and the reduced
emphasis on what's to come for now. Hey, the girls even "infiltrated" the
school; what else of a classic plot line do you want? Don't ask me why because
they probably have their intentions for coming here (clearly it's not just an
overseas trip), but considering the title of this show I just hope they're here
to find a husband? *shock* Oops.
<a href="http://jisho.org/search/zuboshi" target="_blank">Zu-bo-shi</a>? Haha
probably not. (Sorry that was a Tsurezure Children reference I'm so sorry I
shouldn't have done it)<br />[TWO THUMBNAILS BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP MYSELF!!!]<br />

P.S. "Someday you'll be-" Haha don't you LOVE those truck-drive speech
censors?<br />P.P.S. *hears ending song* *falls down* Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
presenting to you (if you didn't read the credits or can't) the main girl's
cover of Sambomaster's "Love Song" from 2009. <i>Man</i>, that's old. I know I
did get a hint from the official website but I didn't expect it to sound like
this tbh<br />(Okay I know it's from the
<strike>same guy</strike>&nbsp;production team that brought us "Gekkan Shoujo
Nozaki-kun" but I don't care. I know of this show even if I didn't watch those
from back then. Gives us good reason to say why this one would stand out more
and I'll watch it too. So yeah, don't think too much about it. Also, great
soundtrack once again from Hashimoto Yukari-san because I've known her since
Toradora! already. Concidence?)<br />

The new chapters (122-123) are kind of differently, so I'll summarise them
separately. The former chapter is about senbei, and how Kokonotsu managed to
convince Hajime-san to the other side (lol) by treating her to specially made
dagashi, and yeah, I don't think I've eaten both ways before. The later chapter
is a part of the ending to the season two Anime where Kokonotsu tries to rush
the deadline to submit to a manga professional, and his friends came to help
along with Hajime-san. Man, the bonding when Hotaru-chan isn't here haha<br />

Hmm nothing much has been in Klassic Note this week I guess, and
<b>if you've been following me on Twitter</b> (which you totally should, I
rarely post stuff now haha I'm just lazy) you'll notice a couple of stuff, from
the Anime stuff above to certain weird stuff like replying to Endou Yurika on
her recommendation to a new age instrumental artist ichika and I must say...
it's real weird. It's totally off-beat, an unusual use of acoustics, and
everything else doesn't fall into place at all. Hmm, I'm not into this, I guess.
<b>Ajikan's best album</b> probably will come into conclusion next week, along
with <b>yucat's new mini-album</b> because she liked my Tweet haha I decided to
take a look again maybe I'll give something<br /><br />Next week brings us
<b>ORESAMA's first full album</b> in which I'll probably give the topic song in
entry to listening to their whole release which I totally should before giving
up. <b>Goose house's new album</b> will also appear next week (w00ts) so maybe
I'll get some consolation after going through another crazy week. Really, it's
terrible.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is it then. I'm kinda tired after all the
singing (even though I didn't sing much) (and I'm depressed when I notice my
singing voice sounds REAL flat lol) so yeah this shall be it. I'm also
considering to change back my life to a life of listening to more new songs
instead of lurking around YouTube and giving ad money to Google all day lol. But
yeah, you get the point. To listen to music requires a mood, and I'm losing a
lot of it. Which easily explains why I'm delaying the reviews every time because
I just don't make decisions as promptly as before anymore. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Cya guys next
week.
