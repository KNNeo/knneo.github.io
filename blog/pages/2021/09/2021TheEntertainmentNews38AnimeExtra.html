I'm literally writing this on the train haha because I CAN'T WAIT TO BE DONE
WITH TODAY DUDE!! lol okay me chill don't mix work with this
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Happy birthday Horie Yui!! Ah, what a deserving
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUB7t2olG1u/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">17th birthday</a>
  to celebrate, dear Hocchan. I love that
  <a href="https://twitter.com/kuronekounion/status/1439615850546270208?s=20" target="_blank">her birthday wish to be prettier</a>
  wow what a great time to start she is already a beauty how can she be
  prettier- Okay in case you didn't detect the sarcasm lol, she's 45 and if you
  think voice actresses in Japan have no shticks she ran this for a quarter of a
  century haha well I feel bad now let's stop
</div>
<div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    On a heavier note, happy birthday also to my first ever crush in middle
    school. It was like yesterday: We were in a new school, she moved house to
    this new neighbourhood all alone, and I was one of many people to talk to.
    Well, not so much face to face but still. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey, I wished I got her into some
    stupid promise that if we are still single when we reach 30 we'll be
    together. You know, for insurance? Haha okay I feel bad for myself now let's
    stop
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    Since we can't talk about birthdays anymore lol, let's talk about why
    there's this extra post which could've been on a Sunday. As elaborated
    yesterday, in a nutshell I thought wrapping the below two series up today
    would be great in view of (1) talking about next season this weekend which
    will also be a lighter load since we'll have only "Sonny Boy" left in
    preparation for the new season of Anime, and (2) some wedding ceremony I have
    to attend provided I can even pay for the swab test. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Let's talk
    about Anime!!

    So, uh, this Nagisa now is voiced by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu" target="_blank">Ayachi</a> or by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/47669/Saki_Miyashita" target="_blank">Miyashita</a>? Haha I don't
    even know now also come on we got more important things to talk about! In
    this final episode of the series I thought was two seasons long
    (#TanMoshi12), it's
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rifujin" target="_blank">ridiculous</a>
    how this hasn't ended yet. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey, I gotta take a word from Kimizuka.
    So, story. Again, this is an adaptation of the original novel series, so
    take the last part of it with a pinch of salt. I'll tell you (where I think is) when, so let's
    continue. Story goes that we still be fighting Chameleon, just that at this
    point, we got Nagisa to help. Yes, that girl who got kidnapped by the baddie
    and saved by the sidekick, dropped into the ocean and saved by Saikawa, you
    with me so far? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So anyways, the fact is still real, Nagisa did that
    heart transplant with Siesta on it, so just like the flashback we saw in the
    previous episode, Siesta just took over the body to deal with this half
    android with the sidekick. Siesta's still dead though; It's on the title,
    don't forget. This is still a thing though, and as they reminisce the days
    they were together over the three years we totally only just saw less than
    half a year lol, yeah it was just a joyride for this series in general, I
    guess. As for Siesta's... revival? Yeah, it's mainly just a lifeline to be
    honest, saving their sorry butts off this bad guy so hopefully the group now
    as we have seen so far can bring themselves together to finish what the
    detective has set to do: take down SPES. We're not going to be on that ride
    though unless you continue with the original. But it sure was entertaining.
    On the epilogue which is basically half this episode to be honest, blah blah
    go away Charlotte and Fuubi-san haha, we talk about whatever date in the bar
    Kimizuka had with Nagisa apparently, just never dressed in tandem which says
    a lot about their rapport lol. Turns out, unlike the one with Hel stealing
    Siesta's heart, this time around, Nagisa let Siesta take over for a while.
    Whether that'll make Kimizuka happy or not we have seen for ourselves the
    answer is no lmao, so yeah, in case you thought Nagisa didn't have a role to
    play in this arc, think again. It's not much though, so don't ponder on for
    too long. And after the credits... Well really, just think about how Siesta
    kept saying she is prepared right from the start. So yeah, you should NEVER be surprised. This is a short write-up for the episode as it's a short
    ending, so let's summarize by talking about what was good about this animated series.
    Firstly, boobs. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey, not that, that is actually what I see AFTER I
    gave the series, trust me. But I'm just putting that aside lest you guys
    lash me for not mentioning it haha. Second, simplicity of plot. I won't say
    the Alicia/Hel thing is simple as it is talking about SPES and their lack of
    intel in this adaptation, but everything else from Siesta being the ultimate
    detective with Kimizuka being sidekick solving mysteries on his own without
    the girl, it all made sense if you don't think too much into it. Think James Bond if kids knew what that is now lol. For the Anime production, I say they did it
    well. Lastly, everything else in bits and pieces. From the stellar (female) (haha) voice cast
    (seriously who gives a shit about Kimi) to the theme songs which arguably
    might be the best of the four I've watched this season, to the haphazard
    action scenes which will make any Siesta fight cooler than Charlotte shooting
    from a helicopter haha, there will be something that can catch your
    attention even if it's from the one-hour special on the plane. Now, what was not
    great. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I don't really watch many action series, but I think it's enough for
    me to say in this. Seeing as this is from a novel series, I will cut it some
    slack because how are you going to dictate a detailed action series better
    than a manga artist haha. So yep, next up, the animation. Yes, literally, "Shinigami
    Bocchan" as we will watch later and is mostly run by 3DCG with magic powers,
    is still better. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> I can give you examples using screenshots to
    convince you but you may have noticed something yourself at some point. And that, if you
    are here for action, I'm sorry to disappoint because it wasn't my fault. And
    then, the gaps in logic of the story. Not exactly obvious, they won't have
    enough time to say it even if we give an extra episode-length headstart, but
    having Siesta being the solution and intelligence in everything is total
    convenience for an action storyline without even trying. Meaning, I rather
    watch people die in "BLEACH" (or not) and then you give me the simple
    solution than just give me the answer from the start: That's what I felt
    after watching Siesta dominate her opponent on the plane. It's too smart.
    It's only when Kimizuka takes over and Siesta moving into a secondary role
    that made this series good because that advantage is "lost". Lastly, and I think this is kind of important
    but not really, the lack of impact. By the time you watch Siesta come in to
    fight alongside Kimizuka, you already know Chameleon is never gonna win, and
    they are just toying with their prey now. There are no cliffhangers within
    the action, no one gets harmed... even Siesta getting hit by that monster AND DIED in
    SPES HQ also looked like a joke haha. It basically lacks the kick it needs to
    make it really good and awesome. I don't know how you
    can fix this considering it's a flaw in the series seeing how the story
    panned out, but I've been kind. The Anime did end on a proper note, if
    everything isn't planned this would've been cooler, and now I rather do
    Nagisa because Siesta is dead already lol okay I'm done</div><div>

    </blockquote>
    Wow, I'm in awe. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Okay I gotta do this quick we are falling behind
    I still need to work tomorrow haha. In this final episode of a series that
    has only made me happy (#ShinigamiBocchan12), in this one we will be a
    little sad. Just a little just because. Story goes that in the previous episode sadly
    ignoring the Daleth thing with Sharon because we'll get to that at some point maybe,
    Bocchan got invited into the main mansion by of all people, the mother. With
    this episode though, we do know a little more about her and the family
    situation as of now. Feels awkward to talk about this right at the end of
    this series but yes, you can take a hint. <span title="*wink*">üòâ</span> So, mainly because Bocchan has
    only seen her mother since he was five if you would recall, he having to
    return to what is his home is kinda unsettling. You know, because there's
    the one who will never dare to acknowledge his son because she thinks her
    child is a time bomb or something lol. We'll summarize what she did talk
    about to her eldest son in a moment, but I would like to discuss a bit about
    the house and what happened of Sharon. Interestingly, Sharon who is Alice's
    mother, shared a friendly relationship with Bocchan's mother, clearly likely
    because of the head maid and mistress- Yeah you get the idea. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But
    more importantly, we now know that Alice was passed on to her relative
    because Sharon passed away. How though? We have no idea. It's as if someone didn't want her to witness her mother's death... We also know about
    the moment Bocchan got cursed, and how it happened. Basically an ambush,
    some woman hugged him from behind in front of a grave which yes we can't see
    the front view of the tombstone anyways, the woman was a powerful magician who instantly
    casted a curse on him in seconds, and she had a rack. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> That
    could've been anybody. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> ANYWAYS haha, and before we hit the final
    conflict on the dining table which yes looks like the one in the past across
    the long table lol, we also touched on the aristocracy we so love and
    treasure a century ago haha. Okay, jokes aside, that means you do not have
    any freedom on the decisions and all decisions are done in the face of
    reputation and upholding the household values, whatever they are. So yeah,
    in case you wondered, Walter thought of freedom if Bocchan became head of
    the household, is probably what he was angry about. So yeah, each one for
    themselves, but all within the same cage. And finally I can't believe how
    they can drag it this long, the confrontation. No fist fighting, no really
    it's not even an argument here the mother didn't talk back she normally just talks OVER her kids haha, but we were given a little family background after knowing
    this family for so long. So so far, the father was missing in action clearly
    but because the dad is ill and bedridden, which will explain how the mother
    has been making the decisions thus far. And with a traumatised past some I could
    say came from a cursed child (no, not talking about Harry Potter), we can
    see the mother is indeed under a lot of pressure, should her husband pass
    away without anyone to actually take over the household. Yep, our bro
    aristocracy strikes back again, because women can't lead the family.
    <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Anyways, the mother's point is that, if Bocchan can't get his
    curse done in half a year tops, Walter will be chosen to lead the household.
    Ironically that is the worst case scenario for both of them since the elder
    doesn't mind leading but has a curse and <strike>the younger</strike> THE
    SECOND (haha I'm sorry Walter I gotta) has to take over the household
    just because the brother is incapable of doing his rightful duty. Hey, what
    else is new. But yeah, this might change in the future, if they can actually
    resolve this sooner or later. But nonetheless, that didn't stop Bocchan from
    talking about Alice which I must say, is the topic of conversation in the
    house lol. From literally saving his life from the ashes, to raising him up,
    to making him understand hope and love again... Alice has only been an angel
    just as much as (since we know that) Bocchan has also saved her. But yeah,
    in the face of our bro -trocacy, Bocchan reprimanded her mother for
    disrespecting the position of the maid for literally saving his life, and
    also declaring his promise to make Alice part of the household. You know, that
    way. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But yeah, this must have been the most satisfying ending for
    any series EVER. And we're not even done yet. *Alice wink* All in all...
    okay please let me say it already, <a href="https://twitter.com/bocchan_anime/status/1439582550112890886" target="_blank">the sequel was announced on Twitter</a>; It's
    as if they planned it. I can't say I don't want it though, for I can tell
    you so much I love about this series. I want more shrewd comedy at the worst
    times from where they are all drinking soup and the disrespectful mother
    started talking about inheritance lol wtf mom can't you even (haha) to how
    everyone's character is uniquely dumb as it's entertaining (haha <i>second</i>)
    (lmao see?), it will only make you enjoy this series more than you think. I
    want more - and I can't believe I am saying this - more animation here because
    the animated series has not pissed me off one bit as I continue to immerse
    more along with the standard Anime expressions and reactions that can still
    be expressed despite the use of 3D technology which is still in debatable
    quality even today. I want more fanservice because what is this series
    without Alice and everyone with a rack besides Viola lmao, and I want more
    of the overall wholesomeness we get every episode. I know the story is potentially dull
    and even depressing, but that is what will make you appreciate Bocchan and
    his life in the old mansion so much. We are literally in the feels of
    Bocchan right now, minus the curse of course, to know how good of a series
    this was. And will be, once we get to the sequel. I cannot recommend more,
    even if you like to nit pick on the animation, this is as emotional and
    entertaining as Anime storytelling can get, and I'm so happy I picked this
    up in the first place, just like how Alice came in to pick Bocchan up from his darkest time. And just like Bocchan finding a solution to his curse, I would like to see this series animated till the end, if
    they can do it of course. I think it deserves its own conclusion, for what
    it has become so far. There's still so much lore waiting to be discovered,
    and I can only imagine what will be of Bocchan, should he be able to touch
    Alice for real. We can really only so anything else but wait. And I'll be damned when the good news happens
    haha remember to not put in the long narrated intros for the sequel okay? lol</div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

    P.S. "I may be scared, but that doesn't mean I don't want to meet (my
    mother)" Yeah but she's such a piece of sh*t for literally abandoning you
    so... <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> Parenthood, huh.

    [Okay in the mother's defence? She is already kind enough to not exert
    herself over the lives of her children mainly because without the husband's
    guidance (and God knows if he's the real villain in the series lol) and also it can be
    seen from for example she only mentions the impact of Viola's fashion sense
    on the family reputation and never once did she force her to change out since the one time she did it it's only just escorting, already shows
    how... magnanimous? She has already been so far. Not to say she doesn't have
    a temper, but who knows? Maybe she can still be a good mom. Definitely not
    as bad as Sayu's mom in "HigeHiro", God that bitch was a literal-]

    <br /><br />Like seriously, how long was this post supposed to be? I know it's
    only Monday, me, but CHILL OUT!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Because problem is, I did intend
    to talk about another short web series which I intend to write at length so... I
    think we can just talk about it briefly I guess. As you might have known,
    <b>"Ganbare Douki-chan"</b> which was a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/doujin" target="_blank">doujin</a> series I've followed since
    last year if you have seen my packages lol, has actually gotten itself
    animated (which apparently isn't surprising since it isn't the author's first but it did quickly gain traction online), and boy does it come with viewing restrictions basically saying if
    you not in Japan don't even think about it but apparently it got licensed in
    Southeast Asia through YouTube so yay me but yeah I watched
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLONTO2tGHY" target="_blank">the first episode</a>
    this morning on the train this morning and I think that might be a bad idea lmao. So
    yeah, it was fine, just happy to see it animated, and don't ask if I will
    ever buy the Blu-Ray set or something. Just no I'll just take the books- IS THAT A CHARACTER THEME SONG!?? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Cya guys this
