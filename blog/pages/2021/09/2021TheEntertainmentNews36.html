Well, it's Sunday, guys, you know what that means...
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  It's time for me to play more simulation games so I can forget that I have to
  watch Anime this week- Maybe reviewing Anime was a mistake. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah,
  I need to get that itch off watching shows and this is the best way I know how
  without finding friends to talk to about this because like they watch the
  stuff I do, so here we are. Man, did we come a long way. Remember when this
  place was just text and just a year ago it was about photobook reviews?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Haha okay jokes aside, let's talk music and Anime once again! Still more
  exciting than my own life which I rather not mention because just ask me
  whether I've changed jobs over the last week to make things interesting
  lmao even my sis changed jobs<br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Well, "finally some action" is something I normally wouldn't say, but I think
  I said that for a lot of action series which refuse to give more action every
  episode so here we are. And amongst all this action, we have a conclusion. You
  know what I'm talking about. Yes, ignoring the title drop, in this new episode
  (#TanMoshi09) we infiltrate the SPES headquarters where they are supposedly at thanks
  to Chameleon dropping the hint to us... I have a feeling that they dropped a
  lot of context in this episode since probably the original manga would've
  elaborated, but nonetheless, let's see how much I can decipher from this
  aggression alone. So, the trio ie. best couple (lol) along with Charlotte go
  to that island off whatever country we were in to stop those guys, or as
  Siesta (RIP) has elaborated we are going in to get rid of Hel and rescue
  Alicia? So first things you would ask yourself is didn't Chameleon talk about
  how supposedly Hel changed form and became Alicia? I guess he was also
  deceived but maybe not, because with the reveal of actual alien character Seed
  who let's just say it is just an alien literally, went on and talked about
  itself being the cause of SPES and why it is trying to survive probably
  eliminating and living off humans in order to be around on this planet, so as
  to say. It's disgusting, that pile of corpses didn't help much, but there's
  more. Chameleon showed his face ironically with the obvious intention to stop
  them from leaving, but Charlotte took care of him I guess so Kimizuka got the
  runaway to find Siesta (RIP) who might be in danger. And here's where the drop
  is. If you haven't been hinted by me so far as with Siesta's (RIP) fate then
  go watch the episode before you continue from here. Or just read between the brackets I've put down enough of those now haha. Anyways, looks like
  Chameleon is truly one of his name, since besides being a distraction, he also
  was fighting against Siesta outside of the headquarters? Okay, TanMoshi, ELI5 (ie. Explain like I'm 5) (I should stop using old abbreviations lol) how this would've made sense to us because I can't comprehend this already
  lol. But never mind, no matter what the case is, Hel got to them somehow. And
  because Siesta (RIP) is a genius, she figured out that Alicia and Hel aren't
  both of the same thing, but coincidentally, both under the same thing, that
  Seed thing. So yeah, call him Daddy or something, but yeah, his two daughters
  apparently have different opinions of this planet, it seems. Alicia kind of
  likes this world so much so she would rather part with her evil self which is
  probably on Hel at this point or maybe it's the other way around, but yeah,
  Alicia rather not believe this world is getting eliminated by the father I
  suppose. On the other hand, we have Hel who is inherently jealous of the
  sister I think, and is bent on following that Bible and just like the dad, is
  bent on eliminating any humans getting in their way of operations. A robot of
  sorts, I would argue. You know, to get the affection back from the father, if
  there is any in the first place. Do aliens know love? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But hey, these
  two do, Siesta and Kimizuka, they have a spiritual bond which will stop them from killing each
  other even under Hel's psychic command. Sure, man. Doesn't mean we can't kill
  them separately. Then blah blah blah monster comes out from nowhere so yes I
  was right it was to feed this thing all along since that fight, and Siesta (RIP) tried
  to save Kimizuka? Yeah, this is the part I was confused about, and then Siesta
  (RIP) (okay me we get it) dropped dead on the ground. This time, probably not
  breathing already. Because as Hel somewhat protected these two (lol thanks)
  from that monster by stabbing it on the head, Hel is suffering substantial
  damage but instead of just dying like a good antagonist lol, she, uh, took
  over Kimizuka's place as detective? Ugh. Title drop, I guess, and they had to
  show the unscientific way to heart transplant, huh. Well, at least Siesta isn't
  screaming while her heart got ripped out. *gags* Ugh, I don't feel too well.
  <span title="*pukes*">🤮</span> A-Anyways, Kimizuka can only watch of course as his buddy got her
  heart ripped out because remember the psychic powers? And Hel lives to see another day- Hold on, hold on... WHAT??
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yep, so, to conclude ignoring it was part of Kimizuka's dream since
  this probably did happen it was a flashback anyways he's just reliving the
  past... how is Nagisa's heart here as is now? Yep, gotta start thinking guys,
  before Kimizuka goes to sleep again and we have to see some level of crying
  scene that is not going to happen just because. But yeah, that's got us a lot
  to think about. All in all, this episode... I think besides the title drop
  because yep I've waited for weeks for this lol, the animation for the fighting
  was rather disappointing because for example why didn't the monster tentacles
  move as they rise up from the ground (yeah), and other than that, I guess it's too
  convenient a way of storytelling, just like every other action series, I
  guess. I mean, the storytelling could've been better, I'll give you that.
  Other than that, you would be glad I'm still on this bandwagon despite the
  death of the best character of this season lmao (okay Kimizuka go hug her now
  I guess lol and if you don't I'll do it <span title="*sob*">😢</span>), and we shall see if this
  flashback if some prophecy for current events in this storyline going forward.
  I highly doubt so since what's dead is dead unless you're that Seed thing but
  who knows? Siesta (RIP) might be an alien or Hel's sister something, I don't know. Haha cya
  guys next time while I go mourn on Siesta's corpse- YOU RUINED HER CHEST TOO
  HEL!!!! YOU BITCH WHY CAN'T YOU OPEN HER UP FROM THE BACK??? lol okay me say
  sorry to Siesta you doofus
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; When you learnt that agony is never being able to hug Siesta again lol
  Kimizuka why don't you understand this]

  </blockquote>
  Please, Walter, Rob is not a creep Bocchan is more of a creep since he has that
  curse on him haha ah. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where we can talk about
  Christmas now just three months earlier (#ShinigamiBocchan09), yay this is
  actually a happy episode. Well, as happy as it gets, we still have some stupid
  family issues to deal with. But OTHER THAN THAT!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, let's get
  that out of the way first, is the mom's knowledge of what her kids have been
  doing. Last time, we know that the mom knows Viola has been leaving house as
  and when she likes and skipping meals with the family, and boy oh boy the brother
  is also covering it up for her, so yeah, essentially she doesn't know where her daughter is going unlike maybe the servants haha, even though we know it's to see Rob
  lmao. But yeah, just that Rob is in the same mansion as Bocchan, the one the
  mother warns of not visiting due to his curse or something. But nope, that's
  not going to stop Walter the brother from disguising as the only companion ie.
  the driver, to go to the mansion with Viola on that two-hour ride in the snow-
  TWO!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways haha, before they arrive, we can talk about Cuff and
  Zain, essentially Bocchan's only friends he made purely by coincidence. Well,
  if you would remember it almost became an arson if not for Cuff being nice
  enough to ask for food instead of taking it by force, but yeah, Zain talks
  about more stuff about his companion which is shown in contrast to Alice I
  guess, but hey, I believe that Alice is too much for me. It's like that
  Goldilocks story where Alice is the Papa porridge and Cuff is the just-nice
  bowl of porridge. You with me? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But yeah, personality might be a
  problem considering one's a maid and the other is just a spoiled brat who
  wants to be recognized by the buddy lmao. Speaking of spoiled brats *gets
  burnt into a crisp* (lol Cuff I like you too Zain's the one who can't express
  himself), Viola arrived with the "driver" lol poor mom eating alone at the
  main mansion, and we dive into Walter's secret mission of scoping the
  brother's abode? Sure, James Bond, whatever. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes, this guy is probably also
  a spoilt brat, going off how much he thinks he's being ridiculed for
  inheriting the family but not so much so being cursed by a witch that might
  never be removed? Hey bro, you don't know anything. Moving on, he managed to sneak in
  to the mansion which has occupants I can count with one hand without being
  noticed lol, he found a Santa outfit which looks like it's meant for Rob which
  would probably be more interesting if it's on him so we can hear Viola squeal
  more haha, but yeah this dude wore it as disguise and got mistaken as "Santa"
  by Cuff because she believes in Santa and doesn't know it's actually your
  parents who put the presents under the tree every year. *sshh* And Walter gave the present he found on the ground which Viola dropped and
  gave it to Cuff while perfectly pulling off his disguise... To be honest? I
  thought Rob would appear and he wouldn't notice Walter so he can sneak in
  perfectly because yes lol Rob can't see or hear for shit. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah,
  Walter appeared in front of the others through the chimney because how you
  gonna arrive as Santa without a chimney lol, and I think the only thing we need
  to get out of Cuff refusing to give Viola her present from Santa and almost
  went to burn it because of a "poisonous flower" lol, is that Walter wants a
  showdown with Bocchan on who is to inherit the family title. So yeah, breaking
  the curse, apparently. With two half-witches here and a trip to the wizarding
  world (GO AWAY HARRY) (lol) Bocchan takes the challenge with confidence.
  Because if this brother can help break his curse, he'll probably be happy
  living without the title, BEING SECOND in the house haha, and be with Alice forever. Because I would.
  <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> All in all, it was fun, they had a Christmas insert song which actually
  doesn't sound too bad this well likely get into my music collection, Walter was sad
  because he had to create a cool exit for his pitch to the brother but forgot
  he's the driver so he had to wait for Viola outdoors lmao, and we got some conclusion
  to the flashback we saw last week. Yeah, that's real cool there, that last
  part haha. This episode definitely paid off for the sadness last week and
  monotonous feels the week before, I must say. And we're near the end so you
  think Walter has a solution to Bocchan's curse yet? Haha maybe we'll find out
  in the next few episodes, who knows?

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Yes, this is the enjoy-all-you-want buffet style happiness (sadly with Milika)
  but until the drop actually happens just like Anime "KoiKimo" and
  "HigeHiro"... just as Saki-chan said, let's enjoy it now! In this new episode
  where we do the onsen thing because the trio technically haven't went on a
  proper date (#KanoKano10), ah wow I didn't really expect things to go any
  other ways but, but then again considering the author I'm glad he exists to
  make this as screwed up of a situation as possible even with Naoya's smooth
  brain explaining his innermost desires. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, he's just pushing it throughout this episode, huh. Haha anyways, story. Story goes that last week
  because of you know what happened, the trio decided, or Naoya decided, that a
  date will be a great way to foster their relationship(s) in time for such a
  situation to happen again, but yeah, it's as smooth as it can go. With them
  excited for the trip, the three of them go shopping for clothes, and the two
  girls then realized that honestly speaking? They can't be all at Naoya at
  once, not even for the kissing. I mean, a 3* is fine, but yeah, this is no
  porno and we still have some moral values to hold lol, so... maybe not? Besides, we have a nice Nagisa-chan here who is also technically the 2nd
  girlfriend in this relationship moving aside such that the two can actually
  have some time together to, you know, probably clock in some more time
  compared to Naoya with Milika-san haha. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay jokes aside, but that's
  how it works. Nagisa has lack of fashion tastes but we know like, Nagisa-chan
  is putting in so much effort to make Saki-chan like, stand out in front of
  Naoya to the extent Saki-chan thinks it's unnecessary (ah hey, Nagisa used the
  same effort to get Naoya to get your boy into two-timing so go figure), Shion is smart to try
  to ask Naoya to talk to (because if it's her friend SakiSaki she'll lie until
  the sun sets down lol but too bad) but her shyness is probably stopping her
  from doing so so... oh well next time haha, and Naoya feels like he has been
  followed. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, you know who is stalking him. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, as
  they prepare for the trip, Shion did however try to get to know of where her
  friend is going to stay at, so I guess she is just going to find out the hard way.
  Hard as in hard truth. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yep, now that the stage is set up
  to collapse beautifully, let's go to Hakone! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Besides knowing that it's a relief that
  Naoya is declaring his love on the train and holding hands with TWO girls at
  once in public until they reach the abode lmao, we also know that it is really
  hard to explain to this blockhead that it's just weird to be doing so on
  contrary to like, talking softly and holding hands with ONE girl and not
  thinking that advancement in relationship is doing whatever he's thinking of so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Yeah, this show is f**ked up. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What's more f**ked up is at the
  entrance of the hot spring hotel, yes. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In summary, surprise surprise
  Milika-san is there for Naoya so that's a problem we predicted since the previous
  episode lol, but also, Shion is there. Yep. We're screwed. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But just
  as the friend of SakiSaki can confirm this and I can't imagine what she will
  do in this situation, Nagisa came in and paired with Rika-san such that (1)
  Shion won't suspect that these two are just these two lol and (2) since she's
  here for support role she can get a hold on Milika so that she won't climb
  through the walls to find Naoya- <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Sadly, that's just part of the story
  to deal with, since they still have to keep up with this farce. With Milika
  ready to take action any time of the day, is the problem. Naoya appears in the
  room they are in with that outdoor balcony hot spring- man can we have that
  here lol (Audience: We are 1 degree above the equator bro) (I know haha) just
  to catch them soaking in the bath but no matter (I know right it doesn't
  matter? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> YES lol) Naoya is here to take Nagisa back to their room. He
  argues that since Shion will see her walking to their room he bravely
  suggested to do that "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35821/Chio-chan_no_Tsuugakuro" target="_blank">Chio-chan</a>" stunt by
  <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lmLymMfWQYg/YTSjUkEDqOI/AAAAAAABHvE/Yex9IFOBL8837jml649FdS5F7l_MbDdgwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/chiochan01_preconstruct.jpg" target="_blank">walking on rooftops</a>
  (Kids, do not try this at home) (lol) to get to each other's rooms- Hey,
  remember how screwed up the storytelling is in this series? Yep. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Nagisa was like "no way", so she quickly gets clothed (lol no shit dude you
  just walked in to two naked women) and ran away so that Milika-san can get her way with him
  alone. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Uh oh. UH OH. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, great episode as usual the
  production definitely did take care of making sure it's as messy of a maze as
  it should be every episode, and instead of focusing our attention at Shion which will
  be our actual gatekeeper because why drag Saki-chan's mom into this lol, we
  have to deal with, yet again, the most irritating bimbo not in a relationship
  ever voiced by a married woman in this two-timing romance series... did I just
  summarize half of this Anime series lmao cya guys next time

  Haha I like how Mizuho is trying to train this "dog" even though he's
  technically a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> in this world lol Mizuho can you don't. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Aren't
  you also into cats? Oh yeah that's from the grandma. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new
  episode where we go all mellow and quiet talking about
  <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/regret-new-rec-version/1536317553?i=1536318058&amp;l=en" target="_blank">regrets</a>
  (#SonnyBoy08), I must say I'm liking this ASMR from
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/591/Kenjirou_Tsuda" target="_blank">Tsuda Kenjirou</a>, no joke. Never expected an episode full of storytelling with his voice, but
  here we are. Also, if you didn't notice guest appearances like
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana</a>
  (I got spoiled from <a href="https://twitter.com/Ayana_take/status/1433460545298915337?s=19" target="_blank">her retweet</a> of this episode specifically) (so, so much
  Ayachi this season haha) and <strike>Kamiya Hiroshi</strike>&nbsp;I found out
  it's
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/68/Kouji_Yusa" target="_blank">the guy who voiced Gin in "BLEACH"</a>
  (and Lilium in "ACCA"- How did I mistake him for the other? lol I'm so sorry) then you
  need to watch more Anime. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, let's talk about the story that Yamabiko did with the ASMR-level low tones, yes? Haha oh well I can't do that I'm
  not that sexy. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, shall we? The guys in the island mainly Nagara's
  bunch were still stuck together alone by themselves so far, knowing how every
  other faction is moving other ways from Nagara in search of... I don't know
  what lol, but yeah, Mizuho tipped on Yamabiko to talk about his past, or
  basically just, how he transformed into a dog. But it turns out, we may have
  dug out a more deeper story than we have asked for, so let's talk all about
  it. Yamabiko when he was still human got adrift with his classmates at some
  point, but left them just because. But unlike Nagara who can just create new
  worlds and be in there, he just travelled. For a really long time, until he
  was discovered possible unconscious by another group of students led by some
  girl with the Star Wars "The Force" powers literally, Kodama. Kodama, as we have seen,
  has the positive powers to change stuff, obviously mostly for the better, and
  managed to save her group of followers (lol) so far, probably even including
  Yamabiko who refuses to gang with them even if Kodama gives him chance to do
  so. We'll come back to that later, but suffice it to say even if she did as he
  succumbed to her kindness, it was also all for nothing because I guess a
  mental epidemic struck the community, with everyone (ironically) besides
  himself getting some weird virus which brings them despair and deteriorated
  their bodies until they drop dead- Oh so you can die in this world, uh oh.
  <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Anyways, one day, as Kodama found another person with the virus but
  this time, they all suspect this dude is likely the guy who brought the virus
  because he looks worse off already, but also, despite his honesty by saying
  Kodama is ugly with that virus on her face and eyes ugh ok haha, Kodama also
  wanted to do something for this new guy, just like what she did with Yamabiko
  too. But interestingly, this new guy gave her some medal for killing people?
  Yeah okay, this doesn't make much sense until he dropped the bomb on the now
  doggo, because precisely, he's here to spread the virus since Yamabiko can't
  make the decision for himself. To save all of them. Yes, he's trapped in his
  world, with the bunch of them. Think of like, how some of the worlds have
  leaders already? Yes, but he's rejective of himself as he mentions to Kodama,
  and that's precisely why the girl wants him to think for himself. See? This
  world does make sense if you think about it- Nope, nope, no way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (lol rejection) But that's
  also how, after being around for so long, knowing that his powers were to
  materialize what was in his mind. And since he's thinking of regret pretty
  much all the time, it doesn't make of a good world to live in, to say the least. Again,
  just like some others including Nagara, it's something very introvert and
  downward-spiralling, you wish you can stop thinking like this now lol oh well
  me try harder. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, Yamabiko took probably centuries in his time
  of flow to get out of his own shell, and that's how he saw these guys. Hey,
  it's for the better now that everyone in your world is dead. RIP everyone
  including Kodama who taught him the way. And you too,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sensou" target="_blank">War</a>, you helped
  a lot too. (Not doing that "Rush Hour" reference) All in all, a mellow episode
  to even swallow, but I liked it. It kept me at peace, and gave ample times for
  realization and plot twist (as a world creator Yamabiko also heard that voice
  too, go figure), but probably did not help in further understanding in this
  world apart from yes, the one guy who brought the virus here, War himself. But
  Nagara might be right: It might not be able to change anything. Remember what
  this was again? The principal as God's great joke? So yeah, War's objective
  might still seem bleak after all this while. Also, he wasn't with that
  leaders' group we have heard of last week, and is likely acting on his own
  accord. Don't think of how many people he actually killed though he probably
  blamed on the weakness of the people in those worlds just like how he dealt
  with Yamabiko's. For that, Nagara has a lot to think about going forward. And
  we should too. Cya guys next week haha oh the soundtrack of the episode
  replaced the theme song btw
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; If this episode is too tough to understand for you: "Her (Kodama's)
  wish was to walk together with me (Yamabiko) in the outside world,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/soredake" target="_blank">that's all</a>"
  And no, not Futatsuboshi reference here lol]

  <div>
    As mentioned last week, this week was labelled "Hololive member songs" on my
    calendar so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, I've gone through the list, so let me bring
    out my notes to see what I've commented (lol) (also only songs I gave will
    come with links):
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        <b>Tsunomaki Watame's new songs</b> and I'm not talking about the weekly
        releases this month alone but before that, those two of them were nice
        specifically
        <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/melody-for-you-single/1574269076?l=en" target="_blank">this</a>
        and
        <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/mayday-mayday-single/1581059071?l=en" target="_blank">that</a>, but I prefer the latter so let's see how many songs I can give her.
        She's aiming for solo artist levels of songs in case you wonder.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        Moving on, didn't expect myself to give
        <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tokusya-seizon-wonder-la-der-single/1581057783?l=en" target="_blank">Amane Kanata's 1st song</a></b>
        because ironically I share the same affinity with UNISON SQUARE GARDEN
        recently with that composer on hand (what's his name, Tomoya Tabuchi,
        that's right) so I gave this super fast tempo song even thought I
        probably won't need a brain rush at work lol. But hey, I've already
        given so you're welcome Kanatan.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Natsuiro Matsuri's 1st song</b> still didn't get me after I've heard
        of it last week so I'm sorry my first VTuber watch lol, and don't even
        ask me what <b>Sakura Miko's new song</b> sounded like. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
        yuiko-san who did the lyrics? Nope, just, nope. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Minato Aqua's new song</b> is a real meh even listening to it the
        second time so I'm skipping it because of her voice tbh, and don't ask
        me whether I'll like <b>Omaru Polka's new song</b>. I mean, it's close,
        these two, but nah. Listen to Polka's first song at your own risk haha
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Shishiro Botan's new song</b> went real well until it didn't, so I
        didn't bother giving it any further. (Remember, all these are given
        based on audio impression ie. no video imagery whatsoever, so it should be better)&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%A2%E3%83%A2%E3%83%8E%E3%83%8D-single/1580884138?l=en" target="_blank"><b>Momosuzu Nene's new song</b></a>
        is actually great she makes me want to marry her lol, and
        <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/mage-of-violet-single/1580886349?l=en" target="_blank"><b>Murasaki Shion's 1st ever song</b></a>
        is very fitting of her magician-like VTuber persona so I'm giving it
        despite having a weird end and a shorter melody. I did listen to
        Nenechi's first song which is literally about her but you know, if "ne"
        is your thing and
        <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ne-ne-ne/1537803645?i=1537803647&amp;l=en" target="_blank">three of them aren't enough</a>
        (lol Anime joke) then help yourself to the chorus lmao.&nbsp;

      <li>
        <b>Houshou Marine's new song</b> written by Yunomi who also wrote Anime
        "Tonikaku Kawaii" opening theme song still didn't get me even if I gave
        second chance, and I think it's mainly because of her peculiar
        electronic-based style. Once again, giving the latter is purely me being
        lenient at an Anime theme song.
      </li>
      <li>
        Last but not least, didn't even know <b>Ookami Mio's new songs</b> are
        in like, an EP so I listened to all of them, but not like I gave any of
        them because they sounded edgy to me and also they suffer from the same
        melody issues I rather not discuss.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div>
    So there you have it, the full roundup. I only spent like, three days on
    these total in commute so it isn't much since rejecting songs was swift lmao. To
    add on, I saw
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/overtones/1576834187?l=en" target="_blank">Takebuchi Kei's new album</a></b>
    around so I decided to listen to it yesterday... and gave chance to one song
    because it reminded me of Anime "GREAT PRETENDER" from last year. Oh well, I
    tried. This album had 100% more electronic pop which was far cry from her
    album back in 2014. (You see, the thing about gaining an audience with
    easy-listening first albums... lol)

  <br />So next week, it looks like we'll be slowly up to pace with new songs
  incoming, so let's start off this month with
  <b>Necry Talkie's new single</b> for Anime "KanoKano" and I hope this
  mainstream stuff can be good but we shall see, and maybe I'll listen to
  <b>Sayuri's new song</b> when I have the time. There you have it, folks. (lol
  I sound like a TV host)<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Man, it's just sad still playing a game that is already about to end in two
  months. The gacha do not work anymore so my spare gems are left for nothing
  but I did roll out my final "new" SSR card last month though so that is nice, there isn't
  much left to do now besides grinding on stuff that might be locked after the
  service ends and it transitions to the offline version where we can use some
  of the features like photo-taking forever thanks staff, but sadly, those that
  are not unlocked for example relationship levels with the girls might stay
  locked forever. And those, the staff has concluded with proper character
  endings where we meet the girls years later, with new outfits and storyline.
  Man, do you regret spreading your love through all the girls now and not being
  able to unlock those endings because you didn't focus on one? Stupid idiot.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, cya guys then, the package is taking shape though there
  isn't much development since last time</div>
<br />P.S. My sis, who recently decided to change jobs, thought of buying the
same phone as I intend to change to by the end of the year, the Google Pixel 5.
<span title="*silence*">😐</span> I must be dreaming lmao but hey, no couple phones please she's my sis
and I don't have a

know if your sis has a
