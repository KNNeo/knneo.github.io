Man, maybe I should take a break from Anime watching for a season.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Haha, of course I'm saying this as a joke because otherwise you'll not get
  this weekly post anymore I'll just be talking about music, and even then it's
  kinda dependent on Anime too, so yeah, it has its own implications. So unless
  I start reviewing packages on a weekly basis and/or ditch blogging as a side
  hobby, I'll have to watch Anime for as long as I don't watch drama and movies
  on a weekly basis lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So, without further ado, this week's a short one since most shows are either
  done or not yet premiered, and I have a wedding to attend on Sunday too, so...
  we'll see how I'll publish this after eating like, a ten-course meal because
  that's how Chinese wedding dinners work lol<br />

  It's that time of the season again, as we will talk about new shows that will
  come in to find themselves a seat in my history of watching Anime haha. Well,
  I've been watching for a while so yeah. But it doesn't stop me from talking
  about then new shows so here they are:

        which featured a stellar cast I don't think I need to mention who, but
        suffice it to say that this might be horror, but good chances not even
        us the audience will be spooked since the main girl doesn't even care,
        so think along the lines of&nbsp;<a

        that would be boring if there isn't contrast and that's why there's
        everyone else who can't see ghosts in the series lol. So yeah, I'll

        aka Koko-chan as main girl will be compensated by an actual good
        storytelling which either I missed watching or I'm just picky about
        since this one looks like it's about portals, and this is kind of sci-fi
        so if I see mechs then I'll stop. I'll try for an episode though; I've
        seen the original manga work and I think I can give it a chance- IS THAT

        [Premiers October 8th 2021], and I must say it's pretty intriguing to
        see another love story spawn out of being a rich descendant and lonely
        again, but with some historical era context and a cute fiancÃ© from the
        start, I don't know how else to not give this a chance. I mean, find me
        a problem about this Anime- Chika-chan is the love rival!! Okay let's
        watch this lmao

        but because I've watched so many series in this age range and context of
        workplace... it's hard to look away from this one. It might just feel
        like a character focus series eg.

        school, which will appeal to me anyways. I'll definitely watch a couple
        of episodes to see if I can even live with the senpai because boy do I
        never want such a senior where I work haha- IS THAT SIDE CHARACTER

        season please tone it down guys haha

    <div></div>
    <div>
      As we can see above, looks like next season is- GODDAMMIT the first two I
      mentioned are Sunday shows so I hope you love that I talk about Anime on
      Mondays lol, and I think we have more comedy series ahead of us instead of
      just romance even though isn't romance comedy a thing anyways lol so yeah,
      let's see how they go. Chances I don't watch all of them aren't very high
      because we seriously shouldn't go for more than 4 shows which is this
      season my Sundays are rough, so we shall see. Is this going to be the
      first time I'm going to review Anime twice a week regularly? I hope not
      lol

      Man, what is with that summer camp feel in the island with the Nagara
      gang? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, they gotta squeeze in that soundtrack somewhere haha.
      In this new episode though (#SonnyBoy11) let us not forget about the
      passing of Nozomi. No really, she's gone now, as much as we have loved her
      presence and no matter how much Asakaze loved her... even he didn't appear
      at her funeral service so f**k you bro and your boob desires lol. Anyways,
      RIP Nozomi and also why are we then talking about death? Yeah, this is
      kind of ambiguous already if you think about it. So, story. It has been
      2000 years it seems in this world they were stuck in, and I'm not going to
      cringe on a funeral so let's move on, Rajdhani is back from his vacation
      lol. He was back for a reason though, for a project that can get them out
      of this world and he's staying for some reason: Project Robinson. If you
      find that name familiar I don't lol, but suffice it to say they are going
      to cause environmental destruction so bad conservationists will scream
      through their screens lol not that, but thanks to Nozomi's powers being
      left over... I have no more guts to say this anymore, but yes, that's how
      they all got to know how to leave this world, I guess. The result is just
      a space shuttle reaching to the stars, which is ironically what Nozomi
      probably saw all the time, the exit to this hell scape. Before we take off
      though, I'll touch on a couple of stories Bill Nye talked about his
      journeys where if you recall, started with a boat. Firstly, the love story
      about nostalgia. It says a lot about the world adrift they were in, with
      the guy stuck on the past because you know, why go back when you can just
      recreate the world you lived in...? Sure man, that's how you get girls to
      leave you haha. (Jokes on me I don't even get to do this and girls never
      stayed with me BOOM haha) But this one had an easy conclusion: The idea of
      being together is to create a future together, not live in the past. The
      other story though, was a little more shady, but I think, it's necessary
      to talk about. In his story to Nagara about death, he saw someone in one
      world do all sorts of evil stuff in the face of how this universe works,
      attempting to create "Death" which we technically just witnessed with
      Nozomi last week so I don't know why he didn't consider jumping off a
      cliff an option lol, but yeah, I won't describe it but if electrocution is
      anything to come by as liberation (ugh), it's probably just a good tool to
      remove all meaning in one's soul and thus effectively create death,
      meaningless in life that will even piss of the God in this world. Weird,
      Bill Nye didn't try out the chair himself thank goodness, but it's sort of
      necessary to talk about in the darkest times of this world, ironically
      where no one wants to leave now and one can die in this world? Man, this
      is making me puke let's move on haha. Lastly, I assume with Mizuho's
      powers they can order a NASA into the world lol, and along with the cats
      and Bill Nye's handy tools which we'll never get in this world for another
      century maybe longer, they managed to do what SpaceX will take billions of
      dollars and years of man effort to do. Hey, I'm not into real space
      shuttle launches but I'm digging this for some reason, don't mind me. And
      yeah blah blah Nozomi asking for a promise to be friends with Nagara again
      once they go back to the real world. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span> All in all, very perspective of
      what will be concluding of this series which is a big question mark in
      itself, and as we see Nagara and Mizuho reach for the compass and Voice's
      smirk in his seat... I doubt this will go along as smooth as we think.
      Remember the last time they tried to go back to their real world through
      cutting of life footage or something? Can't wait to be busted by "War"
      this time around though, though can we even consider him to be alive now?
      I don't know. I don't know everything and I don't even bother reading the
      powers explained in their official Twitter account so I REALLY don't know
      haha. Let's see if the final episode can make me think twice about
      regretting to give this in the first place. See you then.

      This week is quite a week of new songs, so let's talk about them!

      >
      is not on my list, I must not be biased even if I like her voice, because
      I mean, hear the other five songs sung by VTubers I've given earlier this
      month. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
      <b
        ><a
          href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%84%9B%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E6%84%9B%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A6-ep/1543671598?l=en"

      did take some getting used to since they are not high in production, and
      you know, they like to shit on me (lol "live a long life" but I don't
      wanna) but I still gave them a couple of songs. Whether I'll listen to the
      ones from this year... maybe not haha or next year probably.
      <b

      offers wonders because clearly some producer spent a lot of money on the
      soundtrack, and interestingly I'm giving songs I have not initially wanted
      to give so... they got me haha.&nbsp;<b

          >Porno Graffitti's new single</a
        ></b
      >
      in years isn't exactly ground-breaking considering I did miss a couple of
      years giving them songs because giving songs in Klassic Note be like a
      fighting game combo lol, so yeah, I gave the one song as promised when I
      heard it at the start of the year. Last but not least,

          >Earphones' new EP</a
        ></b
      >
      might have taken the spotlight because despite being a concept release and
      appealing to an international audience with that one song (instead of
      releasing new languages of it, Akarin and Kana-chan) (haha), it also has
      great melodies apart from that one opening song from Anime "Sore ga
      Seiyuu" because I swear

      are all in digital streaming platforms so help yourself to some new tunes,
      yes?<br />
      <br />On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and sorry if I missed
      any I'll cover them next week, don't ask me why they had the budget to
      make

      because apparently this is trending with artists now lol ironically though
      it won't affect their compositions but no guarantee for credits though so
      goodbye Anime series with theme songs which she was famous for. (Oh maybe

      since her... marriage announcement two years ago lol, but it's probably
      not affecting me giving songs since her buddy composer Kitagawa (which I
      assume they had to get him again after moving music labels) (FYI to the
      one Taketatsu Ayana is in) is writing the topic songs and they got Chinese
      people to write Chinese versions of the three... new... songs- Yep.
      <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> No comment, by the way. <b>Hoshimachi Suisei's 1st album</b> will
      be the first time I'll be giving an album release from a virtual YouTube
      in case you have no idea who those are she just has a great voice just
      like all the others (if you don't count non-Japanese lol),
      <strike
        >and sadly she will be competing against
        <b>Yogee New Waves' new album</b> in two years and goddamn if this isn't
        a long time waiting. The topic song is great so let's hope the rest of
        the release is also good.</strike

      Wow, if you didn't know about this I won't blame you, but for about 2 days
      iTunes for Windows (Desktop and Microsoft Store version, I use the latter
      since easier to install) was down due to a start-up error after an update
      which will not be solved if you change the language lol thanks Internet,
      really made me think about my music subscription for a while. Apart from
      spending two days without a low-memory consumption music player, I also
      didn't get to access my library which I use it to update my now music
      database to know of availability. So yeah, can I sue Apple? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya
      guys next time then, and until next time... turns out the hardest thing is
      to buy that

      because of her recent "concept" album and maybe her popularity was that
      good. I'll try Suruga-ya but they won't let me bundle with bromides.

      time but man is hosting a wedding dinner a little damp in such tried

      for rice to pair with the dishes that came out lol I was just too full
