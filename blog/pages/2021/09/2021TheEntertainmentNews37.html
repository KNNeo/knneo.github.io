Seriously, I can NEVER get enough of that Transport Fever game haha I want to go
back to playing it but today is literally packed with mostly doing this post
so... can I skip for this week please? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Just joking, because this is my life now until the new package is coming
  together real soon and I have no idea where they come from because I lost the
  confirmation email somewhere or maybe they didn't send it to my email anyways-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Sorry for the ranting here my life that I would share is just these anyway so
  enjoy the rest of this post I guess lmao

  </blockquote>
  Yeah Siesta and Nagisa would have an argument over how big Kimizuka's d**k is
  lmao and we know Siesta will give way since she hasn't seen it before.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I try to not make this a rated series but with all the violence
  and blood I think it has already covered for itself lol. In this new episode
  where we snap back to present day (#TanMoshi10), I think we are starting on a
  new arc after what we saw of a long flashback from what is now 4 years ago
  because you know, 3 years she died and it took another year before the heart
  got to Nagisa-chan. Speaking of her, we have plenty to talk about on this
  ship. Yep, courtesy of Saikawa's huge fanbase and their fanclub fees lmao,
  we're on a ship now. And you know, it's no fun just being on a ship, so they
  have to coincidentally also see Charlotte who was also on this ship (wait,
  there were other passengers on this ship?? lol) somehow and we know it's not
  coincidental since she was
  here to find what, Siesta's legacy or whatever, right on this ship. Yeah, not
  that we know of that, and not like if she's dead why wouldn't she leave
  anything for the two sidekicks she had, but yeah, at least one of them is
  looking for it lmao. (One of them legacies too, no joke, there are more? Just a
  reminder this is a two-cour series ie. this spans two seasons haha) We got
  some Nagisa and Charlotte conflict but yeah, I think even till now we didn't
  really get around to Nagisa-chan's story even if we know it's just a heart
  transplant and now she's getting dreams of meeting with Siesta, doesn't really
  contribute to her credibility in working with Siesta or replacing her or
  whatever, but yeah, the others aren't that qualified either. So yeah, looks
  like Charlotte is the only one doing it now after she finally ends her last
  round of gambling in the casino lmao she's a gambler, and you know, more
  things happen on this ship. It's no surprise SPES probably got wind of this
  news too don't ask me how they know, but next morning after the guys have a
  good night's sleep lol well not everybody, there was an announcement from the deck which
  obviously is just someone from SPES echoing through the ship itself since no
  one is in the AV room, is that they got hold of Nagisa-chan. From last night.
  Haha guess who didn't have a good night's sleep. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, why didn't
  they abduct Saikawa instead since there's that eye, but at least with her and
  the two searching for her presence, we can at least confirm Nagisa is
  kidnapped by someone who can't be seen by her blue eye, so an android. And
  yes, if Chameleon didn't immediately spring up in your mind, you need to watch
  last week's episode again lol. But yeah, as the day is over and Kimizuka met
  with the bad guy holding Nagisa hostage (Tentacle porn, anyone? Haha I wish
  Ayachi was on it lmao *<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ojisan" target="_blank">ojisan</a>
  giggles*), Chameleon asked the dude for his choice to either save the ship's
  passengers which are being evacuated as they were speaking, or save the one
  girl who has given him so much happiness since they met. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I
  meant Siesta, please. Nagisa may be an adequate replacement but have you seen
  Siesta drunk in her sleepwear? Haha okay I know she's great let's just not rip
  off dead people. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, SPES is just doing the dumb yet straightforward thing
  by destroying all evidence so even Charlotte can't do anything about the
  legacy, and without anyone digging Nagisa's heart out to save the legendary
  detective (lmao) we might just be in a pinch. Oh well, Charlotte might just
  come in at some point so I won't hold my breath. All in all, very
  straightforward episode, plenty of emotions from Nagisa-chan herself so I
  won't elaborate, and yeah, this is not exactly over yet. Not like Siesta
  mentioned about her will anytime soon, but I guess you have to figure that out
  yourself huh, as one of the sidekicks lol. Charlotte figured it out, so let's
  see if that will be a deal breaker for even Chameleon in this case.

  P.S. "I never want to go back to that place, like a birdcage, to the days of

  </blockquote>
  Now that I think of it, how did the head maid have a kid? How did you even get
  pregnant as a slave of the mansion? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ignoring that, uh, ah hey Bocchan
  getting the stepsister route maybe? Haha in this new episode
  (#ShinigamiBocchan10) looks like we're getting some flashbacks? Hey, we know
  the conclusion of this series is likely not the lifting of the curse, so it
  must be something else. We might be getting there, as we speak. More wholesome
  content as we continue on the route after Christmas, and we totally ignore the
  mother on the dining table which is what I'm totally digging for actually
  since I don't really like those domestic affairs and could use less of those.
  Haha what is interesting than that though, is everyone else. For example,
  Cuff-san actually got to do things by herself, like go grocery shopping alone.
  Without Zain. Without asking for Zain to go instead. Yeah, she's growing up.
  Besides the occasional screw up on the communication which almost got Zain to
  interfere as he stalks his <strike>girlfriend</strike> buddy haha, but
  otherwise Cuff-san can take care of herself. I mean, she even knows when she
  got pickpocketed, so I would say she's good enough to go on her own. Then, we
  have the bed scene. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Haha, I know saying it this way sounds overboard
  for an Anime series where the guy can't touch the girl, but it isn't wrong. Alice volunteered herself to sleep with Bocchan on his bed even, and I don't
  even know what to say. Just... be careful haha. They had some pep talk
  regarding guess who, the mother for some reason, and I guess we're not having
  any s*x scenes for the night. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, we learn a bit more about
  the past, specifically from Rob to why Alice was here in this mansion. Yep,
  Rob MVP for this series by the way, or else we are probably still seeing
  depressed and suicidal Bocchan till date. So apparently, things were doing
  okay with the two at the old mansion, the kid was happy, Rob gets to serve the
  master, things were fine. But I guess as time goes on and Bocchan keeps
  thinking about being alone and his curse making everyone stay away from him...
  well, you gotta start thinking of bad things, isn't it? Can't say it's Rob's
  fault, but he might not be that great of a father. Hey, we don't even know if
  the actual father is even good he's not even around. (Ah) (Haha) Anyways, Rob knew
  that he needs to find some female caretaker who will talk to him about his
  troubles, so he recalls the time he saw Bocchan being on good terms with then
  kid Alice (which is super adorable btw) so she brought her in. He probably
  also got her out of the aunt's hands which is real convenient, and these two
  found solace in each other. This might be have been the best life decision Rob
  has made in this entire life- Rob MVP by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, we also
  know things don't last forever, which brings us to the last part of this
  episode, the reality of the future. Even Alice knows her good times with
  Bocchan won't last forever, and as much as Bocchan loves this voluptuous woman
  lmao, it's not going to make any stance to Alice's position in the household
  as a maid because societal status was a thing a century ago and not everyone
  is able to make their decisions alone as to how to live their life, whether
  it's family-related or romance-related. Think about it, and you'll see how
  disappointing and poignant their lives were compared to us. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> So next
  episode... does the title mean we'll unlock some magic in Bocchan?? Hey,
  that'll be real cool if anything is along the powers of not killing living
  things in an instant lol cya guys then

  Oh yeah, we are technically starting this off with a sex scene in the hot
  springs, right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey in this new episode though (#KanoKano11) where
  no one will believe Naoya will get out of anything himself... lol how has he
  been living life up till now anyways? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe with some help from
  Saki-chan as childhood friend, I guess. But bro, please, show some restraint
  and make some decisions in your life and not be manipulated by the author- Ah.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, story I guess haha. I need to arrange all this a bit so
  please forgive me if I totally forget about writing this paragraph since you
  won't notice it anyways lmao. Firstly, we talk about Milika-san. In a nutshell
  we're not going to see a live porno lmao but we will in a bit haha, but yeah
  Rika-chan here just wants to hang out with Naoya just so she can have a chance
  with him more? Yeah, lovestruck already, isn't it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, from
  listening to Naoya's life choices to listening to Milika's... more fulfilling
  yet baseless identity lmao, it's not hard for this girl in heat (lol) to get
  excited at everything Naoya says- Yes it doesn't even matter to this girl now bananas are cool to her at this point haha. And as if 5 minutes of them together in the bath with Naoya in his
  likely tight pants which is probably getting tighter lol it's shrinking dude
  that's how fabrics work (thank goodness he wasn't wearing jeans lol), Milika
  gotta flash herself naked before telling him to leave- Am I really writing all
  this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And in his trip back to his room through the rooftop walking we
  mentioned this as a reference from another Anime so I'm not going to talk about it
  again, he slipped, and guess where he landed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yep, so I couldn't
  believe they would do such a confrontation I thought it'll be more official, he landed at literally where Shion is. Yes, as she was entering the hot spring. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Yep, the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> references
  here are already beyond me so I'm just looking at it all and giving up at this
  point lmao. So part two, is the confrontation of Shion versus Naoya, the one
  we missed last week in school. Because you know, why not talk about stuff like
  this when we're wet and bare and naked in front of each other- Someone please help me
  this is literally the first time I DO NOT want to write this post. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Shion almost got him into telling the truth by dumping him with so many facts
  we can believe she will make of a good lawyer in the future (#TodayILearnt
  polygamy is illegal and socially discriminated in Japan), and also making sure
  he doesn't leave until he explains himself which I must say is of concern
  considering Shion almost let her towel off and still doesn't know of shame-
  Someone please help my typing fingers and my eyes that I have to read this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The two girls thought discussing about their
  trip would be safer in the hot springs so... guess who's the four-timing
  member in this complicated relationship. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I can't laugh
  anymore man I'm tired. I'll laugh at the flat chest though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Saki-chan
  really thought that his boy got his d**k out <strike>in front of</strike> INTO her friend lmao I
  can't even, and Shion ran out in shame. Oh so THIS is when she stopped lol.
  Well, she probably also ran because Nagisa took pictures of her on top of
  Naoya so... please don't accidentally upload it to social media, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Saki-chan
  gives his boy a good beat up out of this place considering this is a public female-only bath WTF, and last but not least we talk about Nagisa's life decisions so far
  with Saki-chan. Keeping the long story short, she's me if I try in life but
  still is average lol, but yeah, she's already content with weak-willed
  Saki-chan giving in to whatever this two-timing relationship is about- See,
  her friend is right; SakiSaki is weak. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So next week which is the
  final episode, looks like we are continuing with this pep talk about Nagisa's
  life, and how she mainly plays into interrupting a normal boy-girl
  relationship. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'm not even Naoya and I feel bad for her now lol
  let's see if any of us can wrap our heads around Nagisa's life next week I
  guess

  </blockquote>
  Wait, Mizuho's cats are having a meeting? What is this Anime even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
  this new episode where Mizuho might be in danger lol (#SonnyBoy09), turns out,
  her cats might be even more in danger. Well, not hers if you recall, but yeah,
  I forgot I have to think about this episode more intellectually at every
  point. So, let's do this. Story goes that the Nagara team ended up in the same
  world as the party bus with Aki-sensei and Asakaze, in the world of Sou Seiji. (No, not what Americans think how Japanese describe their dong lol) Yes, there are two of them. Both are also called the same name. The only
  differences are barbaric Seiji doesn't dress in a suit, and he has one less
  hair on his head. Yep, fighting over such meaningless things. The others were right in that
  just removing one hair from the other Seiji or just give this dude a hair
  transplant, but we are totally missing the point here: He was fighting with
  himself. Remember the traversing of worlds and how everyone in this adrift
  world is like, a copy of the one in reality they can never escape to? Yeah,
  same thing here, but this is what happens when two copies meet. Yep, we're
  reaching that stage already haha. Sou Seiji has the power to revert all
  world progress to the point where all of them were before they were adrift, but
  because Seiji has to fight with himself every once in a while, they both use
  the same power and nothing happens. Worst thing is, no one remembers it, so
  this cycle continues. Why any of them would think this is a great idea to get
  back to reality, I have no idea. What I do know though that as Aki-sensei gave one of them some assistance to disable one of their powers such that time could
  resume in this world lol I guess sure, it's better than nothing. Literally,
  it's either two of them Seiji or nothing. So yeah, that was a waste of time
  lol. We did find out more stuff out of this episode though, specifically
  Mizuho and her group of cats. A flashback showed us kid Mizuho (we don't need
  another voice actress for the role Yuuki Aoi can handle all that I don't even
  have to confirm in the credits) hanging out with her grandmother which she
  hated a lot I'm sure, and started to hang out with the grandma's cats more and
  more until she wanted to become one- What? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, this one is just
  a short story between the cats who have the Nyamazon power specifically Sakura the white
  cat which is a millennial cat for some reason according to the others? Haha
  and it also thinks Mizuho needs to be protected. That isn't wrong as the dog
  senpai Yamabiko has found out, but yeah, in this world where everyone is
  adrift and did I mention this might be a place to learn life lessons, Mizuho
  might need to grow up soon. Apart from that, we know
  <strike>Rajdani</strike>&nbsp;<strike>Rajhdani</strike> Bill Nye haha, figured
  out Mizuho's power real early, that it's not that she can order anything even
  if it's living and the cats aren't allowing her to do so, but her power is to
  copy anything in existence. (Which is why copying living things is rough since Sou Seiji lmao) It's easily seen from when Bill Nye experimented
  with - he did a lot of this by the way so be warned - the orders by ordering
  something unique in existence and explaining it in detail even in front of the
  cats and that's how you know it's copied (keyword is "unique", you can't order a unique item), and the cats specifically
  interrogating them into telling the truth about their powers- How is this any
  different from that Seiji setting up a trap to catch Sakura to offer it to the
  gods? <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> (Yes if they can copy things aren't they technically connected to
  the real world? Is probably what Bill Nye thought of) All in all, if this is the
  only weird episode in this series you need to watch the past two months of
  content again lol, and even then we might only be scratching the surface. But as we
  continue to find more answers to the question the voice told them to give up
  finding just because, I'm afraid we can only think of this series as in
  imagination and analysis of life instead of treating it as a sci-fi thing.
  Because it's not, and I can tell you even without doing a double reversal on
  you lol- Okay thank goodness I did that or else we might never see next
  episode haha cya guys next week</div><div>
