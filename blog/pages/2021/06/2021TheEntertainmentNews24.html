I like how I was thinking about an intro for this in bed last night and now I
forgot all of it because I didn't write it down lol
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, I am spending a lot of money this week so that's good haha, and the
  upcoming package is on its way. Just a heads up, it's going to be the first
  package of nothing but shirts! Yes, I'm in the apparel range now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Well, it's going to be all shirts related to idol stuff so you can guess what
  it'll be like haha I just did it to fill my wardrobe
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Didn't even realize that the Anime season is going to end soon. I wonder
  what's for next season- Yes I will get to "Eden" at some point I'm just too
  lazy to watch it because I rather watch some streamer play a Spongebob
  simulation game for hours for like, it's the third time this week now lmao
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Also, don't ask me IF "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/43969/Kanojo_mo_Kanojo"
    target="_blank"
    >Kanojo mo Kanojo</a
  >" is in my watchlist for next season because if you look at the cast there's
  no reason I wouldn't want to cheat on anyone with Waki Azumi especially of
  Sakura Ayane haha SUCK IT and also Asakura Momo is singing the ending song so
  yeah hehe<br />

  "I mean, lawyers are awesome" Haha yeah Rio so are sumo wrestlers but you
  didn't want to be those... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's anything goes for her huh haha. In
  this new episode of thinking about your career path because this is part high
  school talk still (#KoiKimo11), is this how this series is going to end
  though? Hmm I hope not we got so much more to talk about hehe. So, story.
  Firstly, about career path. Man, does every high school Anime have to talk
  about this? I mean, if you watched till the end it got resolved like it's not
  even a problem unless you watch those exceptions where it's not like this eg.
  "Yesterday wo Utatte", but you know, it's all the same thing. It's always
  everyone else even Rio who had a future thought out, we don't have to give a
  damn about their future since we not writing stories 10 years later into this
  timeline, and it's always the main character that is troubled about his or her
  future, in this case Ichika. I know right? Just be like Ryou and listen to
  what her parents want, that'll be easier. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, that for later, but
  you get the idea. Ichika asked Ryou for advice because he's the only person in
  her life who isn't older than her mother and younger than her friends so...
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ryou suggested other paths she could take though (*Success in those
  paths not guaranteed), so there's that. Next up, the family reunion. Yeah,
  from last week, and the dad's back home. Don't ask me
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/162692/Mayuta_Andou"
    target="_blank"
    >who he resembles</a
  >
  but he looks like he's been in some shit as a kid to not let his kids walk
  down the same path...? But heck, Ryou isn't doing those stuff that you do,
  <i>dad</i>. Besides sleeping with women. And dating high schoolers in the late
  20s. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And of course let's just say coincidentally, the dad overheard
  what Rio and the mother already knew about Ichika, and how lovey-dovey they
  were up till now (they just don't know the details <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>) so yeah, that's bad
  news. Ah dammit Ryou was about to leave too! Dang it, he could've just
  god-like evaded the father but you guys... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And so yes, we have talked
  about this confrontation for weeks we knew it was coming, and so here it is.
  It wasn't a lot, but it's enough to cause the usual conflict inside of the
  abode for everyone else to hear it ie. the ladies, so you can imagine. The
  father is just more concerned that by dating Rio's friend, Ryou is implicating
  the sister into whatever romance bullsh*t he thinks his son is going through
  which I must say, if you look at the mother's expression on what Rio told her,
  says a lot of different things compared to the romances he has had with
  older-than-Ichika women thus far. So, that's your hint right there. Besides,
  this Ryou's father is unlike Sayu-chan's mother, so we should be fine here.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Sorry for the "HigeHiro" reference, but if you didn't watch that the
  mother accused the daughter of the friend's suicide... which isn't too far off
  but still) Hey, till the end, concern and worry is always on any parent's
  mind, so if you can imply from that you would realize why the father would be
  thinking like that, though more traditionally influenced. Next up, OOF they
  gotta place the girl and the dad in the same place huh. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> So yeah,
  Ichika dropped by Rio's place just because, and got a chance to be alone with
  the father... Yeah, that wasn't too bad maybe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You see Ryou, if you
  don't do things to disappoint your parents... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I would argue though,
  that that will be very backwards thinking of them. Because seriously? DNA
  plays a part of how your children will become, from inherent abilities to
  weird choices in life, depending on the circumstances. So yeah, why not blame
  parenthood then? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay we better move on this is the last time I'll
  talk about this haha. Last but not least, how about some
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hanami" target="_blank">flower viewing</a>?
  If you don't happen to live somewhere with great
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sakura" target="_blank">sakura</a> to look
  at I'm sorry to you and myself too haha, but I like the confirmation and then
  drop from Rio to Ichika and telling her she is going to hang out with two
  other dudes including Ryou because they can't get their usual gang to show up
  in which Masuda has already prepared so much for it beforehand. Man, this kind
  of thing sucks, but you know, at least the guys have some backup. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Also, "back up" because at least Rio knows to leave the two alone when Masuda
  suggested to stock up on the drinks just because. We get to hear another part
  of Ryou's history with his father (the good ones), and I think it's not boring
  just because like Ichika we want to know more about his story, and why it has
  come to this. Well mostly Ryou's life choices but you get the idea haha. And
  dammit WE ALMOST GOT HER TO CONFESS!! Come on Ryou, took you way too long to
  figure that out lmao. Ah THE SUSPENSE lol. (Also Masuda you deserve to die and
  reincarnate as a pig ten times over for disruption haha what) All in all, man
  this is a good episode. I know the dad thing is bad, but man did they actually
  try to patch it up to show the different side of the father to say the least,
  and I think that is what is important about this series: Showing balance, and
  other options in the face of ambiguity. And that I must say is actually good,
  and plays a different part of what we think as a romance series. I know we're
  close to the end but not yet, but I wish for some conclusion next week. I
  hope. Not going to expect much but hope the dad doesn't ruin the confession or
  something haha

      "I think Sayu was lucky to meet a guy as nice as you" Yeah bro, her
      previous encounters haven't been this great hahahahahahaha
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  In this new episode of "more people know about Sayu's departure" lol
  (#HigeHiro10), hey we gotta spread the news right? She's technically got a
  week left in this place we call Heaven haha. Again, it's not about the reality
  in front of us now guys; It's about what Yoshida would justify his actions and
  do something about all this. Well, probably not much, but you know, we want to
  see some desperation, and crying alone is not the solution. Please, we saw
  that last week, no more. Anyways, story. Story goes we still have a week to go
  before Sayu has to go back home, and of course, everyone in the office... who
  knows of this of course, needs to know about this. Interestingly though, his
  buddy Hashimoto and Mishima both can see through him and know Yoshida rather
  not just let the kid so back and face... the consequences supposedly, but
  think that Yoshida has no choice but to let her go, because again, if you need
  a reminder, he's just a dude who let her stay because she was on the streets.
  Next up, the talk with Issa. I think this is a good summary for this series in
  general as he talks about his family background and the mother and how Sayu
  came to be like a bad memory manifested as her descendant kind of thing, but
  yeah, "a parent's love is very important to a child" is probably what you
  should take away from this episode even this series, I must say. As the
  brother has mentioned, it's the mother's perception of what the child
  represented which resented her to treat Sayu in such a way. But still, we know
  this is not forgivable. Because the child doesn't know. It's not her fault.
  You get the idea. We'll be able to talk more about this next week probably so
  stay tuned for more illogical arguments like these haha, but suffice it to say
  Issa is just here to apologize for what he thought of Yoshida to be and he
  technically doesn't know the first guy he talked to at the convenience store
  is one of those jerks he should beat up lmao, but maybe that's why it's also
  Sayu that gets too attached to this father-life figure, considering she
  doesn't have a father herself, if you followed the story. The days go on,
  Yoshida buried himself in work, Sayu does little things in the house to keep
  this guy in check though I would argue she doesn't have to he'll be surrounded
  in women once she leaves lmao. Also, I just think the reality is he's just
  going to go back to his lazy self and not clean the place OR cook for himself
  lol yes including shaving his stubble and probably lose Mishima and Gotou in
  the process- Call me the Prophet thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sayu brought Yoshida
  somewhere late at night (If I didn't remember wrongly there's
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/41389/Tonikaku_Kawaii" target="_blank"
    >this other series</a
  >
  which did something like this late at night and it's to submit marriage
  papers... you sure you not...? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) to see the stars as what Asami did to
  her, and we then confirmed that Sayu is likely the one who will feel too
  attached to this "home" she doesn't want to go back. But seriously though,
  compared to that place you lived in Hokkaido? ANYWHERE is better haha hey mom
  try hitting me I'll sue you for assault and do your daughter a favour by
  locking you up you b*tch <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Turns out I'm more Yoshida than himself,
  who knew) (lol) Then, we have more talk between the co-workers. Man, they are
  just pumping stuff into Yoshida's brain right now, making him think that going
  to Hokkaido with Sayu and seeing this through is the best idea haha. Ah hey,
  we're still a couple of episodes away WE ARE SURE to see the confrontation of
  the mother with Yoshida I tell you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, it is kind of there,
  which is why Yoshida took Sayu in in the first place, but you know, this is
  just the other way of helping her I guess besides doing nothing, knowing the
  full story now. And as the buddy Hashimoto mentioned, because he's a family
  man himself and knows what this feels (Mishima knows this feeling because she
  loves the dude haha), we can already (1) guess what will happen if Sayu is
  left with her brother to go home to the mother because don't think Sayu can
  defend herself since Issa probably won't do that or do enough for her tbh, and
  (2) it technically is about whether this part of "taking care" or "taking
  care" of the stuff in your job that matters more. Well, in this case, I would
  think Yoshida will have to make the decision since it's not really just up to
  Sayu. ("Okay work is more important than Sayu; Now drive me back" lmao) In
  Yoshida's defence though? But also, because he's so matured as an adult, I
  would say this series is really trying to drive him the selfish, pesky way
  instead of doing the adult thing by letting the (worst) things happen on its
  own, no really. It's like drilling into bedrock; We know they can't drill him
  and they still doing it haha. Also, we know Yoshida is not going to change
  things going on from here: Sayu will. But you know, as they lie on bed
  together on the night before the farewell, Sayu tells him the same thing, that
  this place is just too good to leave and go back to face her past. It's like
  this "family" here is so much better. But seriously Sayu, he's not your dad.
  He'll NEVER want to be with your mom. Haha GOT HER <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> But I think Yoshida
  made that final decision on seeing not just the future that will be on Sayu
  which might be bleak for her in this case, but also, that she is honestly too
  scared to face it herself. Come on, we know she is technically alone she has
  been alone for six months and counting!?? Even the brother didn't give a damn
  for this long, please. Probably won't make me want to go to Sayu's home and
  face all this with her, but Yoshida would. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, a lot of
  things have happened, as small as they are, to pile up into the decision we
  have not seen yet from last week but yes, you know this is going to happen
  anyways, it's just how. I could shit on so much on the mother, I think we
  should leave those for next week haha so yes, that is going to happen so you
  guys better be prepared for it. Man, is this series as depressing as it is so
  well done, I must say if I was matured as an adult and have unbiased judgement
  this series might be one of the best out of all the shows this season. Yes,
  comparable to family stories like "Usagi Drop" which I didn't even watch lol.
  Okay, compliments done, we have a couple more to go, so we shall see where
  this ends up.

  P.P.S. "But I am still scared to go home" Yeah Sayu we don't even know what
  the punishment is lol well you hope it's just a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sekkyou" target="_blank">scolding</a> and
  that's it and not like solitary confinement- THEN I'll tell that teacher to
  call the cops haha
</div>

  [I tell you Sayu proving that she had a great life with Yoshida is basically
  showing off her v****a and saying "Look mom there's no Yoshida s***n in it!"

  Oooh boy, you bet I saw the screens from the official Twitter account so I
  won't even tell you whether we get some Kuroha bikini or not because... you'll
  probably be staring at the other Shida sister anyways haha GOTCHA Midori btw
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this back to back beach episode because why not last episode was
  only one day long (#OsaMake09), we got more girls to show more skin. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Hey, is this not a good summary or what haha. So, let's get through the boring
  parts ie. story. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, the Shida sisters are here and remember this is
  only Day 2 of this Okinawa vacation/music video shooting where the three girls
  are expected to produce a dance sequence for a song by the end of the trip
  (which they did), they still had to study even if there is plenty of time to
  ogle at... everything haha, and yay to more swimsuits just because (*looks at
  Akane and Aoi*
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/8769/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai"
    target="_blank"
    >Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii</a
  >-) this is a fanservice Anime that only knows how to shamelessly show girls
  in scantily clad clothing. Prove me wrong haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Seriously though, do you
  even remember that the three had to show their dancing off to Tetsuhiko so
  they can be prepared for the music video? You probably don't because I don't
  so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As Sueharu continues to lay his hands on
  <strike>Rena-chan</strike> Tetsuhiko's sister... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> so moving on, we
  have issues to solve. Firstly, Sueharu still not forgiving Kuroha over the
  amnesia incident. Well, I wish this main guy is strong-willed enough to not
  succumb to her way to evading her acts, but somehow this will happen
  eventually and she will be forgiven on the damage inflicted on her childhood
  friend, but let's say that will not happen just yet because hearing
  <strike
    ><a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase" target="_blank"
      >Inorin</a
    ></strike
  >
  Kuroha say "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/suki" target="_blank">suki</a>"
  over and over again is making me smile (haha), and of course Tetsuhiko should
  be the one who should NOT be forgiven EVER just because he cut into him
  deeper. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Again, Sueharu doesn't know, this idiot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Also lol
  what's with the cards thing) (Personally I like some "Sergeant Kuroha" punish
  me please haha ah-) Well then again what's the problem even!? Flirty Kuroha is
  back which I like, and the only one losing out is Sueharu. What's wrong?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span>&nbsp;Then, Sueharu realizing how great his childhood
  friend is in person before moving on to the main girls for the week lmao. Yes,
  it's not Kuroha haha, the latter I mentioned. But hey, if she's a good
  studying buddy, what's not to lose? Well, when you marry the sh*t out of
  Shirokusa we'll see if she can keep up- Oh that one has a maid? Then never
  mind. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And as Sueharu slaps&nbsp;<strike>Kuroha's butt</strike
  >&nbsp;his cheeks to pull himself together, now we know how much of a
  childhood friend or
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/anesan" target="_blank">ane-san</a> this
  girl has been in on his life. Man, I couldn't be more grateful if I were him.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> More on that later, but as we hear more stories about Sueharu
  involving NOT the three main girls (Uh oh, we doing some Shida
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> jealousy
  here too? *<a
    href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en&amp;ls"
    target="_blank"
    >cues music</a
  >* Hey, didn't believe I'll have to use this on NOT Kuroha but here we are.)
  while still being able to set up the stage perfectly thanks to Akane somehow
  (Speaking from Anime experience though, Akane-chan? If your members wouldn't
  even put in enough effort to practice like, lesser effort than the girls from
  "K-ON!" you should just quit haha) I think we do have a fruitful day ahead of
  us haha. And as the sun sets on Day 2, Sueharu noticed her beloved girl (I
  mean) (We'll get to why I say this later shortly) dancing under the moonlight
  just because she's the only one falling back in practice and, you know,
  suffering minor injuries in the process. Man, kudos to Shirokusa putting in
  this much effort. It sure is paying off somehow, whatever form it is in right
  now it's&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hatsukoi" target="_blank"
    >first love</a
  >&nbsp;anyways. (Meiko be like "do whatever man" haha she doesn't even care
  you didn't bring her on the trip too haha) COINCIDENTALLY lol, we have the
  Shida twins watching over those two at the villa- How small is this place??
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again it's probably not that far away anyways so... But still,
  you get the idea. Everyone wants a piece of the main guy (sorry Tetsuhiko lol
  not sorry) yes including ALL of the Shida sisters which I cannot comprehend
  anyways, but yeah Aoi-chan is right, don't go in that type of target too deep.
  Well I did before, first love, and I tell you, doing nothing and watching is
  better. I did a lot of dumb things I can only laugh at now that I'm twice my
  age that time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> The music video filmed the next day was great
  just because the Anime production here is better than the production team
  inside of this Anime lol, plot twist someone fell down the steps but was fine
  because the one dude saved her so start guessing who haha, AND they have to
  wrap it up with a Abe-Tetsuhiko conclusion. Kinda spoils the mood here huh.
  Good thing is, we know everything and more than these two summarized, so I
  don't think I want to iterate anymore. Thing is, there is an obvious
  consequence to this incident at the end because surprise surprise, and you
  don't have to ask the father for permission because he will go along with it
  too, Shirokusa will now take care of Sueharu AT HIS PLACE now that it looks
  like the dude sprained his arm or something he has a cast now man wtf how
  heavy is Shirokusa <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, this is a fantastic episode, maybe
  even better over the previous. I know sitting on Sueharu is like the best
  thing ever how can you ever top that lol (Kuroha please don't do it), but yeah
  since this is a harem Anime series after all, having all these emotions sorted
  out or even hinted at especially from the minor characters is interesting to
  watch to say the least. I wished Kuroha had more chances at winning, but
  seeing that she is so obstinate in making up with her long time childhood
  friend, then Shirokusa can only take this chance whenever she can seeing that
  Maria is only going to lose from here on. Yes, I meant in the chest department
  HAHAHAHA as for next episode though... yeah they didn't get the maid to talk,
  but if I'm not wrong that's voiced by Ede-chan, by the way. Haha if you don't
  know who she is or who she is voiced by I expect a lot more of fanservice next
  episode so I guess come back then. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  as a singer and yes if you haven't known her through a certain Anime "BLEACH"
  ending you don't know her enough,
  <b>RYTHEM's self cover of their own songs</b> form a decade ago is great

  for Anime next season. Hey, I guess that's how you sell those songs these
  days, putting it with an Anime and not let mainstream gain this benefit. Don't
  be too surprised though; That's how they can justify their music careers
  actually. And yes you can see all the tweets I liked for

  <br />So for next week, looks like we only have
  <b>SCANDAL's new single</b> similar to the one in March which is for their
  15th anniversary and since there aren't any previews let's hope it's good so I
  can add it to the package that is waiting right now, and
  <b>Waki Azumi's new single</b> which didn't have impressive topic songs but we
  have come so far so I'll at least give a listen. The upcoming weeks after will
  be better though, finally having some vivid undress and stuff.<br />
  <br />

  Okay I'm tired so I better stop here. I do have plans to improve loading GIFs
  on this site because some of them do take some time to load and I know Blogger
  is being a bro by optimizing that load, but still. Also, I think I have to go
  see the doctor again, really not feeling too well and the fevers are coming
  back and it's NOT the pandemic lol which is why I hope I don't have to go get
  swabbed, but you know that's not true, none of it. Cya guys next week then,
  and until next time...

  where the feathers flew all over the place. Clearly they didn't rehearse this
  because why would you rehearse the cleaning up

  P.P.S. I don't think this will be archived for long but even if it is then go

  Once again, and I will say this for those streams which fall into this
  category, I appreciate the extra effort into making it more scripted to
  entertain an online audience instead of treating it as a live because... you
  know, there's no audience. They also took like what, seconds, to change out of
  outfits to make this livestream seamless. So thanks production, you definitely
  made this memorable.
