<div>Man, I miss giving two-track singles haha</div>
<div>
  <br />Hey, didn't expect this to be happening too, but hey, I have a feeling
  we'll get to another one of SCANDAL's singles this year for each season so go figure. If you don't get this then just ask me what
  happened three months ago lol. Anyways, since I've actually given the single,
  I guess we should talk about it. Just this time around, we're getting
  emotional.

  (From what looks like a windowsill, I think we have a clearer image
  compared to their previous single)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: It's this world famous girls' rock band's 15th anniversary together,
  and to show how much they have grown from being just a band which has songs
  written for them to writing their own songs to even creating their own music
  and fashion label which is supported by millions of fans, they have come quite
  far a way. And after a strong first single, the girls probably sat down to
  think of the many years of emotions they have gone through, and came up with a
  song to touch hearts in these tough times. Let us see how they have achieved
  greatness yet again.
</div>
<div><br />(1) Ivory<br /></div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Floating and floating, in this dim world
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Search and search, I also fumble</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Swaying and swaying, with these swaying emotions
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Slowly enjoying, and living (life)"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  As you can hear the moment the vocalist starts after a mellow intro, yes we
  have lead guitarist and not usual vocalist MAMI-san on the vocals this time
  around, a super rare chance we will see that happen in their music library to
  be honest. Besides the obvious change of vocals, this song is also different
  in mood compared to their previous song, singing a song true to life, being
  real, and making us reflect in these rough times. Simplicity might be her best
  point as composer and lyricist of the band in recent years, and this one
  follows a similar style, with her singing totally in character to represent
  what it means to live. I must say initial impressions did hit me quite hard
  considering if I was not wrong I was rather happy at that time, and this song
  truly brought me down to their level. And that is how I know, this was a
  powerful song in depth. The only things I can complain is probably the lack of
  experience of MAMI-san as a singer because yes HARUNA can do better, but it's
  the uniqueness and the mood of this song which calls for the occasion to make
  it more unique than usual.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Peacefully Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Ivory (Acoustic Ver.)</div>
<div>
  Yes so basically this is just MAMI on her guitar without everyone else and the
  studio level production, nothing but her. But hey, it's as good as it gets.
  Maybe a little on the sour side if you can get the feelings in it even deeper.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Summary: I can't emphasize how good they are over the years giving us great
  tunes to remember, and this will continue the trend as they continue to search
  for their image, and define to us what makes them them, 15 years into their
  formation. I would not recommend buying this single since it's not much, but
  what is much of this song one would not easily forget. Feeling for this single
  doesn't take much, and if you are already in the mood this song will not
  disappoint.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>- Kaineng, on the Klassic Note</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (Wow did I praise them too much? Hey with all the criticism I get on work I
  could be nice once in a while to others)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE PACKAGE</div>
<div>
  Of course, you can see the overall package when I talk about it too, but I
  will show what specifically is in this CD of course. Well, don't expect much:
  It's the same as the last time we reviewed one of these.
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

  So as you can see, not much right here. Normally I would have something to
  talk about like special gifts, where I got this from but all this seems rather
  irrelevant considering only the Limited Editions will come with merchandise
  which of course also cost money, and that it doesn't matter much because I
  take this as buying music, not buying whatever that comes along with it. So
  there you go, pure music affection and support right there, how little it is
  compared to their fanbase of course. Happy 15th anniversary, SCANDAL. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
<div>
  So this shall be it. Coming right up will be a proper talk about the biggest
  package we'll probably be getting since that yearly Suruga-ya run which of
  course, isn't as packed as this one because we have some T-shirts to cover!!
  So yeah, see you on the other side I gotta model for this now somehow haha
  yeah this might be a first in my blogging career lol
