That's my problem lol <div><br /></div><div>  Okay I should stop with these negative intros the package dropped by this   week! Yay, another successful harvest haha it was quite a lot but I swear the   upcoming package(s) will be even better so I'll be looking forward to that   while considering if I want to go see the doctor before the left side of my   body gives way haha don't ask me if I got the vaccine or not pls </div><div><br /></div><div>  Next season Anime talk is also up, and man does it start early. Or is this   season ending late? Yeah maybe that's why but that is definitely not stopping   me to pick my choices for next season this is all the entertainment I have now   it's either hospitalization or nothing </div><div><br /></div><div>...</div><div><br /></div><div>  Let's talk about entertainment, shall we? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Summer2021Anime01">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Summer 2021 Anime Preview</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">[Powered by <a href="https://randomc.net/2021/06/25/summer-preview-2021/" target="_blank">Random Curiosity</a>]</div>  </blockquote>  So yeah, it's that time of the season again! I'll list down anything I see on   the post first hand, and tell you whether in general I will watch it all the   way, watch it for a couple of episodes to know if it's good especially if it's   vague in preview, watch an episode just because, or not watch it at all   because I don't have all the time in the world to watch dozens of series every   three months AND I'm not keen on all of them anyways because it's all stupid   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a> stories   and sequels and whatever boy idol group bullshit   <div><br /></div>  <div>Hey, I can have opinions right? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br /><br />So, here it is:</div>  <div>    <ul style="text-align: left;">      <li>        Man, when you call your monsters in the series "others" I'm pretty sure         the band I know SPECIAL OTHERS is more interesting than this. So no         thanks, <b>"Scarlet Nexus"</b>.       </li>      <li>        Ah so <b>"Oh, Tsushima"</b> is like those cats who can talk? Okay I'm         not a cat lover anyways, but I like voice actresses who like cats?         (Audience: F**k off) (Okay haha)       </li>      <li>        <b><a href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202021%20Preview/Kanojo_Kanojo.jpg" target="_blank">"Kanojo mo Kanojo"</a></b>        [Premieres July 2nd, 2021] will probably be in my watchlist because as         if I didn't have enough of romance and/or harem Anime for this season         lol *looks at OsaMake* the cast is spectacular because you get to cheat         on Sakura Ayane (again) but this time with Ajuju (Waki Azumi) and what is         cheating on your girlfriend without a whole set of other girls to potentially cheat on         (now this is what I call "others" lol this is a Scarlet Nexus         reference?), so yeah I will watch this even if for a couple of episodes         to see the main girl on the short end again haha       </li>      <li>        <b>"Bokutachi no Remake"</b> sounds like a good Anime and slice-of-life         which I miss until you realize... it's time travel. So yeah, it's those         "I can go back in time to fix my mistakes" where in this case taking         university (college) again? I mean, Naobou's great as cool girl (hehe),         but why Koga Aoi has the high pitch voice and why this story doesn't         appeal to me I don't even know. So nah.       </li>      <li>        Hmm wow. I don't know what to say when I saw the many voice actresses         promoting this series, but now that I've seen the trailer for         <b><a href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202021%20Preview/Tantei%20_wa_Mou.jpg" target="_blank">"Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru."</a></b>        [Premieres July 4th, 2021] I must say I'm curious in the mystery itself.         So it's like, the assistant whose main detective died and he has to         solve the mystery behind how like, a spiritual successor is back to help         him out? Man, it's confusing, I really feel like giving an episode to         see how far this mindf**k goes, so we shall see. I think I'll put it on         the tab.       </li>      <li>        Okay serious talk though this one next up might be even better- Heck why         has it got to be romance again? (Haha I can't get out of this loop         someone please send help) So yes, I might just watch         <b><a href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202021%20Preview/Shinigami_Bocchan.jpg" target="_blank">"Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid"</a></b>        [Premieres July 4th, 2021] purely because the premises of the plot is         real good. I mean, I probably had a better life than that main dude who         can't even touch anything living since he was five even though that's         also me WITHOUT a curse just that I die lmao, but you know, the...         testing of this curse will make this infinitely more interesting than it         can be, so yeah- Wait Minase Inori is in this??? Haha let's see if I can         get over the... 3D animation? I don't know watch the trailer yourself         and you tell me       </li>      <li>        I thought <b>"Shiroi Suna no Aquatope"</b> is very like "Nagi no         Asukara" but the latter has lore and this is basically a coming of age         story so I don't think I'll be sinking (get it?) into this anytime soon.         Also, this is very similar to those "I have to come up with shit to save         this company/place" premise so may~be I'm not that keen after all I         thought like, the drama will keep me on my heels but not really       </li>      <li>        Man like really, what IS         <b><a href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202021%20Preview/Sonny_Boy.jpg" target="_blank">"Sonny Boy"</a></b>?? [Premieres July 15th, 2021] I know it's an original Anime but man         did they get influenced by weird genres like "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei"         and just dump a class of high schoolers into an alternate world? Does         this count as isekai if I watch this?? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I wished this had more         clarification I just don't want it to be a life lesson at the end of         this I got enough of that just this season alone lol (Is that Oonishi Saori as main         girl? Yes haha good for her) <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> You know what? I'll give this an         episode when it comes up, I'm curious haha       </li>      <li>        <b>"Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai!"</b> sounds like fun because it's just a         demon girl descending into Earth to try to get back up so we know it's         going to be rough and funny, it's prepared to get a two-cour punch right         off the bat meaning it'll last two seasons, but it will be kind of late         in arrival, not to say there isn't a proper trailer yet. I'll get to it         when the time comes, but probably not even if Oozora Naomi is the main         girl but... well ask me in a month haha       </li>    </ul>    <div>      I have a feeling I'm still stuck in the romance genre for now lol why, but       also more importantly, I may be stuck in the Sunday premiere timeslot       which, if you don't know Anime broadcasts in late nights, means I'll only       get to watch them earliest Monday. And Monday isn't exactly a great day to       watch shows, trust me my weekends do not include Monday haha. So yeah, I       may have to come up with something if I want to watch any number of       these.<br />      <br />      <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HigeHiro12">        <div style="text-align: center;">          <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;">            Hige wo Soru. Soshite Joshikousei wo Hirou.</span>        </div>      </blockquote>      <blockquote class="tr_bq">        <div style="text-align: center;">          "You are sure you didn't lay your hands on Sayu?" Wow this coming from           the mother? Haha Yoshida is fine can't say about the other ones           before him though         </div>      </blockquote>      Well the mother doesn't know a lot about Sayu anyways when she left house,       so whatever. Still, she doesn't care so go figure. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this       <strike>final</strike> new episode where we have to confront the final       boss of this series lol (#HigeHiro12), yeah gotta do that b*tch slap again       just in case it didn't get you last week haha. Thank goodness Issa did       stop her in face of a guest... which again, did not place any great impression on her, so let's see how this goes. So, story. Man, this is going to be       rough, so hold tight or stay away, if you want to prevent a tearjerker.       The guys finally arrived back at Sayu's home... place that she calls home       lol, and immediately gets slapped by the mother. Great start, isn't it?       And as they sit down on the table, the mother still really went on with       the current situation rambling as if that no one has considered of the       consequences of that (and that's why she came back home, or else she might       as well never) and also because this IS still the place she calls home, as       begrudgingly undesired as Sayu may have wanted to. Yeah, we all thought       they could come to some understanding, but maybe just as Issa said, these       two may need to get some communication going. See how Issa's conciliatory       relationship towards her mother went by so far, not bad right? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>       Okay, story, please. The mother continues to then rant about Yoshida's       current appearance at her place, about how he took her of her while she       left home considering why would she leave home in the first place if       she couldn't survive for long (Spoiler Alert: It's because of the mother),       and even with Sayu explaining her intention for leaving home, and not       because it wouldn't justify her leaving, but then the mother just thinks       whoever took her in is crazy and shouldn't have meddled in family affairs.       Okay, if your family isn't this screwed up NO ONE would want to interfere.       You think the teacher who visited your place wanted to interfere? Oh       please. I wished Yoshida will say something more than that first instead       of "yes I did effectively kidnap your daughter", but seriously thanks Sayu       with the interjection: It's really just because the mother doesn't learn       how to give a shit. To anyone. Literally. It's as if she <i>isn't</i> your       daughter. Wait, was I wrong? She's YOUR daughter, right? Just, don't tell       me I don't care. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> This guys, THIS is her attitude towards a childbirth       of regret. Down all the way, she IS still your daughter, is this how you       treat them? I mean, we know of many stories&nbsp; and you might too, of       irresponsible parents not taking care of kids, so this one is just adding       to the list. But seriously though: who is responsible? The dad haha yeah       but he left so now what? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> You see though, then just like Yoshida,       who is going to be that responsible adult who will still do a parental       duty right till the end? Is it you, mom who doesn't give two f**ks?       Probably not, and that's why all this happened. Not because you gave birth       to Sayu, dear mom; No one would forsake a childbirth easily even if it's       of a regret. (Okay early abortion is an option but have you not seen       literal foetuses on garbage dumps overseas? Ugh) But not raising her up IS       your fault, ya b*tch. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay I should stop laughing. Because       really, even if it's no one else's business, one should not even treat       their kid like this, for whatever reason. But if you take my insults       seriously, then maybe, maybe, you would think yourself through. Or not.       Whatever. Even Yoshida can only do that much. But okay, I know full well       what Issa mentioned about the mother's problems, as we have seen, she kind       of has a mental problem herself probably due to the father's betrayal most       likely, but also, maybe that's why her mother then, could not execute       properly her responsibilities as a parent. See, Issa probably was already       taking care of himself when Sayu was out, seeing the age difference       between the siblings. Maybe that's why, plus a busy mother, that she       rather not give a damn about this mistake she did two decades ago with       another man be in her way of her mental state, I suppose. Still, it's       obvious enough of a drop, they make Yoshida a good pointer here, that he       is someone who rather take responsibility in taking care of this high       schooler than the actual parent who rather let her die on the streets. Not       even once, NOT EVEN ONCE, did she bother to get her daughter back home.       It's all the brother, if you didn't notice, even if it's on the orders of       the mother. And that word says a lot of things even. <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> Ultimately       yes, it's really just because Yoshida is just too nice to not let Sayu die       out on the streets at night, that one time. So hopefully, after all this,       as Yoshida confronts the mother again after getting her brain going ie.       her mental illness probably kicked in, we may have a mother who will... at       least not try to make her want to jump off the now highly fenced school       roof before she graduates. The humiliation then on might be rough, but       it's going to be a couple of years, and then who gives a shit about this       family haha. Okay, Issa be nice guy too but look at who did the       <a href="https://jisho.org/search/dogeza" target="_blank">dogeza</a>      first. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay I think I've said my piece enough; What do you think       about this episode? Is it sufficient in Anime level perspective? Should it go deeper to talk about the reality of both sides and how they can       actually come to a conclusion? Or should it never have been dug too deep       like what it is now? Because again, what she says is never what will be in       action until it's done. I just felt like the depth for this episode might       not be enough, but the aggravation is there so I wouldn't say it's too bad       Yoshida did go on his knees so that's something lol. Cya guys next week       then, because next week is the final episode instead of this week it seems       I really thought we are done, but maybe it's happy ending time, isn't it?       I cried too much this episode alone I could use some happiness here haha</div><div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2dnjAKX5SJQ/YNhfD1kevMI/AAAAAAABFno/spqAIlHRHmYpYC-AiQDAVkwJCj1tBvt-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro12_yoshida.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This series in a nutshell.<br />Think about it.           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VLvgf63eJA4/YNhfE17B4KI/AAAAAAABFns/eFrE2oG6buYjPcybVfkKxKaN8O_FoB3HwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro12_sayu.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This series in a nutshell.<br />Think about it.           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>      </div>      P.S. Not quoting from anyone else but myself: "Parenthood cannot be more       <a href="https://jisho.org/search/minikui" target="_blank">unsightly</a>      than this considering your kid can be smart enough to know to leave and       not suffer at your very own hands." This, I felt a lot from this series       even when I heard about the mother's story.<br />      <br />      <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="OsaMake11">        <div style="text-align: center;">          <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;">            Osananajimi ga Zettai ni Makenai Love Comedy</span>        </div>      </blockquote>      <blockquote class="tr_bq">        <div style="text-align: center;">          "Hehe, I didn't write this (on your bandage)" Okay dear genius then tell           me who would write this lol         </div>      </blockquote>      And that's probably why the entertainment industry can NOT be trusted lol       we going back that route again huh. Hopefully we are still in the final       arc of this series, for the new episode (#OsaMake11) I guess we can still       be lovey-dovey while making a documentary, huh. Just that yeah, this has       to happen sooner than later. Because back to the story, that one       Shun we have seen some weeks ago who got his face splashed probably got       his revenge right and square by publishing sub fake stories of Sueharu's       past into light for the public to know which is probably not accurate, but       you know, these guys haven't made their video yet they still basking in       the sun making that one music video lol. So, next plan meeting of course,       where Tetsuhiko laid out the plan to override the current situation with a       video broadcast backing big enough to get attention, and this time around, let the       three girls to talk about the past with him to make this something more       accurate by all means. Well, maybe we should cut down on the romancing       parts lol. Hey, at some point they gotta figure out what NOT to film for       the documentary right? Or we are going to just cut those romancing parts all out?       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Well, Tetsuhiko will think of something lmao. So firstly,       Shirokusa's side. She talks about a simple story of courage and adventure,       with Sueharu as a kid talking about shit like going to Tokyo Tower alone       with a rich kid's girl... I mean, THAT is how you know you have a lot of       power lol. Anyways, obviously they failed, but that doesn't stop him       trying, is the point he delivered to Shiro-chan back then. Definitely also       helped in shaping Shirokusa's mind and body (those       <a href="https://jisho.org/search/boinboin" target="_blank">boing boings</a>, get it?) today, so I guess she's just grateful for that. Okay so how does that       contribute to this documentary? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Oh well who cares the editor for       the video will figure it out haha as the video is dumped on whoever is receiving it from Shirokusa probably Tetsuhiko lmao. The two did go to the Tokyo       Tower for real this time obviously without much obstruction the butler       will even drive her there lol, and I think Sueharu has managed to strike a       deal with the maid to avoid unnecessary conflict from here on by offering       shots of Shirokusa in return lol this genius. I mean, who wouldn't want       some bromides for favours? I would haha. Man, I have a feeling this       documentary is just going to showcase this harem. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I mean, look at       those girls on the bed with him in the morning touching his- Please, it's       muscles, please. Don't get him into trouble the neighbours will literally come in knocking haha yes I       meant ALL the Shida sisters lmao. Next up, we have Maria's side of the       story. As Sueharu said they have to come to this specific road at some       point, but yes it's where the mother got hit for real by a car during       filming. I know this shouldn't be possible even with all the precautions       taken, but an accident is still an accident, so yeah we have already       talked about Sueharu's feelings on her passing, and how much he still       wants to finish the sequel despite losing his loved one at that point back       then. Maria really wanted to rant about why he left the entertainment       industry but then again she didn't know the details, well&nbsp;then again,       Sueharu also felt nothing already ever since her mother's passing, so I       guess it doesn't matter already, Maria-chan. <span title="*sob*">üò¢</span> Okay maybe not I was       wrong, because as Maria talks about her relationship with the mother       ("I've always loved your mom" haha I guess Sueharu you have lost to your       mother lol ok me) and the unknowing of her passing as a kid because no one       told her about it and that's why Sueharu left after being done with that       drama, that's probably what brought him back to remember his sadness when       he lost his loved one. They both shared tears in remembrance of the       passing of the mother (AND SHE WINS lol ok we get it), and yeah this       probably let Maria redeem       <strike>her top position in the harem ranking</strike>&nbsp;her ignorance       back then as a kid and now growing up as an entertainer. Hmm this episode       in all... I must say it hits things. Well besides hitting muscles lol why,       I must say everything else did fall into place a lot more naturally now       that we have most if not all the lore behind their stories. So yeah, it's       real easy to talk about them especially in detail, and I guess let the       emotions run high after we have experienced like, just pure affection of       Sueharu from all the girls for so long lol. Good to see this series still       can talk good emotional drama when they have to. So I guess for next week,       we have Kuroha's story which probably won't be as strong as these two but       who knows, and then the conclusion it seems. Next week is indeed the final       episode       <a href="https://twitter.com/osamake_project/status/1408349246533738498?s=20" target="_blank">they are already doing the countdown</a>      on the official Twitter. Hmm, so far so good, I guess, they gotta hit the       final arc a little more strongly I suppose, and it is going well, so let's       hope for a decent conclusion coming next week. It's probably not going to       end up tops just like all the girls in this series but who knows? Only       Sueharu knows what's happening and I wouldn't even call him a genius lol</div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CYZwe6FI0-k/YNhfR-6CRyI/AAAAAAABFnw/c6QSsRkd13sfduObd4jbMvW0hdEoPmoRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake11_bed.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Can confirm this is a porno lmao<br />(This is that "what is the             maid doing on our bed" scene, huh)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L2D1Po3EiOM/YNhfR68r6NI/AAAAAAABFn0/f-hzTvpwNbskTQPGvrZ00lKuon12ZpAjgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake11_girls3.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Can confirm this is a porno lmao<br />(HOW WRONG IS THIS??

So, and not because Kouno Marika is the main character in       this... short series if I'm not wrong (#EdenAnime), we talk about the       world of robots. Well there's a human in this so hear me out. It starts       with robot creation and maintenance protocol (probably written by humans)       which state that, most importantly, if anyone is seen helping humans, they       will be eliminated, which if I swear, does eliminate the first two rules       which talk about humans creating robots lol. As you can see something is       already wrong here, but let's move on first. Story goes I'm not going to       name the robots names just because haha, there is this blue robot which is       in an army of robots inside an apple orchard it seems (So, uh, who are       these apples for? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>), and of course besides doing the obvious like       watering and harvesting apples, that very robot also chanced upon what       looked like a capsule with another yellow robot, which opened up to be,       you guessed it, a human. An infant, to be specific. Well she       can talk and walk so I guess more than an infant maybe toddler level but       yes, the same rules above apply for these two robots but instead of       immediately reporting the human to the place they call Eden Three, the       yellow robot (out of sympathy, in case you didn't notice) chose to report       it later. Way later. Like, even if a security guard appears and they still       managed to smoke it over later. Like, when they thought they could pass it       on to the Underground which is a bunch of robots who are in closer contact       with human and/or human culture but then got found out and arrested which       the two luckily escaped with the kid (Oh no robots hate Anime culture lol       "robots must be eliminated" haha) kind of later. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I think you get the       idea by now, but yeah, they raised this kid as their kid. And yeah this       kid is just growing up eating only apples, huh. Okay, still better than my       nutrition plan lmao. But they do know it's not about whether she would be       found, it's just WHEN she would be found. And that's not good news to       anybody, not even them robots themselves. So yeah, as they managed to       escape from the Underground, one of the robots managed to drop them a set of coordinates to       effectively, you know, escape from the premises because why would you need       to build walls for robots they can't run away like humans do HAHAHAHAHA       okay back to this. The two robots then decide, with the most ridiculous       decision ever, to leave the kid alone and... Aw come on, the kid is calling       you dad and mom now, you can't leave it here. Excuse me, her. Haha almost       forgot she's the human here lol. So so far we are only on the precipice of       the story, within this Eden Three place, and as they all reach the       specified coordinates known as the Oasis because you know there's one oasis in it, an elder robot greets them telling them the bigger worldview,       which consists of many of them robots able to run away from Eden rule,       their ability to speak with humans, and the belief that humans can save all of them       metal things. *scoff* Haha hey they don't know. I assume this is centuries       after human downfall so yeah, but you know, Eden Three now is just robots       so that's not human friendly. Okay, besides them. Fast forward years later       where the kid Sara here has grown some height and a pair of boobs haha, she then       learns of the stuff around her, of danger and exploration, of that thing       that elder robot used to spy on Eden Three as a robot which is totally       cool I must say, and... had first contact with voices at Eden Three. Not       great haha especially when they decide to eliminate her. Uh oh,       if they get rid of Marinka then what will happen to my fanclub membership?       And that signed membership card?? (lol) Them robots are going to continue       to charge me for the fees right? Damned automatic payments haha okay move on please I       just want to make some idolism jokes here</div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WBPFy7QfT4o/YNhgR2S7fyI/AAAAAAABFoY/VGieSG5cpj8Mw_NIMu1_wsKNtJRWaiYCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/edenanime1_shelter1.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Parenthood in a nutshell           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eL2Vju1fnbM/YNhgSpTirXI/AAAAAAABFoc/Tmff4xn3b4EIFx3JAhFPjtTsdb8wGXXvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/edenanime1_shelter2.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Parenthood in a nutshell           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>      </div>    <blockquote>      <div style="text-align: center;">        "If I can understand human emotions, I can trust Sara's decisions"         That's... true       </div>    </blockquote>    <div>      So, moving on, and yes LONG POST WARNING haha I might minimize this part       to say the least, we talk about the truth behind this world. So now, we       know that this world has human lying around which might just be robots and       I'm still right technically, but yes, Sara is ready to find out the truth       about her world. That'll probably make the dad and mom worried considering       she did lie about 1,345 times in her life so far lmao (DELETE FROM       "HumanDialogue" WHERE Source = "Sara") (lol SQL joke) but besides her own       discoveries and quick learning of stuff from the elder robots and her       surroundings, she also learnt that there might be human activity inside       Eden itself. Well, each Eden considering it's "Eden Three" so there must       be at least two more of those. But yeah, that robot which is probably tied       to Eden got her a lot more information than all of them can handle,       including learning of microwave technology which will get her tastier       potatoes lol how much can she eat, and using the thumb drive to get them       footage of... humans dancing? Sure, yeah, that'll make them happy haha.       But yes, as we can see here, there is much history about humans in a world       dominated by robots that we do not understand, but with the reveal of the       two other humans in the story, it seems that it might be due to       environmental degradation on the planet. If you need spoilers this one conversationalist is probably fighting to save as much land as possible       from desertification, while the Eden project humans are, take my word for       it, preparing for an apocalypse. But but, we're not done yet, there's       more. I'm truly enjoying the layers of story here though so hear me out it       won't be as long as the first one haha. And in respect of Sara's decision       for that call for help, the other robots decide, even including the       parents, to let her go on her own (okay with PJ) to find out Eden for herself,       considering that the security from Eden Three might be out to find her,       hiding inside enemy territory would be the best decision ever. You know       that quote. And so, she dropped by the apple orchard collecting facility       into one of the boxes, and almost ended up in a pit. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Man Sara's       logic is great haha but yeah, no need for human carrying into another       machine so they just drop you into it. Well, the apples, of course, but       you're not that. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Luckily, PJ saved her butt and they land       somewhere safe. And as if the parents thought they could use the spy robot       to track Sara's whereabouts, that very robot got mysteriously controlled       by some AI which, coincidentally, is also the one who called out to her       name. The robot led her to some sanctuary down and below, where, wow this       is something, human were put into cryogenic sleep (And under normal       condition? What about those that aren't- Ah well haha). And that number counting down is now, we have learnt, the time left for cryogenic sleep to expire and they       probably will probably expire (get it?) if not opened. Figured that out       yet? Yeah, because I do. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So far the logic of the story is not       lying here: There are humans about, and from what we can see, they are       about to meet. For better or for worse.</div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dk_TYc55wpA/YNhggbBmYtI/AAAAAAABFog/_t62gpqiOqkicEDa9RW-TTQYxEyT_STcQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/edenanime2_scared.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The humour in this series is just so subtle yet so good... lol           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-54OCCqDVBdw/YNhghLvCXyI/AAAAAAABFok/em4s3szhIZIeZHUc8QjBvYt4K5ADIfiMACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/edenanime2_assemble.gif" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            LOOK AT HOW COOL THIS IS!!

Not a robot? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> *shockers*       </div>    </blockquote>    <div>      So yes, we reach the morality stage of this series but I really prefer to       call this movie- Why isn't this a movie?? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, that Eden One       AI told her on what to do to wake the humans up from sleep in a world of       environmental degradation so not actually good, so now we have to decide       whether it's actually right to even do this or not. No humans have       dictated that this should be right even for the robots, so... planning       failed maybe? Unlikely case but that's where the conundrum starts. Maybe       waking humans up might not be a good thing after all... So, as we continue       on this story it's getting exciting, we now are trying to find a way to       wake up the humans... or not. Maybe not so far, as you know, the Eden       robot army is getting in the way. The parents managed to run into Eden       Three for some reason to find their daughter after she nearly escaped from       robots, and they found Emily, that robot that was with Dr. Fields, the       other human Sara knows existence of, but also, the only robot which will       give her more information as to what happened to that doctor in       particular. (Man, I really thought they would lose sight of it with Sara       talking away lol) Known as Eden Zero and completely wiped off the robot       map, inside lies an abandoned abode with stories to tell. Well, mostly       through Emily I don't think Sara can figure this out herself anyways haha       I know she read a lot of old books but still. But sadly, and obviously       that will happen, the Eden Three army got to them. Bad things happened and       I rather not talk about them here too much, but despite the parent's       appeal to Zero about how good Sara is as a human but since they got       caught... yeah.&nbsp;I mean, the parents aren't wrong: this one human is       nice, brought up by the from a toddler. Put 35000 of them adults together and it won't be such the case haha ah       hey. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Sara's... robot parents are no more, that's for sure. In       response, Sara retaliated like all humans will do to save their own lives       or others which is fight (why is there a stick for her lol also she is       electricity prone? WHAT YEAR IS THIS haha), but also means that, in front       of all the other robots in the Oasis and Zero, she has proven her violent       tendencies which of course, proves that humans are dangerous. Okay, you       win, I guess. And as Sara barely escaped from execution through that same       pit she saw before haha hey they don't have guns and/or ropes in the Eden       lol the pit to digest fruit was the most dangerous thong, but as you can see, she is in quite a pickle. And as she returns back       to Eden Zero which is technically still safe, Emily shows her another       video of Dr. Fields which also, tells us about the truth of the reality of       this world. Dr. Fields isn't actually dead: He has been mentally       transported to a robot. And surprise surprise, it's the very robot that       tried to kill her. See? Humans are evil, even if they were transported       into a robot. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey, I didn't write the script, someone else did. A       human. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay human jokes aside, this story has provided a lot of       context as to the worldview, reminds me of "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/9314/Fractale" target="_blank">Fractale</a>" which I liked and is       also an original series, and what a plot twist! The best part about this       is of course, Dr. Fields' memories aren't erased, as seen from just a       moment where Zero reacted to dad voices, it looks like Eden One's       AI has sealed them down. Which means...</div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1GAN38x2flY/YNhhHinp4dI/AAAAAAABFo8/8y-Z0G7yHF8Ed9hyDDLHvQm6EX-In62QwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/edenanime3_drone1.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How to know you have been discovered by drones<br />(Wait, you can't             see?

Well, obviously there will be a showdown, but       it's not what you think. Well, at least they weren't any guns... right, Dr. Fields?       Yes, as with what he woke to, he woke up years later after her       wife and daughter passed away due to an epidemic it seems (don't, don't       even relate to today, please) seeing the Eden project in success. Apples       grow on tress that can be eaten, robots haven't killed each other yet lol       well that's good, and humans are still preserved through cryogenic sleep. That       is until, Dr. Fields found out about the world outside of his world. It's       probably vague so let me guess it's other humans on the planet wanting to       ruin the Eden project, which is probably what caused Dr. Fields to put       himself into a robot so he can prevent his worlds from being ruined by,       you guessed it, other humans including himself. Ironically though, remember the 2 pods that       were opened out of the people inside Eden One sleeping? The other one was       Sara. (No seriously I thought it was Liz but I guess she did pass away)       Not like they explained why she would have been opened haha maybe robot       bug or glitch, but yeah, they needed a twist for this to pick up I guess.       The story definitely focused a lot on the humanity of robots to not harm       humans which is great advantage and total immunity for Sara to advance her investigations       into the truth of the world through Emily the robot,       figuring out a way to wake everyone up from sleep. That, as we slowly       realize and conclude, as much as humans are such jerks who will result in       this Eden project from being considered in the first place, it's better to       wake everyone up, and there's no much time left. Also, I don't like the idea of killing 34,998 humans lol. On Eden's side, Zero is       even more furious that this mere human could run away from       <strike>his</strike> its hands, so yeah huge robot fight coming up! I mean       seriously though, if Sara didn't tell Zurich to revive that one robot       where she found out the truth, what is that huge thing going to do? Stomp       on everything and ruin the environment once again? Man, it probably made       no sense but you know, bigger means more powerful haha. Good thing though       the robots from Oasis did manage to escape, and are helping Sara beat this       Zero thing down. Yes, Zero as in the wife's favourite number- I think he       may have f**ked himself there, this Dr. Fields. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Because other       than naming himself over that, he also left Emily intact with all the       memories of the child, enough to awaken the robot's human memory of which       it was transplanted from. I mean, we know Zero didn't mean to save Sara       but you get the idea, it's in one of the rules. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Anyways, the guy       revealed the password which is basically the three rules haha I must say       it's a good password better than those stored on browsers keyed in by most humans today lol, and we woke up the humans in the end. So yes, the answer       for Sara's question in the middle of the story, was coexistence. Robots       will keep humans in check, in a world of humans. Robots can prevent human       violence, and humans can make robots better to make the world even better.       Won't say that should be the solution in our world right now, but hey this       is like 1500 years later into the future, so let's see if it's not already       ruined with pollution and desertification by then lol</div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DmSQV1KX40s/YNhhzS3K9jI/AAAAAAABFpM/7k0eS9CLv6QsfPbQDhduaQNhTlMNR8xrwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/edenanime4_eden1.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Eden", huh.</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SarSh5gb5Kw/YNhh1LImKOI/AAAAAAABFpQ/H_DXdoBQ6I8fG6lNGOAA6mWVTwEskY2SgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/edenanime4_liz2.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is as cute as it's real sad once you know the context           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>      </div>    <div>      <blockquote style="text-align: center;">        "What kind of world are you going to let the (awakened) humans create?"

In short, I must say it's       fantastic. Shouldn't have even seen the reviews because those jerks online       suck haha (hey humans what can I say I'm a robot), but yeah, the story is       actually logically presented, and it has a reasonable conclusion that I       like of course. Again, if you have ever watched another Anime series       called "Fractale" you would understand how I would like this series. Okay minus the guns haha. I enjoyed every bit of this story, the 3DCG didn't really get in the way to       be frank Sara fighting the security bots for the first time and the final       showdown was pretty cool I must add, and the soundtrack is very well done.       For a Netflix original, once again, I'm giving this a thumbs up. They       build up enough suspense to tell a story, I saw the numbers and there are       some things that aren't explained but slowly you can figure out (Save you       the trouble, that number from the beginning of the series was uh, 500       trillion milliseconds or about 15 years Sara is around 15; It probably was       longer than that before maybe hundreds of years), there is a lot more       action to be understood over conversation which you would notice which is       probably the premise of this series I must say. If you can get over that       understanding and the simplicity of the dialogues, you can understand and       appreciate this level of production on an Anime. It's hard to find these       already these days (trust me I see every season's series and I get       disappointed), but hey, maybe it is worth picking this up. And you should       too, just like how E92 picked up that cryogenic pod in the first place.</div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qxjj_AO9Ze4/YNhh9QzvA3I/AAAAAAABFpU/XZZzTxU17hsuMspHE9dZ3gFYac56jRzCgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/edenanime4_PJ.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            PJ MVP!!

Might be a bad time to find out more artists I know releasing songs within       the year but yeah I may have to space them out so I can actually have some       time to give songs every other day or something. So,       <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tomei-na-fusen-ep/1571127939?l=en" target="_blank">Takahashi Rie's debut EP</a></b>      is okay I guess? The only disappoint I get even from the start is that       they didn't create a solo music career image for her as she's still       singing hyped up songs which is kind of true to her strengths but you       know, could've taken the chance to be different. Nonetheless, the songs       are meh, so I just gave the two topic songs they emphasized with music       videos.       <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%84%9B%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3-ep/1569376563?l=en" target="_blank">vivid undress' new mini-album</a></b>      is one release in a while but I must say I'm not that pleased since I       didn't really find something that'll remind me of past them which is fine       I guess, guess I have to find new ground for them anyways, seeing them       grow. And of course our winner for this week is obviously       <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/no-buses/1568299483?l=en" target="_blank">No Buses' 2nd album</a></b>      and I haven't even heard of the first lol, but suffice it to say they may       have settled my long time alternative music itch for a while because for       once, I've given so many songs for them I can't even <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br />      <br />      On news concerning music and is on Twitter and is technically under my       radar or until I find them lol, still disappointed why       <b><a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie/status/1407322564972584963?s=20" target="_blank">Takahashi Rie's new music video</a></b>(s) do not feature her why Rieri you no perform in MVs haha,       <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_Floor_/status/1407352873822961669?s=20" target="_blank">The Floor's new music video</a></b>      is emotional which is making me emotional because I miss their hype songs       which I hope will be in their upcoming release next month,       <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Cocoro_Auction/status/1406893912841547777?s=20" target="_blank">Cocoro Auction released two new singles this year</a></b>&nbsp;even one literally this week and I've heard none of them yet so       maybe I'll do so someday just not now,       <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1408349255140585472?s=20" target="_blank">Asakura Momo's new single cover</a></b>      is very pink just like her birthday celebrations probably so happy       birthday Mocho hehe,       <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1408379450908057600?s=20" target="_blank">TrySail's new song</a></b>      is for the Anime "Madoka Magica" series which is no surprise       there because more surprisingly is <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1409126867693715456?s=20" target="_blank">their new album releasing in September</a>, we'll talk about       <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuzzyknot_staff/status/1408379694970327046?s=20" target="_blank">fuzzy knot's new music video premiere</a></b>      next week... next week haha,       <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1408745613345230852?s=20" target="_blank">SHE's is releasing a new album coming October</a></b>      and I don't even mind I just want more because they are good, and       <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ORESKA_Official/status/1408738009256665093?s=20" target="_blank">ORESKABAND's new music video</a></b>      is... rather cool if you can bring back your emotions for Ska music haha.
