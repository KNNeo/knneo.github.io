I think watching Anime on Saturdays might be my new hobby now- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I know right? It's as if I CHOSE not to watch on a Saturday just because.
  Little did I notice I get more time for the rest of the weekend where I can practically do
  NOTHING lol the stress of Monday seeps in though but not when I'm on leave
  next Monday!!! Haha, "family trip", it seems. Also awkward I'm using this term
  because when's the last time my family had a trip together lol ugh it just looks like my mom's having a trip together with her friends instead <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anime time I guess! And thanks to Anime, we're getting a bunch of new (and
  actually) good songs on the tab, so we'll talk about those too. I know, the
  problem is just it's all female vocalists; It's gonna affect that one survey in
  Klassic Note so bad lol who else cares but me isn't it
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And trust me because I'm not a nerd who can't read Japanese for shit: My new
  hobby in recent years is to read the cast credits&nbsp;for minor characters&nbsp;at the ending of each
  episode. Seriously, it's when you know who they are and you don't notice that
  makes ALL the difference haha just like last week's KoiKimo and this week's too.</div><div>

      "Okay, we get it, come back to us" lol me when I talk about my dream

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Man, Ichika just shooting down everyone else's dreams of finding their partner,
  huh. I mean, you be dating with an old dude so you don't go- Haha hey, it
  wasn't her choice. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#KoiKimo04) where Ichika's
  ideal partner is basically NOT Ryou lmao, Rio's ideal is a sumo wrestler. So
  okay, dear fams, you have a (fat) chance (see what I did there?) of dating
  Ryou's sister now... provided you can get past the brother. And their front
  door. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I'm sorry if you can't take my terrible sarcasm) Anyways, story time, because we have quite a lot to talk about
  here. This time, it's on the company Ryou works at. Again, WAAAAAAAY too much
  women on the premise that are still single by the way <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>, and I wish I
  can get my hands on any one of them chit-chatting about on the pantry during
  lunch about Ryou, believing that he has improved his image and appearance
  mainly because he is dating someone right now. Well, not true, but he is happy
  about it, nonetheless. They think it's someone older considering how many
  women have laid hands on him enough for the colleagues to warn newbies about
  approaching him romantically, but also, because one of them overheard his
  phone call talking about a certain "Ichika-chan"? Haha he's probably talking to
  his sister, and the others believe his target apparently is also a teacher who <em>might</em> be
  sadist? Well, the sadist part is kinda true though lmao I won't deny that. But
  yeah, as you can see this "Acting
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kachou" target="_blank">Kachou</a>" has
  built up quite a reputation in the company. Not that it's a bad thing, but
  then again he's into Ichika right now so the others won't even bother I guess.
  But the rumours are spreading though. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Then, Tamaru asks the
  questions, and maybe, just a little, understands the whole situation with the
  main couple. After helping Ichika out because why wouldn't you lol <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, he
  asks Ichika about her relationship with Ryou, and then finds out later from
  the sister what has happened so far in this infatuation the brother has about
  this high schooler. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Tamaru himself though... he be wondering about
  HIS feelings about the girl. Ichika, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, no love for Rio
  here? Sadge. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then, Ichika asks her friend out to get advice on...
  what to get her friend's brother for Christmas. Like seriously, Ichika, why
  would you pair the stuff you want to repay to him for WITH Christmas anyways?
  <em>You know</em> people will get the wrong idea if you did things couple-like
  on that day. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, I guess she IS gullible lmao. Also, Rio is right:
  her brother only wants Ichika. Gifts are not necessary, girl. It's that "<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/i-want-you/1536114709?i=571982811&amp;l=en" target="_blank">WANT YOU WANT YOU I WANT YOU</a>" thing man; Ichika you can't give him that. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Nonetheless, the two
  did go out to select a present fitting of his status (we will see that soon),
  and then Ryou comes to ask his sister for what to give the girl. You know, not
  like, that one flower every other day for his own satisfaction. Man, being the
  middleman, or in this case, middlewoman, is rough. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Spoiler alert: The gift for Ichika is going to be something otaku) Up next, we have a new character to talk
  about. Yep, took me a while even though I checked on their homepage last week,
  it's voiced by yours truly, Hanazawa Kana. (Also, is this the 2nd time I've
  seen her voice a single woman her age?? Haha PSYCHE) (Well she be married now
  so it doesn't matter) What we do know about this Matsushima is, that she came
  in to the company the same time as Ryou. That's pretty much it. Any feelings whatsoever though? I
  mean, Ryou's reputation is already on the same level as the sewers so I don't think we
  will have to think too much into it. Tamaru has more prospective in liking Ichika than
  this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And lastly, Christmas, ditching your colleagues for the one
  high schooler who will give you a tie pin as a present. *YES* Ah hey,
  I'm just feeling happy for Ryou, okay? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ichika got real Limited
  Edition stuff in return though if you wonder why she can be this happy feel free to browse through
  my blog posts lmao, and they both got presents for the one person who made
  this all happen: <strike>Ichika</strike> Rio. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Hey, she didn't make
  the phone call lol) And so, they hang out at their place for foods, presents,
  and probably Sumo wrestling matches just because Rio is into them lol don't
  ask me why. All in all, fantastic episode for plot development, plenty of
  holes right now because I swear that Matsushima had waaaay lesser appearance this episode compared to the three colleagues who gossip about who Ryou is seeing lol, but I think
  we might clear up that quite soon, starting with Tamaru hopefully.

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Ooo boy what have I just seen on a series I've approved last week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
  this new episode (#HigeHiro03) where I rather they not dig too deep into the
  past, they gotta show what happened in the six months Sayu was in Tokyo but
  had no place to stay right? THEY GOTTA. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey Sayu, feels great not being
  f**ked the night before and/or smelling like s**en, yeah? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I think
  nice guy Yoshida is going the long route here, and then he will bang this
  chick someday haha hey don't quote me here. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Jokes aside, let's talk
  about this week. Eh, before we go with the emotional drop, maybe we have to
  talk about what happened in Sayu's past- I think we better not lol. So,
  story. In an interesting move, Yoshida recently rejected a business trip
  probably because of Sayu, but as you can see, people have started thinking otherwise.
  I mean, it is true people will reject such an offer mainly because you have
  family or a partner, but in this case, it's a little hard to explain, as in
  Yoshida's case of course. His house may be robbed if he goes for a business trip. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like his buddy said, it's going to get him into
  trouble someday, so just like the other times, he decides to keep it a secret.
  Well, not for long. And Mishima got mad because of it too. Hey, I like a
  jealous b*tch. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Then, Mishima asks Yoshida out for movies. I mean, if
  you didn't notice this from like, the previous episode at least, this female
  colleague has been setting her eyes on this nice guy of a superior if I'm not
  wrong, so she starts to take action, one step at a time. Whether Yoshida sees
  it or not... we will talk about it in a moment, but it's probably better than
  Gotou's relationship with Yoshida right now haha. Come on, Gotou, you can't
  look back. Then again this is a literal harem so <em>everyone</em> looks back
  haha ah hey. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yoshida has to tell the one at home that he's not coming
  back for dinner (just like how I deal with my family lol see the similarity
  here?), also revealed his location to Sayu-chan. Ah, what an idiot, isn't he?
  Good game brother; It has been nice knowing you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And just like any
  cringe drama Anime, they had to set it up such that Sayu leaves the house to
  confirm her suspicions and those suspicions can then be confirmed with her
  thinking that "going out with colleague" must be a female who likes him (or
  vice versa, unlikely but just putting this out) and she is totally right, just that,
  they had to catch them at the right place and right time. I must say though,
  that Mishima's courage is to be feared as to be praised, going full on
  throttle with Yoshida knowing full well someone is living on the same abode
  with him supposedly. Most women would already back off, but this girl. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  And Sayu is right: she is jealous. Surprisingly, unlike from the many
  cases of her surviving on this unknown land, she may have actually fell in
  love with the guy who technically saved her life...? Hmm, we don't know. But
  it didn't take long for them to figure this out. As Mishima ran away from
  Yoshida after that hug moment (man, is this a <em>real</em> romance Anime? lol), she
  encounters Sayu in the park probably because she also needs a place to cry haha,
  but not until she realizes the one she is consoling on to to make more decisive
  action on her situation is also the one staying with the guy she likes... It's
  getting a little confusing isn't it? I even have trouble writing that one
  sentence out lol. And lastly, because if you didn't notice <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> it's Episode
  3, so they dish out the "emotional moment of clarity" (I should refer that as
  this next time lol) and I don't mean Sayu almost naked in front of Yoshida
  because then they can't air this on national TV lmao, but you get the idea if
  you have watched it. Essentially it's assuring what Sayu-chan keeps thinking
  about her situation right now: Living with some dude who doesn't get anything
  out of it. Being genuinely nice, I must say. I would say it's really hard to
  be such a person, but now that I have actually known a couple of them in my
  own life, I must say those people are real good, and they help you no matter
  what happens. Yoshida... might be such a person, trust me. And that's why even
  after literally watching what looks like a build-up to a porn video scene lol
  ("And... CUT!! Good job everyone" haha), Yoshida does admit Sayu's appeal just
  like any other dude one the streets would because if you don't I'm pretty sure
  you're gay, but also, explains to her why he's being so nice, and what he gets
  out of it. And as we have seen so far, his life changed. His house got clean,
  he didn't have to worry about dinner, he shaved every day... so much has been
  done to improve his lifestyle and image, it's already worth more than one night's sleep with the girl. Okay, if you think otherwise, just like what I
  have said in the first episode, this show is not for you. You can leave now, you freak.
  *waves farewell* But if you did understand how lonely Yoshida is living the working life and living alone and could use some company instead of a good time lmao, then you
  will get whatever has been going on so far. Just, cut down on the rated content,
  yes? Sayu-chan is cute but I don't want to f**k her just like what Yoshida
  said. Doesn't mean I'm a nice guy but she is a spoilt brat so it's already all loose down there haha ok I'll stop</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "That night, was Sayu hoping that someone-" ...Would f**k her so she
  can stay a night?!! Haha NAILED IT and THANK GOODNESS this story isn't like
  that]</div><div>

  Wait, Sueharu was a child actor? Hey I'm kinda like him. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> It's called
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kurorekishi" target="_blank">kurorekishi</a>; We don't talk about those haha. In this new episode (#OsaMake02) where the
  opening theme slaps and hopefully the pace isn't as edgy as the first episode, but man, is this actual drama here?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just like last week, we have plenty
  of content to go through, so let's get to it! Firstly, about Sueharu's past.
  In a nutshell, and I will not repeat the story he said to Shirokusa later, Sueheru
  is a child actor thanks to his parents, and some drama got him famous. Sadly,
  he "quit" not because he wanted to unlike what Abe-senpai thinks about him,
  but in an industry secret he had to be left on hiatus after her mom who was
  co-starring with him in the drama itself, got into a freak accident during the
  <strike>shooting</strike> filming, and thus, was left alone to deal with... the fame? Yeah, sure. It's
  pretty sad to some extent so let's not dig too deep into it. What we can dig
  deep into though, is the revenge plan. Let's talk about that first, and then
  how it might be a trap, according to Kuroha. Firstly, the plan. Since Sueharu
  was once a famous actor, and Abe-senpai is well known in the industry until
  you call out Sueharu's name lol, he and the buddy Tetsuhiko thought the best
  way to get back at Abe-senpai is to do a play. Basically, drama against drama,
  I guess. But to get that to work, not like they have a script ready to do so,
  so they thought asking for the best author or writer in class would be a great
  idea... until you realize that she is technically on the opponent's side, this
  woman. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But she did not reject Sueharu's suggestion though, so they
  exchanged numbers to discuss this on business terms lol. Wait, Sueharu you
  don't have Shirokusa's <strike>LINE</strike> NINE? How far behind are you now,
  may I ask? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know Abe-senpai might be leading here but are you like,
  last place in a Mario Kart race? Haha I can't even. And yes, you didn't hear
  wrongly, Kuroha did suggest this as a trap, as a regular visit to each other's
  houses because they are neighbours, reveal that Shirokusa might not be that
  nice after all. Sorry, "Shiro". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We'll talk about that later, but
  suffice it to say it has been a while since he acted considering it might be
  many years of his name in hiding so he's basically a normal high schooler in a
  harem now haha what part of that is normal, but more importantly, is do we
  think Shirokusa is such a person? In a freak accident of Sueharu practising on
  stage in school and seeing him in the nurse's office and him telling about his
  past... likely not. For even if we think like Kuroha which is more on like
  "Sueharu is just her backup" kind of relationship, she still liked him from
  deep down, knowing him as a kid some time ago. Man, this story has much more
  depth talking about past than in the future lol. Because despite the obvious
  romance in front of him ie. childhood friend Kuroha and they are basically
  dating right now (lol those sad dudes in school who want to kill the harem
  king), Sueharu is also trying to... take revenge on the girl she likes because
  she's dating someone else also on revenge on the fact that he left her alone
  after they enjoyed each other's company as kids some time ago? Goddamn, this
  Anime is some levels of inception. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So who's the first love now? I
  don't even know lmao. But what I DO know is that this is making things a lot
  more spicier and more interesting that it should've been. I do have such child
  drama experience before working on stage not on TV before, but not about me,
  but I wouldn't know if this acting thing will get in the way for me for now.
  I'm not too sure. But just like Sueharu giving his acting another go while
  trying not to break up with <strike>Inorin</strike> Kuroha haha, I'm also
  trying to give this Anime because there's so much greatness going on with this
  series, I can even forgive the adaptation of the original story thus far. Then
  again, I don't read original work so I shall continue not to do so so I can
  enjoy this as much as I can. And if the Confession Festival is next episode,
  I wonder who will really win out of all this. I know who the losers are
  though, if you want me to bet on it right now. There's either going to be a
  lot of crying next week or... well anyways I'll get my fill haha remember they
  are voiced by actors too hehe cya guys next week
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; We see which is faster: Me getting over the tensions of this series or
  me dying over Inorin overdose haha I think the latter]</div>

  P.P.S. "You don't know? It's all your fault" Find me a harem Anime series

  [And that ending theme song title is "Strategies Unpredictable Type of
  Romantic Comedy Ending Song" lol I mean what (The song is actually not bad
  though I'll see how when it releases NEXT WEEK?? lol) (Definitely not
  tearjerker material though so I guess that will be done using insert
  songs...?)]

      <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote><div>Well, it's a week of Anime related songs releasing this week because this is how you all know to listen to them because that's how you think they are good lol, so let's talk about it. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/easy-love-ep/1558995369?l=en" target="_blank">Uesaka Sumire's new single</a></b> is not her worst, but then again I have only given one single a Klassic Note Review so don't expect too much from het songs in general. But you know, if you liked the Anime it's in I'm sure you'll tell me to watch a show I just rejected last week lol. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/plastic-smile-ep/1562664393?l=en" target="_blank">Ishihara Kaori's new single</a></b> probably took the spotlight this week and probably will be the winner for the theme songs for Anime this season (Maybe winning KoiKimo? I don't know) because man if that song didn't hit you when you watch the Anime you may want to watch the one this week to feel that. I also took some time to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/answers-ep/1545321704?l=en" target="_blank">mol-74's new EP</a></b> which is a new release in quite a while since the disaster known as 2020 (lol), and man did I miss listening to them. Hopefully them singing for Anime will get them the recognition they need: They sound like SHE'S but the latter is more popular than them but mol-74 can do emotional songs like none other, really worth a listen if you do not know of them.</div>
  <br />On news regarding music and is on Twitter and I did not forget filling this part up lol, not that you need to be in her fanclub or in her fanclub event to know of this but <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1385850999756124160?s=20" target="_blank">Kitou Akari is releasing a mini-album</a></b> coming August lol that's quite far but it looks like she revealed one song in the event so yeah go sign up and buy tickets to it next time haha (Hey I'm halfway there already I got the membership), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/VictorMusic/status/1385518810359209986?s=20" target="_blank">Teshima Aoi is releasing a best album</a></b> in June for her 15th anniversary (yes she is quite a veteran but if you have heard of her you know she's good), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/a_toyosaki_yoda/status/1385065829352427524?s=20" target="_blank">yay sphere for 12 years</a></b> of... memories because it's not all songs there was a hiatus of a year too haha, and FINALLY <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1383746173958180873?s=20" target="_blank">cinema staff is releasing an EP</a></b>... soon because they didn't put in a date wtf seriously? Oh well, might as well wait longer.<br />
  <br />
  So next week if I didn't remember wrongly it'll be Anime "OsaMake" theme song singles on release, which will be <b>Azuna Riko's new single</b> which man is the topic song quite impressive so we shall see if I can get into her songs, and whatever <b>Minase Inori and Sakura Ayane Anime single</b>. You think it will sell? Oh yeah I bet it will lol over the opening. As mentioned in the episode review, it's not emotional, and I suppose this romance comedy will still have that despite the jokes, so we might see insert songs incoming. Or that the B-side is just that. We shall see.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />I did watch earlier <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuLiNFW3v-U" target="_blank">Kotobuki Minako's livestream on YouTube</a> and it's no major announcement it's just an anniversary on her YouTube channel and her in England for studies if you forgot about that and like me you didn't watch every single video of hers... she showed off a lot of photos taken on the streets of London. Wink wink for photobook, Mina-chan? If so I'll make sure to buy it hehe it's never too late, I say. Also, she was eating some cup noodle, excuse me, "pot noodle" and like some idiot because I'm not British I saw it sell locally probably imported, so I guess I might try it out myself lol "beef and tomato" without the beef taste is going to be WILD lmao. And as I sat down playing simulation games with my music library in the background and ClariS appearing, it really makes me miss the original duo a lot haha hey at least we got Clara-san and looking at her I would TOTALLY date her despite her... daunting height? I mean, who cares? I like Aki-chan too you gonna say the same thing? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Oh, age difference, got it) Cya guys next time then, and until then... well hooray for 4-day work week that my superior is going to carry me for on Monday so that's going to be fun haha I feel bad now but I gotta spend that whatever tourism promotion voucher or else our local economy here will collapse lol bye</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Not going to dump this on next week's post, and technically it is this week but it wasn't on Twitter until I saw my custom RSS feed (lol people still use those?), <b>Toyosaki Aki is releasing a new album</b> coming end of June. Not surprising considering she revealed new songs on her first ever streaming live, but yeah, she's back, and hopefully this will be an album to put on my shelf. We shall see, Aki-chan, we shall see.</div>
