How's yours? I'm just glad it's over to be honest haha<div><br /></div><div>Problem is man, I really should stop writing this intro on Sunday nights when the week is ending lmao it's so hard to think of something good to write. I did spend a lot of time doing up my side stuff though so that's good I should find more live videos to listen while doing these. And hey, I did spend a lot of money on one of the weekdays though, forgot which day lol. So yeah, even though we might not have a Suruga-ya run (I swear we will because I just bought another photo album haha) we do have things lined up for the next couple of months, so that'll be exciting- Excuse me, that'll be motivation to work for now lol</div><div><br /></div><div>We still got new Anime to watch, so let's get to it! Hey, when you watch on Saturday it's just different haha HYPE lol also F**K YOU NAGATORO-SAN which airs on Saturdays so I can actually watch all my shows for the week a day early hehe you're welcome, me<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KoiKimo03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I'm more concerned about you calling me at this time every night" Man, they     are already this close? Ichika-chan man... <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>   </div></blockquote>I think after watching this already, we know the pace of this series is going to be funny as it's lovely, so yeah, I'm already into this, haven't you? In this new episode (#KoiKimo03) where I recall that getting hit by volleyball tumblr page I saw years ago lol, Ryou's sister see the new couple in worry because man, the brother may have some competition. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> (Yes, didn't realize them subs be stylizing the names again, so from here on "Ryou") (The sister's name won't change though, as much as I won't be using it just because) Well not really, but it is about time we doubted on this womanizer's... love for Ichika, I guess. So, story. In a strange line of coincidences, we are introduced with new character and classmate to Ichika called Tamaru, and yes, he is male, he looks kinda handsome, and... he got hit by a volleyball lol. Well, it's Ichika's fault, she be nice like she always does and ask if he's fine... and somewhere along the road in return, Tamaru did pique her interest in stuff she can talk about but not with Ryou because he don't <a href="https://jisho.org/search/otaku" target="_blank">otaku</a>&nbsp;on this for shit: <a href="https://jisho.org/search/manga" target="_blank">manga</a>. So yeah, it's your "nice classmates borrows you his own collection" type of situation and trust me I have done that before and that's how you get popular in class lmao (we even got to read it in class which I don't think Japan would even allow them to be seen in school premises but you get the idea), but suffice it to say, you know, they are just a bunch of good classmates. Who cares about Rio, amirite?? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But yes, cue Ryou into the situation where the three met coincidentally (well for Ryou not really but) (haha) outside of a convenience store, and yeah Ryou decided to drop a hint to Ichika's newly made classmate friend to, you know, not get in the way of the couple(?) lol. I think Tamaru did take the hint, but again, just like any other dude, unless you be going for sadist Ichika haha, no one is fighting with you Ryou just chill bro. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey, maybe it's those "don't take my prey" predator calls which I have never learnt from womanizing... women lol, but Ryou did make his point. Which interestingly, led Tamaru to think that this is no good dude, as he drops a casual warning to Ichika thinking that he might be up to no good. But seriously, how bad can things get? They are like, a decade apart in age what can even happen- Man, Tamaru-kun, Ryou's coming after your butt now haha my condolences to you at such a young age tbh. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/press-f-to-pay-respects" target="_blank">Fs</a> for Tamaru-kun, everyone. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Moving on, and yes, so in case you didn't take the hint after the end of last week's episode, the one by the stairs seeing <strike>those two hug each other</strike> Ryou hugging Ichika aggressively (I'm calling the cops lmao) was, in fact, Tamaru-kun here. Not that it matters because he knows if he told it to not Ichika he's gonna die soon lol, but yeah, maybe that's what add up to the distrust of Ichika towards Ryou at some point. The confrontation happens at the study session with the sister, Ryou is kind of shocked and is taken aback to be honest, Tamaru might already be dead at this point lol, but somehow things haven't changed between them. It's like a lover's tiff, just that they aren't exactly lovers and they didn't quarrel directly with each other since Ryou probably already forgiven her. (I like how they still like, talk on the phone even though it's like awkward now. Yeah, looks like Ryou is a womanizer after all lmao) But more importantly then, is if you didn't notice Ichika coughing, she is slowly turning unwell. Maybe after all the worry accumulated from having to deal with this dude every night (not the nightly calls, please) but yeah, you see Ryou? You gotta give your girl a break. She's no adult woman who can take everything you throw at her. Well, not yet. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay, moving on, but yeah, Ryou seemingly forgot about his work and rushed to Ichika's place knowing that from his sister that she is unwell to go to their outing in the morning. And I swear the mom is giving a warning to the daughter because Ichika was right about her knowing the friend, but otherwise, she accidentally let in the beast, I guess. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Well, not like she's in a condition to bicker with him anyways lol. So yeah. Also, because Ryou was watching her preparing for the test last time and now is down with cough or something? Yeah, he kindly wrote her a study guide. Really, someone who would do that much is NEVER going to take advantage of you. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Right? <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Anyways (haha), Ichika aced the test despite missing days at school, so she gotta thank Masuda for drawing that awesome cover for her study guide. Hey, we know who's getting the full credit here, Ryou. Haha man I wish I had a 16-year-old to brighten up my work life lol competition eliminated it's exclusive Ichika love from here on now haha lol cya guys next week for more of these shenanigans <div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-145bIIRVwFI/YHrlSXaAnqI/AAAAAAABDs8/EoO2-pDlYjkJm_wNeRVwyiJJaC0Kw0yXACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo03_camera1.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Because clearly someone forgot to remove the annotations on their               animation drafts lol<br />(Yes, my new thumbnail can do more than two images now)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xWIeIRs5LYY/YHrlTItAr6I/AAAAAAABDtA/G5d305XPAaIgTpSl7BArXjRacZH5WKC-wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo03_camera2.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Because clearly someone forgot to remove the annotations on their               animation drafts lol<br />(Yes, my new thumbnail can do more than two images now)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YAecHMy41is/YHrlUPP6MaI/AAAAAAABDtE/a5SYbrWa5Js71P6SnDLMcHl53fWqzj9RQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo03_camera3.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Because clearly someone forgot to remove the annotations on their               animation drafts lol<br />(Yes, my new thumbnail can do more than two images now)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Probably not,       Yoshida, but I think you can make it better. Not through sex though, please.       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>     </div>  </blockquote>  Okay so where's the part where Yoshida has to buy brassiere for Sayu-chan?   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode (#HigeHiro02) where we can don't buy this much for   this girl to be honest (well I guess it's reward for doing all the housework),   it's even harder to see through the real her. If it's me I'm going to be like   "be honest here or get out" lol haha I know right?? (Wait, she's already gone? Why) Ignoring that opening   theme sequence and I don't even know how I have to give another idol group a song   because of Anime lol, we talk about the great advances we have on Yoshida's   life this week. Well, I mean, not like everyone knows he's letting a JK live   at his abode, but suffice it to say many at work have noticed his change. As   with the first episode, including his buddy at work many have realized his   improvement in image because he shaved his stubble often now (title drop), and is even at this point, unknown to his colleagues, going shopping with Sayu to get   like, daily necessities like moisturisers or else how you gonna massage those   boobs- Still, something doesn't feel right, as we have mentioned before and   Yoshida has too, it's that she's still in acting mode. Which is why Yoshida   has to remind her to not put up a fake image anymore, because that is   precisely the reason why he saw through her and... effectively adopted her in   the first place haha you think the parents will find out if we put his name as   guardian? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, so yeah, Sayu, if those smiles were fake, get   rid of them, like how you told Yoshida to get rid of his horrible stubble.   (title drop) (haha) Next up, we have new characters to introduce. She is   Mishima, Yoshida's <u>female</u> colleague by the way (man where are those IT   company with all the female programmers SIGN ME UP haha my company doesn't   have SHIT lol), likely below him since he's the one who noticed she screwed up   code for a project to be submitted the next day (Hey, ask about how relevant   is this to MY work right now haha), so just like a nice boss, he cleans up her   mess. Though, after hearing that he might be screwed by management for this   level of work quality, Mishima pulls herself together to clean up code (literally)   before it's too late, well, also into the night. Nice guy Yoshida gets her   dinner, and all is well. Hey, just another day's work just that my boss is so   hardworking and nice he doesn't let me carry the can all the time. I know, I   feel bad already. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Anyways, besides literally getting ruined by the   colleague here about him with Gotou ("don't mind desu" lmao it's also very Ishihara Kaori too if you know of the voice behind in person), Mishima is also the first to talk   about Yoshida's change in image, and she did ask about why he is so nice   despite being dumped by that Gotou-san just in the first episode alone. I get   it bro, he's just open about it and don't cry in the room jerking off like   some idiot (<span title="*wink*">üòâ</span> KanoKari <span title="*wink*">üòâ</span>) but then again, since Mishima doesn't know   for now, it's because of another woman. Another younger woman. WAY younger woman.   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But as we know, Mishima seems to be happy that besides finding   another buddy to go out for drinks, she also noticed it's her time to shine   to, you know, be more involved in this nice guy's life. Yep, feels like a   harem already MOVING ON!!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And of course, he went home to only   remember Sayu is alone at home waiting for him with dinner and, uh, yeah,   which justifies Yoshida's plan in getting a phone at this day and age where&nbsp;this   girl who should possessed one just threw hers into the sea in Hokkaido lol. I'm sure Sayu-chan will   feel bad about this gift but to be honest I'll count that and any expensive stuff I   have to buy for her to survive now, as debt she has to pay back. At least it   won't let her feel that bad, if she does anyways. (Or we bring the budget down? How about a   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/pager" target="_blank">pager</a>? Oh they   don't have those? WHAT YEAR IS THIS lmao) (Young kids out there, may I quickly   explain what a marvel that device is to be able to ONLY receive messages from   any phone that sends out messages lol ok me) (Oh yeah you can send from a fax machine too!!- Ah) So that's that, and yeah, Yoshida   may have taken <i>too</i> long to decide for the girl, seeing   that she will keep rejecting (oof) him for it just because. You know, even got   the buddy worried about him being <i>too</i> nice to the girl, considering she   is a spoilt brat herself. So far, I don't think so, but what do we know she   sleeps with men on a daily basis before they met. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, Gotou-san   then asks Yoshida out. Well, not the "I regret rejecting you and let's date"   kind of out, but more like, for work purposes I guess, as an excuse to, you   know, ask him about stuff. Hey, she's right; It IS important to her, whatever   he has done to his suit and stubble. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Because really, I like how   Gotou-san here is so observant in thinking that Yoshida who got rejected by   her immediately found solace in another woman Mishima and it feels like it's   for revenging against her rejection (we'll talk about "OsaMake" later but   still) (haha damn) but deep inside, we know he is effectively holding captive,   a high school girl from Hokkaido. (I'm calling the cops lmao) Well, he did ask   some questions that were important to us at least and of course him, including   the purpose of this "meeting" and what cup size Gotou was so go watch to find   out haha that is A, B, C, D, E... <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> He then returns home to notice that   weird phenomenon of not being able to contact Sayu-chan again so he's probably   eating dinner again for breakfast too lol, but yeah, he gave her the phone he got for   her, after an afternoon's excitement and maybe slightly forgotten because of   Gotou-san lmao. Hey, I get it bro, you into MILF, right? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So yeah,   looks like this series will be a lot of this, and would Yoshida's buddy be   nailing it as if the author's in the story himself? The resurgence of affection after rejection? We don't know. But what we   do know looking at next week's thumbnail is... wow they got to Episode 12 real   quick lmao haha I doubt so but we shall see</div><div>  [TL:DR; That's it! That's the drop!! Thanks Anime for making me realize that   when I shave every day for work means I'll be dating someone at some point.   Yeah, just, for now it's still every week so] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-76Q9wtcyTiE/YHrmc1b1vyI/AAAAAAABDtc/RBqJPXpFLSExfz3r9bct8IHKkbmGjJ4IwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro02_yoshida1.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              What I expected<br />(Nice guy Yoshida FTW)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3ClvR_0a4uc/YHrmem0bNzI/AAAAAAABDtg/cpTQdGc1AIQ5PDt-7Iw8sBdGbTjYw2kegCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro02_yoshida3.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              What I got<br />(Female audiences be like so high right now lol)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Man with all these burns just this one episode I think I'm going to need to go   to hospital for third-degree burns. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this first episode (#OsaMake01)   of a series I have decided to watch since last year... there is actually some   lore here?? Haha I think this may need some introduction before we continue.   Before watching this episode,&nbsp; I legit thought this was just a simple   story about a guy who got rejected by another girl and then this <a href="https://jisho.org/search/osananajimi" target="_blank">childhood friend</a> will take revenge for him by sacrificing her dear self to go out with   the dude. Well, all is still kind of accurate though, but now that I have seen   this first episode for myself, I have my own doubts about what this might turn   into, to be honest. So, let's talk about story and how this revenge story came   about. They got through it real fast though; I was expecting the revenge drop   to be at the end. So, Sueharu is our main guy in a harem well not yet but we   will get to that eventually, and as the intro has shown, she has built up   quite a relationship with <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hatsukoi" target="_blank">first love</a> and literal teen genius Kachi Shirokusa (Shirokusa   sounds like me making those   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kusa" target="_blank">kusa</a> jokes and   she's serious type so <strike>Kachi-san</strike>&nbsp;Shirokusa kusa) (lol) after complimenting on her prowess of dealing   out award-winning novels, Sueharu has somehow slipped into her life, which is   a good start, to be honest. And also having a crush since then. Sadly, in that   one classroom where all the drama is happening lol, we then found out (as a   class) (lol) that she is taken, by Abe-senpai of the same school. You know,   fitting status of a pair one would envy until they choke themselves to death   for. Yes, we call them "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">normies</a>". F**king normies... ANYWAYS!! (Haha) And unlike Sueharu's harem friend who   is patting pussies (cats, please) day and night thinking of which to accept   this upcoming summer lmao, this dude still hasn't gotten laid even though we   are already HALFWAY THROUGH high school lol hey bro what about me. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So   yeah, this is not technically a rejection, but yeah, why bother confess is   more likely Sueharu's conclusion. He goes to cry in the nearby river like any   other dude who got rejected (well he's not old enough to drink the pain away   *looks at HigeHiro*) and   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">onee-san</a>&nbsp;childhood friend Kuroha is there for him so yeah, it feels rather sad   already tbh. But yeah, just not cut deep enough. Because considering we're talking   about Kuroha here who has confessed to nice guy Sueharu before and got   rejected (Fs for Kuroha) she is still willing to go through Hell with her   opposite gender buddy after all these years. I don't know if the love or   childhood friend status makes her so nice to this guy but hey, you figure it   out yourself. Anyways, she suggested the idea of revenge on the other couple   we all hate now (lol) (yes for reference that is Abe-senpai and Kachi-san),   and man did this get on fire. Because now that you know all the context, it'll   be easier to explain how despite Sueharu not finding out any weakness of his   love rival and THEN having to come up with ridiculous plans with Kuroha to   take revenge against Kachi knowing that she might actually come back to get   him if anything happens (safety net?), so interestingly, Kuroha does the nice   girl sacrifice here to - quote me here - go out with him to make   Kachi-san jealous. Normally I would only see this in titular or even shitty   drama plots, but hey, they exist in Anime too apparently lol. (We still   putting this in the "romance" genre or what) (oh yeah, "the <u>romantic comedy</u>") And ALSO because Kuroha wants her   childhood friend SO BAD, it's not hard to state such a "sacrifice" in a room with   them alone together you just go in for the kiss to seal the deal. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> I   don't want to explain how ridiculous this might've gotten into and Sueharu did   run away from it but man, if you close your eyes (and even if you cannot understand without subs lol) it really sounded like a porno. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Oh, so   this is what romance is about? Sueharu you lucky piece of sh*t. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Well,   in an Anime of everyone being in harems I wouldn't be too surprised lol what.   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, despite this being too good to be true even if it's a   plot in an Anime world lmao, must I even repeat myself how forced the author   sort of have to make this plausible such that such a plot would happen and how   he/she can justify the title of this series? (FYI it's "the romance comedy   where the childhood friend never loses") Hmm... yeah I won't be rejecting this   series just like how all the rejection is happening of all the Anime I intend   to watch this season, but yeah, far-fetched maybe an underestimation to what   we might get in the future. And we are starting out strong too: Next episode   is probably figuring out why Abe-senpai might know this loser of a dude lol   I'm just here for   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase" target="_blank">the</a>  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11622/Ayane_Sakura" target="_blank">female</a>  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/19884/Saori_Oonishi" target="_blank">cast</a>  don't mind me HAHAHAHAHAHAHA okay we good </div><div>  [Okay no wonder this episode is awkward it's very different from the original   work in terms of presentation much context is left behind until it's required   and it's way more palatable than this animation haha I am getting worried   about this adaptation] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NkRnpJaD2vc/YHroCQfWakI/AAAAAAABDt4/MONgGgEM0J0VdbhBFSulXg6YtxIHspaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake01_bully.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              They be so into each other already I wish they were together-               Ah.<br />(Haha)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y8pmCDd0FkA/YHroC0yMTKI/AAAAAAABDt8/kjku87Atr_kTVCbhOoNTDgHBvMIPjDW0QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake01_shirokusa3.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Man, 17-year-olds in gravure now?

Seriously   though OsaMake how did you go right to the bottom- And how is ACE COLLECTION (KoiKimo) winning this   season's best opening animation!??

I think I only actually got into it during the weekend, that album. On the other hand, VTuber <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ghost-single/1562662494?l=en" target="_blank">Hoshimiachi Suisei's new song</a></b> is actually good so I might as well give it and where's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cqV5BKJHyk" target="_blank">her debut song</a> in any digital release seriously, and <b>Aimer's new album</b> is our highlight for the week. (Not going to link you can't listen to all of it on Apple Music anyways) (Even <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3iFkNa8SRNFHD7La40UqUz" target="_blank">Spotify</a> a freemium service has more songs available than my yearly paid subscription you sonofa-) So, the album is quite a journey back when I was giving her songs for about 2 years, and hmm... I ended up giving like, all the single songs along the way instead of the newer songs, even not for the album topic songs. Okay, just the one. But yeah, goes to show some songs do age well. Or if I give a damn and they will leave a better impression lol. So yeah, wrapping that up as soon as possible because not like I can hear it on the go <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> Oh, I also listened to <b>GLIM SPANKY's recent live</b> too, and all the songs I gave in the album from last year (all 3 of them) were in there. I'm happy haha<br />  <br />  On news concerning music that is on Twitter mostly from the people I follow lol I should follow artists I have some interest of to be honest, yay yay <a href="https://twitter.com/azumi_waki/status/1383439684546662400?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Waki Azumi's new music video</b></a> will make you regret buying her photobook two months ago lol <span title="*sob*">üò¢</span>, <a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1383223937392250890?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Sangatsu no Phantasia got another credit in drama</b></a> which is quite an achievement considering they were effectively doujin artists couple of years ago, in a weird streak of events <a href="https://twitter.com/kusoiinkai/status/1382680172151730184?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Kuso Iinkai introduced their return</b></a> in a video and their vocalist <a href="https://twitter.com/skream_japan/status/1383000996700372996?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Miura Ryuuichi released a solo album</b></a> which is already out now as we speak, if you need subpar<a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1382887552307236866?s=20" target="_blank"> <b>Kitou Akari live with 360-degree audio</b></a> videos from YouTube you're welcome it's official sources btw so obviously sponsored, not too surprising but <a href="https://twitter.com/aoni_official/status/1383012391600857089?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Kouno Marika's 2nd single is announced</b></a> for July for Anime this time around so let's see if it can reach my shelf again (Spoiler: It probably won't), my life sucks so I missed half of it but I did catch up on <a href="https://twitter.com/shionnu10/status/1382697026752811016?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Tsuji Shion's performance livestream on YouTube</b></a> in a while which now also accepts donations so <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1382659752744787972?s=20" target="_blank">I did my own part</a> to support her after Scenarioart and UNLIMITS once again ("Three tickets worth will get me a signed bromide??

Huh. Wait, let me check another website haha *checks Skream* Okay there are a shit ton of digital singles though so I may just drop in for some <b>Cider Girl and Yourness digital singles</b> if you even remember them from last year lol the latter was in Top 20 mind you. Oh yeah, and maybe that <b>Miura Ryuuichi album</b> if I feel like it lol I know it's effectively Kuso Iinkai but the latter is cooler lmao it's the same thing<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />Argh dammit stop <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1383685350464180225?s=20" target="_blank">displaying those TrySail collaboration shoes</a> please I DON'T HAVE MONEY TO BUY THEM haha but seriously though I could change my shoes for work lol maybe not pink though. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Also, new shoes in this rainy season might not be great haha. Cya guys next time then, and until next time... I was told to wear a little more formal than what I usually wear (polo tee, jeans) to work, so... being the idiot I am I'll probably appear in office tomorrow with a blouse and suit pants lmao. No really, I have no idea what is in between in fashion, no joke. I just overdress so I don't have to worry about underdressing anyways. But that's also the problem, you know, overdressing compared to your colleagues. Must be easy being good at doing this lol maybe I need a fashion consultant haha bye</div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
