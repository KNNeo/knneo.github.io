Yes, this may be Joke Day, but my dreams are already playing with me so much I might as well be the straight guy here and retort them all.<div><br /></div><div>It was originally in two parts because mainly I have sleeping problems lol, but suffice it to say the first half is literal porno (ie. Pissing? And that other word that rhymes with "flirting" which I can't say here) featuring AV actress Azusa Hikari... SO! We will talk about the other half. It's also not that great it's LITERALLY my trip to the toilet haha no really</div><div><br /></div><div>[SCAT WARNING INCOMING!! And I will <i>try</i> not to describe to that extent]</div><div><br /></div><div>(This is already burning all my game time in the morning on my commute to work remember tomorrow then is the public holiday)</div><div><br /></div><div></div><blockquote><div>"I was in a regular trip to the toilet, and went into a cubicle facing out to the streets. As it was probably the last cubicle left and I might be in a hurry, I used the squat toilet with reluctance.</div><div><br /></div><div>As I have digestive issues, I know to calm down and stay on the bowl for longer just because. And just when one was about to come out - and it did by the time it happened - Kito Akari managed to peek over the cubicle door and stare into the stall!!</div><div><br /></div><div>"This must have been a common toilet, it seems" I told to myself. And as I continue to do my business, I can't help but think of her, and somehow, things went more smoothly within those fake walls. And then! The door flung open likely due to the strong wind within the toilet, and I rushed to try to stand up to close it, but I guess the wind assisted in covering my shame as I lock it up again.</div><div><br /></div><div>After my long run in the open air toilet, I left and joined back which I believe is a group of people, standing by the streets around where the toilets were. And as I continued to stand and wait, I felt one incoming and, literally, pooped on the spot. I can even feel the one solid turd up the back of my jeans!!"</div></blockquote><div></div><div><br /></div><div>And I woke up to confirm if that is happening in real life... And it isn't. Again, I said I have digestion problems, so a solid turd out by itself would be a miracle lmao. This is already a joke to me, isn't it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span></div><div><br /></div><div>For references, ironically it is describing my trip to the toilet at work when I have to go but not really, and might as well go camp there a bit just because since I can't push out my bowels for sh*t, but Akarin, I can't believe you appeared in my dreams at THE WORST TIME POSSIBLE lol well that was before anything was in the bowl so at least it didn't smell weird...? And waiting in a group likely resembles me waiting for my colleagues to gather to go out for lunch haha</div><div><br /></div><div>Thank goodness dreams are a literal joke to real life.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Happy Joke Day everyone haha</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. And if you really want to know about the first half it's similar to those videos where they let them not go to pee for like, hours because they gave them drinks which makes them leak so they can do it manually- Okay okay stop stop stop stop (Haha)</div><hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Dreams</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
