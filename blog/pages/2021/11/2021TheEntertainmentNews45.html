You bet I did! Do I want more of these? You bet! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We're not getting any more of these, huh. Well, not until I pass my job scope on to someone else so I can actually enjoy my year end holiday this year. We shall see, we shall see...<div><br></div><div>Anyways, back to more Anime, and if you missed on what kickstarted this long weekend be sure to look at the latest package opening, because hey, sometimes you either count correctly or you just plan for the use of a spare voucher they giving out on the previous package. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, don't say I planned it, spending money is still burning a hole in my pocket especially those Kana-chan bromides lol why are they random again...</div><div><br></div><div>So, Anime time! Also music of course, and I think this week was a little lacklustre, but you know, I get tired real easily so remind me to take a nap later today haha I'll finish doing up this post first I guess I really need to make this thumbnail thing a little easier to make on my side haha yes I had to change the code a lot to make them look this cool hehe maybe it's just me who thinks it's cool lol let's talk about drama I guess<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KomiSan05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Komi-san wa, Komyushou Desu.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"These people (with social awkwardness) are just bad with communicating with people..." I mean, she doesn't have to. *sees students cheering* See? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><span style=text-align:left> </span></div></blockquote>Sometimes we just wonder how Tadano-kun can read Komi-san's mind so well... spoiler alert he's the author in disguise lol but also man, isn't it the best if you're the only guy who can read a girl's mind? Think about it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, in this new episode (#KomiSan05) we got so much to talk about man, so let's get into it! Firstly, we do another showdown with that sore loser who can't afford to win anything. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, it's Makeru-chan again and I think we'll be doing this as often as she can, this time around it's fitness check, and as expected Komi-san doesn't even have to try and she still wins by a large margin (okay in Makeru's defence there was one where it was close) but yeah, maybe all that effort doesn't pay off after all, huh. I'll date someone like this, I can be the loser without even trying haha then she'll think I'm being complacent? Haha, what a life that will be. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I'm sorry, Komi-san, we shouldn't be talking about losers. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, we go to Komi-san's place. I mean, we have seen her room before, but Najimi wants to try <strike>his</strike> <strike>her</strike> their luck out (lol) by requesting to go to her place, of course, with Tadano if possible. Tadano did read her mind in thinking how much psychological conflict Komi can have within herself, but hey, the joys of having friends over always wins over everything else even your secret porn stash haha (which is also why I'll never invite anyone to my place now haha ah), and so we went. The mom who thinks she's Horie Yui lol (JOKES!! Haha yes we made this joke before two months ago) gladly welcomes them into the abode, and she can talk lol oh good the mom can talk. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Again, it's just the daughter so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, thanks for the mom breaking the ice, Najimi does the honourable thing by leaving the two alone... and nothing happened. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, what did you expect. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Najimi did dig out a lot of things from Komi-san though, including her communication skill books lol and her photo album which showcased her in her younger days... mostly in silence lol the photos won't mind, but yeah, if you have any criticisms please refer to my friend Yamai-san she will make sure you disappear from this universe. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then, we go eat ramen. This might be worse than when <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/140810/Chika_Fujiwara target=_blank>some bimbo</a> went to eat ramen and showing how one should eat a bowl of noodles, but suffice it to say Tadano and Najimi got a lot of pressure to do this whole stunt right, considering Agari-chan is the <em>expert</em> at this and Komi-san just went with the flow in silence which is most of what this is about so yeah, she wins. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And who says one can't enjoy life without talking to others. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, let's talk about the new girl. Introducing, ladies and gentlemen, the <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/168491/Minami_Yamamoto target=_blank>Yamamoto</a> (from Anime "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/38619/Joshikousei_no_Mudazukai target=_blank>JoshiMuda</a>") of the Komi-san series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (I'm so sorry for this joke this is the only reference I can come up with) Okay, just this one has all the special effects built in so not like that girl who just <em>thinks</em> she's cool. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, they be all stuck at elementary school so I'm not going to comment much but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, new girl with personality tries to make friends with Komi-san like everyone else she's also weird and really did not catch a hint until Tadano kind of explains to her because... surprise surprise, he's one of them too lol welcome to the shadow realm Komi-san lmao, and if you need explanations because you didn't watch enough Anime, this is the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/chuunibyou target=_blank>chuunibyou</a> character which basically means you watched too much action Anime or played too much RPG. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ironically, Tadano also had that life in middle school too until some girl rejected him for his (not) stupendous behaviour haha, and thank goodness for that or else Komi-san would never open up to that idiot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And thank goodness Komi-san was smart enough to pair up in gym class with... who's the girl's name again? *look at website* <a href=https://jisho.org/search/nakanaka target=_blank>Nakanaka</a>-san? Okay. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Oh come on how come you can't chuunibyou a name out of this? lol) I mean, if you're Komi-san the best chances are to pair with someone in class you don't know of so you can easily hit that 100-friend goal haha ah hey, so you know, we just had to get over the awkwardness of this girl thinking that she's in another world haha thanks <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/152862/Omoharu_Nakanaka target=_blank>RumiRumi</a> it was a joy to hear you being smug. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (If you need more and wonder why I can imagine her in the recording studio doing this voiceover, she did this too for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVnYR2kqiiY&amp;t=196s" target=_blank>Anime "Munou no Nana" special</a> on YouTube) And the ending is the best part of the episode, you're welcome. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Thanks to "burglar N" lol if that's not obvious enough thanks <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/152632/Najimi_Osana target=_blank>childhood friend</a>, Tadano had to share an umbrella on the way home with Komi-san. Yep, someone draw that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/aiaigasa target=_blank>aiaigasa</a> on the chalkboard please, we just got a freshly bonded couple. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, as I said the last part is the best lmao, everything else is just flair we know we're here for the romance between the main two hehe, and Tadano you're right just be normal. All the abnormal miracles will come right your way. So where is mine then hehe cya guys around for more f**ked up characters who wants to be friends with Komi-san haha</div><div>[TL:DR; I legit thought when the teacher in gym class said "let's do volleyball" that Nakanaka-san will get beat into a pulp with the ball serves after pairing up with Komi-san for stretches lol guess we won't get to see that part lmao]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglOElPnyviX0LDBQ2ztTLO6AREOTjQ6TdHhizA27jwD7_z73lCReZogROErlZvQg5I29y69LRymmN9DYT8ZJMpspeMxLOkngoDFzlOJcIoCEvQspynIqPiZospK-RD4VG3KhQU1hKt0b7pWNvynqA2eLrj4oLqDHW0iPf58UJ5ECpi9Q/s320/komisan05_nakanaka4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I kind of get this reference but this is getting WAY TOO FAR for this one Anime lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4dMg8fdVyN9cfIndfcuNiUWUe43tfghnd8mcxb-GVZRJ9KDo2nuDFevgtsS9l3HyZj51AabXSKH7TTOKetYecYoGRGzj5M0xXEateS2mb5sszcEv5cBqD2YHNLqxjXSz0u46jMlSYjb-3QoGWlJhnahyphenhyphenBkfdyZhiBSDYQtZqH2BjZkA/s320/komisan05_tsukkomi.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW people don't get my jokes haha <br>(Or the author when) (lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjiKYirKbDztGxWK5wrMRVM5_5ZKyg-jg5GYdBRbJHUHpKsrGgoXAOcl3S6kh5-uyc-aRXXq-24gjx4kgKBl5zUsHCxWJARk0L1PkTyDboYQWQA-WjHEcGi1tTBKEqgKYy7e9nODz2YQalEH0Shp9Yda-bOW1bYMjTb6_QkMuiVMzCwqA/s320/komisan05_shining.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Literally me thinking of going out with someone I like lol<br>(Ah, that time is over though...)</table></div></div>P.S.

In this new episode (#TaishouOtome05) before we talk about the new girl, let's talk about Tamako-san. In the previous episode she talked about being a doctor, and after talking (through mail, I would think) to her uncle who runs a clinic, looks like she might have a future at this after all. Probably anxiety to make such a decision because if you think the pride of Shima family will be used in of all things, care and benevolence, think again haha, but suffice it to say after seeing Yuzuki in pain and unable to help her besides seeking professional help, she felt that she could do something to... maybe help maintain some family reputation at the same time, I would hope. She is going to be so screwed for the first couple of years though, but we shall see. Besides wishing her all the best though, Tamahiko did give her a pat on the head... when she's asleep(?) to give some encouragement as <em>the</em> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/oniichan target=_blank>onii-chan</a> (because the other brothers don't matter BOOM GOT'EM haha) and I bet the next time we see her achievements the brother wouldn't even mind to pat her again. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, so cringe I love it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, Yuzuki's usual trip to the market in the village. I mean, people gossiping about her is the norm, but Tamahiko decided to do the manly thing once in a while and go grocery shopping with her and offering to hold her basket (I mean, did you even see what she carried the last time she did this? Your back would break bro haha), but most importantly, and yes you book weebs you can come out now lol, he's here to buy new books. Or well, his only salvation after his parents dumped him (well), but yeah, this is probably called "having your cake and eating it" in sadness, I guess. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Maybe we shouldn't dig too much into this depression but what's NOT depressing is the birthday celebration! Yeah, you think Tamahiko remembered his birthday? His sister did, and so does Yuzuki though so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Gotta say though, best birthday I've seen yet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, include myself in this too, please. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Audience: What about the photobooks you reviewed this year?) (Ah) It was a lovely dinner, Yuzuki got the hug she so wished for or probably didn't considering we are dealing with an emo freak so she can take this as bonus pay haha, and Tamahiko probably got his very first present in his life: a bookmark. But yeah if you think the cat in his room isn't the culprit or something bad happening you got another thing coming. Then again, what can be worse than your dad abandoning you so introducing (lol) the girl down the village who had her eyes on Tamahiko here, and I wasn't wrong in thinking she is here for some blackmail, but instead of like, offering her body to the dude (Haha ikr we got a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/waifu target=_blank>waifu</a> already we can always get another haha ah-), you be glad Tamahiko didn't call the cops on her for stealing the prized present from Yuzuki but also, surprise surprise, the wallet. Probably what this girl is here for we will know her name next episode I assume, but also, now it really becomes a blackmail as Tamahiko tries to get back not his wallet because he has the money anyways, but that birthday gift, man. What else could be more important? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Man, I wished money wasn't that important to me haha we shall see what happens next we can use some not family drama lol</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEguGVCamtaxnlgokpFPy1WfghYi-QbAeed-eoLI5uyViw_XG-1AEJCHdalnh-1JtbdEgcHo19Nvnp8B4mZG_CT104ERFBMIfvh8qB3FprwJFR83GNCLfmdVaNusUPMz-bhNjJjbTX3rShL7ps4Okr2TQ6cajLc16kZBYEhvIoUK6jENYw/s320/taishouotome05_huh.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>My girl when I suggest what we have for dinner lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3rnWG5bd4nD38SOwgEn27hEdvX_c9JPk2uj35ov87cZL2YyoLz5t_Y2hyphenhyphen4M1mAzmO2_inD6xkGKVWpddIurfHvLFOQo5n0B7WM75snOvkBMX4_RzZSILqpCVegjiOq4r7HyexdYSh1wk5sHiS_ox9p2gkZpFtBTO5Ou3mjTs5WtQY8Q/s320/taishouotome05_pinch.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me trying to pinch my girl's face at night haha it's sister btw</table></div></div>P.S.

Haha I think it is. In this new episode where we will NOT be lost lol (#SenpaiGaUzai05), unless Futaba-chan grows a few inches more we will see if she will be seen as matured at any point. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sorry to all my aunts, this is not targeting you ladies. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, new character to come spoil the fun in this romance comedy haha I know right they jebaited you guys as a workplace drama but the drama is just nothing but love. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, introducing Yuuto, too bad we don't know him much at first, but through coincidences with Futaba-chan and her friend, and then Takeda with his judo skills which is probably losing his belt already he did just beat two guys up in an alley lol, this kid looks defenceless no matter how you look at him. Which is great because why can't I be that dude and have a busty sister. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, less about him, Valentine's Day is upon us. Some guys would prefer some <a href=https://jisho.org/search/honmeichoko target=_blank>honmei chocolate</a> even if store branded, but we know it's just the handmade <a href=https://jisho.org/search/girichoko target=_blank>giri chocolate</a> every year anyways, so don't think too much... Or should we? So firstly, the main couple. We are just briefly reminded about the days that happen so often, Takeda meeting up with Futaba after work for dinner even if they are miles away at work, and even Sakurai (the sister) knows to avoid being the lightbulb to these two thus stopping the brother Yuuto from joining them on their lovey-dovey session which is probably great because now that the ramen shop Takeda frequently visits also knew of Futaba-chan I'm sure someday they will order some specialty chocolate ramen and have to share a bowl together MUAHAHAHA moving on. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> But yeah, don't think too much until now, and I'm sure Takeda also won't after eating some green tea chocolate nicely thought out by Futaba who knew he doesn't have a sweet tooth. *hmm* Haha anyways, let's move on to the real highlight, the secondary couple in this series. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ah hey, I wanted more of this, and so we are getting them. The girls in the office are too, giving them chocolates. Tsukishiro did eat up some of them though, so RIP that dude who wants some chocolate from Sakurai (not the brother lol) even though we know the serious gift isn't to him. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ah, just like the flashback when Sakurai was a student, everyone was expecting the most popular girl in class to give some chocolates out to some dude, but turns out she's only into women. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, don't count on me there though, just saying. Anyways, it took a roundabout to get to there, not that I knew of Kazama's tastes in chocolate, but he did get a chocolate bar which is definitely NOT 100% friendly so... yeah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Kudos to him mistaking Sakurai walking on the streets with the brother though turning him into a jealous degenerate which really makes you think how he isn't fired for over copying documents in the photocopier machine and hitting too many times on the vending machine- Does that machine even have that many drinks? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Oh yeah you gotta put in money for each drink too huh haha I guess it is broken) Anyways, Sakurai be struggling with her own troubles, but I'm pretty sure like us popular dudes (lol) we know that it takes a lot them for people like her to actually like somebody, and wink wink, guess who's the lucky one here. Kazama is dumb enough to not notice Yuuto walking on the parapet half-covered by the ledge haha making the brother look like some tall dude who would date the girl, but hey, at least he did clear that misunderstanding. And yes, Futaba-chan, now is the time to rat him out because I don't think we need to look at the smile on his face I know right f**k you other bro Sakurai and I are an item now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, the boss' cake actually looks too good to even eat it haha, why is Takeda and Futaba going out for dinner a normality now, and vodka chocolate is the best lol thanks Tsukushiro. What more romance plots is this series going to unfold? Your guess is as good as mine.</div><div>[TL:DR; Screw you "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/37302/Ayase_Aragaki target=_blank>OreImo</a>" I've moved on to Sakurai over here haha thanks <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/869/Saori_Hayami target=_blank>Hayami Saori</a> this is all I've wanted in Anime]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLgM0vIi4eig3gdfCgXics_AOjDKgktTmeg5QNIe852DL0n3TsG7cEMC87xzWvavv1X4OlkGxeXo-XSH_DCGu-uW4XcvDJS2jxIIkvHnRg93uEaCyeYrZJaaQdBtFvpgj5uWAy7wu2iO2m2NF6HhDGgk5HUipmOlkwAp3zDZRGlSeD1Q/s320/senpaigauzai05_siblings2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>EXPECTATION<br>(Wow Sakurai going out with handsome dude)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSVFeXqQZ39Bhg3pvhcVeJZBeMMvMLb05lNLg1JqY5TqEvAQuqKcLlzR8o0aYbrMmshpNLyeJ1eZTJIynk2MZxmLk-BuX7Ps14FGBiUdNv-snlAquVACftKo5byrU_TqQvr0ZJp6ue7ahB77vteFrLe_XBo8XIY8Euz812EoAphUsing/s320/senpaigauzai05_height2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>REALITY<br>(lol)</table></div></div>P.S.

It's November already, and yes I am preparing for the Awards once again, so yeah, this is going to be like transition phase where I become stricter in my judgement, so don't mind me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, just talking about my own observations after years of listening to songs in Klassic Note. What was not strict though, was <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%A8%99%E7%81%AB-ep/1591142332?l=en" target=_blank>yanaginagi's new single</a></b> because from not giving to giving the topic song, I also managed to scoop out the singer's own composition once again knowing clearly the 2nd song is NOT her work (and likely by some techno artist and surprise, it's TeddyLoid), so I would pat myself on the shoulder for being this smart after 14 years of Klassic Note haha. Sadly though, my judgement on <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%B5%B7%E5%BA%95%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A%E6%84%9B%E3%82%92%E3%81%93%E3%82%81%E3%81%A6/1589792963?l=en" target=_blank>cinema staff's new album</a></b> is real strict, which made me ditch the topic song of the album due to its rather off style which I might call it, so I gave one from the single earlier in June and some other songs inside the album which went within my frequency today which is... I don't know now lol. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1456275057005629462?s=20" target=_blank>SPECIAL OTHERS' new song</a></b> is a meh so I'll skip it for now, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%B0%8F%E3%81%95%E3%81%AA%E7%A5%88%E3%82%8A%E3%81%AE%E6%9B%B8-ep/1591219975?l=en" target=_blank>nano.RIPE's new mini-album</a></b> available only on digital platforms so streaming counts, is not much to impress but I think you might have found out over the past couple of years I'm only giving them old songs now because seriously I want them to get into my taste again... which might be hard. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, I can only give that much recognition with that pitch in vocals though so</div><div><br>On news concerning music and is on Twitter and yes Anime season announcements are excluded in this paragraph haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1456133546712596481?s=20" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new song in collaboration with Polkadot Stingray</a></b> is in a nutshell Kana-chan singing the band's songs which is pretty meh to be honest I thought it'll sound better so I didn't give it, and... wait, that's it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Uh... I guess this is all. Wow is this the shortest paragraph I've done ever? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Wait, let me get in another one. *reads own Twitter feed* <b><a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1457327674792157194?s=20" target=_blank>Primary's vocalist yuiko is hinting on releasing new songs</a></b> without a physical release as they might have done in the past and selling it on Comiket which has also gone digital, and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1457256364477014032?s=20" target=_blank>yanaginagi did a livestream</a></b> where she asked fans about her new single but I didn't join in so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See clearly, I did not read the news haha also everything seems to happen on Sundays so I'm just <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <br><br> So for next week, I'll take a break out of new songs since there aren't any new stuff but I'll promise myself to do two things within next week which are (1) focusing on giving songs in preparation for Klassic Note Song Awards which I must say it's way harder than last year which is what I normally say every year lol and (2) watch some past live performances in order to clear my archive and probably give some oldies if I can do so. Don't bank on the latter, but yeah, this is likely where "new" songs will appear if I do these as mentioned. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Ask me again next week haha<br><br><br><br><br> And I think we ended this week with the Anime's event and the best news yet, <a href="https://twitter.com/bungosd_anime/status/1457301809949642754?s=20" target=_blank>Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" will be getting its 4th season</a> (I assume the first two seasons were counted as separate though aired back to back) which is currently in production, so boy am I excited because I did read up a bit to find out what that is but if you saw the poster for the next season the top right is likely British ability user Agatha Christie, who is also the one who summoned some incinerating ability user to remove Yokohama if the Japanese can't contain whatever dragon is in that "DEAD APPLE" movie in which the movie was only based on Atsushi's past events. Haha yeah, 'tis getting real, boys, we getting the full arc series greenlit right now. *thumbs up* Can't wait for that to happen but by then, I guess I'll continue to live on so I can watch this masterpiece. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time then, and until then... I can't carry over three more days of work leave so I should start thinking of how to use them maybe stack them on the usual year end spree I guess lol bye<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Oh yeah even the <a href="https://twitter.com/tonikawa_anime/status/1456911678017134595?s=20" target=_blank>Anime "Tonikaku Kawaii" season two announcement</a> won't win this now haha just joking this one's even better we get to know Tsukasa's origin story lol you should've guessed something when the author mentioned this was an adaptation of the "Bamboo Princess" haha yep</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. I... may have watched too many episodes of "Bungou Stray Dogs" in one night haha thank goodness I cut my hair and showered early hehe thanks past me</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
