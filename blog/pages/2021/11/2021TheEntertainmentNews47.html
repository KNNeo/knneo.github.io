And... welcome to Sunday! See you guys next week haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Wait, what? I have to review Anime and talk about the songs I have listened
  for the week when I spent three days on the bed struck from the infection I
  got from two weeks ago? Okay, guess I have no choice then. Maybe don't drag me
  to go to prayers in the morning just because I have been sh*t on my luck
  getting all this resurgence of a virus infection that is not financial rebate
  because- Look, I spent a lot of money on ultrasound scan stop asking me to buy
  new T-shirts sis <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Now that we have summarized life this week for me lol, let's talk about actual
  exciting stuff, yeah?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (Hey I'm only watching THREE shows this week man; Look at next year's line-up
  and consider if you want to continue this weekly post or not lol)<br />

      "Tadano-kun discovered a new fetish" lmao alright
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Yeah Komi-san if you want to be picky about what you have missed in your
  belongings for this outing, try your mom you will need a luggage case lmao. In
  this new episode and man this is the pinnacle episode of any Anime series lol
  prove me wrong (#KomiSan07), we go to the pool! It's not a beach, mind you, or
  else someone wouldn't have been hurt hehe you see what I did there, but maybe
  because it's the pool that will make this infinitely more fun for especially
  Komi-san who I assume, has never been to one in her life. She has not done
  many things in her life so gotta take note of that. Anyways, it's the usual
  group plus Agari which is expected and Yamai-san which is not lol don't ask
  how she knows they are here, and she brought the others in class to join in
  probably just saying along the lines of "Komi-san
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/mizugi" target="_blank">swimsuit</a>" and
  they just appeared within 5 minutes haha ah hey. So yeah, the group went to
  the pool, they were changing and as usual the dudes have to stand on a line
  and after we figured out that Najimi can only use the reserved for the
  disabled restroom lol, we see the guys, just like any other Anime, judge on
  the quality of swimsuits on, of of course, the girls in the series so not
  Najimi. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Apparently the guys still did judge them so whatever lol,
  Agari-chan has a rack I can't even haha, Yamai-san and whoever those are are
  fine, and Komi-san wins. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No surprises there, she <i>has</i> to win.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They played water slides in which the floatie is for a pair I think
  you know what I'm talking about, and thankfully Tadano was sitting in with
  Komi-san because everyone else is choosing who gets to sit on the reserved
  seat lol. Although I would argue though, no one would get that new fetish
  discovered if it isn't normal Tadano-kun so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They held long breath
  competitions but they all lost to Komi-san and her cuteness so drinks on them
  haha, they were stalking Komi-san going down the lazy river lol what, and
  Komi-san fell while running to another ride. Hey, what did your parents remind
  you about running on wet ground? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, it's her first time, no one
  will be mad actually they will be worried, but she is still full with worry,
  so Tadano - who got pushed away by Yamai lol - assures her it is not her
  fault. Yeah, Komi-san, your god-like status will override everything. I wish I
  had friends like that. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on haha, they ended up playing water
  guns instead since that is not as intense as moving around though I would
  argue this might only work for Agari-chan since she would rather be hit and
  not dodge or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Interestingly this is not the only thing this
  episode, so let's move on. Next up, the dad. You would think that after seeing
  so many bad dads this season this one would be the same too, but considering
  the mother can talk and if parent traits do inherit to their kids... you get
  the idea lol they got a voice actor to do the same thing as what Koga Aoi is
  doing now lmao. They agreed somehow to go to eat
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kakigoori" target="_blank">shaved ice</a>
  together (in a cafe? ok), it was the dad's idea, but that's the problem since
  the dad can't open his mouth too they are just in a stalemate after taking
  their orders. (Of course, through pointing on the menu) Yeah remember when we
  talked about social communication where someone has to START the conversation?
  By speaking up? That's the problem lol. But yeah, the dad did it just because
  or else we will be here forever lol, and he asked something simple basically
  same as the mother, which is about her life in high school. Komi-san trolled
  her dad for a moment, but I guess all is well if she doesn't show a depressed
  look probably like what she did in elementary and middle school. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Then, Komi-san went to the library to spend the afternoon reading books. What
  did get her though isn't the eyes looking at her reading books, but her
  anxiety of borrowing the books through the (human) counter. Yeah, they don't
  have those automated machines yet, huh. I used those when I was a kid visiting
  libraries for maybe twice a year. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She stayed to read the book instead
  and you know, entertained a kid while she's at it. And yep, if you thought no
  one spotted her, Tadano got in on the action thank goodness. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And the
  last part where Komi-san is at the playground is just nostalgia retry because
  if you haven't been crazy about the remasters of video games you have played
  as a kid you are not old enough. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And Tadano saw it again what a lucky
  dude man haha not on the library fines though. All in all, great episode, I've
  talked about the stereotypical Anime jokes and classic style of presentation
  in Anime excluding the lack of dialogue lol, but overall this series has not
  yet been disappointing, even if it means Komi-san writing on paper to explain
  herself. So yeah, can't wait to see what happens next. It's like the author is
  thinking what weird situations they can put her in right now that I've
  experienced before lol no I've not been in the ladies changing room lmao oi

  </blockquote>
  Hey, if I can quote the whole thing Yuzuki said in the intro, I wouldn't have
  to do this review. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, let's do this review. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new
  episode (#TaishouOtome07) where Tamahiko... sensei haha hey we gotta show some
  respect for the new title he just got, because he be teaching Aya-chan's
  sibilings again- Hey, I did not agree to teach the whole village's kids!!
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, what rabbit hole did you fall into, bro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, I would
  assume the kids at Aya's house ie. her sibling who actually cared about
  studying lol the elder sister probably gave up education to take care of them
  lol cringe, went to Tamahiko's place in search of knowledge and guidance
  because he taught them so well in that one day. So yeah, he agreed, and the
  group of kids joining increased real fast as if they were having kids and then
  immediately sending them to this "school" lol hey that can happen, and as you
  can see, he is making a name out of himself. I mean, it's just easier for him
  to teach kids since he is privileged enough to go to school lol remember it's
  1920s Japan where universal education is not compulsory yet, so at least in
  that part Tamahiko is doing wonders on these kids. Yuzuki be the supporting
  role as always, and they are just scared of Aya-chan's arrival. Yeah, after
  what happened last time you gotta wonder what is happening around here huh.
  She did apologize to Yuzuki for being such a b*tch though, but seeing as she
  is not dealing with a weak-willed woman hey she is a woman she turned 15
  already hehe, she knew to not mess around with her after all. I don't know if
  I can accept that but hey, Yuzu did. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, a day of cleaning around
  the house, but this time, Tamahiko helped out. Yes, with just one hand. Yes,
  we know it's not much, but the desire to help is still stronger than me
  watching my dad vacuum the floor so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Shame on you, me, shame on you)
  But yeah, and as they cuddle together in the night watching the seasons
  change, Yuzuki talked about how she is now in legal age to be married to you
  know who. Interestingly, Tamahiko wants to make change to be able to suit
  himself better for this supposed future wife. Like really, I wouldn't have
  considered otherwise if it wasn't this girl, but yeah, his dedication shines
  through the light, we almost forgot he was Mr. Depression just episodes ago
  lol. His dedication went as far as writing a letter to the dad to request
  continuation of his education which will of course revoke his "death sentence"
  so this might be a no-go, but he can still do it privately I guess. You know,
  remote learning? Get around everything and do what he wants? That's what we
  call freedom. Not for Aya-chan's brother Ryoutaro though, he's kinda screwed.
  Following their family events, the drunk dad probably got into more debt, so
  Ryoutaro had to work in Tokyo in order to pay back money and/or raise his
  family. With such a noble sacrifice in the face of freedom back in the 1920s,
  it's no wonder he'll get worried about going up north- He's probably 12,
  right? We all can agree on that? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, so brave man, so brave-
  This dude's life is going to Hell in about three months haha GET ME OFF THIS
  CHAIR I DON'T WANT TO WITNESS WHAT HAPPENS TO RYOUTARO lol okay me stop
  getting emotional haha. All in all, I'm actually enjoying all the life stories
  happen, I don't want the bad stuff to hit my face. But yeah, I'll enjoy this
  while it lasts then, as long as we can keep our heads high, yeah? God, I wish
  this series is just everything without the dad, but as Aya-chan almost got
  sold away by the dad, you can't expect everything to be so rosy after all.
  <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Man, we can but hope. Cya guys next time for the rumoured, the one and
  only musician in town, Kotori-san.

  It's fine, Natsumi. Only cheaters cheat. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, I thought this was
  "Taishou Otome" I legit checked again to make sure I'm watching the right show
  lol, so turns out it's a flashback. So in this new episode (#SenpaiGaUzai07)
  we talk about as I'll quote from the official Twitter "Natsumi's friendship
  with Futaba", and so we shall. Oh, boy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Here's a warning, because I
  had a tissue box by my side. So, story. Story started with the Sakurai
  siblings with Futaba and Natsumi, thanking them for the time they helped Yuuto
  out when he was lost. (Really, can't help but hear Horie Yui's own voice in
  this lol it's that tone man) Yuuto became interested in their friendship, and
  *flashback* we go back to when they met in middle school. Natsumi was just a
  punk skipping school and stuff I mean you wish you could be as cool as her,
  and Futaba was a lost transfer kid in the new school. Following someone in the
  same uniform probably was a mistake, but suffice it to say because of
  Natsumi's nonchalant attitude Futaba did feel relived she was around someone
  of the same circumstances... maybe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Through this episode though, we
  are hit more about dreams as kids, from Yuuto who wanted to not look bad in
  class doing long-distance runs with a girl so he came out to train (man, I
  would too, haha), which brings us to the next thing in the two buddies' middle
  school life: choosing a club. Really, hardest decision ever haha and in Japan
  you can't really skip it, because it's a way of encouraging secondary passions
  within an education system that only wants your grades. *OOF* Haha so yeah,
  Futaba chose Art Club because she loves to draw, and explained to Natsumi on
  chasing of her own passions, for example, if she likes running a lot. Though
  discouraged by competitions which we have seen in the intro where people like
  to cheat and think they are better but they are just losers anyways BOOM GOT
  'EM, ironically if you point this out so clearly Futaba will make a lot of
  sense when she says to just do it for oneself. I didn't choose my clubs when I
  was a kid in school just because I'm good at them. Sometimes you just want to
  try things out and learn something new in the process, which is why Guitar
  Ensemble in high school for me where I got dad to pay for an acoustic guitar
  so I could join in on the big stage even though, which brings us to the next
  point, I totally don't know what I was doing. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (<i
    >Don't tell the others</i
  >
  haha not like you know who they are) So, *flashback* again haha why~ <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  We find out that bullies don't exist. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, me and my sarcasm. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
  Yeah, so of course Futaba was often bullied in school for probably her height
  but also probably her own lack of confidence, which also explains why the guys
  in class who have no heart or soul, just find someone to waste their time on,
  and the was just in the way. Natsumi came in to stop them just because, almost
  got into trouble because of that but then was saved by the two boys who told
  the teachers the full story. So yeah, friends be helping each other out. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
  I don't have such a wonderful story with my friends though; We broke out real
  soon and only met up again in university so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> ANYWAYS haha, friends are
  about talking each other out, and influencing each other. Whether you would
  take the first step to go running in the morning and/or take up the basketball
  club like Yuuto would, it's all up to you. For everything else, it's important
  <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> to do everything you like, for yourself. Gotta say though, not every
  hobby is pride, for example programming because not like I'm recognized as a
  freelancer or whatever, but you get the idea. Being cool and yourself is part
  of what brings in confidence, people. All in all, I'm still surprised how I
  can still write all these with a cool head because the front of my shirt is
  <i>totally</i> wet lmao, but yeah, they got me good man, they got me well.
  Can't wait for more of these though; I just have to remind myself this is also
  a romance Anime so drunk Ooishi x Tsukishiro maybe?? Haha I'm just focused on
  the Sakurai x Kazama ship right now lmao such is life isn't it

  This week is a week of new releases likely for the month (there's always that
  one week of the month lol), so let's see what we got. I'm throwing away

  by the way, just so you know, not because he's male idolism but more of I
  didn't like the songs anyways and I don't think I'll give this Anime ending
  anytime soon so... yeah. An Anime ending I did give though, is
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hikare-inochi-single/1589737452?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >Kitri's new single</a
    ></b
  >, and since with my stupid brain and didn't notice both songs in the release
  are featured in the Anime itself namely the latter B-side is the episode 1
  ending song, it'll likely be our new and final Klassic Note Review for the
  year. Man, we could use more of these, you know. Maybe I should just buy
  digital. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not least, we have (I won't even bother typing it
  so I'm copy pasting)&nbsp;<b
    ><a

      >GARNiDELiA's new album</a
    ></b
  >
  which is something I keep thinking about them singing for Anime so I totally
  forgot they are more pop than rock music but yeah I'm more of a fan of the
  latter so you can guess what songs I gave in the list apart from the Anime
  theme song. Melody is also an issue, so I won't comment on that too much

  due on her birthday next year... yes they are both in February and only three
  days apart so go figure I'll have to review them within a week, and I thought
  of giving them after listening to
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1461605185814474760?s=20"

      >ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new music video</a
    ></b

  but I thought maybe not I'll just wait for more songs this is just one of
  those emo songs but the melody really isn't any impressive. Wow, that's all
  for news, huh. Hmm, maybe I need to go search around for new artists lol I
  think I'm relying too much on YouTube these days I'm not even trying where is
  even mention of Audioleaf remember that indie gem? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well times have
  changed huh
</div>
<div>
  <br />So for next week, we do not have any new releases... Wait, let me see...
  *checks
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2nqM31uxdg" target="_blank"
    >Skream</a
  >*, oh yeah I kept dodging their music videos on YouTube and never gotten down
  to them so maybe
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%AE%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC/1592471021?l=en"

      >Humbreader's new album</a

  I guess, but I have planned to give a listen to
  <b

      target="_blank"
      >Base Ball Bear's latest album</a
    ></b
  >
  because I have given a few songs over the past 2 years in this burning Hell so
  I thought I should just listen to them and see if it's as bad of a flop as the
  last time we listened to their album, fingers crossed.

  I... think my whatever virus infection might be coming back. The doctor might
  be right, it might have spread to my kidneys, and I don't even know it's
  connected. Oh well, I guess my health is going downhill from here now huh.
  I'll just go to work to settle last week's problems (haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>) and
  <i>then</i> get my MC after that wave. I have done that scan so let's hope if
  my doctor can figure something out of this. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Cya guys next time then,
  and until next time... oh

    >the new DOAXVV update</a
  >
  was great I'm taking my time to grind the game lol it is now the only not
  mobile game I'm playing and this one inherited the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onsen" target="_blank">onsen</a> stuff from
  the game that ended haha. What was NOT that great though is the package as
  it's not coming along nicely thanks to more delays from that one online store
  which I won't provide context but it's also those who promised my Ede-chan
  bromides and delayed it till now, is now delaying my RumiRumi bromides to
  December. Thankfully that'll come along with the calendar for next year so I'm
  still covered unless my health is due and I have to pay so much in medication
  I can't afford the shipping costs lmao

<div>Ask me again if my crotch is okay next week haha</div>
<div><br /></div>

  P.S. New phone dropped by on Monday and made my week until I realized my head
  hurts on Tuesday and spent half the work week at home lol. The result? Tomita
  Miyu with long hair for her birthday for me (lol) is the final image of my old
  phone so that was the cover, thank goodness. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
