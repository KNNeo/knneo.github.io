Wow, harsh reminder from typing that post title, we're left with 4 weeks, huh.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Apart from thinking about Klassic Note Song Awards this year which I should
  totally do so already I barely made any notes on it tbh, I also can't wait for
  this year to be over so I can actually enjoy a week's break off work in ease
  and not have to deal with it because I'm just tired from all this and want to
  play games or YouTube all day without having to wake up at 7 in the morning.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Also, so I can have the mood to watch Anime because I'm literally doing the
  above every week so I can actually sit down and do this and then realize that
  I could've just done it earlier since it'll hype up my weekend instead of what
  I think normally which is get me more tired than I should have been.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Hey, anything beats getting sick and sleeping all day amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's
  not get sick and talk Anime and music lol

  I mean, what else can top last week's episode, right?
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yukata" target="_blank">Yukata</a>?? I'M
  IN!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh yeah, summer's not over yet in this series. So in this new
  episode (#KomiSan08) where for once Komi-san didn't wish for the summer
  holidays to end man do you even want to know how she spent her previous years'
  holidays lol I don't, we do other things than just go to the beach, I mean,
  pool. Hey, I thought we will get the beach episode but I guess not huh. I
  mean, last week's so good what else can top it? Maybe when Komi-san was in
  yukata I guess, but before that, let's talk about the family trip. Yeah, as
  you would imagine, the Komi family is a bunch of weirdos, basically the dudes
  being silent and the married ladies being the chatterboxes and thankfully, the
  head of the family ie. the grandmother can speak, so that's a relief. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Talking about family, we have relatives too so namely cousins and we are
  introduced to one Akira-chan (voiced by yours truly Hondo Kaede) (don't worry
  I didn't notice from the voice either I only remembered someone on my Twitter
  feed tweeted about it lol) who besides knowing how scary her elder cousin is,
  also noticed about <strike>Komi-san</strike> Shouko's change since the last
  time they met, last time I assume being the grandfather's death anniversary
  last year. They got along way better than last year it seems, and even when
  Shouko got called in by the grandmother to report about her life (her dad is
  me when I have to report my life to my grandmother tbh lol who sadly passed
  away when I was 9 RIP gramps) the elder is just glad she enjoyed high school
  and had some friends this time around because remember how bad it must have
  been the years before since they had to do this every year, to talk about how
  she is alone again because of her death stare and perfect image?&nbsp; Hey,
  I'm glad for you too, girl. Next up, yay finally I can talk about the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/natsumatsuri" target="_blank"
    >summer festival</a
  >. Tadano is right about people not wearing yukata to the festival since
  youngsters have abandoned it, but man if these Anime characters don't wear
  them then I might as well just watch real life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Komi-san is
  in the spotlight as usual, Yamai-san and the others somehow found these two
  with Najimi lmao, and all of them got to play some games. Firstly,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shateki" target="_blank">shooting</a>.
  Literally the best joke is when you don't believe Komi-san will shoot better
  than Tadano did which is missing all his shots, and then Makeru-chan shows up.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Now you DEFINITELY can believe Komi-san will hit every single shot.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, that's how you know haha this series is the best. No
  surprise Makeru-chan lost, so let's move on to
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/katanuki" target="_blank">katanuki</a> (wow
  thanks for the definition that is the first time I've known of what it's
  called lol), where we see Najimi be the Makeru-chan of this skill-based
  activity I gotta try this out sometime once this world stops burning and we
  can travel, and the main couple be so good at them they did it out of anxiety
  lmao hey this is Anime accept this reality with a pinch of salt, thanks.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Don't worry, the one in Anime "Acchi Kocchi" was lamer haha)
  Ironically, the delayed speech from Komi-san did travel to Tadano at some
  point though, complimenting on him wearing a yukata even though the dude
  probably didn't want to, as instructed by Najimi. Then, we have whatever lucky
  draw in the form of attached ropes. Yes, since this is a comedy bit all over,
  they gotta show the attendant who is also a scheming bastard of a granny (lol)
  cheating on the psychological minds of innocent participants until you are
  Komi-san who just doesn't think and pulls the one prize. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I would
  argue though, I'll be like Komi-san too, just that my luck is not as good as
  hers and if someone tells me some level of technique I'll just follow and be
  an idiot just like Najimi who got some pocket tissues. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Blah blah
  taste your sausage lol Yamai-san aren't you female where's your- AND we move
  on to goldfish scooping. Apparently Komi-san was so concentrated in her play
  and didn't notice the darkness (lol) Nakanaka-san where she tries to catch a
  goldfish but I guess it went as well as she wanted since that's why the fish
  avoid you they know you aren't normal and exude darkness from within- Please
  don't turn me into a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chuunibyou" target="_blank">chuunibyou</a>
  I'm not that cringe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Komi-san got lost despite forgetting that she
  has a phone now, Tadano spotted her missing and found her, and... can we call
  that a confession? Ok maybe a pick-up line but who knows right <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last
  but not least, we gather at Tadano's place just because. Oh and if you want to
  know the reason I'm pretty sure Yamai-san who was uninvited will be glad to
  explain it to you guys. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course, the actual reason for their
  gathering is because Najimi loves fun and hates homework so they are crashing
  it now, just like normal student Tadano too so what else is new. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All
  in all, wonderful episode, I laughed a lot, I feel for you Komi-san enjoying
  summer holidays (in case you don't know Japan's school summer holidays last
  for 2-3 months) (yes in one go, and for reference Singapore's longest is only
  slightly less than a month), Tadano's sister Hitomi is surprised how
  impressive her brother was at hooking up prime material lmao, and I'm pretty
  sure you guys are just salivating at Komi-san all the time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm not
  though, so don't associate me with you freaks. Haha cya guys soon

  [TL:DR; Best part is actually when the others were distracted by Yamai-san and
  Tadano said he saw Komi-san at the library and the park. Oh boy can't wait to
  see Komi-san die of embarrassment being witnessed on what she did last episode
  lol]

  Sometimes I look at the intro and think if it's a hint to something. I know
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/41389/Tonikaku_Kawaii" target="_blank"
    >some other series</a
  >
  like to do this too so, I wonder. In this new episode where the uncle is MVP
  because he literally saved Tamako and Tamahiko&nbsp; and it's not because he's
  a doctor (#TaishouOtome08), and that's why it's great when your dad pronounced
  you dead because you can bypass him and DO WHATEVER YOU WANT!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know
  freedom shouldn't be expressed this way but in this case, it might be his only
  way out. So before we talk about new characters, let's talk about Tamahiko's
  journey to schooling. Well, re-schooling, right? He dropped out of school due
  to universal hatred? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Anyways, his determination is impeccable,
  but despite his many letters to the father, he did not get any reply. But that
  doesn't mean his fate is sealed, dear Mr. Depression; Your uncle is about to
  save your life. We can only have that many saviours in our lives, so take them
  while we can, yes? So yeah, thanks to Tamako talking about her brother with
  the uncle, the uncle in turn would like to help him get back into school,
  though of course there isn't any guarantee of a rose-coloured school life with
  his name and reputation so we'll talk about that later, but suffice it to say
  Tamahiko has to catch up with school considering he did go into a slump for a
  good amount of time before Yuzuki appeared. So yeah, he studied day and night
  and even in the bath lol, and Aya-chan had to pay him a visit and cook
  something for him to cheer him on. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Wait till you dump on Yuzuki that
  jealousy song, amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey MOSHIMO you're welcome for free PR
  your one song is more useful than I ever expected. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Tamahiko
  eventually got in, surprisingly, on the same day as another student who,
  surprise surprise but you'll get it at the end of the episode anyways so why
  the delay, is related to the idol? Yeah, I guess so, it's singer Shiratori
  Kotori-chan's twin brother Hakaru who, despite his nerdy appearance, is
  probably getting way more attention compared to I don't think it's
  <em>that</em> Shima family transfer student but you know, we don't ask questions
  here besides in class to the teachers so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He had it rough and I don't
  think we should reiterate, but considering Tamahiko is here for education, I
  think he can live through this just because. Yeah so f**k all of you: I'll
  live through high school alone, says Tamahiko, but you gotta reflect on this,
  because remember this is 1920s Japan where EVERYONE is a jerk, from classmates
  to the teacher so yeah, you don't say. Tamahiko is probably glad he didn't get
  beat up in the courtyard every other day or get sh*t on from a noble school or
  something from before he was abandoned by the father- Hey, bad enough already,
  right? (You know, sometimes people are just relieved that they survived and
  not have to suffer a living Hell when they are better off dead, really.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span>) Anyways, it looks like our other transfer student is interested in
  him despite being surrounded by fans of probably the sister lol does she have
  to study haha, but yeah, it wasn't until Art class (yep, that exists) where
  Hakaru took the seat beside him that got the ball rolling. Gotta say though,
  that one drawing Tamahiko did? Totally can sell as an NFT haha no really like,
  if it's actually done by say, the voice actor or something lol don't quote me
  on this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hakaru's probably can sell as a meme for twice the price
  online though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay jokes aside, they got shot by the teacher onto
  the ground easily which means more supplementary work apparently drawing each
  other, which will explain the "friend" and his visit to their place. When
  asked about school life though, Tamahiko did lie to his wife about... Well if
  you haven't been paying attention, besides the lunch and I guess we got a
  friend lol more like the friend got us, <em>everything</em>&nbsp;was a lie. Hey
  Tamahiko, is this how you maintain a healthy relationship? <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Sadly, he
  got egged by Hakaru to turn those lies into reality, so yay he got a friend
  now lol, but man, what's wrong with talking about how screwed up your life is?
  We modern society people compare our worsts all the time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all,
  man every episode in this series is so wholesome as much as it has its sad
  moments, I <em>really</em> want to make sure the dad is dead so that we don't
  have to see his face again. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, it's not all cherry blossoms
  or Yuzuki's smile lol, so we shall have to see about that. What will make
  Yuzuki smile though, is the appearance of Kotori-chan at her place, and
  likely, as the Shiratori family has moved into Chiba, we get to experience
  their presence and influence on the village, it seems. Man, I can use more
  happy moments haha cya then

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  But of course Kazama is going to play video games on his Golden Week off. What
  about Sakurai though? *BOOM* Haha in this new episode (#SenpaiGaUzai08) how
  about let me ask whoever is reading this a question: What do you do on my days
  off? Since I have planned for a week off end of the year, perhaps, I can
  equate this to Golden Week which is normally in May, on what I do on my days
  off. Nothing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, let's talk about Tsukishiro's day off. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyways, holiday time, it's the best part about working lol seriously trust me
  on this if you are still studying haha, and I'm just glad the reality is
  normally... we just don't plan for anything. Especially when the world is on
  fire, you hardly want to leave the house in case you get ill after your
  holidays which I must say happens real often so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This time around, we
  had our focus on the main two couples if you haven't already noticed who they
  are, so let's not talk about Ooishi picking up pebbles on the riverside. Like
  really, I don't even want to talk about it. Haha so yeah, let's start with
  Futaba. She is living her holidays purposefully it seems, with clean up of her
  already small solo abode followed by a yoga workout which just ended up in the
  trash because she tuned in to the wrong channel and freaked out lol,
  technically asked for help from Takeda who is just casually working out lmao,
  and I guess they just ended up hanging out together instead. Hey, I wish I can
  ask my colleagues out that easily. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Maybe I do have communication
  issues lol what am I even huh. Then again, considering when you come to the
  city to work alone far away from family, this is normally what you would do to
  keep your sanity, you know, hang out with people. I don't have that experience
  so someone help me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What I also don't have experience though, is
  dating someone. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, I'm the pathetic one, Kazama, so why
  not literally jebait Sakurai into going to the aquarium haha hey I gotta say
  REAL SMOOTH BRO I can't even pull that out tbh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And since Sakurai is
  very willing anyways, why would she say no so guess who's having a great time
  in their Golden Week holidays. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I'll leave the rest of the fun to
  yourself, but suffice it to say they did make a good joke out of a dolphin who
  looks like Kazama lmao, Sakurai got wet (haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>), and Souta-kun lives in
  her place now lol yeah even the name is same as his even though I swear this
  is the first time we were reminded of his name instead of referring to him by
  his family name so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Kazama treated his date like a game and it went
  well, Takeda treated the crane game like a game and got Futaba a prize which
  should be easy to get loads of lol, and the dolphins are MVP. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'll
  never be that cool as Souta-kun though, to think of a way to run away from
  those dudes so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe I gotta brush up on those skills first- Which
  shoujo manga you read on this? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, fantastic episode, I gotta
  say it's stiff competition between these three shows I watch this season they
  all have their strengths, but I'll remember this dearly as a reflection of my
  pathetic life being a worker of society. Haha, maybe I'll get to look back at
  this once I get laid with a woman during my Golden Week holidays or the one I
  planned end of the year lol <em>I did this for the song awards</em> haha bye

  Wow, how is this week less than last week? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, I thought of waiting
  for <b>Humbreader's new album</b> to be available in Apple Music the only

  which I gave... nothing so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, getting real dry here in Klassic
  Note already, really. So yeah, we shall see how I can get the former release
  to appear sometime soon, I believe this is some music label level bullsh*t-
  It's 2021, guys, what's with the lack of privilege of music streaming? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>
  I'll just forget to listen if it's not out by next week tbh<br />
  <br />In news concerning music and it's on Twitter and I might say this week's

  and don't ask me why (1) there's red in this when she loves blue lol and (2)
  why there are two albums haha the latter is actually easy to answer they want

    >vocalist Mia-san did a face reveal in their recent live performance</a
  >. Yep, it's out now, as all of your might have waited for. I'm not very
  surprised at the face though it reminded me of Lynn-san the voice actress, but
  more surprised at why the show face, but it seems that the concept for the new
  album is to start afresh, so maybe that's why. But yeah, show face or not, I
  won't even comment on whether she's idolism material there is good reason why
  she hid under an avatar for so many years, because I'll still look forward to
  the album all the same. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay, <em>maybe</em> I was disappointed
  <a

    >remember when she had long hair</a
  >? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'll get used to her face haha<br />
  <br />So for next week, and finally I might add, we will be touching on
  <b>Cider Girl's new album</b> and so far as I have said besides their 2nd I've
  never missed one so this is the 4th, so let's see if I can give something from
  here besides the one song for the Anime. And maybe Humbreaders again if it
  gets over some one week period priority for physical releases or whatever
  lol<br />
  <br />

  I'm not going to take this as an actual review just because, but hey the

      >Dead or Alive Extreme Venus Vacation soundtrack released this week</a
    ></b

  (that was a mouthful) became my jam for the week at work, honestly speaking.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't know if that's a good thing or not considering I hardly
  listen to the in-game music and always substitute it with YouTube, but hey, at
  least I'm enjoying it. So yeah, if you liked the series then the soundtrack
  would be something to you. I'm just here for the 3D girls and outfits lol
  don't question my tastes. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... can
  you believe, this is the only time of the week, I dare to talk about stuff I
  like and not get zoned out or shit on by others? Well, not like I talk to
  people about this too so whatever haha take care of your own mental health
  guys<br />

  P.S. According to
  <a
    href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1464911866291900423?s=20"
    target="_blank"
    >Mia-san from Sangatsu no Phantasia</a
  >&nbsp;(yes I follow her on Twitter instead of the artist official account
  hehe) and this is just a loose translation of a summary, she mentioned about
  how in early days she wanted to use Mia-san which is that avatar to sing songs
  and tell stories likely according to the composers backing her, but over time
  she was so involved in writing the lyrics and novels (yes it is a thing,
  though hard sell to not Japanese since no translations) related to them,
  creating a more fuller image then made her decide to do all of this in a more
  honest reveal, using her own self to replace that avatar medium in telling
  stories from here on. Brave girl, Mia-san, and personally? I don't think it'll
  affect her popularity because the songs are genuinely good, but this will be a
  good chance to show us and herself if she can be capable of such a drastic
  change in image. People will still like her though, I'm pretty sure about
  that.
