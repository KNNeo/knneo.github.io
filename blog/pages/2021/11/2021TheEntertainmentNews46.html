Happy birthday, Kido Ibuki, my dear little princess. I can't express how much I
want to be with you, as you have only been more attractive to me from your looks
to your personality as you grow up, and trust me, I would love to marry you in
that wedding dress you wore recently.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Haha okay confession's over, let's talk about stuff this week! I'm tired on a
  Sunday because anxiety got to me when I saw whatever WhatsApp thing going on
  last night ugh, but hey, at least that is resolved for now. FOR NOW. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Okay, think of Ibuki-chan then, me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> SHE is the kind of people I'll
  never want to have s*x with, but would love to make out for like, eternity.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know, that's like, for everyone. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not Nan-chan though, some
  are meant to be
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> and
  receive head pats forever haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Now I think we can start we probably hit the intro limit on each post if you
  saw on the home page of this blog. I'll be surprised if anyone saw it or even
  not because they subscribed to this blog's... feed haha it's 2021 man who
  still uses feeds (it's there by the way if you need it lol)<br />

      "I learnt from television that comedy in communication is important" Oh
      yeah, Komi-san? Oh right, that's a comedy show she's watching lmao
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  WHAT?? IS THAT A 3D CLASSROOM?? Hey, say Anime hasn't gotten better since when
  you started watching it. For me, 13 years and counting. *FeelsOldMan* Anyways,
  new episode (#KomiSan06), Komi-san's making jokes here and boy did this just
  remind me specifically of Anime "Hatsukoi Limited." episode three where I
  experienced the same fate. Dear author, you didn't happen to...? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyways, we got lots more to talk about this week, surprise surprise, with
  relation to communication with others, so let's get to it! Firstly, someone
  turned Komi-san into a part-time comedian lol. I say part-time because she
  can't even speak so how can one make jokes with just in writing... *looks at
  this text* I also wonder haha but yeah, most of us will think like Najimi and
  wonder if they are the next target for some puzzle-solving mystery lmao. Then,
  probably best part of this episode just because it became a competition, it's
  going shopping. Going shopping is fine for Komi-san because she doesn't lol
  and it's also fine for everyone else without Komi-san because they have never
  done it before they only simp on her every day haha, so yeah it's no wonder it
  literally became a magnet for discussion once Najimi brought it up. Yep, even
  Yamai-san wants in on the fun even if she is not invited. I mean,
  coincidences, amirite? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, since Komi-san is a n00b at shopping
  for... I assume anything for herself since just like me my mom takes care of
  my casual wear lol hey it's a thing guys but I do buy them myself now...
  online so I don't know why Komi-san hasn't done that yet- Oh, no phone.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, sorry Komi-san for bombing you again, so let's bomb the others
  instead and let them choose clothes for you to wear considering two are
  females, one is unknown and the other's a dude. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I have a feeling
  this will go well lol thanks Najimi for the China outfit though that's just
  fanservice anyways. But yeah, of course Tadano wins this competition because
  he's the only one who didn't screw around (Najimi's 2nd choice wasn't too bad)
  and did bring out her purity in silence with a one-piece white dress unlike
  the others haha. But you know, the dress isn't anything if it's bought and not
  worn, so we shall see that real soon. Next up, the haircut scene. Really
  feeling bad for another victim of Komi-san but this time around, it's the
  newbie at the salon Arai-san (voiced by, and I got tipped earlier this week
  since I follow her on Twitter,
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/43303/Rika_Nagae" target="_blank"
    >Nagae Rika</a
  >) (very, very cute hehe oh name as in "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/arai"
    target="_blank"
    >washing</a
  >") who can't pick a hint at silent Komi-san and lets senpai and hair stylist
  Karisu Maki (God, this is such a pun I can't even) (Can be read as "charisma"
  so charismatic and "maki" which is curl as in hair) who likely cuts her hair
  as a regular and knows what she wants likely dictated by her mom when she was
  12. So yeah, go figure. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, Arai-san's impressions of Komi-san
  isn't wrong: not talking especially when you can is pure disrespect even if it
  means you're bad at communication. It's like talking to a wall, especially
  when you are human and you're not deaf lol. Oh well, what do I know about
  Komi-san anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And I thought it's a joke where Komi-san never
  greets anyone back in class every morning, when it's literally no one but
  Tadano noticed her hair change. As expected of my boy, amirite??? Haha
  Komi-san I dare you to talk back to me, I dare you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And it hasn't
  ended yet, because we got exams coming up. Najimi may not suck at tests
  actually they did better than Makeru-chan over there who can barely hold
  against Komi-san's god-like results lol, but yeah I guess like the typical
  student no one wants to stick through doing revision alone, so the guys go to
  the library to study. Well, I don't think Najimi is doing it and that
  "gorilla" library attendant of a student did send them out after a while so...
  hey, still better than Makeru-chan though- I really wonder how she studies lol
  and imagine if she gets to study with Komi-san if she admits defeat. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Oh welp. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not least, now that exams are over that's fast lol,
  it's the summer holidays now. That is fast, and as Komi-san and possibly the
  others see the time pass by, you would wonder why she isn't hanging out with
  her newly-made friends in high school, isn't it. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Thanks Najimi-san
  for initiating the invite because I feel you Tadano-kun it's
  <em>impossible</em> to invite any of the others as a dude I get it and who wants
  that ninja in on this anyways lmao, but yeah, Komi-san had to reply a "yes" to
  that phone call from the <strike>childhood</strike> friend so yay, I guess
  we're going out after all. AND WE'RE DONE CYA NEXT WEEK haha I F**KING KNEW IT
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, looks like our beach episode is next week so that's
  something to hype about sooner than later hehe see you all then

  [Okay I'm not going to put in the review on top just because, but I'll explain

  </blockquote>
  But serious question people, what can be worse than your dad disowning you and
  declaring you dead? *OOF* Anyways, with this new episode (#TaishouOtome06)
  this series suddenly turned into a mystery series lol it's not that hard to
  find out who stole the wallet the village is only that small and we do know
  who did it so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, in case you didn't realize, Mr.
  Depression-san (lol), someone else also has their own family issues. And what
  an emotional episode once again, man, this series making grounds I can't even.
  Let's talk about it. Last time some thief dropped by rich guy's house to steal
  his wallet which coincidentally contains a birthday present to him by the
  future wife, so yeah, that's gotta get someone worried. What does get him more
  worried though, is him having to deal with the confrontation of getting it
  back. You know, other than him being the rich dude in the village who everyone
  knows about, he also didn't think of dealing with not Aya, which is her father
  who is a drunkard and is intending to take the stolen money to get more drinks
  haha what a stereotypical alcoholic dad, but yeah, Tamahiko left in silence
  but did come back the next day to try his luck, hopefully without the father
  lol what is the problem with dads in this series haha. Sadly, it didn't go
  that well because besides finding her in an open bath with the rest of her
  siblings haha he did pay though I gotta say haha <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Is this a problem?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, you tell me, I don't live in 1920s Japan lol. Anyways, Aya-chan
  here also took chances to bait this rich dude into teaching her brothers in
  exchange of her prized gift, thus giving her context to... yeah I hate to say
  it, be a BITCH- Okay just this once because evil people be evil, people.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like really, start being a nice person and not be your dad for once,
  girl. HAHA GOT HER <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, if you thought Tamahiko teaching kids is
  a future prospective career for him, you got another thing coming. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Another thing that is coming dinner than later though, is when the dad's back
  and Tamahiko still didn't get back his bookmark, then let the girl come find
  him at his abode, allowed her to spew all sorts of stories in her favour just
  for her own satisfaction, I guess. Well, it definitely did a number on "too
  pure pure girl" Yuzuki though (sorry for Anime "Kannagi" reference lol), with
  all this coincidence weaved into a perfect story of adultery, seems like a
  perfect way to crush this housekeeper with motivation to never trust this rich
  guy anymore. Or so it seems. Good thing is there is a thing between these two,
  and with a call from Tamako from Kobe which got her an even better life than
  his brother is living now I still don't believe she had friends now though
  lmao but still. With this call, Tamahiko was also taught of the

    >language of flowers</a
  >
  which I would equate as body expressions, as a conveyance of message without
  words. But yeah, saying this directly to Mr. Depression here won't be great
  Tamako lol, but yeah, which brings his determination to patch up (get it?)
  that bookmark in order to maybe, MAYBE, get things back to where they were. Of
  course, Yuzuki had to spot him doing it, and thus learnt to forgive him for
  not telling her the truth earlier. Tamahiko you were right though; Telling her
  earlier will cause less misunderstandings. Very, very wholesome episode which
  I'm so glad they buried the dad things real far away, and looks like next week
  his place is going to turn into a school- an employment training facility
  where he can train kids to grow up to help in your company, <em>dad</em>.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I'm helping him come up with excuses in case he needs to deal
  with his surging popularity in the next couple of months lol see you for the
  chaos then
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Please, this is not called a school nor a training facility; It's
  called a... what they call it, a "healing facility"? Haha we call that Heaven
  lmao]

  Oh yeah, we getting the Gramps loves granddaughter episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this
  new episode where you wouldn't expect Futaba's grandfather playing a big part
  of this series but he did lmao (#SenpaiGaUzai06), I am SO GLAD I watched this
  series because it makes me cringe every time I see something that I have
  personally done in real life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, more stories I can relate to, I
  guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But firstly, since dads are boring and maybe even evil lol, we
  got a cool granddad who we can look up to... maybe lol. Hey, they gotta slap
  in weird characters in every Anime series. Figured this big dude is it- Wait.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, in case you didn't notice, we have what we call an
  overprotective granddad scenario, so when it comes to the hit with what is
  supposedly a boyfriend-like co-worker which the granddaughter met at work in
  which he refers to as "wolves" lol, of course one would be worried. Well, if
  you're Futaba's granddad, it seems. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The episode is ironically filled
  with competitions in which both the grandfather AND Takeda are excelling at,
  from fishing to picking up garbage as volunteer work to peeing... (lol you
  never heard of "Pee like a Champion"? Go play The Sims 4) it seems like all
  for nothing until they both realize how much they care about Futaba-chan,
  whether it is as a family or... as prospective family haha I'm not second
  guessing there you are, but suffice it to say that it's just a showcase of the
  amount of care and concern there is for Futaba who chose to live independently
  as she grows up, as we have seen from the flashbacks. That, is probably why
  just this combination of two ripped dudes is just hilarious, and protecting
  the smallest human being in existence aged 23 now lmao happy birthday anyways
  Futaba, really makes this more of a growing journey for the granddad and for
  Takeda who witnessed Futaba's personal life of actually having that love
  shelter over her head and don't ask where the rest of the family is lol I
  don't even want to know now. This episode is just wholesome, and I intend to
  keep thinking it this way. I do not have an overprotective granddad, by the
  way, that is not part of my experience I never saw my granddad so <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
  Anyways, Gramps came down to the city to celebrate the birthday with her, but
  then noticed the same birthday co-worker exchanged presents with each other
  leaving him in the lurch, and probably fury because he didn't understand
  whatever situation they were in, and always trying to understand the kid, it
  really feels like the grandfather just keeps treating the kid as... you know,
  a kid, for better or for worse, but yeah, like they always say, "once your kid
  always a kid", so sorry, can't help you there, Futaba-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in
  all, Sakurai likes macarons memo memo lol, someone doesn't know how to drip
  her eyedrops lol same and thank goodness Takeda didn't do it like "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/49520/Aharen-san_wa_Hakarenai"
    target="_blank"
    >Aharen-san</a
  >" which we will see in two seasons lol I read the manga and it was a joke
  lmao, but as you can see even just the one scene where Futaba gets bullied,
  and that's why you have such overprotective family and senpai watching over
  her. Man, is this such a good series haha cya guys for more then please tell
  me Sakurai and Kazama were an item so we can get rid of Hijikata lol he wasn't
  even competition now compared to those two big dudes haha

  [Oh yeah cringe stuff I did for my birthday with ma bro, and I did I mentioned
  this before: He was starting to get into voice actresses back then thanks to
  me lol, I thought of showing him what photobooks are like because not many
  people buy them here already especially physical ones, and it's also I never
  will consider walking into a local Japanese bookstore (Kinokuniya btw) alone
  to get them, so I suggested since our birthdays are (sadly not the same but) a
  month apart, we should exchange photobooks as birthday presents. He got Uesaka
  Sumire's photobook which is not the one I reviewed (we got those separately
  way later lmao) and he gave me Kouno Marika's photobook. I've seen the former
  so at that point I know mine was better so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

  isn't too bad it's a simple song about coming together regardless of where we
  are, it's kinda ska heavy just like the many ones they did after they left

  P.P.S. Can you even understand how I can be not jacking off to pornography
  because I rather play with a 3D character model simulator right now and DOAXVV
  is the best game to scratch that itch I need to find back that Miconisomi
  porno game which has an awesome character customizer the new game
  development's blog is only making me hornier even thought I can't touch them
  but VV is the opposite- I better stop lmao
