I can't express how much I want to be with you, as you have only been more attractive to me from your looks to your personality as you grow up, and trust me, I would love to marry you in that wedding dress you wore recently.<div><br></div><div>Haha okay confession's over, let's talk about stuff this week! I'm tired on a Sunday because anxiety got to me when I saw whatever WhatsApp thing going on last night ugh, but hey, at least that is resolved for now. FOR NOW. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, think of Ibuki-chan then, me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> SHE is the kind of people I'll never want to have s*x with, but would love to make out for like, eternity. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know, that's like, for everyone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not Nan-chan though, some are meant to be <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> and receive head pats forever haha</div><div><br></div><div>Now I think we can start we probably hit the intro limit on each post if you saw on the home page of this blog. I'll be surprised if anyone saw it or even not because they subscribed to this blog's... feed haha it's 2021 man who still uses feeds (it's there by the way if you need it lol)<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KomiSan06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Komi-san wa, Komyushou Desu.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I learnt from television that comedy in communication is important" Oh yeah, Komi-san? Oh right, that's a comedy show she's watching lmao</div></blockquote>WHAT?? IS THAT A 3D CLASSROOM?? Hey, say Anime hasn't gotten better since when you started watching it. For me, 13 years and counting. *FeelsOldMan* Anyways, new episode (#KomiSan06), Komi-san's making jokes here and boy did this just remind me specifically of Anime "Hatsukoi Limited." episode three where I experienced the same fate. Dear author, you didn't happen to...? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, we got lots more to talk about this week, surprise surprise, with relation to communication with others, so let's get to it! Firstly, someone turned Komi-san into a part-time comedian lol. I say part-time because she can't even speak so how can one make jokes with just in writing... *looks at this text* I also wonder haha but yeah, most of us will think like Najimi and wonder if they are the next target for some puzzle-solving mystery lmao. Then, probably best part of this episode just because it became a competition, it's going shopping. Going shopping is fine for Komi-san because she doesn't lol and it's also fine for everyone else without Komi-san because they have never done it before they only simp on her every day haha, so yeah it's no wonder it literally became a magnet for discussion once Najimi brought it up. Yep, even Yamai-san wants in on the fun even if she is not invited. I mean, coincidences, amirite? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, since Komi-san is a n00b at shopping for... I assume anything for herself since just like me my mom takes care of my casual wear lol hey it's a thing guys but I do buy them myself now... online so I don't know why Komi-san hasn't done that yet- Oh, no phone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, sorry Komi-san for bombing you again, so let's bomb the others instead and let them choose clothes for you to wear considering two are females, one is unknown and the other's a dude. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I have a feeling this will go well lol thanks Najimi for the China outfit though that's just fanservice anyways. But yeah, of course Tadano wins this competition because he's the only one who didn't screw around (Najimi's 2nd choice wasn't too bad) and did bring out her purity in silence with a one-piece white dress unlike the others haha. But you know, the dress isn't anything if it's bought and not worn, so we shall see that real soon. Next up, the haircut scene. Really feeling bad for another victim of Komi-san but this time around, it's the newbie at the salon Arai-san (voiced by, and I got tipped earlier this week since I follow her on Twitter, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/43303/Rika_Nagae target=_blank>Nagae Rika</a>) (very, very cute hehe oh name as in "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/arai target=_blank>washing</a>") who can't pick a hint at silent Komi-san and lets senpai and hair stylist Karisu Maki (God, this is such a pun I can't even) (Can be read as "charisma" so charismatic and "maki" which is curl as in hair) who likely cuts her hair as a regular and knows what she wants likely dictated by her mom when she was 12. So yeah, go figure. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, Arai-san's impressions of Komi-san isn't wrong: not talking especially when you can is pure disrespect even if it means you're bad at communication. It's like talking to a wall, especially when you are human and you're not deaf lol. Oh well, what do I know about Komi-san anyways. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And I thought it's a joke where Komi-san never greets anyone back in class every morning, when it's literally no one but Tadano noticed her hair change. As expected of my boy, amirite??? Haha Komi-san I dare you to talk back to me, I dare you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And it hasn't ended yet, because we got exams coming up. Najimi may not suck at tests actually they did better than Makeru-chan over there who can barely hold against Komi-san's god-like results lol, but yeah I guess like the typical student no one wants to stick through doing revision alone, so the guys go to the library to study. Well, I don't think Najimi is doing it and that "gorilla" library attendant of a student did send them out after a while so... hey, still better than Makeru-chan though- I really wonder how she studies lol and imagine if she gets to study with Komi-san if she admits defeat. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Oh welp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, now that exams are over that's fast lol, it's the summer holidays now. That is fast, and as Komi-san and possibly the others see the time pass by, you would wonder why she isn't hanging out with her newly-made friends in high school, isn't it. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Thanks Najimi-san for initiating the invite because I feel you Tadano-kun it's <em>impossible</em> to invite any of the others as a dude I get it and who wants that ninja in on this anyways lmao, but yeah, Komi-san had to reply a "yes" to that phone call from the <strike>childhood</strike> friend so yay, I guess we're going out after all. AND WE'RE DONE CYA NEXT WEEK haha I F**KING KNEW IT <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, looks like our beach episode is next week so that's something to hype about sooner than later hehe see you all then</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqbMOqiYYFVop1shFRv0O3qVWSWKQs3bo80omuX9jshiI-q6os9hO36bY5Pnod6XoME9Zchp-0gHVqNMsxbkotj9DmdwwJ9QxLuVhwQI_LXcTrsEoqwJVhees5Zka9ngVXAib6KW1k5TG9lqYWZizS0XLQvUmk0oY9Eutz1SwWG_cCSw/s320/komisan06_idea.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Trust me, when I have an idea it's different from when Komi-san has an idea haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggKlnTC-RMvDY7psitdMe3VRZuIc9FEYvh9WpurlmZBbX7_KArJgTwxrPobs-3EHSNZeASkNSvO5UWGUVlWnUng_LyEz3P3hManGBCLCRqq0eezy44fLzJFrxqHiumM4RAr94IqS4IzsWPOqb_wA4L0qxOLJxcQTlRHkSP8rQkMtSYBg/s320/komisan06_judges1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I recommend Instagram girls <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CWAuqSUPRKk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target=_blank>like this one</a> to ma bros lol<br>(She may not be perfect to others but she is to me)</table></div></div>P.S.

And what an emotional episode once again, man, this series making grounds I can't even. Let's talk about it. Last time some thief dropped by rich guy's house to steal his wallet which coincidentally contains a birthday present to him by the future wife, so yeah, that's gotta get someone worried. What does get him more worried though, is him having to deal with the confrontation of getting it back. You know, other than him being the rich dude in the village who everyone knows about, he also didn't think of dealing with not Aya, which is her father who is a drunkard and is intending to take the stolen money to get more drinks haha what a stereotypical alcoholic dad, but yeah, Tamahiko left in silence but did come back the next day to try his luck, hopefully without the father lol what is the problem with dads in this series haha. Sadly, it didn't go that well because besides finding her in an open bath with the rest of her siblings haha he did pay though I gotta say haha <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Is this a problem? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, you tell me, I don't live in 1920s Japan lol. Anyways, Aya-chan here also took chances to bait this rich dude into teaching her brothers in exchange of her prized gift, thus giving her context to... yeah I hate to say it, be a BITCH- Okay just this once because evil people be evil, people. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like really, start being a nice person and not be your dad for once, girl. HAHA GOT HER <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, if you thought Tamahiko teaching kids is a future prospective career for him, you got another thing coming. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Another thing that is coming dinner than later though, is when the dad's back and Tamahiko still didn't get back his bookmark, then let the girl come find him at his abode, allowed her to spew all sorts of stories in her favour just for her own satisfaction, I guess. Well, it definitely did a number on "too pure pure girl" Yuzuki though (sorry for Anime "Kannagi" reference lol), with all this coincidence weaved into a perfect story of adultery, seems like a perfect way to crush this housekeeper with motivation to never trust this rich guy anymore. Or so it seems. Good thing is there is a thing between these two, and with a call from Tamako from Kobe which got her an even better life than his brother is living now I still don't believe she had friends now though lmao but still. With this call, Tamahiko was also taught of the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hanakotoba target=_blank>language of flowers</a> which I would equate as body expressions, as a conveyance of message without words. But yeah, saying this directly to Mr. Depression here won't be great Tamako lol, but yeah, which brings his determination to patch up (get it?) that bookmark in order to maybe, MAYBE, get things back to where they were. Of course, Yuzuki had to spot him doing it, and thus learnt to forgive him for not telling her the truth earlier. Tamahiko you were right though; Telling her earlier will cause less misunderstandings. Very, very wholesome episode which I'm so glad they buried the dad things real far away, and looks like next week his place is going to turn into a school- an employment training facility where he can train kids to grow up to help in your company, <em>dad</em>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, I'm helping him come up with excuses in case he needs to deal with his surging popularity in the next couple of months lol see you for the chaos then</div><div>[TL:DR; Please, this is not called a school nor a training facility; It's called a... what they call it, a "healing facility"?

Hey, they gotta slap in weird characters in every Anime series. Figured this big dude is it- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, in case you didn't notice, we have what we call an overprotective granddad scenario, so when it comes to the hit with what is supposedly a boyfriend-like co-worker which the granddaughter met at work in which he refers to as "wolves" lol, of course one would be worried. Well, if you're Futaba's granddad, it seems. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The episode is ironically filled with competitions in which both the grandfather AND Takeda are excelling at, from fishing to picking up garbage as volunteer work to peeing... (lol you never heard of "Pee like a Champion"? Go play The Sims 4) it seems like all for nothing until they both realize how much they care about Futaba-chan, whether it is as a family or... as prospective family haha I'm not second guessing there you are, but suffice it to say that it's just a showcase of the amount of care and concern there is for Futaba who chose to live independently as she grows up, as we have seen from the flashbacks. That, is probably why just this combination of two ripped dudes is just hilarious, and protecting the smallest human being in existence aged 23 now lmao happy birthday anyways Futaba, really makes this more of a growing journey for the granddad and for Takeda who witnessed Futaba's personal life of actually having that love shelter over her head and don't ask where the rest of the family is lol I don't even want to know now. This episode is just wholesome, and I intend to keep thinking it this way. I do not have an overprotective granddad, by the way, that is not part of my experience I never saw my granddad so <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Anyways, Gramps came down to the city to celebrate the birthday with her, but then noticed the same birthday co-worker exchanged presents with each other leaving him in the lurch, and probably fury because he didn't understand whatever situation they were in, and always trying to understand the kid, it really feels like the grandfather just keeps treating the kid as... you know, a kid, for better or for worse, but yeah, like they always say, "once your kid always a kid", so sorry, can't help you there, Futaba-chan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, Sakurai likes macarons memo memo lol, someone doesn't know how to drip her eyedrops lol same and thank goodness Takeda didn't do it like "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/49520/Aharen-san_wa_Hakarenai target=_blank>Aharen-san</a>" which we will see in two seasons lol I read the manga and it was a joke lmao, but as you can see even just the one scene where Futaba gets bullied, and that's why you have such overprotective family and senpai watching over her. Man, is this such a good series haha cya guys for more then please tell me Sakurai and Kazama were an item so we can get rid of Hijikata lol he wasn't even competition now compared to those two big dudes haha</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBG7cQgTXwkac4q1C4NvOtMcPhkYI5AcYZ9gebf5cc30y9j7c8GIQXxnxrP_VKzSM80DU2rRVM7Cesd5V48iHPvZn28mGiP_vK-Q1fbE8Fu6piIoeAHmw6u265_ABMeCR6aEZoREtsfo3b84bKbwPBbad_wAI4WHPIHfhp2ElfyD6fzQ/s320/senpaigauzai06_family.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>FAMILY THEN<br>(Aww...)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimsroCH40Qy8hbaD9UxRY8TG60vj5F-Ua4y5Xu64cWcRLu0fv4b96OlSyKScxEv6_qjnbfCpX882VdCOIawJDLby6UqXAhyXhKl1ooV1WCGz1maGCoHKk1hdxDanhI_0rqwsI4bN1XULCsSx0seGu6CvEsuXDxGW-uQo8p7Z28f1eD4A/s320/senpaigauzai06_granddad6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>FAMILY NOW<br>(<span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>)<br>(lol the guy to the left)</table></div></div>P.S.

He got Uesaka Sumire's photobook which is not the one I reviewed (we got those separately way later lmao) and he gave me Kouno Marika's photobook.
