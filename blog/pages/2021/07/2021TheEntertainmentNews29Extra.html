Haha hey this is literally the only thing I hype for right now apart from packages so let me have it okay?<div><br></div><div>So, I'm here because I don't have to work (yay) but also to do some conclusion on whether to give all of these below or otherwise. Definitely giving "Shinigami Bocchan" at this point to be frank, and "TanMoshi"... let's just say if I get bored maybe I shouldn't be watching up to four shows this season. And yeah, this is not even counting on "Sonny Boy" which kinda blew my mind yesterday and... I don't even know if it's worth giving. Maybe fear of original series being bad is a problem? Man a decade ago I was trying things out left and right.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe I'm getting old lol okay enough about me let's talk about a detective who is but a sidekick and a young master who can't touch living things haha BURNNNNNN</div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TanMoshi03><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"It's true that the saliva of the world's cutest idol is smeared all over my hands now, but it's not like I'm going to enjoy it later with a cotton swab or something" Haha what AND he puts his hands back in his pockets? I see that's for later lmao</div></blockquote>How many times <strike>Kimitsuka</strike> Kimizuka (oops) gotta explain to people that he's not a famous detective? But she is, that girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where Siesta's... consciousness lives on I guess (#TanMoshi03), man you bet I am thinking about how much of a pill I need to swallow for this series, ironically even more than "Sonny Boy". It's like making fun of the dead. Worst thing is, we still haven't seen how she died- Okay story. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Someone dropped by as in a new character did, introduced herself as Saikawa Yui, local idol who we can just imagine is super famous at least within this Anime world- IS THAT HOLOLIVE VTUBERS PROMOTING HER LIVE??? Okay I'm out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, I'm not going to dabble on the changes of Siesta's heart on Nagisa just because we will get to that at some point and will talk about that later, but let's talk about Yui-nya? Haha I'm becoming a fan too lol <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/39009/Kanon_Takao target=_blank>this newbie voice actress</a> is going to get some unexpected popularity because of this series now. And because Yui here accidentally jumped on Kimizuka thinking he's the detective again lol why, but we did just went through the "Siesta's heart is in me now" thing so yeah, gotta conclude that first I guess. Next morning, Yui discusses about a couple of things which will of course at this point, only make Kimizuka suspicious just because he did inherit some analysis and thought from the master herself. So firstly, the threat. I know it's dumb to imagine even if it's just Yui-nya here (ugh) (haha) making this letter up I mean we can scan for fingerprints if you want, but yeah, the police don't buy it, so she went for these two I guess to see if they can prevent the family heirloom from being stolen in certainty. You know, because there won't be any human security and the security system in place within the big mansion might not be enough to prevent this- Wouldn't it though? Press X to doubt haha. Anyways, that's the first thing, which will bring us to the next part: Yui talking about her competition. Seeing that she is the head of the household now that her parents have passed away (RIP), and this idol thing is literally her job now, it will be no wonder why she hasn't got rid of those VTubers who might be getting in her way of her idol career to make sure all competition is eliminated- Maybe they got bought in with money already haha they be promoting her live isn't it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, showing the difference of logic and analysis of Kimizuka, wait for it, in comparison to Nagisa. So far this girl has only shown much emotion like a normal <a href=https://jisho.org/search/JK target=_blank>JK</a> due to her past and compassion because she be nice girl who lets people fondle her chest and see her in a swimsuit lol Ayachi why (haha okay me), but let's just say that also means the dude has seen through Yui and her tactics thinking that she might have lied about the attempt to steal the family heirloom, probably to distract them from something else or whatever I don't know but unlikely, but you know, that room with treasures sure is a good place to suddenly trigger a security lockdown, if any. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... I still see no reason why I can't give this series. It has jokes to laugh at, the theme songs are fine, it has decent animation... yes we're talking about plot and worldview. My biggest concern is again, as I have mentioned before, seeing Siesta's foretelling being so good, it hinders the inference process typically done by the audience. But this time around, Kimizuka is the one doing it. He's not as good as Siesta, but also means that he doesn't do the reveal as fast or is as invulnerable as her, which makes this more exciting of a mystery series to be honest because we can do some second-guessing first and/or see him screw up once in a while. Imagine if there's always a fall back like Siesta to solve every crime; Every crime will be solved and there will be no exceptions. Which is why the lack of this is why I can still see myself giving it, just like how Kimizuka can see a little of Siesta inside Nagisa here to think she's the real thing. So yeah, we might finish this off considering this is a one-cour series, and hopefully we'll not get to the point where I have to cry over the reasons of a specific someone's death. Ironically, not shot on the heart would be one of those reasons or else the story would've ended lol or maybe brain transplant would've been better? Haha cya guys for this again I guess</div><div>[TL:DR; "Where is all (Nagisa's) confidence coming from?" Haha I know right]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MI3flwKF51Q/YPUKMhG8_zI/AAAAAAABGo8/omik1XBpRB8O6fNc7akj8LVQw5eDyDmpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tanmoshi03_vtubers2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't mean to know such "obscure references" but from left to right is <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdn5BQ06XqgXoAxIhbqw5Rg target=_blank>Shirakami Fubuki</a>, Saikawa Yui (lol) and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ0UDLQCjY0rmuxCDE38FGg target=_blank>Natsuiro Matsuri</a> with the other two as IRL virtual YouTubers</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3mtGCAO8wz4/YPUKNV7A3LI/AAAAAAABGpA/Q37bV1iLJRY9Rimdp_gjsrIJeYF7-BnVQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tanmoshi03_table.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Safe distancing measures at its finest I guess must be that idol having a disease we call <a href=https://jisho.org/search/moe target=_blank>moe</a> lol</table></div></div>P.S. "Are you saying this whole nation is hopelessly corrupt from bottom to top?" Yes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> </div><div>P.P.S. "I wanted to put in running shoes and sprint around a track" Well, that's everyone's wish as a kid until you grow up and be an adult and realize you don't like that anymore and would rather stay at home and watch YouTube lol well stereotype talk right here folks</div><div>[I really am filled with regret for even giving this series in the first place especially that one-hour long first episode. Do I have to live on with this just considering Nagisa-chan here? I may have to lol give me bikini next week or I quit lmao]</div><div><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=ShinigamiBocchan03><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"The loser has to do whatever the winner asks" Okay I see a trap in this rule but who cares amirite we always come up tops haha (get it, trap)</div></blockquote>Wow this is actually quite an episode which will solidify itself in terms of perspective at least, as an imperfect love story. So, in this new episode where now you can hear the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCIBb0ROXAo" target=_blank>opening</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql6ouR2NqN0" target=_blank>ending</a> theme songs in full on YouTube by the way (#ShinigamiBocchan03), we have quite a conclusion to whatever is between these two to be honest because there's one thing good about your mother abandoning you alone in a big mansion is that you can flirt with the maid as much as you want and not get scolded for it. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Okay, story. Oh yeah, we started with Bocchan playing snooker or pool depending on where you come from, and you know, what's a little fun if you don't play with others, so Alice offers to play with a rule that the loser does whatever the winner wants. You know, Bocchan will probably ask Alice to strip so that's not much fun lmao we will see that later anyways lol, but yeah just flashing herself will already make Bocchan lose at his feet so guess who's going to the town with Alice haha. But yeah, we'll take this as a date, whatever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In order to prevent a death in this episode specifically can't say for any other episode or non-human related deaths haha, but yeah, he gotta walk in town which is having a festival right now in a steel cage so he looks like what's that The Crow thing reference which I should be talking about right now? Haha I don't know you tell me. Really could've made it lighter but maybe the heavier burden would be good on wary for Bocchan himself so in case he gets carried away by the crowd at least he won't suddenly kill someone- Okay I should stop with the death jokes lol. So, two things that happened in general on day time. Firstly, someone who recognized Alice's mother saw her in town and mistook her as the mom, but did not offer to talk more and left. That would likely be a drop at some point but we shall ignore that first I guess who knows what stories Alice has to tell, but yeah, Bocchan got lost and is with a lost kid so yeah who's the lost one now lol. He decides to play the piano at the town square to calm the boy down and it did work, probably also attracting everyone to the square which should include the kid's mother and Alice so win-win I guess the town gets to enjoy some great music while he's at it. (Also, great assessment on your future prospects bro you are leaving the house to a stable life with reliable income real soon haha) As the night sets in, the couple (I mean, they are) talk about the moon and the story of a princess losing her beloved to a witch who sent him to the moon... why are witches all so bad they should be called b*tches- ANYWAYS haha, if we have to compare who's the sadder case, I must say Alice is right these two are closer than those two with one of them on the moon and space travel not even a thing yet I don't even think planes are a thing even lol so yeah, they win. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still sad though, gotta say. Next up, a night at Alice's room. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Not gonna comment on why she sleeps like, in a shed away from the mansion or something lol, but yeah that is truly the place where she can be free... of clothing apparently lol hey the Bocchan is onto it I guess HAHAHAHA <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span> She puts up some scented candles, gives him some camomile tea which I must say does not work on me to help me sleep because I probably have bigger problems on me lol (So wait, why are you drinking so fast bro? Haha), and lets him sleep on her bed... alone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What? The bed ain't big enough bro not when Alice is this thicc <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> TWO Cs BRO, TWO Cs!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, show's over haha but not the show we get to see in the end so last but not least, Bocchan asks Alice out for some meteor shower sights. Quoting from his sad past again <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> he saw this fabulous spot for shooting stars and knows it appears every once in a decade so let's assume Bocchan is around 15 now haha, but yeah as you can guess instead of actually looking at the stars and wishing that his curse could be removed (ah hey, not my fault), they got themselves wet (lol), and we almost got Alice dead. So yeah, they both know how to swim right? Or is the lake shallow enough to stand on? Either ways, no one died so we get to see more antics another day lol, and I guess Bocchan didn't get to confess his true feelings with a good atmosphere. So yeah Alice, see you in ten years I guess lmao oh well he briefly said it anyways lol. Hey we know, we get the idea. It's all good. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> All in all, lovely episode, I'm digging this slice-of-life thing until we have to deal with people confronting Bocchan or something at some point, but we may not have far to go so besides doing all this Honeymoon stuff haha, we might see more characters coming in to... hopefully help Bocchan out, I would believe. Cya guys next week... end haha this is the problem I gotta wait this long every week I can't even</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2ThH57vGQ4c/YPULGvs_deI/AAAAAAABGpI/hP35Fm7uuS4jdeb5HUqJA4hx11oFB-vgACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan03_inside1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This looks like business as usual until...</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOenM8EKbFM/YPULHjaXXcI/AAAAAAABGpM/4sRJ1omNe5wnNUOyo9N0G0dKVkTRqXZDgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan03_inside2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>...you see what is outside the box, in public<br>(haha)</table></div></div>P.S.
