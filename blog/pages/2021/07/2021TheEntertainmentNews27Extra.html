What is this I see AN ANIME EXTRA?? WHAT YEAR IS THIS??? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br /><br />Okay,
I did mention on Sunday anyways, so if you didn't read that, idiot (haha), then
you would've expected this the least. Suffice it to say I'm NOT going to do this
every week from here on until the season ends, but just because I can't stand
seeing those Anime previews and recommended videos on YouTube I'm doing this
earlier, just the first episodes of two series that will be airing on Sunday
nights from here on.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah, let's see if they were worth doing this one post on a Tuesday haha
  thank goodness for work from home amirite?? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span><br />

  </blockquote>
  Normally people ask for help from doctors on planes but this one asks for a
  detective. You better have a good reason for this or I'm out. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In
  this... mystery of a mystery of series I guess (#TanMoshi01), if your life is
  as messed up as this dude you can live in an Anime universe too lol. No
  really, you should go see the doctor. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, before you do that, we can talk
  about this one-hour special which I totally forgot about its length and thank
  goodness I didn't choose to watch this yesterday haha. So, we start at the
  plane, as you have seen in trailers probably, of a flight attendant asking for
  a detective. Apparently it's because someone at the cockpit which is not the
  pilot, asking for one. Yeah, it's a hijack, in case you wonder.
  Whatever genius detective Siesta volunteered for the task and pulled Kimi...
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kimi" target="_blank">Kimi</a>. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> She pulled this not random guy out of his seat to negotiate with a... partial
  android? Yeah, that is seriously a lot to absorb even just 10 minutes into the
  story, and I mean if you enjoyed the action scene good for you, but as you may
  have noticed this Kimi guy is not pleased. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> As much as the hijacker is
  also not pleased of a detective immediately being able to bust in and solve
  his mystery, as we go on forward we see even more of an Anime reality where
  Siesta might be like James Bond level with power up her a** and weapons to
  bewilder. Well in a world of androids and secret black organizations to take
  down, what else is new? Probably the "assistant" that Siesta has been
  desperately (maybe) trying to recruit, and even then you should've thought of
  why such a perfect... investigator would need anyone as her assistant. Right?
  Maybe as bait? Or human shield? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But as we can see, it's not the case
  as she gets more pushy than ever, doing very weird things only a stalker would
  do to this dude's place. Bear in mind that is literally the only thing funny
  about the series, as Siesta <strike>tries to</strike> solves Kimi's problems
  about his school in order to probably convince him to travel the world with
  her as an assistant as she has always desired. And I say that as an
  underestimation did you even think how he can be suddenly kidnapped and told
  to ship a briefcase onto a plane so that the gun inside could be used to take
  down a partial android on board?? Yeah, think about it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So part two
  of the hour long episode, we go to the school festival in which that dude has
  no idea recalling because he lives a screwed up high school life and has no
  idea of what happened to school- Dude do you even go to school? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And
  you say you life's lonely and full of trouble. Okay maybe that's why but
  that's not the point! Point is that- Okay who gives a shit about that Hanako
  story
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/39534/Jibaku_Shounen_Hanako-kun" target="_blank">I already watched one Anime based on that</a>
  and I hated it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, didn't know they can do secret groups inside
  of the school which is DRUG SMUGGLING??? What world are we even in right
  now lol which will bring us to this series' main point: Why this dude will
  become the assistant of a... whatever genius detective in the first place. So
  easy point because I'm not Siesta who will explain stories to you later haha
  got her, I guess he rather live a life of danger in which she has mentioned
  she will cover that part since he's the trouble magnet, than you know, live a
  life like mine which is probably why I haven't gotten laid in the first place
  maybe I should get into more trouble so some cute girl will come and find me
  to be my bodyguard- I rather she be my girlfriend. Haha negotiations are over, girl.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, I find many problems with this series which will make me
  lose interest over time, to be honest. It reminds me of "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/39017/Kyokou_Suiri" target="_blank">Kyoko Suiri</a>" which I
  watched a year ago where romance is their pitch over spiritual mysteries. This
  has the same feel, but the main girl or detective shows no challenge whatever,
  the main guy is even more boring, and romance is mellow at best. It's great if I'm
  sitting down in my bathtub with lukewarm water <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, but just in this case I
  don't have a bathtub at home and yes, this series also doesn't have much of a
  base that will drag me in at all. And that is just pitiful in my opinion. If
  the author knows everything but lacks in making it more dramatic, I would say
  it doesn't make of a strong mystery series. Well, that is, in my dumb
  <strike>Kimishita</strike> Kimizuka level opinion of course haha. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>
  Okay, you know what? I might give this the three episode rule, even though
  this is more than one episode's worth already in Anime rules lol. I don't
  think it'll live up to the hype I think I want, but I think I can live with
  the idea of Siesta being smarter as she is from the beginning of knowing any
  incident, like you know, being a Ranpo-san or something. We shall see if this
  holds up especially, next up, we talk about the recollection. Yeah, "the detective is already dead", bro. (title drop) This storytelling is in another
  world, man, I don't even know. Well, you'll know if I'll watch this next
  week...end if it helps haha Siesta no second-guessing me please (unless you do
  cat maid girl outfit hahahahahahaha)
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Okay "I'll protect you" and "I'll be your girlfriend" is such a thin
  line away so why didn't he demand the latter? I'll do it I want to get laid
  before I die to say the least haha]

  </blockquote>
  Okay serious talk though? FUCK YOU MOM- Heck, why are mothers all so bad
  nowadays? Where were those mothers who will poke into your relationship
  affairs or something? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this episode of a new series which got me up
  as much as that maid got her death god-like master every other time
  (#ShinigamiBocchan01), I think I'm loving this series as much as I'm also
  saddened by the story behind it, and I think that makes a good premise for
  this series, which is why I can see this is actually good. So firstly, back story.
  Bocchan here, as we will call him from here on, is a young master or duke of a
  prestigious family I would assume what looks like in the 20th century and of
  course, where witches exist so this is not real life already btw, he's uh,
  cursed to never touch anything living or else it dies. Man, that's kinda sad.
  Thus, the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bocchan" target="_blank">bocchan</a>" name.
  Yeah, he's kind of like the Death Note but as a human lol. Living inside this
  big mansion, he stays alone with the only maid who will serve him (for now)
  Alice, daughter of head maid at the family mansion until two years ago, she
  decided to come here to serve this cute lad haha. Hey, don't ask me what
  reason will that be, but it's a sweet love story I can get behind if there is
  one. We'll leave the butler for some other way because he's down and I'm not
  lol, it's hardly surprising to see why then for Alice,
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san" target="_blank">she likes to tease him</a>
  as much as she can while she's at it, and yeah you bet this is half the reason
  I'm watching this series lmao. With this curse though, it has brought more
  than the definition of him as basically a monster who can kill anything living
  in seconds, as evidenced by him touching a tree which is not directly
  connected to the swing he was on. As <strike>one of</strike> his childhood friend visits him in
  the mansion-&nbsp;WAIT YOU HAVE A CHILDHOOD FRIEND?? *<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/43007/Osananajimi_ga_Zettai_ni_Makenai_Love_Comedy" target="_blank">gets serious deja vu</a>*
  Haha okay other Anime jokes aside, introducing childhood friend Philips which,
  ironically were only friends when they were kids so before 5 years old which I
  guess not many will remember that anyways, dropped by to say hello. For the
  first time. Ever since the mother threw him in this one mansion to live with
  the one butler for many years. Long before Alice dropped by. See where this is
  going already? If you thought this meeting will end well don't fret, as
  Philips is so far still the nicest outsider so far though being instructed by
  the mother to come to check on him, is also warning him on the world outside:
  The family is ready to do the inheritance thing on the nobility of a family, and
  he's... not in line for it. I mean, you know why. He's no
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji" target="_blank">Ciel Phantomhive</a>&nbsp;who can exact revenge, that's why. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay jokes aside, but yeah seeing as the actual family
  eating on the table and not even a little worried about the son, really makes
  you wonder who's the evil one here in the first place, over the
  witch lol. Yeah, it depended on which parent was faster on the trigger to kick him out isn't
  it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh poor Bocchan, you don't even have a great name to remember by
  (You see, most main characters do not have actual names...) I can't even.
  <span title="*sob*">😢</span> So as you can see, this series has a lot of backstory we can jump in on
  for the next couple of episodes even, and I think I'm actually liking it a
  lot. For starters, I like the crudeness of the series. Did you watch the
  opening animation and think why the chest close-up coincides with the two
  character voices singing "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/mune" target="_blank">mune</a>"?? Haha think about it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes, I means crudeness is all it's positivity, by the way. Next up, the lore. The nobility family is a
  thing, Bocchan here might be losing his status as a noble real quick (maybe he can do part time funeral services and make sure those who faked deaths be dead? lmao) considering why the parents didn't do that to a five year old back then lol
  I'm calling social services haha, but also, the witch's curse is also a thing.
  Yes, in case you haven't watched enough fantasy stuff before, with every curse
  comes a cure. So yeah, it's sex right? Sex with a woman? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So as you
  can see, this has made many take sides as to whether even this Bocchan should
  be allowed to live even as a cursed person. And this drama, I am in
  for. And last but not least, the teasing and fanservice despite... yes if you
  have noticed, the 3DCG which I have safely avoided ever since I saw it first
  on a series called "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35557/Houseki_no_Kuni_TV" target="_blank">Houseki no Kuni</a>". But this time around, it has gotten better to say the least, there aren't crazy action scenes so I don't have to worry about fast moving c*appy motions,
  and I wished this was 2D drawing and animation so I can actually salivate at Alice's- Okay
  I'll stop haha. So next up, we have a cat in the story- It's dead already,
  right? Haha cya guys next time oh and I'm not going to apologize for all the
  death jokes I'm going to make for this series, just so you know. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>

  <br />So yeah, pretty much it, this is all. I see my new package arriving so
  hopefully we'll see that within the week or if not it's fine too, and yes from
  here on I will probably be watching only on Sunday mornings even if they air
  on Sunday nights. Yeah. No really, not going to burn my already little energy
  I have for Anime haha I know people do that for drama binging but I don't.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Until next time guys.
