Really should've watched that Seitokai Yakuindomo movie this week, huh. Well, I
didn't really expect myself to watch those two shows earlier this week but hey if you
missed that once in a blue moon Anime Extra please do read those because I will likely be
giving them too.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  But it's okay, I can spend some time outdoors... in shopping malls for the
  most part haha hey I gotta stock up on snacks or supper and stuff. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, my life is boring, my left
  side is still partially disabled but as much as it's not affecting my work, I
  better go see the doctor at some point- I should stop talking about health
  issues here lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  On not life things, hey I picked up that "IDOLY PRIDE" mobile game recently,
  having managed to grind through and be stuck on beginner's missions just
  because I didn't start end of last month, and will expire today. Which probably also means I should
  stop playing a couple of those games I feel like an obligation to play at this
  point- Where's that Android 12 upgrade on my old phone so that I can stop
  playing Kirara Fantasia? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay, let's get to more polygamy!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, you heard of songs in
  polygamy? Yeah I don't just listen to the one song every day unlike most people, trust me. That's
  how Klassic Note started hehe well anyways

      "... (Naoya) really cherishes me. OR SO I THOUGHT!!" Haha Saki-chan I get
      it lol
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Yeah Saki-chan, Minase won't even mind if it's a... I can't say that word anymore I
  think I may have to delete that post from last week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new
  episode where we picked up where we left off which is the basis of this series
  by the way (#KanoKano02), we learn that Nagisa or Minase here maybe I should
  call her Nagisa haha, is a b*tch. Well, according to Saki-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Okay
  I gotta sort this out: Should I continue down the path and Inorin this by
  saying
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase" target="_blank">Minase</a>&nbsp;who has nothing to do with this series, or use Nagisa??) (Audience:
  "How about both?") (Shut up haha I'm going with the latter) So, story. As we, or actually Saki-chan continues to ponder about this situation she is in now
  since she didn't choose to get out of it somehow, we talk about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> stuff. You
  know, what else you gonna talk about in this romance comedy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay
  specifically though, on how interestingly, unlike most stories, these two
  girls are horny. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, something's wrong here so let me clarify. As
  mentioned last week, I did say that Nagisa here is going to be just
  conciliatory about everything because she loves Naoya, and will do nothing to
  stop getting to him as we will learn later, even over her studies which
  effectively is one's future at stake. Well, romance is also part of your
  future I mean I have a job but no girlfriend so go figure. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Anyways,
  after a great bath session last week which discussed that word I can't say ever again
  just because it starts with "three" and ends with "some" lmao, the trio sleep
  together- Please, this is called bonding, understand? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on,
  yeah Saki-chan thought it'll be a great idea to not sleep in the middle and just leave those two alone so
  they can actually get laid at some point (Think about it though: Did Nagisa
  here not enjoy being with her confessed within 24 hours? Haha wtf I wished I
  had that kind of life lol I mean, even if you got successful this wouldn't
  happen that quick... right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey I never experienced it in The Sims you tell me
  haha) which of course they don't because I don't think any of them were that
  desperate besides holding hands at this point- Remember, these two girls are
  effectively at the same starting line with respect to going out with Naoya.
  Saki-chan is thinking all the wrong things because she is back facing the two pretending to sleep (lol is that me), and is just going mad at her own thoughts, which brings us to the
  next thing: what she is doing in private. Thanks to Nagisa boldly looking
  through her rival's phone instead of her boy's first... oh well on the surface
  it looks like Saki-chan is obviously trying some advances on his boy to you
  know, actually take things a step further even without Nagisa because she did
  get egged by friends to advance her own relationships, so yeah, turns out
  letting Nagisa think that she is also a pervert- Yeah, who's the b*tch now,
  SakiSaki- Even your name sounds like hentai. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;I guess you two are
  similar in that sense haha also only horny girls will get attracted to Anime
  guys amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Coming back haha, Nagisa then also found out what we have
  heard from Saki-chan's monologues so far which you know, maybe it'll help down
  the line but then she got found out by Naoya so welp. Haha thank goodness
  Saki-chan saw it but went back to sleep to forget about it like a dream, and
  man did she really forget lol hey thanks Anime I'm sure Saki-chan won't get
  jealous in the long run considering she has a memory of a goldfish. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Moving on, is what Nagisa paid for in exchange for such a perfect confession
  result: her studies. Turns out, she has been missing school probably after
  spotting the hottest guy in class lol you should've spent more time looking around, girl (well that's me too in middle school so go figure), and spending A LOT of
  time perfecting her feminine skills... that sounds feminist but you get the
  idea lol yeah she is coincidentally bad at studies also so the author is- Anyways, Nagisa is bad at math at this point but who knows what else
  she is so bad she might only be good at
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/physical%20education" target="_blank">PE</a>&nbsp;just like her voice actress is but (lmao
  <a href="../../2021/03/the-eleventh-book-vs-twelfth-book-worth.html">photobook reference</a>
  and that is Q9 on the Q&amp;A haha) Nagisa REALLY tried to make sure she looks
  good in front of Naoya by... taking long toilet breaks so that she can search
  online for the solution like how we watch YouTube videos to get trigonometry NOT, and of course still failed lol. Hey turns out, education is not just a Goegle search away. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Not typo) Naoya
  probably isn't top student but guess who's ranked from the bottom up. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Last but not least, public exposure. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay hear me out, as in the
  two-timing thing, because Naoya COULD NOT SHUT HIS- Thanks Saki-chan for
  beating him into a pulp because of that haha. I mean, it's going to be hard to
  explain the two-timing in general anyways. You know, because common sense.
  Also, we have to wait a couple more episodes before we can actually let this
  beast out in public. Two-timing, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, probably also because Nagisa did not
  go to school for a while, that she didn't make any friends for some reasons I
  don't have to explain. Hey, some Anime characters don't even have friends after going to school for six months so... *OOF* But yeah, Naoya desperately
  wants to "be friends" with this new girl lol but as expected, because he's too
  extreme and honest to himself he just wants to shout it out to the world that
  he is two-timing- Don't make me type this word too often please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All
  in all, Saki-chan just let these guys hang out in secret together just because
  we really can't leave Nagisa alone not even as classmates just because, and
  yeah, it's better no one sees this screw up of a triangle relationship we are
  having here lol. Hey, so far so dumb, this series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I really got
  worried about the bed scene this week but yeah, we should be good on this
  because besides having to enjoy plenty of monologues all around especially
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/36812/Azumi_Waki" target="_blank">Waki Azumi</a>&nbsp;who voices Nagisa in the toilet this week tbh (lol), it's actually a
  lot of fun I personally am enjoying every episode so far so that's good news.
  Really makes you wonder what the new characters will play in this not harem
  series because really, having two is enough haha cya guys next week</div>

  </blockquote>Well there isn't much this week, but we are catching up from last week and possibly I will be doing this for the rest of the month so here we go... VTubers <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%AA%E9%99%BD%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-single/1574601955?l=en" target="_blank">Oozora Subaru</a></b> and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/bluerose-comet-ep/1573858346?l=en" target="_blank">Hoshimachi Suisei</a></b> have new songs for various reasons I don't want to explain here because it'll be a long paragraph but they are good so feel free to hear them out especially with the latter having more songs coming up soon, I happen to be hearing VTuber clip outros again which I normally skip and found this song perfect for summer time so thanks <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/summertime-single/1266610137?l=en" target="_blank">cinnamons x evening cinema and their song from 2017</a></b> which got as popular as it appeared on national television back then which I must say it is actually good, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/the-skys-the-limit-single/1572955726?l=en" target="_blank">PHONO TONES' new song</a></b> for their 10th anniversary which we will talk more later I guess, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/clock-town/1572232054?l=en" target="_blank">The Floor's new mini-album</a></b> which should be the focus of this week's releases as it is literally the one released this week, is kinda okay but I expected more since their previous album wasn't that great and it was like close to 2 years ago already so, oh well. I really wanted something more out of them though, to be honest.<br />
  <br />For news regarding music and it's on Twitter and I swear this account is still used for music and not for me to share mobile game codes lmao, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1414207855259840513?s=20" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's new music video preview</a></b> actually sounds nice so I guess I'll be listening to it when it comes out in a few weeks,&nbsp;<b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1413878189940625408?s=20" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia's new music video</a></b> is too cool to be an Anime opening but I guess which is why it's made for it, don't stop crying if you saw <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1413493179026862086?s=20" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari's last performance on national TV with the OG three-piece</a></b> band, I may check out <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1406914796880949250?s=20" target="_blank">Yoshioka Kiyoe's I assume cover for veteran Matsumoto Takashi's tribute album</a></b> I guess, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1411995773038993411?s=20" target="_blank">Natsukawa Shiina released a live video compilation</a></b> of her recent Shiina (417) Day live, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1412021440858116105?s=20" target="_blank">Kitou Akari revealed music previews for her upcoming concept mini-album</a></b> releasing in August from her livestream on Monday, and it looks like<b> <a href="https://twitter.com/alterna_girls/status/1414132352482267139?s=20" target="_blank">Alternative Girls mobile game is getting another new song reveal</a></b> from self-proclaimed idol Mano Sakurako voiced by Ookubo Rumi so this is gonna be good please don't disappoint.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br />So next week and probably throughout this month we are probably going to be stuck with only one new release in which upcoming is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/new-story-ep/1573852725?l=en" target="_blank">Kouno Marika's 2nd single</a></b> which did not leave a strong impression for me just yet so we shall see again, and I'll finally be able to get back to those digital singles from last month, we shall see. Oh yeah, and did I mention <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%A7%86%E3%81%91%E3%82%8D-%E5%A4%A9%E7%90%83-%E5%BD%97%E6%98%9F%E3%81%AF%E5%A4%9C%E3%82%92%E8%B7%A8%E3%81%84%E3%81%A7-ep/1575719705?l=en" target="_blank">Hoshimachi Suisei just announced a new single</a></b> again which is released this week and NOT the one I listened to this week? Man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh yeah, maybe I should listen to those <b>two&nbsp;Cocoro Auction singles</b> first, to be honest, those are falling back in time as we speak, earlier than those digital singles.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  And I'm ending this week with some Anime reminiscence which is in case if you wonder, "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/12291/Acchi_Kocchi_TV" target="_blank">Acchi Kocchi</a>". The <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/55839/Tsumiki_Miniwa" target="_blank">main girl</a> voice actress <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/12041/Rumi_Ookubo" target="_blank">Ookubo Rumi</a>&nbsp;got me in (Don't deja vu; she was mentioned earlier too), the slice-of-life and subtle romance made me stay. I think I was trying to find something where I remembered one of the girl being egged to buy drinks together and said "Oolong Tea" just to join in... Haha okay if I find it I better remember to GIF it or something lol. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... life is great if you don't think of work, to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, work gives you money which supplies you life so oh well what the heck haha bye<br />
</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Note to self: It's from part B of episode 11, where Sakimori is buying and Kana-chan and Mayoi is egging Himechi for a drink "<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V9Nyn1xULCU/YOsI605D5ZI/AAAAAAABF-o/YhslrBm2JcoZt-RIFZDyM28e26m2S-vlACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/ackc11_yay.jpg" target="_blank">Someone looks like she's lost</a>" said Tsumiki lol that's me sometimes when I get dragged to play board games at their place</div>
