Well, guys, I have some good news and bad news.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Bad news is, we have FOUR SHOWS to watch this week and maybe every week,
  basically on the watch day I call Sunday ie. today haha so yeah, this is going
  to be quite a grind. Good chances I may not drop any of them but we shall see,
  and you know, this might still be it moving on.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Good news is, because I will have taken leave tomorrow and have a public
  holiday the following day, which means I guess we can do another Anime Extra
  just to cover the two shows on let's say, their third episode so we can
  actually do the three-episode rule thing and maybe get rid of Tantei if we
  need to.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well, chances are slim on that but I'll see about it haha Ayachi~!! lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So, let's get to it! Sorry Natsukawa Shiina my dear imouto I know it's your birthday today and I'm simping over Taketatsu Ayana I can't even</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://jisho.org/search/gomen" target="_blank">GOMEN</a>!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She'll forgive me haha good luck on your live tour that has been delayed for a year lol let's actually move on, shall we?<br />

  <div>
    I mean, who doesn't want to be hugged, amirite?? Ayachi, I'll take two.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay not like we're drawing parallels with her voice actress who is
    married and
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Ayana_take/status/943700093781213184?s=20" target="_blank">is as busty</a>
    (<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>) as the new girl, but yeah, in this new episode (#TanMoshi02) we got
    dropped by this random girl in school. Yes, it's just some random girl, but
    with a catch: She has a great rack. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, not that haha. She...
    hears a voice within her in search of someone. Yeah, sounds ridiculous
    already, but let's make some sense out of this. The girl is Nagisa, same
    year as Kimitsuka here who already is in his final year of high school
    living the thug life or not I guess, but yes, without Siesta. What happened
    to her I guess we will find out at the end of the series (because
    <em>why not ask the heart</em> lol more on that later), but suffice it to say
    that, it happened some three years ago, and it has been a year since her...
    passing. Yeah, hard to swallow even when they wrote "she ded" on the title, huh.
    Still, Nagisa seems real desperate in finding out the truth (you don't want
    to know what happened again I wish it was
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu" target="_blank">her voice actress</a>
    that was doing... it... choke porn lol) (I seriously can't "swallow" this
    series with the plot tbh haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>) so yeah, Kimitsuka the famous detective I
    guess be gracing the newspaper mainly because Siesta can't be on it,
    decides to help her out. You know, finding the local police would help from
    a start. Besides more new characters who are talking history lol like
    seriously I don't even know the woman, we find another familiar buddy we
    have seen in Episode 1: that partial android who can hear from miles away.
    Before that, I guess we have to talk about who Nagisa is trying to find
    here. No idea, she said. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But the only thing we know is that she had
    a heart transplant a year ago <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> which probably explains her absence from school and has been desperate to find
    someone since. Probably not a boyfriend because I can fill in that role if
    you want lmao, but yeah you get the idea. Someone. Just, we have no idea.
    Not until we find back that dude who is apparently, locked up in a high
    security prison underground and thought there are visitors coming to talk to
    him, then regarded that as the arrival of the famous detective who locked him up
    in the first place. Remember, his ears are super good? But he can't see
    through 3-inch steel? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, surprise surprise, when asked about
    if the guy would know about who Nagisa is trying to find even without
    telling him about the transplant, I guess in his ears imagine like, Siesta
    standing&nbsp; there but his eyes are tricking on him to see whoever that
    white haired <a href="https://jisho.org/search/loli" target="_blank">loli</a> as a big boob high school girl lol how is that for a
    comparison! <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, yes the heart transplant had to have a donor,
    and it's from Siesta. Yeah yeah, boring for the world to be so roundabout on this, but yeah it's likely a coincidence because if it were to be
    transplanted to someone in Okinawa, Kimitsuka wouldn't have heard any of
    these lol and maybe in a couple of decades will this then come back to find him
    lol. You know, the author just thought of accelerating the process haha it only took 3 years. And
    it is way easier to explain how that works by the dude throwing his android
    ear thing right into Nagisa and seeing it get shredded... as we have seen in
    Episode 1 because specifically Siesta is the only person who will be immune to his attacks. It's like
    a firewall rule to block Facebook just that we moved that PC to another physical location lol. All
    in all, I must say I'm still intrigued by this series to be wanting to
    continue watching this to see if I ever want to give this a try. Giving that
    moving forward, we may have to live with Nagisa and no Siesta as the awesome
    duo we have seen previous episode, it'll be a hard pill to swallow, even if
    the replacement is someone more voluptuous and cute as the
    actual person- Maybe we can get Nagisa to dress up in a cat maid outfit now? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Besides all the blatant chest shots this episode lol, the animation
    is still kind of lacklustre probably because we got thrown in into quite a
    fight on that plane initially I guess, but yeah, if recollections are going to be the
    thing moving on from here, I might get disappointed over time. It's like remembering someone's death anniversary but we gotta mourn for three months straight.
    Yeah, it's going to be painful to say the least. Best part is, the thing
    about transplants is like you shouldn't live the life of the donor, even if
    the heart is so strong it can control the host because this is some
    sci-fi-esque series that I rather stay out of lol. To add on, we got another
    girl who wants his help. Could this be Siesta but all her other body parts??
    Haha we shall see I guess I will do the three-episode rule to see if I can
    be convinced at all even
  </div>

    [TL:DR; Watching TanMoshi is like having very terrible entrees for a meal
    but having like, the smallest yet most exquisite lobster meat in the world in the
    middle lol]

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Serious talk though, even if I had many interactions with the one I
  love... liked in middle school equivalent in Japan even then at most I only
  touched her... hands... Haha okay enough about me lol in this new episode
  though (#ShinigamiBocchan02) we have new characters appearing which will in
  essence, complete the life around the mansion for Bocchan here I would say.
  Firstly, the return of the actual butler Rob who should be running the place and
  not Alice haha. He's down with back pain considering his age, but as he
  recovers surprisingly he's super efficient, clearing up the garden and serving
  tea right after without a hitch. In a different level from Bocchan who can
  only sit and do nothing or else the whole garden might die lol, this butler is
  proving to be real useful around the house. Well, until the next time he
  breaks his back, that is. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or yeah, the next time he accidentally
  touches Bocchan and meets his own funeral <strike>way</strike> earlier than he should have...
  Haha anyways, Alice is still helping out despite this butler being super great
  at his job, and cleaning the place is probably something Rob can't do alone
  because he can't squat down to clean the floors for shit lmao. Moving on, is
  what Bocchan does around the house. Apparently we saw some reading here and
  there, but interestingly, he is future planning from when he heard his only
  buddy Philips tell him about the family side issues, so he is practicing his
  piano skills with new songs (WHAT YEAR IS THIS?? lol) so that he can go rock
  the streets as "The Grim Reaper Pianist" when he opens his YouTube channel in a
  couple of years time haha. Yeah, the advent of the Internet may not lift his curse but definitely would've solved
  his problem to be honest. Virtual Duke would be pretty cool now haha but hey,
  this is like the early 20th century so don't think too much into it lol. Anyways,
  Alice walks in unnoticed as always to clean the place, clearly drawn in by the
  piano playing, but you know, she is just here for cleaning. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And as
  Bocchan continues to stare blankly at that one woman in the whole abode...
  "seishunki", we call that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or puberty, if you will haha. Hey, can't
  blame the guy who only has this one woman to look at- Heck, what do you think
  he was looking at before Alice was even here? Rob?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next up, the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> is serving herself up to the mansion, it seems. She is Viola, basically
  just voiced by making a super duper kawaii voiced Minase Inori lol, and is
  Bocchan's younger sister who obviously, like the rest of the family, is living
  in the main abode. About her... let's just say she has all the quirky teen
  qualities checklist ticked even a century ago. She is on a diet (lol how old are you even), she
  likes sweets and love stories which I bet she doesn't have the latter anyways
  so why shit on your brother, she is adventurous so she actually defies her
  mother's orders and does visit her brother from time to time mostly for sweets
  but I must say she might be a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/burakon" target="_blank">brocon</a> for all we know (can you even be one
  without having to touch your onii-sama at all?), and she's into old men. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Wait, what was that last part? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  But yeah, I really liked the drops she gave to the brother in all of the
  places even without talking about his curse which of course mainly refers to Alice the maid but you get the idea haha. Of course, just like Philips who
  actually will give a damn about Bocchan unlike the mother, she is also wishing for the
  day his brother can be rid of his curse. Someday girl, someday he'll get rid of it.
  <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Last but not least, uno pussy gatto. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If you still get it
  despite how weird I made it sound that's good lol, but if you don't suffice it
  to say a wild cat dropped by the mansion supposedly asking for death because
  it probably didn't know about a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>
  living in this area haha, which is probably in search of food (and boobs lmao) for
  its kittens living out in the wild, supposedly abandoned seeing as it has a
  collar. But it did find a life out there somehow, and thinking back for
  Bocchan, this might be his fate in the near future too. Ah, the irony I see,
  dear author. All in all, I mean, the series may be sometimes a little darker
  than that bright full moon at night, but again I'm staying for Alice's BANGING BODY haha
  really that's all you need to live for. I can be cursed and live such a life
  in place of Bocchan I don't even care lol. They even got to fake dance in the
  balcony which is just sad to see, but yeah, it's real reflection on the
  reality we see in this series, as fun and quirky and blatantly&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a>
  this might be. I like it though, Alice-chan I mean (haha), so I'll definitely
  see this till the end. Don't think we'll get a conclusion on the curse but the
  love between the two... we can but hope.

  Guys, I think Nagisa is into scat- OKAY IN THIS NEW EPISODE haha
  (#KanoKano03), I guess we are still struggling with the problems when
  Saki-chan actually realizes she is still not okay with this relationship
  triangle or something I don't know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, turns out, not an actual
  good thing this is still some competition after all. Well, according to
  Saki-chan it is so. And Nagisa too, if you think about it. So, story. They still be thinking about where to eat for lunch secretly so the three can actually
  eat together... and they ended up with long story short because we really
  shouldn't be talking too much about toilets and how they stink anyways lmao, they end up choosing to eat in the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E4%BD%93%E8%82%B2%E5%80%89%E5%BA%AB" target="_blank">sports storage room</a>
  by sneaking in through one of the unlocked windows and rearranging everything
  to protect themselves from a sudden ambush through the front door lol they
  have to do this everyday huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, probably small effort for the
  other two compared to how wonderful Nagisa's lunches for them has ever been,
  and of course including the fact that Nagisa is just in general so sad and
  lonely all this while it makes them feel bad because apart from just
  suggesting great places to be alone in, she also doesn't have friends which to
  be honest is already sadder than me already so yeah, even I wouldn't leave her
  alone. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean, as a classmate, please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, but yeah, then we
  come to the main topic of the whole episode, where Saki-chan recollects on
  what she has done for Naoya compared to her <strike>love</strike> two-timing
  rival lol. Well, guess what, basically nothing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because if you have
  not noticed even without Nagisa-chan right here and as we have seen in the
  episode too, Naoya is basically spoiling this girlfriend and he has done so since they
  are childhood friends, and yeah it's making both of them happy, with Naoya
  being the guy who spoils his girl which is a given, but also Saki-chan who
  enjoys everything and gives nothing back because Naoya is kinda perfect to be
  honest and doesn't really need much emotional support. Well that is, until
  Nagisa arrived I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So as you can see, it's not that simple. At
  this point, it definitely led to Saki-chan really thinking about what she has
  done for her boy, considering this is still a love relationship even without
  any competition around if that were the case beforehand. Yeah, I can't even
  explain how single-sided but also, how much bliss Saki-chan has to have such a
  guy like this. And you waited until high school to accept his confession? I
  feel bad for Nagisa now lol haha ah hey. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Saki-chan thought sex would
  suffice but we know Naoya is gay so (lmao) I guess she left and went back to her
  family's place which is next door because childhood friends, man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And
  so, as Naoya "finds out" that Saki-chan is troubled and doesn't want to talk
  just because she is jealous of Nagisa having a larger rack than she does lol
  wtf, this guy, without sleep, thought of ways to bait her down to discuss on
  what she is troubled about. Well, it's when you realize Nagisa knows her
  better than you, dear boy, that you might have lost. On everything. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Ah, this jebaiting is the best lol guess who's the
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34881/Aho_Girl" target="_blank">idiot girl</a>
  now haha GOT HER AGAIN!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I think I have said the previous
  sentence many times before by now haha, but yes this is a true down to Earth
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rabukome" target="_blank">romcom</a> if I
  have ever seen one, and I have seen many in the past decade, trust me. It
  still talks about love in the logical and preposterous aspects, it still has
  boob touching lol, and it's still ridiculously funny overall. I mean, I don't
  even care about the morality of two-timing already at this point; If you are
  still stuck at this like an old man with traditional values then don't expect
  to enjoy this at any point. Because honestly saying? Besides the actual
  recognition of going steady, it's just... well at this point, a competition to
  win the affection of Naoya, isn't it? Well Naoya does love the two not knowing
  which is the heavier bias but you get the idea. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still, great to find
  out at some point - which they really didn't touch on even this episode - why as
  we have seen thus far, Naoya will not give up his "childhood girlfriend"
  (<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>) for Nagisa-chan which is honestly so much better in every way as if
  it's the ideal girl to go out with. Maybe we'll get to that at some point, I
  guess, but meanwhile let's enjoy the cake, the boob fondling lol, and is that
  <strike>a YouTuber</strike> an online celebrity playing gacha streams hooking
  SSRs left and right which I would prefer to hook her left and right
  boob?? Haha new character arriving soon I guess we shall see how she adds into
  the mix that is basically burnt out curry lmao cya guys next week for more of
  this craziness

  </blockquote>
  Wow that was quite an episode even for an original series, and I swear this is
  the longest break I took between watching the episode and writing this review, really. So, in
  the first episode of series which will blow your mind including mine
  (#SonnyBoy01), if I had to summarize this series it's more like the talk of
  freedom and experimentation. Yes, and I'm not talking about that one student
  who is analyzing this weird phenomenon that is still plaguing the school
  premises. Again, it's not like they aren't at school or anything, but firstly,
  we have set ourselves on the proposition of it. In this case, the school is
  technically out of phase from the rest of the world they call home. Yes, a
  school of only students it would seem, stuck in their school, in a separate
  space time. I'm sure Einstein can explain this better but in this case,
  Einstein will probably give up and go back to his deathbed haha. I'm
  not going to explain what happened this episode, but I think I can talk about
  it in three factions. Firstly, the bad guys. Well, delinquents I guess, but
  apparently they are the only ones who are dumb enough to show their
  superpowers all over, ruining school property and such, thinking of taking
  over the school like it's some fever dream and they will get something out of
  it or whatever because that's also a joke because there's nothing out there at this
  point lol. You with me so far? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's probably small thing, but now
  let's talk about everyone else, starting from the Student Council. Yes, it
  still exists in this particular "school". To that, it looks like they don't
  have superpowers but looks like everyone might have one as long as you have discovered it, but suffice it to say they had like, leadership powers
  which can grant penalties dependent on rules set within this world. So yeah,
  long division. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I'll definitely get the hundred-kilometre run though considering I hate running) Despite the irony of not being able to use any superpowers as defined with the rules which is technically backed up by one, everyone joined the chat group which is apparently
  working still lol WhatsApp working in this alternate world PogChamp, but yeah,
  clearly the bad guys weren't happy with that. Because seriously, telling me to
  do long division on pi just because I broke the windows? Absolutely
  ridiculous- Why do I have a black cross on my face and why am I typing this
  review 2000 times haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, you get the idea, and the conflict is
  on with the "bad guys" having powers related to them which is more like
  defiance and destruction based compared to the "good guys" with more logical
  and tactical based powers as seen from how they escaped by replacing their
  location with item substitutes in cages they were locked in. So as you can
  see, destructive powers have ways to avoid getting screwed I mean they didn't
  technically kill all the students at once because why not lol, and the "rules"
  in the school aren't perfect either. Well, you see, you didn't set down
  generic rules is the problem lol I may not be able to break school property
  but that doesn't mean I can't insult your mother- Moving on!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not
  least, we have the main characters, Nozomi and Nagara. If this episode is too
  much for you, I would like to just bring your attention to the part where they
  are still in their reality, and Nozomi be tearing textbook pages on the rooftop.
  Firstly, her radical insults to normality and human tendency. From "why won't
  you do the tearing of textbooks it's fun" to "why you always pretend you are
  busy even though you're going to do nothing", it sets off a very serene yet
  ponding mood to the world they are in now, with a strike of lightning
  apparently being the cause of their current predicament. Nagara is just a chill bro which is basically me
  not caring about what happens to this world anyways I'm just living the life even
  if on rations set by the Student Council, and Nozomi was a recent transfer
  student who would rather transfer herself out of any school and be free like
  the bird she has been noticing within this screwed up world to know that, this
  is not the world they should be in, and thus the jump into the abyss and
  finding out it's actually the school not inside free space, but on the sinking near some island with mountains? Haha hey don't ask me why. All in all, this
  series is basically challenging you to think out of the box. Every. Single. Time.
  Even the school was in a box until someone ran out of it, remember? So yeah,
  if there is something you can take away obviously including how cool all their
  powers have been so far, is the defiance of anything presented being an alternate option.
  The trailer and staff have somehow hinted on puzzles and mysteries that will
  be the main theme of this series, so it's no wonder to infer that such will be
  the way to... you know, move forward I guess I don't even think we can go
  back as seen from that flashback of what looks like a Grim Reaper ripping
  all the students apart in the first place...? Hey, I'm as confused as you are, and
  you have no way to find out the answer until you finish watching it. Which I
  might do, as messy and screwed up of a plot this might be I would say. I will
  watch a couple more episodes to say the least, and if I can understand more
  than I can infer above or if I was right, I might just stay to see what
  happens. There is no turning back, guys; This is an original Anime series
  which will penalize you if you misbehave... wait, do not know of the rules.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Get it now? Cya guys next week for more weird shit lol
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; If you thought any of their questions or thoughts were right... I'll
  give you an example to think again: Remember one of the bad guys saying "so
  it's not just the leader who can give penalties to others"? Yeah, THAT is the
  guy with the power, who gave power to that captain. Think about it.]</div>

  the suffering of humans, and likely to survive you have to challenge conventional
  human behaviour. That's it- Why is it all death this season? Haha oh and
  everyone has powers whether it's discovered or not because some are harder to notice than

  On news concerning music and is on Twitter and I'm sorry for the retweets from mobile games I'm playing it's their 5th anniversary soon haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1414207855259840513?s=20" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's new music video preview</a></b> on YouTube is very alluring but you know I rather give the song which will explain why I haven't got laid (haha), remind me to listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1414962828142862346?s=20" target="_blank">SHE's new song</a></b> and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1414532486579703818?s=20" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari vocalist Yoshioka Kiyoe's new song</a></b> which released this week... next week haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1415295021415272455?s=20" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora appeared on THE FIRST TAKE again</a></b> with her latest song which is not the upcoming single apparently lol, I can't believe I'm saying this in a long time but <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1415555393153949697?s=20" target="_blank">ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single releases next month</a></b> which is hype for me personally to be honest it has been literal years, I think I will give a listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ReinaUeda_Staff/status/1406628484215021573?s=20" target="_blank">Ueda Reina's new album releasing next month</a></b> when it comes out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRBfnGSB44" target="_blank">the music video</a> kinda drew me in I guess, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1416278440156618754?s=20" target="_blank">Touyama Nao's video for YouTube Music Weekend</a></b> (in Japan) features songs from previous live performances which...

  <br />
  And it looks like next week will be the most packed week here in Klassic Note, and yes I didn't mention about <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1416412373661798404?s=20" target="_blank">SID's new song</a></b> because it released on a not Wednesday so I'll be listening to that next week instead. Along with this though are <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%95%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A2-ep/1573715960?l=en" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's new single</a></b> which I don't remember much of it so I'll go in blind I guess, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/101-%E5%A4%9C%E5%85%89-ep/1573725159?l=en" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia's new single</a></b> which should be good so we shall see, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hello-horizon-single/1571862550?l=en" target="_blank">Minase Inori's new single</a></b> which I may have associated with Kouno Marika's since it's also Anime theme song but the <a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1416752112952778755?s=20" target="_blank">B-side preview isn't too bad</a> so let's hope it doesn't suck. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Oh well, if it does we'll find something else haha I already had a short work week I can live without new songs lol where are the mainstream artists even<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />And that's all for this week, maybe I should design a contents page at the top huh this feels like a long scroll. So yes, next week I will be taking leave literally tomorrow so I guess we shall have another Anime Extra tomorrow so we can actually determine whether we shall watch those two Sunday night premier series from here on, and Tuesday is a public holiday over here so yay. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That's all, that's what you need to know from me next week haha. Cya guys next week then, and until then <em>maybe</em> I'll go see a doctor. Maybe. Haha bye<br />
