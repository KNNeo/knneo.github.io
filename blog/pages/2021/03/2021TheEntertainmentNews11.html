I know it's tomorrow, but happy birthday Toyota Moe-chan!! If liking you is an
excuse to never have recognised you as a voice actress... I don't mind haha I'll
make the exception (I kind of did that with Kayano Ai too anyways, two years
before her role in "Hyouka")
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And of course, I'm at this point pondering watching everything below for
  Sunday afternoon (because I played too much Red Dead Online in the morning) OR
  watching Moeshi's birthday livestream. What do you think I chose? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Come on, there's that ACCA OVA I haven't watched I gotta do those first man.
  Sorry Moeshi!!
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  NOT MIKU TOO!!! Haha that's not on me lol let's Anime<br />

  </blockquote>
  Yeah, hey, you felt anything moving inside you that's hurting you? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
  this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs09) where FINALLY Yosano-sensei gets a run
  on the jokes lol, we got the most stereotypical mistake in the surgery market:
  leaving stuff from the operation inside your patient(s). Well... then we just
  operate again? But her Ability will not trigger. Ah yes, we gotta beat them up
  and THEN do it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So firstly, Yosano losing her shit. Well, as in,
  losing her apparatus for surgery. You know, the usual stuff she does when her
  teammates get beaten into a pulp. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So after searching her room, she
  deduces that it might be inside one of the recently operated members in the
  Agency. Haha, I mean, this is already a joke why aren't you laughing lol. She
  asked Atsushi and he seems fine but as Yosano did say he should've just
  checked like, scientifically, like say, open him up lmao okay I meant just do
  X-Ray. She didn't, thinks that Atsushi is just having food poisoning, and lets him go. Next, we have Tanizaki. I promise you, the moment she says that one
  pick-up line that we should ALL learn (lol) I already know where this is
  going. So yes, his <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> is eavesdropping nearby, as usual. Surprise
  surprise, she probably got mad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, Tanizaki showed Yosano his body
  once again, thank goodness there isn't much in there lol, so she went for her
  last target Kunikida. Instead of doing it right as usual, Yosano phrased it
  such that stress can feel as bad as a scalpel in your body... I'm pretty sure
  the latter is worse lmao. So yeah, of the three questioned she technically
  only checked one properly, but it wasn't until Atsushi and Kyouka reminded her
  about the recent barbeque on the rooftop where she got drunk and used her
  scalpel for cooking... that she stopped harassing her teammates, I guess lol.
  Next up, another one of Dazai's lies strikes again. This time, it's about
  Atsushi's lunch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, you'll get what I mean in a moment. As Atsushi
  finishes his specially bought lunch this time around (man he must have saved
  for this I just eat so long as I'm healthy lmao), Dazai warns him about eating
  the "shrimp handle" lol I think the subs aren't doing too well but so is Dazai
  so whatever. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He then tells the weretiger he can plant that tail down
  on soil and grow new prawns- If you need a reminder or Ranpo-san to come in to
  tell you that it is not possible you should've just Googled the question and
  find out at some point lol. Again, it's Dazai bullsh*t level once again, so
  I'm not going to elaborate too much. Akutagawa believed it like an idiot
  though, good for him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And all because someone was hinting Atsushi
  that he could also use some lunch... hey, Atsushi, got that deja vu yet?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Lastly, we have a drawing competition. Of people drawing you. It's
  Atsushi vs Dazai vs maybe Akutagawa at some point: Atsushi draws enough to
  make a kids' video and song about it (kudos to the composer for doing so much because seriously this series doesn't need a high budget lol), Dazai just draws all the stuff
  that doesn't exist, and I think our winner is Akutagawa. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay,
  personal preference Kyouka's drawings, by the way. You see, in the series of
  war and terror and <i>terrible</i> jokes (haha) we be glad the only
  wholesomeness we get is <strike>Tanizaki and Naomi hugging</strike> Kyouka
  being cute, okay? It's not Thanksgiving but we must learn to be thankful for
  this series lol

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Man, don't you like a jealous b*tch as your girlfriend- Please let me meet and
  date a jealous girlfriend haha preferably someone who's also horny FOR ME
  lmao. In this new episode (#Horimiya10) and in an alternate world where
  Tanihara and Miyamura are friends lol, we get the no-go from Hori. Yep, sorry,
  Miyamura. That's what happens when you be too good with people around you.
  Your girl starts getting jealous of... men? What? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't get this
  logic, but maybe Hori has something going on her thinking girls won't like her
  guy maybe I don't know. Okay, main characters aside because WHO CARES ABOUT
  THEM DUDE!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We got side characters on the ride this week, and man,
  what a tearjerker. No really, THIS is the stuff I signed up for, where secondary
  characters have better story than the main ones, don't ask me why. So, about
  that triangle relationship that is maybe there but we not sure. Firstly, about
  Yanagi's rejection from Yoshikawa. If you can remember some time ago the dude
  came to confess to our girl, and she said no. Problem is, she had to come up
  with an excuse. So guess what, she chose her guy bestie in school which is
  coincidentally who she has a crush on, Ishikawa, to act as her boyfriend. Like
  really, this couldn't get more worse. Because besides making Sakura sad
  because we learnt that too recently, it has also become more of a reality in
  school where people be talking about it so it probably made Sakura even
  sadder. Now who's the devil here lol. To add on, Yoshikawa did the thing where
  she lied upon Sakura on her relationship with Ishikawa probably leaving the
  girl heartbroken, and instead chose to talk it out with her friend Remi. What,
  you think she's going to help you spell out the truth even if you tell her?
  Yeah, Remi is totally right here: settle your own sh*t, b*tch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Sorry
  for the censors I gotta) Then, we get a hint from the sister. (Sorry
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/17215/Atsumi_Tanezaki" target="_blank">Tanezaki Atsumi</a>, I only recognised you after I saw the credits) Because the sister gave way
  a big hint about Yuki-chan herself: she doesn't ask for something she wants
  until it's too late. Quoting from her childhood where she wanted a hairpin but
  only complained after the family went home... it's not good for you girl
  that's called missed opportunity. And to be honest? We have seen that a couple
  of times already, from even earlier where Sakura managed to make a move on
  Ishikawa before the Yanagi confession. So yeah, talking about my perspective?
  I can only say: people are innately evil. So take what you want before it's
  too late, I can tell you that much. It's not that we shouldn't feel for how
  others feel, but don't leave your desires hanging, that's the worst. Even her sis can
  see through her. But sis, Yuki-chan wants more than anything in the shopping
  mall. She wants a dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> OKAY MOVING ON!! Haha I really shouldn't.
  So, after cooping at home for a couple of days she decided to go back to
  school (I wished my compulsory education attendance was like university or
  high school in Japan) which worried her bestie ie. Hori and guess who,
  Ishikawa too because she turned her phone off. Problem is, Yuki-chan also saw
  a phone message which shocked her: the confession from Sakura to Ishikawa. Hmm...
  what do you think happened? Thing is though? She wasn't there to witness.
  Because hey, Sakura be "striking when the iron's hot and the snow isn't around", yeah? Eh?
  Wrong quote? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's a play on their names, in case you have wondered
  how the two talked on the rooftop, the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sakura" target="_blank">cherry blossom</a>
  and <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yuki" target="_blank">snow</a> thing.
  I'll let you enjoy the conversation, but suffice it to say as much as it's
  kinda dumb and they are still kinda like, friend thing going on here I assume,
  it wasn't clear as day on anyone that Ishikawa returned anyone's feelings, to
  be honest. He continued the lie to Sakura, and barely hinted on his interest
  to Yoshikawa... I know right; Ishikawa's the worst lmao thank goodness you don't deserve Hori
  lol. *gets beat up by Hori* A-Anyways, *ouch* But on Yuki-chan's perspective
  now, it made her seem like a bad person too. For people to go along with her
  lie even though she wants fair reality, is once again, only complaining about
  hers not being hers until it's too late. Hey, your rival chose to strike
  first, and you cheated by asking her to give him to you. Who's in the wrong
  now? Last but not least, we have some Sakura moments which I swear, I really
  feel bad for her now. And Sengoku, because I also don't know what to do for
  her anymore. Really shouldn't have stopped her in the room; we could've had a
  new insert song of Sakura crying outdoors lmao. All in all, fantastic episode
  which could've been longer because you know, this is a 4-koma adapted series
  and it's not "Toradora!" which drags like 12 episodes lol, but hey, I like it
  actually. Really feeling bad for Sakura-chan here just because Yoshikawa is
  ambivalent about her perspective in misaligned relationships. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Oh well.
  I wish this was more clear, but considering apprehensive Ishikawa and literal
  b*tch Yoshikawa (lol) I doubt anything will happen soon, but we got 2 episodes
  left, so let's hope this ends well. For Sakura though... <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> In
  other news, I think Ishikawa is going to get expelled lmao haha I WISH

  Wait wait, "first" anniversary?? I thought a century old liao? Oh, or they count
  the jerks leaving as a new era? Ah, I see. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this special OVA
  episode which I've waited for years (#ACCARegards) I finally got around to it,
  and the subtitles might have sucked because it's "Reform First Anniversary"
  which will make more sense. Because as you might have recalled from the
  wonderful series back in 2017, the mellow mood yet heavy tensions of this
  series is what makes it special. From Jean's inspection of all... then 13
  districts initiated also as a confirmation of an anti-coup, to knowing Jean
  and Lotta and their past with Nino, to the dispersal of the Chief Officers of
  ACCA... it has been quite a journey. And a year into its restructure, in
  general the younger generation have not felt any particular change in its
  future, and that shall be our discussion throughout this special episode.

  Firstly, on Lotta. She's still studying, by the way, she's still young, and
  she's worried about her future. For her teacher is worried about her after
  giving her an assignment regarding career plans, and she has been acting weird
  ever since. Not like her brother Jean will know anything else since they
  hardly have time to communicate anyways, but as you can see, heavy tensions. On the other
  hand, we are introduced with a couple more characters to complete the story
  this time around. For one, newbie ACCA member under Jean called Parrot for
  some reason (lol it's not the subs it's literally spelled that, look at Jean's
  phone), is one of those youngsters who doesn't believe in the change of ACCA
  after its reformation of tops. Districts still believe they are the biggest,
  and ACCA only serves as an administration ground or even a middleman, to solve
  all their problems, like how Jean was suddenly asked to Birra to help their
  leader decide on what to showcase on the upcoming anniversary festival.
  Really, Parrot is not wrong; He could've done it himself. Actual like, soft
  skills in dealing with this I wouldn't elaborate too much considering the
  other is a newbie, but as we will see later, it's not just about wasting
  resources. Jean also believes this special team he is in is still rather
  important in these tying times, and maybe we shouldn't complain too much about
  work development lol that's literally me right now haha Jean thanks for the
  mind opener. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, we have the reunion. Well it's a reunion, to
  say the least, at least, between Nino and Jean. Again, they are not exactly
  same years because Nino is like in his 40s now lol, but you get the idea, Jean
  is also getting old lol what. He also shares his worries with him once in a
  while, and they touch on Lotta-chan. Man, even I'm getting worried lol. The
  best part about this is actually, that Parrot has like, a secret detective
  kind of group which is digging out the whereabouts of the former Five Chiefs
  of ACCA like he's the next Sherlock Holmes lmao. Man, maybe this is the only
  part that is not convincing me to be honest, but you get the idea. Heavy
  tensions, get what I mean?

  So, about Pine and Pastis, and the rumours around. The guys be hanging out in
  their districts as leaders now, probably kicking the active ones before them
  now that ACCA has kicked them back a notch lol.
  <strike>Having to deal with revenge</strike> Wait wait that one is Lilium,
  right? Ah, wrong person. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We also get to see the rare Owl appearance,
  as you may recall, Jean's boss is also secretly an undercover for the
  headquarters, checking on the Otus siblings as he can. So, he has to approach
  specifically Pine, to find out more. It's all mystery and all, and the other
  former Chief Spade is reluctant to move, waging with people to not go do Badon
  for some reason lol he's just lazy and loves to gamble. We are also introduced
  to Wind, Nino's teacher who is now the head of the school, but also, is a
  teach to Lotta, so yay, coincidences all around. Okay, so now comes the heavy
  stuff. What this Wind has for Nino is vitally important and I think you need
  to remember, is the idea of, as a grown-up looking over a child, to watch over
  them on their decisions. And for the recipient? It's up to them to decide, is
  what was told to Lotta-chan. Eventually, it's up to you to make a vague
  decision of career choice into something you can live with. That is, at least,
  what happened in my case. I was able to land on a job in which I am happy
  with, and am able to live out my career being a programmer. That, coming out
  from an Engineering Degree without much Computing Science background, is a big
  relief. Moving ahead, is the problem. So let's go back to talking about ACCA.
  And since Parrot has been (like a parrot) hawking about the former Chiefs
  meeting together and potentially starting something up during the festival so
  they can take control or whatever again his conspiracy theories are, it was
  all eventually put to rest once Jean suggested a visit to the current Chief,
  Mauve. If you remember this beautiful, beautiful woman which caught Jean's
  interest at some point hehe, she dismissed their thoughts and probably all the
  citizens during her speech in the festival too, by (1) assuring them that the
  reform doesn't represent big changes in ACCA doing its administrative and
  middleman role but will then require younger input in the future to show
  transition and (2) showing them the Furawau district letter from the not ACCA
  nation which of course, killed the idea of them initiating a revolt in any
  way, which is the precise reason they chose to leave quietly after being
  discovered of the coup. Despite Parrot's worries, it was all for nothing and
  Jean was right all along: There isn't anything going on, at least for now,
  about a coup on the nation. (Of course there isn't you idiot it has only been
  a year these things take at least 2 years lmao)

  Lastly, about Lotta's future. She finally then sat down to talk with his
  brother after consulting Wind in school, and Jean then found out that her
  future lies in her seeing something in Korore, visiting and working part-time
  in a bakery, and that is all. As vague as it is, of course no one is stopping
  you from working there even as a career, but most importantly, what you choose
  to "broaden your horizons", is very jibunshidai (up to you). If it's something
  you can feel comfortable with, like the bakery owner's son carrying your
  luggage (lol Jean), or you not letting your teacher worry without keeping up your
  acting until you reach the toilet cubicle (lol okay me), it's all up to you.
  All in all, this episode did get me a bit, I like it actually, and I'm still
  glad it's under canon material. (<a href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/102184/ACCA__13-ku_Kansatsu-ka_PS" target="_blank">ACCA P.S.</a>&nbsp;is an elaboration of the past and future of the initial timeline, which
  is part adapted into this) So yeah, go live your dream out, people. My turn
  has yet to arrive, I believe, maybe that is why I'm still stuck in the rut and
  just doing whatever it is at work. I have my doubts too, seeing seniors leave
  and only people without much experience like me in the house, but I'm sure
  that will change over time. Until then... hey who knows? *lights a cigarette*
  Man, this series has all the feels, I can't believe I teared more in this than
  the reveal of Jean's early history as a kid. Oh well, you did it ACCA: You
  made real life look fantastically awesome once again.

Oh this week. Not much, actually, until I noticed there is a lot more than the
one release, but even then, we may not have much luck. Yeah, in 2021. I don't
even know how. <b>Kamiyama You's new single</b> is... not in full on Apple Music
(Japan) it seems, but nvm I did hear the B-side and didn't like it anyways so we
good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <b>Fujifabric's new album</b> of collaboration songs are a meh,
but I think I may want to give emotional songs so maybe their song with Hata
Motohiro (name rings a bell?) would do. I've yet to listen
<b>Kayano Ai's 10th anniversary mini-album</b> which likely will be her first
and only one solo because (1) it's Limited Edition so no subscription services
love and (2) it comes with the book so unless you buy the book you don't get the
CD. I literally just want them separately, I tell you. Kayanon why<br />
<br />
On news concerning music that is on Twitter and I swear this week there is quite
a lot because I had time to go look around,
<b>seven oops is doing acoustic livestreams</b> every once in a while on YouTube
but don't expect it to be packed with songs, there's a
<b>SPYAIR livestream for their upcoming album</b> end of March and translated to
every language known to man so I'm sure you know by now,
<b>vivid undress is releasing new songs every week</b> starting this week
leading to their new album, <b>SPECIAL OTHERS ACOUSTIC's new song</b> is
probably along with them doing live houses probably but I guess we won't get to
hear it just yet, <b>Friends' new music video</b> is nothing short of fantastic I'll enjoy the single next week, I suddenly wanted to see some
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMUWB9JhOjc/" target="_blank">MaRuRi-chan on Instagram</a>&nbsp;(Happy birthday too by the way, a week late but) and it took me a while
looking at her Story (because it's just showing a banner for an Anime) to know
that <b>MaRuRi to Ryuga's new single</b> releasing in May is their first tie-up
with Anime which... I probably will watch next season but we'll talk about that
end of the month.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, for next week, finally Friend's new single for Anime "Horimiya" I've never
looked forward to their releases this much until now lol, and we step off
Japanese songs for some Middle Kids new album because I like these Australians,
to be honest. No harm hearing more Alternative music while I'm at it<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay I better stop here. I will be joining the livestream counting down to Moeshi's birthday though, even though I kind of missed her and Itou Miku <strike>playing</strike> screwing up in "Overcooked 2" with fans lol don't worry I did the same with my cousins in Lunar New Year too haha. I'll do at least that. Don't ask me to donate lol I didn't for any of those VTubers, I won't for her too. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We shall see haha cya guys next time then, and until next time... Don't fall sick now. Really, just don't. *cough* It takes a lot to recover now, especially the swab test. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Bye<br />
