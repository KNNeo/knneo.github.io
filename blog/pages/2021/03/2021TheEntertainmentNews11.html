If liking you is an excuse to never have recognised you as a voice actress... I don't mind haha I'll make the exception (I kind of did that with Kayano Ai too anyways, two years before her role in "Hyouka")<div><br></div><div>And of course, I'm at this point pondering watching everything below for Sunday afternoon (because I played too much Red Dead Online in the morning) OR watching Moeshi's birthday livestream. What do you think I chose? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Come on, there's that ACCA OVA I haven't watched I gotta do those first man. Sorry Moeshi!!</div><div><br></div><div>NOT MIKU TOO!!! Haha that's not on me lol let's Anime<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BungouStrayDogsWan09><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I haven't left (my scalpel) inside one of my patients, haven't I?" Uh oh haha</div></blockquote>Yeah, hey, you felt anything moving inside you that's hurting you? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs09) where FINALLY Yosano-sensei gets a run on the jokes lol, we got the most stereotypical mistake in the surgery market: leaving stuff from the operation inside your patient(s). Well... then we just operate again? But her Ability will not trigger. Ah yes, we gotta beat them up and THEN do it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So firstly, Yosano losing her shit. Well, as in, losing her apparatus for surgery. You know, the usual stuff she does when her teammates get beaten into a pulp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So after searching her room, she deduces that it might be inside one of the recently operated members in the Agency. Haha, I mean, this is already a joke why aren't you laughing lol. She asked Atsushi and he seems fine but as Yosano did say he should've just checked like, scientifically, like say, open him up lmao okay I meant just do X-Ray. She didn't, thinks that Atsushi is just having food poisoning, and lets him go. Next, we have Tanizaki. I promise you, the moment she says that one pick-up line that we should ALL learn (lol) I already know where this is going. So yes, his <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> is eavesdropping nearby, as usual. Surprise surprise, she probably got mad. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, Tanizaki showed Yosano his body once again, thank goodness there isn't much in there lol, so she went for her last target Kunikida. Instead of doing it right as usual, Yosano phrased it such that stress can feel as bad as a scalpel in your body... I'm pretty sure the latter is worse lmao. So yeah, of the three questioned she technically only checked one properly, but it wasn't until Atsushi and Kyouka reminded her about the recent barbeque on the rooftop where she got drunk and used her scalpel for cooking... that she stopped harassing her teammates, I guess lol. Next up, another one of Dazai's lies strikes again. This time, it's about Atsushi's lunch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, you'll get what I mean in a moment. As Atsushi finishes his specially bought lunch this time around (man he must have saved for this I just eat so long as I'm healthy lmao), Dazai warns him about eating the "shrimp handle" lol I think the subs aren't doing too well but so is Dazai so whatever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> He then tells the weretiger he can plant that tail down on soil and grow new prawns- If you need a reminder or Ranpo-san to come in to tell you that it is not possible you should've just Googled the question and find out at some point lol. Again, it's Dazai bullsh*t level once again, so I'm not going to elaborate too much. Akutagawa believed it like an idiot though, good for him. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And all because someone was hinting Atsushi that he could also use some lunch... hey, Atsushi, got that deja vu yet? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Lastly, we have a drawing competition. Of people drawing you. It's Atsushi vs Dazai vs maybe Akutagawa at some point: Atsushi draws enough to make a kids' video and song about it (kudos to the composer for doing so much because seriously this series doesn't need a high budget lol), Dazai just draws all the stuff that doesn't exist, and I think our winner is Akutagawa. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, personal preference Kyouka's drawings, by the way. You see, in the series of war and terror and <em>terrible</em> jokes (haha) we be glad the only wholesomeness we get is <strike>Tanizaki and Naomi hugging</strike> Kyouka being cute, okay? It's not Thanksgiving but we must learn to be thankful for this series lol</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTwS0TbKw2ktDGJD4XMYL5e594wx9w_dkBWDXxJZjRou9qXp7IS4_EO6sAO2yffQrmDSg_wUVDW5IhMsMT8ynds1_OCEU70_YZUeeO5pRN8vHZ9L1_FyGoVep1Q2aUiaQWKWoEK4N_sWc/s320/straydogswan09_yosano2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I saw this and thought this is legit some romance Anime for a bit lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1519 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvuD3LSfde7eXmzx0l_Buzf8cbleyM9LAuS9K5XnivWWD4G1pRMezwSeNKMnN7PS4lTgOPqJS4saOeYOwObYqopihASY8-7gSBn_Yd_y4gLHxEskV35wvVD5FBfI__UN9UUwrgkn-tmUo/s320/straydogswan09_bbq.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Ah, just your casual barbeque on the rooftop lmao</table></div></div>P.S.

You're always cuddling with each other and stuff!!" Wait, Hori, you be describing a gay couple Miyamura and Tanihara aren't... that... haha</div></blockquote>Man, don't you like a jealous b*tch as your girlfriend- Please let me meet and date a jealous girlfriend haha preferably someone who's also horny FOR ME lmao. In this new episode (#Horimiya10) and in an alternate world where Tanihara and Miyamura are friends lol, we get the no-go from Hori. Yep, sorry, Miyamura. That's what happens when you be too good with people around you. Your girl starts getting jealous of... men? What? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't get this logic, but maybe Hori has something going on her thinking girls won't like her guy maybe I don't know. Okay, main characters aside because WHO CARES ABOUT THEM DUDE!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We got side characters on the ride this week, and man, what a tearjerker. No really, THIS is the stuff I signed up for, where secondary characters have better story than the main ones, don't ask me why. So, about that triangle relationship that is maybe there but we not sure. Firstly, about Yanagi's rejection from Yoshikawa. If you can remember some time ago the dude came to confess to our girl, and she said no. Problem is, she had to come up with an excuse. So guess what, she chose her guy bestie in school which is coincidentally who she has a crush on, Ishikawa, to act as her boyfriend. Like really, this couldn't get more worse. Because besides making Sakura sad because we learnt that too recently, it has also become more of a reality in school where people be talking about it so it probably made Sakura even sadder. Now who's the devil here lol. To add on, Yoshikawa did the thing where she lied upon Sakura on her relationship with Ishikawa probably leaving the girl heartbroken, and instead chose to talk it out with her friend Remi. What, you think she's going to help you spell out the truth even if you tell her? Yeah, Remi is totally right here: settle your own sh*t, b*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Sorry for the censors I gotta) Then, we get a hint from the sister. (Sorry <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/17215/Atsumi_Tanezaki target=_blank>Tanezaki Atsumi</a>, I only recognised you after I saw the credits) Because the sister gave way a big hint about Yuki-chan herself: she doesn't ask for something she wants until it's too late. Quoting from her childhood where she wanted a hairpin but only complained after the family went home... it's not good for you girl that's called missed opportunity. And to be honest? We have seen that a couple of times already, from even earlier where Sakura managed to make a move on Ishikawa before the Yanagi confession. So yeah, talking about my perspective? I can only say: people are innately evil. So take what you want before it's too late, I can tell you that much. It's not that we shouldn't feel for how others feel, but don't leave your desires hanging, that's the worst. Even her sis can see through her. But sis, Yuki-chan wants more than anything in the shopping mall. She wants a dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> OKAY MOVING ON!! Haha I really shouldn't. So, after cooping at home for a couple of days she decided to go back to school (I wished my compulsory education attendance was like university or high school in Japan) which worried her bestie ie. Hori and guess who, Ishikawa too because she turned her phone off. Problem is, Yuki-chan also saw a phone message which shocked her: the confession from Sakura to Ishikawa. Hmm... what do you think happened? Thing is though? She wasn't there to witness. Because hey, Sakura be "striking when the iron's hot and the snow isn't around", yeah? Eh? Wrong quote? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's a play on their names, in case you have wondered how the two talked on the rooftop, the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sakura target=_blank>cherry blossom</a> and <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yuki target=_blank>snow</a> thing. I'll let you enjoy the conversation, but suffice it to say as much as it's kinda dumb and they are still kinda like, friend thing going on here I assume, it wasn't clear as day on anyone that Ishikawa returned anyone's feelings, to be honest. He continued the lie to Sakura, and barely hinted on his interest to Yoshikawa... I know right; Ishikawa's the worst lmao thank goodness you don't deserve Hori lol. *gets beat up by Hori* A-Anyways, *ouch* But on Yuki-chan's perspective now, it made her seem like a bad person too. For people to go along with her lie even though she wants fair reality, is once again, only complaining about hers not being hers until it's too late. Hey, your rival chose to strike first, and you cheated by asking her to give him to you. Who's in the wrong now? Last but not least, we have some Sakura moments which I swear, I really feel bad for her now. And Sengoku, because I also don't know what to do for her anymore. Really shouldn't have stopped her in the room; we could've had a new insert song of Sakura crying outdoors lmao. All in all, fantastic episode which could've been longer because you know, this is a 4-koma adapted series and it's not "Toradora!" which drags like 12 episodes lol, but hey, I like it actually. Really feeling bad for Sakura-chan here just because Yoshikawa is ambivalent about her perspective in misaligned relationships. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Oh well. I wish this was more clear, but considering apprehensive Ishikawa and literal b*tch Yoshikawa (lol) I doubt anything will happen soon, but we got 2 episodes left, so let's hope this ends well. For Sakura though... <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> In other news, I think Ishikawa is going to get expelled lmao haha I WISH</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEkLfrgyGIUeZWHstkfOoqOcLaI5-6UiAVDc8vJfTlFWiM8JVkFDQS1ocCqVAgWTUUlRaQ3KQllCefYJTzKiMSEwaLacX-YlRSaqaVW49LyBf2Ziiviyi1_govkhFH72rCRtovERk-X1g/s0/horimiya10_crying.gif><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I think Sakura-chan deserves a GIF, no matter what it is</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5MxPjfSLkFlxmGeLH9M-APqH77OPaHD3zZh_fPoGaO8iOfJFHREcMs-8R59sshZB-785fgmaawlhiWLE0Is9xkKfru60J38tBwdgzLkj1ul7MEKd9oJiecpCTCto6fvVimlPBqmE-mFU/s320/horimiya10_couple1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Because look at these two <a href=https://jisho.org/search/riajuu target=_blank>normie</a> f**ks!! lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Ah, I see. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this special OVA episode which I've waited for years (#ACCARegards) I finally got around to it, and the subtitles might have sucked because it's "Reform First Anniversary" which will make more sense. Because as you might have recalled from the wonderful series back in 2017, the mellow mood yet heavy tensions of this series is what makes it special. From Jean's inspection of all... then 13 districts initiated also as a confirmation of an anti-coup, to knowing Jean and Lotta and their past with Nino, to the dispersal of the Chief Officers of ACCA... it has been quite a journey. And a year into its restructure, in general the younger generation have not felt any particular change in its future, and that shall be our discussion throughout this special episode. Really.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1pF1a1VTvW2kJrrQiW94k7G9p7HCdNDeLekgIcam0i81urb9JTZlnnDGxpEdxia5z7DX2SE3HW0Wx_2LAev0bI9pcu7fj9RcZwu9jBBR8Jt-RC1ciML1w-z7PpLGnwRpYqbMYf8p72mA/s0/accaregards_smoking.gif><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Trust me; One of the Cs in ACCA refers to "cigarette" lol<br>(The other C is "cute" because Lotta-chan, obviously)</table><div>Firstly, on Lotta. She's still studying, by the way, she's still young, and she's worried about her future. For her teacher is worried about her after giving her an assignment regarding career plans, and she has been acting weird ever since. Not like her brother Jean will know anything else since they hardly have time to communicate anyways, but as you can see, heavy tensions. On the other hand, we are introduced with a couple more characters to complete the story this time around. For one, newbie ACCA member under Jean called Parrot for some reason (lol it's not the subs it's literally spelled that, look at Jean's phone), is one of those youngsters who doesn't believe in the change of ACCA after its reformation of tops. Districts still believe they are the biggest, and ACCA only serves as an administration ground or even a middleman, to solve all their problems, like how Jean was suddenly asked to Birra to help their leader decide on what to showcase on the upcoming anniversary festival. Really, Parrot is not wrong; He could've done it himself. Actual like, soft skills in dealing with this I wouldn't elaborate too much considering the other is a newbie, but as we will see later, it's not just about wasting resources. Jean also believes this special team he is in is still rather important in these tying times, and maybe we shouldn't complain too much about work development lol that's literally me right now haha Jean thanks for the mind opener. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, we have the reunion. Well it's a reunion, to say the least, at least, between Nino and Jean. Again, they are not exactly same years because Nino is like in his 40s now lol, but you get the idea, Jean is also getting old lol what. He also shares his worries with him once in a while, and they touch on Lotta-chan. Man, even I'm getting worried lol. The best part about this is actually, that Parrot has like, a secret detective kind of group which is digging out the whereabouts of the former Five Chiefs of ACCA like he's the next Sherlock Holmes lmao. Man, maybe this is the only part that is not convincing me to be honest, but you get the idea. Heavy tensions, get what I mean?</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWndknWqcejt7CvYrqxCuDx0257Ew94KgSIF5Hq3jkvt_FNc2zMQEVjh9JIFhelTfGhEO_o4QIr-hLCmnEzOXM-MJyjGRwkCp52Iz7Ug35672dY5U_tCZBLn2QIJxAzMVXarLchf5Mcl0/s0/accaregards_lightsoff.gif><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Jean already has these feels even without being a parent</table><div>So, about Pine and Pastis, and the rumours around. The guys be hanging out in their districts as leaders now, probably kicking the active ones before them now that ACCA has kicked them back a notch lol. <strike>Having to deal with revenge</strike> Wait wait that one is Lilium, right? Ah, wrong person. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We also get to see the rare Owl appearance, as you may recall, Jean's boss is also secretly an undercover for the headquarters, checking on the Otus siblings as he can. So, he has to approach specifically Pine, to find out more. It's all mystery and all, and the other former Chief Spade is reluctant to move, waging with people to not go do Badon for some reason lol he's just lazy and loves to gamble. We are also introduced to Wind, Nino's teacher who is now the head of the school, but also, is a teach to Lotta, so yay, coincidences all around. Okay, so now comes the heavy stuff. What this Wind has for Nino is vitally important and I think you need to remember, is the idea of, as a grown-up looking over a child, to watch over them on their decisions. And for the recipient? It's up to them to decide, is what was told to Lotta-chan. Eventually, it's up to you to make a vague decision of career choice into something you can live with. That is, at least, what happened in my case. I was able to land on a job in which I am happy with, and am able to live out my career being a programmer. That, coming out from an Engineering Degree without much Computing Science background, is a big relief. Moving ahead, is the problem. So let's go back to talking about ACCA. And since Parrot has been (like a parrot) hawking about the former Chiefs meeting together and potentially starting something up during the festival so they can take control or whatever again his conspiracy theories are, it was all eventually put to rest once Jean suggested a visit to the current Chief, Mauve. If you remember this beautiful, beautiful woman which caught Jean's interest at some point hehe, she dismissed their thoughts and probably all the citizens during her speech in the festival too, by (1) assuring them that the reform doesn't represent big changes in ACCA doing its administrative and middleman role but will then require younger input in the future to show transition and (2) showing them the Furawau district letter from the not ACCA nation which of course, killed the idea of them initiating a revolt in any way, which is the precise reason they chose to leave quietly after being discovered of the coup. Despite Parrot's worries, it was all for nothing and Jean was right all along: There isn't anything going on, at least for now, about a coup on the nation. (Of course there isn't you idiot it has only been a year these things take at least 2 years lmao)</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjppoxCUArF8X2wBP1YmhqQmFEijl01UnDwykpiM00qMaR_Gp807x84hPKtGTjBgXoYnRj2y9DX_e6ZdxrX-CkEMxVuHdhcfBoQ4mCCgnngwlvSXRNWS2YdAXlrfPo4SLSYW7DdNUpvnQY/s320/accaregards_lotta1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>LOTTA-CHAN FEVER!!!

(Because why not)<br>Ponytail Lotta is only getting cuter and I love it</table></div></div><div><br></div><div>Lastly, about Lotta's future. She finally then sat down to talk with his brother after consulting Wind in school, and Jean then found out that her future lies in her seeing something in Korore, visiting and working part-time in a bakery, and that is all. As vague as it is, of course no one is stopping you from working there even as a career, but most importantly, what you choose to "broaden your horizons", is very jibunshidai (up to you). If it's something you can feel comfortable with, like the bakery owner's son carrying your luggage (lol Jean), or you not letting your teacher worry without keeping up your acting until you reach the toilet cubicle (lol okay me), it's all up to you. All in all, this episode did get me a bit, I like it actually, and I'm still glad it's under canon material. (<a href=https://myanimelist.net/manga/102184/ACCA__13-ku_Kansatsu-ka_PS target=_blank>ACCA P.S.</a> is an elaboration of the past and future of the initial timeline, which is part adapted into this) So yeah, go live your dream out, people. My turn has yet to arrive, I believe, maybe that is why I'm still stuck in the rut and just doing whatever it is at work. I have my doubts too, seeing seniors leave and only people without much experience like me in the house, but I'm sure that will change over time. Until then... hey who knows? *lights a cigarette* Man, this series has all the feels, I can't believe I teared more in this than the reveal of Jean's early history as a kid. Oh well, you did it ACCA: You made real life look fantastically awesome once again.</div><div>[ROMAJI FEVER!!

Not much, actually, until I noticed there is a lot more than the one release, but even then, we may not have much luck. Yeah, in 2021. I don't even know how. <b>Kamiyama You's new single</b> is... not in full on Apple Music (Japan) it seems, but nvm I did hear the B-side and didn't like it anyways so we good. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b>Fujifabric's new album</b> of collaboration songs are a meh, but I think I may want to give emotional songs so maybe their song with Hata Motohiro (name rings a bell?) would do. I've yet to listen <b>Kayano Ai's 10th anniversary mini-album</b> which likely will be her first and only one solo because (1) it's Limited Edition so no subscription services love and (2) it comes with the book so unless you buy the book you don't get the CD. I literally just want them separately, I tell you. Kayanon why<br><br> On news concerning music that is on Twitter and I swear this week there is quite a lot because I had time to go look around, <b>seven oops is doing acoustic livestreams</b> every once in a while on YouTube but don't expect it to be packed with songs, there's a <b>SPYAIR livestream for their upcoming album</b> end of March and translated to every language known to man so I'm sure you know by now, <b>vivid undress is releasing new songs every week</b> starting this week leading to their new album, <b>SPECIAL OTHERS ACOUSTIC's new song</b> is probably along with them doing live houses probably but I guess we won't get to hear it just yet, <b>Friends' new music video</b> is nothing short of fantastic I'll enjoy the single next week, I suddenly wanted to see some <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CMUWB9JhOjc/ target=_blank>MaRuRi-chan on Instagram</a> (Happy birthday too by the way, a week late but) and it took me a while looking at her Story (because it's just showing a banner for an Anime) to know that <b>MaRuRi to Ryuga's new single</b> releasing in May is their first tie-up with Anime which... I probably will watch next season but we'll talk about that end of the month. <br><br> So, for next week, finally Friend's new single for Anime "Horimiya" I've never looked forward to their releases this much until now lol, and we step off Japanese songs for some Middle Kids new album because I like these Australians, to be honest. No harm hearing more Alternative music while I'm at it<br><br><br><br><br> Okay I better stop here. I will be joining the livestream counting down to Moeshi's birthday though, even though I kind of missed her and Itou Miku <strike>playing</strike> screwing up in "Overcooked 2" with fans lol don't worry I did the same with my cousins in Lunar New Year too haha. I'll do at least that. Don't ask me to donate lol I didn't for any of those VTubers, I won't for her too. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> We shall see haha cya guys next time then, and until next time... Don't fall sick now. Really, just don't. *cough* It takes a lot to recover now, especially the swab test. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Bye<br><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
