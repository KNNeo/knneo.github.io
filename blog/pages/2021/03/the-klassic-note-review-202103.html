  Yep, it was yesterday. But seeing as there are so many things happening
  yesterday, I postponed it just a little bit to today. I hope you are not
  disappointed at me, Marinka. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Now that I've given you
  enough of a hint on what is starting Klassic Note Review this year, let's get
  to it I guess! Surprisingly, it's the onset of releasing new songs in not
  conventional ways that is going to make these decisions a lot harder than you
  think. Friends' new single released recently only had a Limited Edition with
  one track but we're not reviewing that just because haha
</div>

  (Somehow I'm glad she's looking at me on the Regular Edition; Not saying

</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: This probably was a long time coming, but just coincidentally, it has
  to happen on her birthday. If you need an introduction, you shall get one.
  Meet Kouno Marika, Japanese voice actress, member of idol group Earphones, so
  she does have the singing abilities nailed down at some point. She also
  starred in other productions like SOROR and obviously, a trouper in Anime
  character and/or theme songs throughout her career. The extension towards solo
  music career this year is just an exhibition to not just her popularity, but
  also maybe, her prowess in showing the music industry something different,
  something voice actors have been known for for years. And this one, if there
  isn't something we can talk about, I wouldn't be here in the first place. So,
  shall we?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (1) Yume Mitai, Demo Yume Janai [(It's) Like (A) Dream, But (It's) Not (A)
  Dream]
</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "(It's) like (a) dream, but (it) feels to certain, for (a) future that might
    happen
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (The) little wishes are now, gathering and shining<span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (It's) not (a) dream, because (I) can call out, all those emotions
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Tomorrow (I) shall, filled with excitement, (my) greedy story (ahead)"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  Pretty adequately titled even for her debut song, the catchy song and positive
  looking lyrics probably are staple to any idol-based music artist, and this is
  no exception. I would argue though, as I heard this initially at the start of
  the year, I wasn't nearly impressed, and just thought this is just another one
  of those songs they all sing as the first single, as a signal of haphazard
  production to cash in on their popularity. On closer inspection though, it is
  truly representative for the artist herself, for even being able to have a
  solo music career is kind of a dream come true for her, since it is a
  privilege not reserved for all. The lyrics bring about a more positive yet
  encouraging mood, telling a tale of chasing dreams and the emotions
  throughout, it is no doubt saying of someone's maiden debut. The melody is
  catchy though and I would pick on the one note they had to offset at the end
  of the chorus which will make you remember, but otherwise you actually get a
  real nice flow. Even the bridge of the song brings you back in, and it's short
  enough to make you come back for more.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Dream-Like Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) I tie U</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Take (my) hand, spinning and spinning like a top, more
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Come come, ditch away all your worries that have stagnated
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (In) slightly tipsy consciousness, mix and blend round and around
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (Blending) into one, all worth of emotions
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Messy and mixed up</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">This heart squeeze and tied up"</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>
  Wow, this is probably one of the recent compelling songs I have to give this
  year, I promise you. For if you have known of Kouno Marika herself and her
  acting, you would have seen the... more mature side of her in action. This
  might be that manifestation of it, and I swear, I want more. Because despite
  the song having like a change in pace in the second verse, and having a
  unlikely transition compared to the usual idol positive moods, this one is
  nothing but allure and smooth paces, from melody to lyrics, she is just here
  to captivate and catch your attention in the most matured way this cute lady
  can do. And I tell you, it is working on me, to say the least. The lyrics
  emphasize quite a lot on the feelings of love, but in a more forceful manner,
  and desperate in approach, as if she was dragging instead of inviting you into
  love. All in all, it's sort of a song you hear in fancy bars, but this one is
  reserved for the back room. I don't even know how to describe this to make
  this not sound rated, to be honest.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Slightly Fall Short Below Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: Kouno Marika is not for everyone, I'll admit. Her high pitched
  voice does not fit her now more matured personality and image, but
  nonetheless, this step into music will not be her last, and it's definitely
  not a dream. For a long time coming too, and I can't believe what I have known
  of her can manifest like this so well. For the casual listener though, it is
  your usual debut single vibe, which means easy listening songs, perhaps an
  appetizer to what she can do in the future. And I'm very hopeful.
</div>

  <span style="font-size: large;"> And also!!</span> Because I guess the SCANDAL
  girls deserve this single track release...

  (They could've come up with a better cover, but I can understand why once I
  saw inside the booklet, so that's fine I guess) (It was hands on top of each

</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: I guess it's their turn after Chatmonchy in 2012, huh. Cue SCANDAL,
  probably one of the most popular female bands in Japan known worldwide, and
  incoming to the 15th anniversary of the band, if I am not wrong they are
  releasing new singles throughout the year, and this is the first of them.
  Within these 15 years, we have seen them get popular from songs written for
  this girl's Rock band, to them writing their own, and only getting better
  after changing music labels into their own independent label of music and
  fashion. This, is how far they have come. This is just the appetizer,
  basically, of what they have to offer today, which might be different in my
  opinion, but it's still very them. Here is why.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) eternal</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div>
  <div style="text-align: center;"></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Shining bright, that light, leave it (aside)</div><div style="text-align: center;">Pouring down, (the) shower of love</div><div style="text-align: center;">Please, (my) heart, release it</div><div style="text-align: center;">Let (us) feel the world of kindness"</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"></div>
</div>
<div>
  Ah, the song of eternity. Simplicity, would be the topic of this song, and it
  will therefore last, in all eternity. This is what I felt when I heard this
  song. The melody is simple with a strong production backend which is not
  exactly from them but will make an impression nonetheless. The lyrics are more
  meaningful than ever, talking about dreams beyond the situation we live in
  now, reaching out to feel the world out there, especially love. And that, I
  give a salute to members RINA and MAMI for making this song happen. Period.
  It's that good.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Stunningly Above Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) eternal (TOWA TEI REMIX)</div>
<div>
  I'm not going to comment too much because as usual, remixes and instrumental
  only tracks are not part of the review, but I would like to point out how
  different this is from the original, though both produced not with Rock vibes.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: There you have it. It's only a single track, but it can make so
  many waves to make you remember. Who says making impact must be writing
  sophisticated lyrics, complicated beats, or even off-note singing? This is an
  easy representative of what pushing for perfection feels like. It's good,
  impressive, and be sure to get your attention at a glance. SCANDAL now has
  more than been just a name. They travel far and wide to sound what they are
  today, and this is pure evidence.
</div>

<div>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (Okay please tell me how sarcastic I sometimes sound to praise these guys
  because I'm not, okay? Passion is what drives me to click on the order button
  for these things lol)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE PACKAGE</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ClUEo10IAb0/YFNedEpqnSI/AAAAAAABDK4/w8yRiRfCR1sdrFO4FrrxMdQR0gyumV1ZQCPcBGAsYHg/s320/PXL_20210318_133918489.jpg" width="320" />
</div>
<div>
  So okay, quick one about the package. I was just chilling with deciding with
  Marinka's single, but clearly, SCANDAL was just around the corner, so I just
  had to wait. That is why they have arrived together or else I would have to
  pay shipping twice at this point. Still, it was worth the wait, and here they
  are.
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e-EypO3O8nU/YFNegg8UCiI/AAAAAAABDK8/3o_uJHLCugcsT3RjdBasMxWX52CX-yllACPcBGAsYHg/s320/PXL_20210318_123359399.jpg" width="320" />
</div>
<div>
  For Marinka's single, I must say looking inside the package, I was real
  disappointed at the lack of... a lot of things, to be honest, because the lack
  of image prints (which is why I only showed you the cover) and proper designs
  for the text (see the text on the covers for both editions) and credits within
  the book (ie. you don't see a list of people involved inside the booklet, only
  on the CD case) really hinted on not a haphazard, but lower budget production
  even for her debut single. Debut single, guys. You can put in more effort in
  trying to rip off our money lol because seriously go buy a MusicRay'n or PONY
  CANYON single and take a look inside or something haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  For the special gift though, this is what I took time to think about, and now
  that I see what the package is, I'm glad I took my time to decide. *looks at
  chat with friend* Haha so as usual I consulted my bro for what he liked, and I
  did think a lot through this for all of them are actually good, those with
  bromides, and it took me a while to end up firstly, with the
  <a href="https://columbia.jp/kohnomarika/images/tokuten_2102-04.jpg" target="_blank">Gamers</a>
  one. (Why is this preview so small...?) Though, despite how good the
  <a href="https://columbia.jp/kohnomarika/images/tokuten_2102-05.jpg" target="_blank">Sofmap</a>
  and
  <a href="https://columbia.jp/kohnomarika/images/tokuten_2102-10.jpg" target="_blank">Tower Records</a>
  ones looked, and if I didn't remember wrongly
  <a href="https://columbia.jp/kohnomarika/images/tokuten_2102-09.jpg" target="_blank">Neowing</a>
  (or CDJapan as internationally known) ran out of stock as I saw it on release
  date by the way, I instead loved the
  <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OYQ0K0YOwMc/YFNexVH4EwI/AAAAAAABDLE/YzZEpMzYEBEoKgCnQtSZnEJCOU1IX_EDwCPcBGAsYHg/s320/PXL_20210317_125939258.jpg" target="_blank">Toranoana</a>
  one so much I chose that in the end instead. It was also one of the few online
  stores which will pair you with the special gift as a listed item, so YOU KNOW
  whether you'll be getting it instead of being disappointed at not receiving
  one by the time it reaches shipping. No really, been there done that lol
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gbmtIjaf0LI/YFNeslTBZqI/AAAAAAABDLA/GMfmmItRXGUQ4uOl7_iaAiQg8m-LUr7dQCPcBGAsYHg/s320/PXL_20210318_124740660.jpg" width="320" />
</div>
<div>
  SCANDAL's single is just simple, so I'm not going to complain too much about
  it. I can even say this is a Limited single, as I could only find stock on
  their parent music label VICTOR STORE, but I'll close one eye on that. Much
  effort has been made in ensuring the CD doesn't rub against the paper-based
  sleeve so they added in a plastic sleeve which is nice, so even though this is
  the same price compared to the other one above, I would say this might be a
  better package in itself, no joke. Come on, it's only one song here and they
  did more than a standard single wtf
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay I'm done haha. It's only Thursday, I wanna play more Red Dead Online, I
  also gotta shower, so I'll cut my enthusiasm here and continue in the shower
  (<em>"ai no shower~"</em>) (yes, a quote from SCANDAL's song) if I have to lol.
  No really, this is one of those graphs where I couldn't even give a damn about
  these two singles until I listened to them in review. That is how Klassic Note
  Review works now I guess. If that is so, can't wait to be surprised by more
  releases, I guess. I mean, we might get RYTHEM back what could be better?
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time then, oh and I think I better update on the Titans
  Anime this week for it got effectively cancelled. Excuse me while I go listen
  to sexy Marinka singing and tying me up haha ikr you give me a song titled "I
  tie U" you can NOT think of lewd stuff hehe bye
</div>
<div><br /></div>

  P.S. Alternative title for this post: "Is Marinka
