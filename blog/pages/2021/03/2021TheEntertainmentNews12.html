Ah, I think it's coming back again, this cough. *cough*
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Ugh, totally sucks by the way, but I still have to work because I think I took
  enough MC for the month that I shouldn't take too many, and also they just
  incremented by salary. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, suck it up I guess lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I spent quite a lot of this weekend still playing Red Dead Online (I mean, I'm
  only halfway through the Roles), and also watching Hololive VTubers playing
  first time a new game of situational awareness called "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/minna" target="_blank">Minna</a>
  de
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kuukiyome" target="_blank">Kuuki Yome</a>.
  3" and boy is it interesting to see reactions from the purest who know nothing about the series and/or normies to those who hate normies lol hey walking behind I would've pushed that dude
  off into the river too haha *cough*

  Okay, after you have done with looking at the recent Klassic Note Review be
  sure to read on for more Anime talk, yes? Oh yeah, I forgot to update last
  week's, but <a href="https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/status/1371385795123109890?s=19" target="_blank">"Attack on Titan" met a TV simulcast in Japan</a>&nbsp;where an
  earthquake affected airing on some stations and they postponed it to this
  week, so two episodes back to back. Yes, and that also affected worldwide
  distribution. Industry first incident? Well, first time I saw it though tbh<br />

    </div>

  <div>
    Man, even the President is trying to defend Ranpo-san's honour but
    seriously, it's hard because he behaves like a kid lmao. In this new episode
    (#BungouStrayDogs10) where since they talked about barbeque recently and
    they can't reuse material we are having hotpot instead, I guess. So, let's
    talk more story, and does it feel like it's already ending soon? How the
    time has passed on this short series, isn't it? Firstly, the hotpot. If you
    have seen the eyecatch on the formula for Dazai to make hotpot, you (1) get
    Atsushi to buy the ingredients as usual and (2) ask Kunikida to cook.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See? It's <em>that</em> easy lol. Well, for one, I don't think anyone wants
    to have a taste of Dazai's cooking even if it's just dumping stuff into a
    pool of soup base, but hey, what do I know about cooking haha. And good
    chances the hotpot had to be made multiple times so it won't accidentally
    get cleared by Naomi who thought it'll be a good idea to give it to her
    brother... and you know, feed him in the process F**K YOU TANIZAKI haha oh
    well I don't have an
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> what do
    I know about the happiness/sadness of having one lol. Yosano and Ranpo are jerks for
    destroying the food meant for them to eat especially with Kunikida doing
    everything, and Kyouka-chan is me if I'm not picky lmao. Dazai is obviously
    not eating because you can barely recognize him in on camera because he looks so big
    after taste-testing lol. Then, it's everyone going to watch the one movie.
    You know, the one Chuuya has been wanting to watch for a while, one with
    cute doggos but he thinks it's weird for him to watch it. I mean, it will be
    weird if
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/196/Kishou_Taniyama" target="_blank">his voice actor</a>
    went to watch it for his age lol. But as Chuuya took the lift Atsushi accidentally ended up
    in the same lift/elevator with him, so, uh... well it's not Dazai/Chuuya or
    Akutagawa/Atsushi combinations so we shouldn't have to worry too much lol.
    Anyways, there was quite a blackout, Atsushi thought Chuuya is screwing with
    him using the lift, and when power was restored the movie was cancelled. So
    yeah, don't ask Dazai to go watch a movie with Chuuya, please, Atsushi.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, it might be two months too early, but summer. And summer
    means <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yukata" target="_blank">yukata</a>, fireworks, and Dazai's departure...? Hmm, somehow that seems
    like an offset to the actual drama which might be used to conclude this
    season, but who knows? They may have taken this too seriously though lol I
    mean look at the ending sequence. All in all, if you want more wholesome
    content from this series this is as much as you will get to be honest, and
    we know the cow is MVP lol it's in the gatherings I can't even

    So who the f**k is Shuu? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I guess we will find out in this new
    episode (#Horimiya11) because they be talking about siblings- By the way I
    have an
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">onee-san</a>. I
    don't call her that because I'm not Japanese but you know how much I want a
    younger sister already so... Haha let's move on. So, firstly, sausage fest
    if you would like to call it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay don't look up on it I'm worried
    about the ratings here now lol. (Yeah if there is any) We are introduced to more
    characters? Man, we're near the end though lol. Cue most extroverted (in
    school) character... let's call him Iura (Shuu, is his name), though windbag
    might be a better term lmao. Okay, about this guy, he's kinda annoying, he's
    loud, he doesn't care about others... unless we be talking about his younger
    sister but we'll cover that in a while, but hey, with all the guys hanging
    out and Hori leaving and Sawada being uncomfortable you would have wondered.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, just playing around with friendships, I guess, and it's
    great to see how all the classmates are hanging out nicely, unlike...
    mine...? I don't know man look at my Facebook feed. *sees all marriage
    announcements* Okay f**k me then. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It was fun to watch all the
    hijinks at least, and yes Honoka is cute I'll keep saying that until they
    can come up with a new girl. Okay, Iura's imouto Motoko-chan is also kinda
    cute, and she might be our focus in a moment. But between Honoka liking Iura
    so long as he keeps his mouth shut (lol) as evidenced by him helping her
    out, to like, Iura being a brother to his sibling... he's all sorts of
    things put together, I guess. I mean, the imouto
    just described him as an introvert... like... her haha nice joke
    Motoko-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And I guess, as that is a more heavy topic anyways and
    as if episodes of Miyamura being emo about his past isn't bad enough, let's
    talk about Motoko's future. She got mocked by the teacher for opting for a
    better school which may or may not accept her, and thank goodness the
    brother chose to help her by putting her in with Hori-san the ace student,
    and hopefully by then, we can have the one attempt at chasing our dreams.
    Hey, lucky you Motoko-chan I don't have such connections to get me into a
    good school you should thank your brother. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, unless you
    want me to talk about the hijinks specifically, I'm still technically crying
    over Sakura's rejection last episode lol, and yeah, just be the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/burakon" target="_blank">brocon</a> that
    you might be Motoko-chan and join your bro in the same school. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    That'll get Honoka jealous lmao haha what (Then again not possible because 3
    years apart and high school is 3 years)
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; If you like cute girls in this series this episode is it hehe wait
    Motoko is
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/72467/Motoko_Iura" target="_blank">Kanemoto Hisako</a>? How?? lol]

    Hey, we did miss last week's episode because of an earthquake in Japan but
    you know, I'll take two episodes this week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Japan can stay safe.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, now for the bonanza that will only happen once in don't know
    how many years because I don't binge watch Anime, we will double down on this and start with last
    week's episode (#AttackOnTitan73) where we left off with Eren appearing in
    that restaurant then. So firstly, the talks. I mean, if it went well there
    wouldn't be any drama to watch, so yeah, I'll talk about the less emotional
    points that Mikasa is still on about lol. Hey, I have always thought Mikasa
    was cool, but not this episode. So, the main point is besides the two not
    BFFs not telling him about where Zeke is because unlikely they will and we
    will get to that later, Eren is also egging on the two to talk about what he
    has right now: freedom. I mean, those Americans don't and are still wearing
    masks so you don't have it too, but suffice it to say Armin just wants that
    status quo so he doesn't believe he's still part of Bertholdt which he had
    consumed to stay alive, and Mikasa as an Ackerman and... yeah she's a woman,
    okay? What, we going about the misogynist thing again when it's literal evil
    in front of us right now? Not talking about you, Gabi. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, in
    the end Armin got beaten into a pulp because who knows how much Eren has
    been practicing in the gym lol, and Mikasa is heartbroken. Goodbye childhood
    memories then; Eren wants to be God now lmao. Next up, Zeke's escape from
    Levi... sort of. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because seriously if you thought that would
    happen, don't even think about it. Bury it with your hopes to be successful
    and rich in life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As of last time because Levi knows his squad is left on
    their own and likely will be revealed of their location at any time, Levi is
    intending to disable Zeke as a human first so that he can't do anything
    funny to the gang of 30 odd troops here... or has he? So yep, Levi doesn't
    know about the wine and I'm glad he likes tea because me too bro we two be
    the only ones to live- I probably will be dead being trampled by one of
    those transformed Titans because of Zeke's cry triggering his spinal fluids
    on those who drank his wine. Yes, it's literally called his wine part of him
    is in it. So yep, just like last time and actually Levi thanks for the
    reminder, he has to, once again, take down his comrades. Not first time
    already, apparently. So yeah, Zeke is not leaving in one piece, to say the
    least. And at this point Eren isn't with him to any extent, so why is he
    taking the risk to escape? What an idiot haha. Lastly, Floch and his gang (I
    don't like that "Jeagerists" term I don't want to bow down to Zeke lol)
    managed to reach the military from within so likely he took over the
    developed area with the army already, even including the new troops who beat
    up their commander into a pulp. Because you know, evil. Not young people are
    evil now, but Floch did say whoever doesn't goes to jail, so it's probably
    just the five who said they want to join that side. The others just poked at
    his body lol. Hange? Just tell him the location; Levi wouldn't be there
    anymore anyways you can live another day. Just one more day, maybe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  </div>
  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "Since we can't leave, we have to live here until we die" Trust me, sir,
      that is WAY better lol

    We quickly move on to next episode (#AttackOnTitan74) where now that Zeke
    has literally a missile to his abdomen, he recalls a time where his glasses
    were still on his face, or even before. But seriously, why encourage him to
    change this world though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay now that Zeke has done half the
    world over already, let's see what this flashback has to offer. So, the
    reveal. Firstly, we talk about Zeke's family, when they were in Marley. Yes,
    they weren't actually on the island before. I was wrong all this while,
    because I thought the father was in the island first. But if you remember
    the narrative from even season one, you would notice Eren's dad had to have come
    from somewhere. Somewhere, huh. *raises eyebrows* So yeah, Zeke was
    influenced as a kid mainly by two parties; the Marleys who told them the
    lies, and his parents who told them the truth. He gets to know both, so he
    probably already realized the brainwash as a kid which many do not even
    at his age. Still, he tries to live the life trying to be a Warrior to save
    his family from being in a lower social status probably as you can remember,
    and well, it has not been going well. Problem is, the father was rather
    persistent about his son being one of the Warriors. We'll talk about that a
    bit. Next, we talk about Ksaver. Besides having a weird name, he is one of
    those commanders... who coincidentally has the Beast Titan power. Hey, what
    do you think happened after his time was up? You see, if your dad doesn't
    want to play baseball with you... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But as you can see, Ksaver feels
    like as if Hange as Beast Titan powers: he rather research about Titans than
    be one. Haha anyways, that's how you know the past memories of Titans, he was really the only one who still didn't see Zeke's
    efforts as trash, and then also realized that his parents have been lying to
    him. Okay, not like the Marleys have been telling the truth, but yeah, it's
    that third perspective we have all waited for, as Ksaver dropped him on the
    truth from his years of research into Titan powers and of its history.
    Because, the best way to save this world of humans, is to eliminate of the
    Titans. By, you know, getting the Founding Titan to change Eldian
    constitution such that they can't bear kids. (Man, I'll f**k chicks all day
    until I die where got time to be a Titan haha what) So yeah, in short, the euthanization of Eldians. And yeah, might be too early for the drop, but
    there you go. He was also told by Ksaver about the actual solution to this
    disaster, which is what we already know from Zeke's grand plan, to get a
    royalty of Eldians to take the founding Titan power, and then... it's up to
    them. So yeah, he still gotta do the influencing on Historia or something,
    but you get the idea. Then, to Eren. He then also found out that the father,
    besides being an Eldian Restorian which greatly increases their chances to
    get thrown into the pit and sent to the island to... you know, get killed by
    Levi lol thank goodness that didn't happen, but also, his dad even survived
    and had another kid out there, on the island. And interestingly, by the time
    Zeke had a chance to talk with his brother, did he find out that Eren was
    thinking the same way too, thinking his dad is poop and war should stop with
    the Eldians. Man, the best thing about having family for Zeke right now (and
    I swear he's wet down there lol), is he has such a brother who can
    understand the guy who raised them was a total idiot. So, so
    bliss. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, that's as long of memories as we have for now, but I
    think it's enough to justify Zeke's apparent suicide with him pulling the
    pin on himself, probably ripping Levi apart in the process, firing the
    missile at point blank range. My guess? Levi will be better off than Zeke,
    and he'll take over the Titan powers to survive just like Armin. I hope you can see where this is
    going. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Man, can't wait until I have to see more Titan fights, but
    we may have to wait. Thank goodness these two episodes come in back to back,
    because next week looking at the preview it's BORING haha cya guys then

    There isn't much this week, so let's go over them quick.
    <b>Friend's new single</b> is single track, so guess if I gave it or not- No
    Klassic Note Review as it is clearly labelled as Limited Edition and we
    don't do that here. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <b>Middle Kids' new album</b> is kinda okay I
    guess, but I will need some time to give more songs, if they weren't already
    hard enough to give. Hey, Alternative music is rough, okay? I like it but
    it's also not easy to accept imo<br />
    <br />On news concerning Twitter and music of which I care about because I
    need to spend time reading my timeline every day,
    <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song</b> is a meh but you can watch the music
    video to get something to get hooked on lol,
    <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new video</b> on YouTube is from a recent live so
    if&nbsp; you like some Mia-san (who still wouldn't show her face on camera)
    you're welcome, <b>Takahashi Rie's new song</b> got credited for an upcoming
    drama which is kinda cool for any voice actor's music debut tbh,
    <b>LuckLife is releasing a new digital single</b> in April,
    <b>SHE's released a new live video</b> on YouTube featuring their new song
    they are getting a lot of publicity here, and last but not least
    <b>RYTHEM announced a livestream</b> upcoming May after nearly a decade from
    disbandment back from their album in 2010. yucat-san and Niitsu Yui-san,
    tell me what will happen, yes? I'm rather excited but I don't think it's
    that but maybe they will be coming back after all, I don't know. We could
    use some of them to pad this year's songs though tbh but maybe it's also
    just a reunion stream how would I know haha<br />
    <br />
    Looks like I get to take a break next week, but from the looks of it there
    are new releases from many artists I know of according to <a href="https://skream.jp/" target="_blank">Skream</a>, so let's
    see if <b>YUKI's new single</b>, <b>FINLANDS' new album</b>, and
    <b>Base Ball Bear's new single</b> will make next week a little different.
    We have heard of Base Ball Bear earlier this year so maybe that's a
    start.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Okay I'm done. I'm coughing way more than I have to so I better wrap up and
    go sleep early in case I have to spend more time coughing than sleeping
    throughout the night lol. Cya guys next time then, and until then... Really,
    when here is more interesting than my life right now... Haha okay bye I
    prefer not to think too much all is well in everyday life isn't it?<br />
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    P.S. Seriously thinking of continuing the trend of new photobook reviews
    until I realized I did review Marinka's photobook even then which is not
    released in the same year so... maybe Kana-chan's photobook from last year
    (before she is married) now? We shall see there is no trigger for this
    though and who knows if she is releasing another photobook hehe- No?</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    P.P.S. Yes Koga Aoi is now in my watchlist as seen from my GitHub page also
    <a href="https://twitter.com/_m_aaii" target="_blank">Kanno Mai</a> I guess
    she is the main in Anime "IDOLY PRIDE",
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMkD33dldv4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">she was cute</a>
    in Wednesday night's livestream, so...
