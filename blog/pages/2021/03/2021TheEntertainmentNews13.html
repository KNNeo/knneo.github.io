Yep, it has been another week already, guys. Remember anything? I only
remembered what I did in this weekend lol
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span><br /><br />I was playing a lot of Red Dead Online, yes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>

  Anyways, next week's gonna be great since it'll be one of those shorter weeks
  thanks to a public holiday, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to be in Hell
  for the first half of the week, so yeah wish me luck haha. Otherwise, you'd be
  pleased to know that as time passes, I gotta think of what to get for my mom's
  birthday (FYI her phone screen is a flower now lol so that), I gotta think of
  what to do on Friday when next week's over haha and hopefully not repeat that
  hospital visit from years ago... You don't know that haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anime time, I guess. And we did give a couple of new songs this week too, so
  yeah, those. New season Anime will be ruining my Sundays already I have given
  the head start to HOW MANY SHOWS?? lol<br />
  <br />

  Well I already know what I want to watch next season already thanks to plenty
  of Twitter and online promotions from the voice actresses I follow so man,
  will this be an awesome season ahead. Here are my opinions for those shows and
  whatever others which I probably wouldn't give a care about lol:
  <div>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        Attack on Titan is already ending soon and
        <b>"Boku no Hero Academia"</b> is still going, huh. Thanks for the theme
        songs anyways lol
      </li>
      <li>
        It's not even April and we may already have new shows hitting my alley
        with <b>"Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui"</b> [Premiers 29th March 2021]
        where it's me soon in my 30s and thinking that the one high schooler
        saving my life is actually in love with me. Hey, bro, fantasies aside,
        you need to find a partner. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yes, VERY reflective of me soon but
        this is funnier and it's not me so we can watch it haha
      </li>
      <li>
        So <b>"Yakunara Mug Cup mo"</b> is just pottery slice-of-life? Man,
        when's the last time I sat down and watched one of those genres... We'll
        see. Not that keen though since pottery isn't that a thing for me tbh
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>"Mashiro no Oto"</b> is quite literally "K-ON!" but instead of
        electric guitars you play with the
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shamisen" target="_blank">shamisen</a>. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, if you are a fan of Japanese culture...
      </li>
      <li>
        Wow <b>"Yuukoku no Moriarty"</b> already got 2nd season remember they
        were just starting like, last year? Didn't watch it though haha
      </li>
      <li>
        Man, if <b>"Hige wo Soru. Soshite Joshikousei wo Hirou."</b> [Premiers
        5th April 2021] is not fulfilling some of otaku's (my) desires I can't
        even say more. Just the premise of the story is probably enough to play
        even just harem with three people, let alone just the idea of a woman
        staying in your abode... I need to move out of my parent's house haha
        you can do SO MUCH alone hehe
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>"Odd Taxi"</b> is basically just "POP TEAM EPIC" but it's animals and
        the stage is just the one vehicle. Heck, they can just do a musical
        version of this where it's only the one cab model on stage and it
        would've worked lol. Or what was that Anime with animals again? Haha I
        don't remember
      </li>
      <li>
        "Yakunara Mug Cup mo" may be about pottery, but if motorcycles are your
        thing why not try <b>"Super Cub"</b>? Man, these interest based
        slice-of-life is only turning me away- Where are all those ones with
        just cute girls like <strike>"Kiniro Mosaic"</strike> "Acchi Kocchi" or
        "Slow Start"? Haha
      </li>
      <li>
        You sure <b>"Blue Reflection Ray" </b>is not like, a
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yuri" target="_blank">yuri</a>?
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Boy, my bro be so happy with all those RPG-based and
        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a>-based Anime this season lol he'll tell me about it
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>"Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san"</b> [Premiers 10th April 2021] is
        basically like "Uzaki-chan" if you haven't seen the similarities but
        instead of shy Oozora Naomi with an accent, sadist Uesaka Sumire is
        taking over as main now. Uh, if you are not a fan of tanned women I
        can't help but I'll even forgive myself just to watch this for a couple
        of episodes to see if Nagataro can win against Uzaki in. ANY. WAY.
        POSSIBLE. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We are not pitting the voice actresses' racks against
        each other btw haha (Tell me there is a hentai of this series lmao) (I
        see my bullied past in this and I don't like it lol)
      </li>
      <li>
        The first one considered for this season is already decided last season
        with <b>"Osananajimi ga Zettai ni Makenai Love Comedy"</b> [Premiers
        14th April 2021] (also known as "OsaMake") because it has everything we
        want in a harem: It's Minase Inori who is your childhood friend and
        can't lose and is probably sadist, Sakura Ayane is the one you like,
        Oonishi Saori is acting young again (lmao), and... Matsuoka is the main
        guy. I can't even describe how fantastic this cast is lol they literally
        picked the Anime industry standard harem voice actor in this. Other than
        that, I'm just here to see jealous teasing Inorin, so don't mind me haha
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      So yeah, how many shows is that I just wanted to watch one episode of??
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You know I want my weekends playing Red Dead Online, right?
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again I'm not that into it already so it might die down
      soon. And well, I know "Kimochi Warui" and "OsaMake" will get me in
      already so the others we shall see. Really, "Nagatoro-san" really is not
      that cute when she's just shitting on you all the time tbh
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Just another note: Because I thought the
      <a href="https://noitamina.tv/" target="_blank">noitamina</a> slot would
      provide great Anime so I always check every year which shows were announced from their time slot... bear in mind I stopped at 2018 with "BANANA FISH". Just
      saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

    </blockquote>
    Haha man if you thought they ran out of jokes to make we going back to The
    Dark Era, ladies and gentlemen!! In this new episode (#StrayDogsWan11) where
    no one knows Ango is the
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a> guy
    in this bunch, we head back to the past. What, we can't talk about the past
    in this
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chibi" target="_blank">chibi</a> world?
    Think again. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, whatever it is in the past they can talk about,
    but as you may have realized, it's the same pattern every time: Dazai's the
    idiot who wants to do dumb things because he can, Ango is the straight dude
    so it's literally him either asking Dazai to stop or asking Odasaku to do
    something about it, and Odasaku just wants some chill time from his family.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What, I gotta write more here? I mean, from the cow featured in
    last week's episode appearing again because they can, to taking photos, to
    writing New Year's Cards, to answering maybe psychological test questions
    but the analysis is the same... we see totally NO MENTION of the future in
    any case. *looks at Ango* But hey, no one is here to remember what happened
    in the main arc: We already know Odasaku is dead and Ango is the traitor to Port
    Mafia. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (uh oh spoiler alert) (too late, huh) But yeah, thinking
    back, it's not as high as this episode alone from just the main story, but
    you know, it's the least we can expect from this spinoff series, to say the
    least. Other than that, I'll take more interesting stories from not Dazai
    please haha the other two can't even make jokes Ango is just boring and
    Odasaku is just tired like me lol

    Christmas is great for couples, until you realize you have a dad and younger
    brother which is way younger than you, and your boyfriend works in a cake
    shop. Man, when we gonna have that alone time together, eh? In this new and
    not yet final episode (#Horimiya12) where we are NOT going to do anything
    with Yoshikawa going to Ishikawa's place... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, really, absolutely NOTHING.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, let's talk about what everyone is doing this winter. Firstly,
    from Hori's family. As she said, it was a big difference from a year ago
    where she didn't have Miyamura in her life, but now everyone in her family
    likes the dude more than her? Man, I envy you, bro. I envy you a lot. So for
    Christmas, as you would have expected Miyamura's family runs a bakery, so
    good chances they will be busy throughout the holiday season, so yeah, no
    party, I guess, from like, the 23rd? Man, good business. I mean, Ishikawa's
    house servant visits your place too so I suppose so. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hori might be
    worried about her future but besides her dad there is literally nothing to
    worry about in her life. Okay, maybe dating the one guy she likes but I
    think we can confirm that already, pretty much. Well, until the Anime wants
    to give me a turn for next week we should be good. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Next up, we
    have Kawa couple. Yes, Yoshikawa and Ishikawa, just so you know. And yeah,
    looks like the girl is already enjoying or even getting used to hanging
    about in the guy's large house. Hey, at least you know the family's rich.
    Now your future is set... until you guys actually date haha that's what blew
    the minds of Iura and Sengoku too somehow lol and it'll blow more minds if
    the whole school knows you two aren't even dating. Ishikawa felt awkward inviting the girl to
    his place just to play games, but this time around, the family servant
    Yashiro is around. Yeah, and she is one bossy woman, for sure. You see, when
    your house maid/servant knows more than your parents do about you...
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yep, really got Yoshikawa worried to some extent, though I
    would argue aren't you prepared for this already, girl? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Probably
    not huh any girl would freak out if you lock the room and take off your tie.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, we have some Sengoku action because why not. And he is
    scared. Not of Remi, not of Christmas, but particularly bugs. You should've
    asked the last time he went to her room which is full of them. Most of them
    probably dead, but full of them. But serious talk though, I be standing by
    Sengoku if I see a room full of bugs. I'll already get those chills going to my
    sensitive skin because it will suddenly have rashes, no joke. I feel you, bro. I
    totally do. But I don't feel that why you wouldn't do it for your girl
    because I don't have one? Now THAT is unfair. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Besides, if you just
    make out with your girl those bugs wouldn't even bother you- Moving on!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (*vividly imagining Sengoku Remi making out*) Meanwhile,
    Yanagi be bumping into Yoshikawa's sister in the streets? What is this,
    another ship? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Guess not, but don't ask me why that is there. Me be
    Iura during Christmas because my nose sucks and I'm technically still
    coughing right now, a month in from my MC earlier this month. Sakura be
    spending her Christmas alone like last year even though things would've been
    different if not for some meddlesome girl who can't get around to what she
    wants unlike initiative-driven Sakura-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, Sakura, if you
    had a partner for Christmas, religion won't get in your way. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay, I'm going to
    get reported somehow so we better stop lol. Last but not least, we got more
    main couple antics, where... Is that a marriage proposal? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Probably
    not, but it's one way to calm down a maiden's heart who is so uncertain
    about a future without being with Miyamura. I mean, he is unpopular right up
    till middle school so yeah you only had to fend off the classmates now and
    you'll be good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Okay maybe the classmates from middle school but those are dudes, girl) If you guys go to different colleges though then I can't
    help you lol. All in all, lovely episode, we got New Year's shrine visit at the end too
    so that's nice. I just hope it's not some foretelling of something bad
    that'll happen for this series, because so far, I think we can end on a good
    note? Hopefully. One can hope. Like hope for a girl or me to like one.
    <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Cya then haha

      </div>
    </blockquote>
    Wait, is that... a Titan consuming Zeke? So he gets to actually live another
    day? That son of a- In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan75) which if I use
    the word "final" before this episode I will kill myself using a
    lighting spear those guys invented lol, we end this season, hey, with a
    bang. Yes, it's already ended and I really thought this would just finish by
    June, but I guess I was wrong. Anyways, story. Story goes that Zeke is
    bombed in half, and surprisingly, Levi's whereabouts are unknown. Though I
    doubt he will be in better shape than Zeke considering one has Titan powers
    and one doesn't. Surprisingly, a Titan came by and just like the fable of
    opening up the stomach of a wolf who devoured is it a rabbit's kids? Yeah,
    Zeke got taken in... physically. So that's that, I guess. Which also means
    he will come back, and unlike what I mentioned, get eaten by Levi who is as
    of now, nowhere to be seen. Pyxis which is effectively the Paradis military
    surrendered under Yelena's orders, so I guess we can't do much except keep
    them in captivity then. Yelena rather spend his time explaining the grand
    plan of Zeke to the potential Warriors downstairs in the jail cell ie.
    Eren's buddies like eons ago, about the euthanization plan. Then, I like how
    Pieck gets a special appearance. Explains a lot about why her voice actress
    retweeted this very episode last night lol. (Nu-chan!!~) (Also, is she
    voicing a girl who is popular with men in the military? Nice) Anyways, she
    is here to take a surprise ambush on Eren (What is faster, Eren biting his hand or people loading bullets on him at point blank range? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) (I know right should've just shot him) with much explanation on her side
    somehow,
    Eren knows she is here not to take his life because she won't, but Pieck
    then goes on to say she wants to side with him. Hey, not that it's not real,
    but going by the logic so far considering she might know of Zeke's plan to
    some extent, she probably knows Zeke's intent has nothing to do with taking
    revenge on Marley just like what she was talking about and her only family,
    her dad. So yeah, Eren believed her somehow, because why not considering she
    is willing to point out her comrades. Hey, not everyone gets to do that it's
    quite an honour lol. So, dragging her and Gabi cuffed together up to the top of
    the building they were in, in the middle of the city (yep), and on the
    rooftop, everyone was prepared to make sure Pieck doesn't come up with some
    cocky plan to rid of everyone else in the roof. But guess what, it happened.
    So yeah, I guess the Marleys are arriving already, after a good amount of
    recovery on their side. And yes, Reiner. Hmm... I don't know what to make of
    the series so far. We know about the grand plan to save humanity, many
    people actually sacrificed for it as usual, the action on Marley was AWESOME thanks Eren haha, and Paradis might be in a rough
    situation now considering everyone is controlled by spinal fluid which gladly,
    will be not of use right now because the preparator is recovering lol, but
    more than that, how will they fight against the Marley on their assault? So
    I suppose it's up to the Titan powers then. Before we end here, let me bring up
    the Wiki and do a Titan legendary power count: Eren has 3 powers (Founding,
    Attack, Warhammer), versus Reiner (Armoured) and Galliard (Jaw Titan) and
    Pieck (Cart) once the military can mount her WITH WEAPONS (lol I know what
    you are thinking) or something to be of use lest the infantry get wiped out
    first, Zeke (Beast) is on holiday, Armin (Colossus) is held captive, and
    that other one which is still encased in her own power. So effectively 3v3 I
    guess? Hmm, probably not going to be great but Marley has a military with
    their own mind so that's probably going to tilt the scales. I guess we shall
    see how it goes... next year apparently cya guys next Winter ie. end of the year lmao haha bye

    So this week, as mentioned last week, I just did a quick search online, and
    found a couple of releases which I can listen, hot off the shelf. But not
    all I gave though, to be honest.
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/baby-its-you-my-lovely-ghost-single/1555709839?l=en" target="_blank">YUKI's new single</a></b>
    is kind of a disappointment but not like I was expecting much it was average
    standard for her but do take note I only gave like a fraction of songs from
    her best album years ago so I wouldn't be complimenting too much considering
    I gave that single nothing.
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/syuuu-drive-single/1557163844?l=en" target="_blank">Base Ball Bear's new single</a></b>
    is only based on the one song I heard early in the year, the other song did
    not convince me to make this a Klassic Note Review thank goodness lol.
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/flash/1554108196?l=en" target="_blank">FINLANDS' new album</a></b>
    would be the highlight to be honest and despite it being like, a solo member
    band (Wait, what?), the songs are still good to say the least, so I gave a
    few.
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kamisama/1553396288?i=1553396292&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Sayuri's new song</a></b>
    is kind of okay so maybe I'll give it but I'll see about that by next week,
    and I saw
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/phols/1556590180?l=en" target="_blank">eufonius' new album</a></b>
    so I decided to give that a chance too. Maybe just the one song haha they
    aren't that good in terms of melody anyways they tend to drift away notes
    real easy and you know I hate that haha<br />
    <br />On news specifying things about music and they happen to be seen by me
    on Twitter before it gets rolled to next week or after this post is
    published lol, this is so hot off the press so yay
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/staff_azumi/status/1376111829282328576?s=20" target="_blank">Waki Azumi's 4th single</a></b>
    releases upcoming June,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/staff_aoi/status/1375689040134090756?s=20" target="_blank">Yuuki Aoi's new single revealed a music video</a></b>
    which... uh okay we might need to cut ties with her solo music career haha,
    <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song had a
      <a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1375406292697632769?s=20" target="_blank">video game credit</a></b>
    which was nice to see her getting recognition, I will remind myself again to
    watch <b>GLIM SPANKY's recent live performance</b> but there's a clip on
    YouTube so I'll watch that first,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ayahi_10th/status/1372744637543161859?s=20" target="_blank">Takagaki Ayahi's new music video</a></b>
    for her best album is kind of a meh so I guess I'm skipping reviewing her
    best album, and
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1373654380923211778?s=20" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari's new music video</a></b>
    is probably what will happen to me by the end of next week hehe so that's
    good. I suppose we are just getting these a little slower, huh. New
    releases, I mean. Hey, I'll take anything I get. You see, when there aren't
    enough Collection Artists dishing songs every other month I can only take
    whatever there is out there, you know. Problems of listening to a music
    industry's songs for a long time lol
  </div>
  <div>
    <br />So next week we have- Ah wrong week that was the one after next haha.
    So, for next week for real we have
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/unite/1556622311?l=en" target="_blank">SPYAIR's new album</a></b>
    versus
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/who/1554411339?l=en" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari's new album</a></b>, and I don't think you want to guess which one I will give more songs of,
    because even if the latter is like a veteran in my opinion and within the
    country, it's kinda hard to give them more songs I don't even know why. I
    got bored? Hey, I got bored of SPYAIR a decade ago already so BOOM GOT'EM
    haha<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Well, is this week more boring than last week? Haha I need to think of other
    things to do for the weekend. Besides exercising. Besides improving my
    lifestyle. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, I'm so lazy I can't even. I have thought
    of continuing the trend of photobook reviews, but I think I need some
    trigger or something (besides public holidays <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>) to review like,
    Hanazawa Kana's... last photobook from last year haha hey she can still sell
    more photobooks I'll just buy them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys then, and until next time
    please remind me to save money for my mom and other things I want to buy like a
    poster hanger for upcoming Minase Inori goods than go for another Suruga-ya
    bromide shopping spree hehe no really somebody please stop me<br />
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    P.S. I need new shirts though those meme ones I bought from USA aren't
    lasting very long lol maybe that Ten-chan shirt which costs more than two
    shirts I buy just down the street lol also I'm Chinese so wearing a blue shirt
    with the word "green" on it will be a good joke haha
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>P.P.S. Why are the shorts more expensive than the shirt lmao</div>
