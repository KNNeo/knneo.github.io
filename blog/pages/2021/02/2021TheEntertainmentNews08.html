Man, 4-day work weeks are fantastic, aren't they? It's the only type of week
where I actually HAVE the time to think of other passion projects and not be
tired from work. No really, I need to migrate to Europe haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Yes, happy birthday to me. I just, uh, spent a lot more money on stuff that
  won't arrive anytime soon as in April and on like Inorin again haha you're
  welcome,
  <a href="https://www.inorimachi.com/goods_image/010061.jpg" target="_blank">you adorable girl</a>. My supposed birthday package hasn't arrived yet too, unlike the one from
  last year- Hey remember last year? Haha of course I do I bought a lot of stuff
  from the Internet that my country's government is going to charge us in like,
  2 years. So, might as well enjoy the tax-free joys of shipping while I'm at it
  haha. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Also, probably reviving the photobook reviewing thing since I
  think it gets me going more. I'm getting lethargic from making blog posts
  remember I promised a Klassic Note post about the special compilation for
  KN2020? Yep, not yet I guess
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anime, I guess. And music, I have a lot to give this week... even though I
  reviewed a lot more haha hey I can't give everything I've been doing it for a
  decade<br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  It's when you hear "Kunikida IS
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/negi" target="_blank">Negi</a>" you know
  it's going to be a good episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
  (#BungouStrayDogsWan06) where we saw the ending TWICE mind you lol... I guess
  it's Dazai enjoying his days in the Agency again huh. Hey, if I had such a
  background as him as in from the main series I'll f**k around with my
  co-workers haha. So, since it's all Dazai this time around, let's put some
  focus on this good-for-nothing who is also a superpower in the main (action)
  series lol. Firstly, pranking on Kunikida. We don't do that everyday, but for
  Dazai it's just another day at the job lmao. I mean, again, I won't even do
  anything close to pranking anyone, but man is this getting into the habit for
  him. For Kunikida though, he just does his serious face, and the other has to
  do his part of his job anyways so whatever, which is why Dazai had to play it
  back on him, like write stupid things and slap it on his back without him
  noticing... without anyone noticing somehow wtf. The dude then went out with
  the President for a meeting which is considered confidential and then Dazai
  realised the problem with his note slapped to the co-worker's back... and did
  nothing about it lol. Hey, he did freak out for a while, but I guess Kunikida
  probably found out before the meeting anyways so it should be fine. (I mean,
  the President should've said something at some point, considering everyone has
  to move around so he would have seen Kunikida's back at some point) Next up,
  horror stories. Sadly, besides Atsushi, no one in the room knows how to tell a
  good horror story, so that kinda sucks. If you were expecting something like
  me though, remember this is a comedy spinoff lol. From Kunikida's jokes about
  him not being able to work which is never going to be a joke to anyone I just
  take MC anyways lol, to Dazai's story about how he got scared of... having to
  go to work more than once in a day haha really, to Kyouka-chan's stories about
  how the injured herself which depends if you call that horror I would call
  that abuse lol... no one actually quite nailed it like Atsushi even if his
  story is just him locked up in a storage him in his orphanage where he came
  from. Hey, even without the story the background is scary enough, bro.
  *shivers* But yeah, in case you need to learn how to tell a horror story, a
  simple case would be thinking of an unbelievable abnormality, and then
  covering it with suspense. The "no one can fit behind the cabinet" story makes
  enough sense to freak anyone out, to be honest. Lastly, let's talk about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rajiotaisou" target="_blank">radio exercises</a>, uh, I mean, dancing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I hope you have seen the former because we're
  going to be talking about the latter instead haha. I don't know what possessed
  Dazai to dance but maybe it is the money, and also why Atsushi will join in
  too unless you tell me he wants popularity which I swear he has already for
  this series... I know Kunikida will join because of them fat stacks so
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And I legit thought it's really the Agency (and Port Mafia too?) who
  were so down on money all of them really had to participate in this
  competition when Ranpo came by and... yeah it's still the three of them lol
  AWWWW I really hoped for that too but hey, imagine that whole scene not in
  chibi animation. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (And I swear Chuuya is not doing a M*chael J*ckson
  reference) Also, real cool for the scene to feature the FIRST opening theme
  song sung by technically Chuuya's voice himself, and man is the President cool
  we'll have more of them GIFs later I'm too hyped I woke up from my nap lol.
  (Sorry GRANRODEO you guys have lost, 5 years later) All in all, another funny
  episode in the works, and man is life in the Agency dull without people like
  Dazai and Ranpo lmao haha *dances*

            </div>
          </blockquote>
          I saw Ishikawa heavily featured in this week's tweets from the
          official account so I guess it's his turn to shine, huh. I mean,
          what'cha gonna do when your bro stole your crush from you, amirite??
          <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> In this new episode (#Horimiya07) to be honest? Ishikawa's love
          case is sad, but it's not as sad as that other Anime where you end up
          f**king each other because the ones you like got laid, so yeah,
          Yoshikawa. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (No, don't think it's "Koi to Uso") Anyways, let's
          talk about what happened then. Firstly... about Sakura. You know, that
          hopeless romantic who thinks she can't get a chance with Ishikawa
          because he likes the other girl... and now there's Yoshikawa hanging
          out with him? Oh man, it's already kind of hard already, isn't it? Not
          if you're not trying. In her conversations with Yoshikawa and then
          Sengoku (Remember his days before high school? He is not that strong
          of a person lol), she knows she still has to try, even with how much
          little courage she has in her, to you know, show some affection for
          the guy she likes in some way. And yes, we found out soon enough what
          that will be. In return for a favour (Where that favour is lending HER
          your jersey? You kind-hearted MAN haha) which I swear someone was
          happier than the other lol (Okay, it's kind of obligatory to help wash
          clothes lent to someone because or else Ishikawa you'll be smelling
          all of Sakura's juices lmao ok me joke's over), Sakura (I swear it was
          intentional) specially made some cookies as a gift. Oh Sakura you made
          too many cookies? Happy Valentine's Day to him man- Oh it's over?
          <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I guess Ishikawa is a bit of a glutton so he just took it
          anyways haha. Anyways, this seemed to Sakura as a win, but apparently
          someone else was losing. Nope, not Hori, she still has Miyamura in her
          eyes which we'll talk about later, but her friend Yoshikawa. Yep.
          Yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Didn't expect the triangle relationship to be here
          ladies and gentlemen, but here we are cramming triangles into those
          toys with shaped holes like a toddler lol. Sakura even extended her
          thanks to her love rival (haha) by giving her cookies too. And man can
          you feel the burn when Yoshikawa just said "Ishikawa's somewhere
          eating cookies" haha ugh I felt that real good. But yeah, kind of
          despicable really for Yoshikawa to think of it like so, because it's
          open market man you all have a chance with this dude who will not like
          any of you all back because Hori. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay me, fancy you having
          such a problem in your life EVER. *BOOM* Moving on, so Yoshikawa
          thought of fighting for it in the way Sakura did it too apparently, in
          cooking. Sadly, she's not that great, and I meant that in the worst
          way possible, so poor girl gotta get sh*tted on by of all people,
          Ishikawa. But yeah, he did it like a bro, and yeah obviously I can't
          blame him considering he has no idea this friendo in front of him
          is... you know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next up, Miyamura's trip up north so he is
          going to miss classes for a week. Can you even do that? I guess, maybe
          it's for a funeral considering they all be wearing black to Hokkaido.
          And in the worst way possible because this is 2021 or maybe not in the
          storyline, Miyamura forgot his phone charger, his is not those that
          uses USB-C cables (lol), and again like every single human who knows
          their phone is going to get cut off, did not send a warning to the
          recipient he holds most dearly to warn her about the lack of this
          communication channel. Really, you should've seen how sad Hori-san
          looks all day. It's just five days, girl. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I know right, wait
          till I get a girlfriend and not be able to text her for a week
          HAHAHAHA) While Ishikawa and Yoshikawa were worried about their lines
          in class where their friend is missing from school (Interestingly, if
          you haven't done those as a kid it's when the teacher goes around the
          class and tells everyone to read a line of the textbook in class
          aloud, typically reserved for one's second language. And yeah, they
          had to read English so RIP Ishikawa and Yoshikawa haha), Hori on the
          other hand... is missing Miyamura real good. Like, as in, physically.
          And yes, thank goodness he didn't get trapped in those flight delays
          due to weather and came back safely, and finally sifting through his
          messages and saw the one that mattered (Dammit, test is postponed??
          lol where am I going to copy my answers now), he rushed to go to her
          place where you know, she be doing the same. Telepathy, everyone. Last
          but not least, man it's quite an achievement even without this girls'
          meeting, but let's talk about them first. Well, in summary, Hori is
          worried about overloading her interest in front of her boyfriend on
          basically, horror movies. Yeah, it's a fact he's still scared. It's a
          fact that Hori-san likes them and forces him (and the father lol but
          more on him) to watch them with her... I know it's that "I did it for
          you" thing and I probably would if I have to date a vegetarian
          (Audience: ...), but for now, it's good to not do that to your dear
          boy <em>before</em> you get married. Right, Hori-san? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But
          instead of heeding the girls' advice first by NOT watching horror, she
          does everything they told her to do AFTER the horror movie, so holding
          hands, pretending to be scared... yeah those won't freak Miyamura out
          haha. So instead of that movie where the dude just ran away from it
          already and so did Hori into her bedroom lamenting herself, they,
          uh... I think you can watch it yourself to take a hint, but yeah, I
          would say "making out" is the safest word to use here? Because I
          highly doubt pene... that thing, even happened please they did not
          even have condoms. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And also we took care of our MVP Souta who
          agreed to let those two make out in bed lol okay not that but you get
          the idea. Amongst all the like, sentimental stuff to the emotional
          stuff to even the... forbidden stuff lol, surprisingly, plenty of
          feels this episode alone compared to the past few episodes to be
          honest. It's like they have to put in the HoriMiya ship every episode
          and then have to also talk about the... KawaKura ship? I like just the
          Kawa ship though you know they got affinity when they end the same.
          <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Get it? Yoshi<u>kawa</u> and Ishi<u>kawa</u>?) Anyways,
          great proceedings moving forward, and damn is it going to end real
          well. How to say, it always ends well, so I wonder how much of a drop
          can they make if they can't stretch it to more than an episode.
          Remember, this is a
          <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yonkoma" target="_blank">4-koma</a>
          manga adaptation which is why it works this way, but if there is some
          kind of bigger drop I don't mind getting into it. I could start crying
          to this series, honestly.

          </blockquote>
          I don't know man, Gabi, whoever you are trusting, really. It's not
          like they ate your mom or anything. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, Eren. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
          this new episode (#AttackOnTitan70) I guess we shall find out from
          Gabi's perspective, everything... wrong about this war? Okay. I don't
          even know who is right already so tell me, girl. Anyways, story. Story goes
          Gabi... I mean she got so many war crimes I can't even, beat up a
          Paradis soldier to death with a brick from the jail walls, and escaped
          with Falco. Easy, right? Well, among all the stuff Gabi is doing, she
          is more like promoting the war than Falco is suppressing the fact that
          they are Marleyeans who don't belong in this island. Still, they
          managed to survive, and stay in custody to a family of orphans who may
          or may not be Marleyeans maybe, but live on this island. Before we get
          into the actual storytelling, the two had to fake their presence, I
          guess. "We ran away from home" Haha unlikely story that b*tch was
          about to stone the innocent girl man!! Call her out but Gabi isn't a
          nice girl Falco no point protecting her lol. Kaya, who saw them in the
          river, guided them to nearby shelter so that, at least according to
          Falco, they can stay low before their rescue because we know he's
          the smart one who wants to see live another day than that idiot girl
          who just wants answers from Zeke which most likely will get her killed
          first very likely by Levi because he doesn't care about your age he
          will just kill haha. So yeah, Gabi has to live a life off Paradis
          for now, eating their food and staying under their shelter- Remember:
          To Gabi, all this is ridicule. As expected, she doesn't know how to
          guise as a soldier. Seriously? A very bad tool for war. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No
          really, ask any soldier if they have not lied through their teeth. Or any
          Warrriors who have stepped on Paradis, they'll know. *looks at Reiner*
          ANYWAYS (haha), we change our channels and talk about the world
          situation now. The citizens from Paradis found out about the war
          situation now and that Eren is held captive due to his... war crimes?
          Haha, hey Gabi here's your buddy. Some people leaked this info to the
          townspeople, and sadly Hange had to take care of them. Well not kill
          them anyways, but man, being Commander for her now must be rough.
          Though I would argue, she has more on her mind and has way more
          technical knowledge than Erwin than to lead the Scouts now, so yeah,
          it be a rough time right now avoiding citizens and juggling between
          war and... maybe not Zeke now because she might be going with his
          cheeky plan now (Historia no~!! Haha well she technically can't be
          f**ked right now so), but probably also, plans with Hiizuru are going
          quite well, considering they have devised a flying boat...? Okay, it's
          that advanced now? This is not even 21st century, right? Wow. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
          My guess, it'll be a flop lol not without the Titan stone powers though. So,
          moving on, and since we know something will happen at some point
          during Gabi and Falco's stay in the stables, yeah, Kaya then
          reveals she is a victim of some raid on her village years ago by, you
          guessed it, Titans. It's kind of like Eren, but it's <em>her</em> mom instead.
          Hey, sounds familiar already? And yeah, we finally reached the part
          where we have to explain to Gabi what the sins of war are to the
          future generations, and how that should even be avoided even at the
          face of revenge. Because really, "with both sides in revenge when will
          it end?" is a common Chinese proverb I learnt as a kid. But you know,
          Marleyeans started it first. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I feel like I say this and I'm
          already getting beat up by Gabi lol. Kaya managed to escape because a
          certain female braved out to fight a Titan so she could... run... (<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
          Sasha <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> she mentioned this before in a flashback seasons ago),
          Falco reveals to Kaya that it's because of Reiner and the others haha
          yep, and Kaya kindly helped them to find a way back. Wait, what? Because despite
          everyone else "being ruthless, human-killing imbeciles", Gabi, Kaya is still
          a nice person. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, this episode... Gabi you f**king
          woke yet, b*tch? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, if she didn't after this, I can compare
          her to Eren already haha talking about him man, we might see more of
          him soon seeing the preview. Quite vague though so we shall see more
          logic telling by then. Also also, looks like the Marleyeans down
          hometown found out Zeke was a traitor, and they can't wait for the
          world to help them tackle the island, so... surprise attack? We shall
          see. Remember when Reiner wanted to die so bad? lol

          This week was quite a lot, so let's talk all about them. I still have
          no feels from
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/fight-ep/1551787082?l=en" target="_blank">ClariS' new single</a></b>
          and I don't know why maybe because the topic song isn't as great as
          the previous one for the same Anime and the melodies are quite
          similar, so I may sit it out.
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/oikaze-ep/1548426061?l=en" target="_blank">SHE's new single</a></b>
          is kinda good not watching the music video so I might as well give it
          now already along with one of the B-sides because that makes me want
          to jump OUT of my room lol.
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%87%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BA-ep/1551741127?l=en" target="_blank">sphere's new digital single</a></b>
          is... uh... no comment, but I'll see if I even want to give it first
          since it's a real meh.
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/cho-kakumei-teki-koi-suru-nichijou/1547563250?l=en" target="_blank">Waki Azumi's 1st album</a></b>
          full of new songs is okay at best, because the clear distinctions of
          Rock and Electronic songs halfway through the album is making me
          favour more of the former, and her
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7HEq99E9QE" target="_blank">YouTube highlights video</a>&nbsp;where she explains all the songs didn't make me like the other
          half more. Last but not least, because
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kuchinashi/1551590757?l=en" target="_blank">Cocco's new album</a></b>
          is actually really good it's obviously the reason why I'm disliking
          most of the releases this week haha I mean, ask my tweets. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
          But serious talk though, Cocco-san is a veteran at making things
          different. And all this was from the quarantine last year? Man, we
          should have them more often- Ah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;<br />
          <br />On news concerning music and Twitter and maybe not Twitter this
          week, I'll get this out of the way first because
          <b>MIYAVI almost got me</b> with
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrQH2g-4qaE" target="_blank">his song</a>
          from last year on a CDTV Live (so no, not giving, and I didn't bother
          crediting on Twitter too) (I swear random comment if you said he's the
          best guitarist because in my eyes he's only a good music producer and
          that song is not guitar-heavy),
          <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1363297943717994497?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Fujifabric released a new live video</b></a>&nbsp;on YouTube to showcase the special stuff in the Limited Edition
          of their upcoming album which is this live in full from 2 years ago
          and man did I love those songs, and no <b>LITTLE CREATUES</b> I'm NOT
          giving your new album since the last time I gave you like, nearly a
          decade ago haha. But really, not what I was expecting anyways, so
          no.&nbsp;

        <div>
          <br />
          So for next week, I know I won't be giving but I'll still give
          <b>Kouno Marika's debut single</b> a chance for we have talked about
          how much I want her to sing original songs since
          <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/minnawagamama-feat-kouno-marika/1168505996?i=1168505998&amp;l=en" target="_blank">someone got her to do it</a>, <b>Ikimonogakari's new single</b> for Anime series "BORUTO" would
          probably be a miss but this is obligatory anyways,
          <b>LuckLife's new digital single</b> and I have high hopes for that
          because I've not heard anything yet, and
          <b>Teshima Aoi's new single</b> because after I shitted on it last
          week since Cocco I still think I'll be listening to it because... you
          know, there's nothing much going on already- I should find more songs
          to listen really<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />Okay, we're good. Cya guys next week then, next week's not a
          4-day work week though so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, for having this for like, 2
          weeks straight, I wish I had another one haha I guess I can just get
          another day them colleagues be liking to burn money for lunch on
          Fridays anyways I can invest it to my weekend instead lol. Until next
          time people... I'm considering
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8OjkcLzYCM" target="_blank">VTuber original songs</a>. Yes, if they get into Klassic Note, that'll be the second exception
          I'm making after mobile game "Alternative Girls" which will contribute
          to the Anime genre of my music library. But thank goodness for now,
          the latter is easier to give so we might be good. And I just
          consolidated that package for shipping, that birthday package, so
          let's hope I can get it by the end of the month, fingers crossed. Okay
          bye

          P.S. When you know you have that birthday luck and win in all the
          gacha on that day besides... the one game. Thanks, "Alternative
          Girls", really should've stopped massaging them chests long time ago haha
