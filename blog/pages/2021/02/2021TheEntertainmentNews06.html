Well, it's been another week again, and before you can even say that, and it's
over. Hey, if I have been saying this all year so far that's how boring my life
was up till now lmao welcome back February hope you're not as boring as January
this time lol
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, new month, new package which will probably only come next month
  because besides complications that'll only piss me off which no doubt I'll
  talk about once the TWO packages arrive in March probably (ugh that one online
  store don't like debit cards, bro) (it's called mogumall haha), I have settled
  one of the things I genuinely hate to do for my birthday year (ugh) so may I
  have to never deal with that until like half a year later when they say
  military training is postponed for another year haha. If you ask me what the
  devil in my life is, I can tell you right now: It's
  <span style="font-size: xx-small;">conscription</span>. MOVING ON!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So, Anime is great, music is new and fresh... life is OG haha I think that's
  good enough to be honest in my opinion I don't have to intentionally spend
  money to live in a hotel for my birthday using government sponsored local
  travel vouchers so I can help boost the local tourism business lol you should
  know where I live by now let's talk about Anime instead!
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (If you notice weird stuff happening in the blog that isn't happening before
  I'm tweaking a lot of stuff, hopefully for the better. Probably also fixing
  old blog posts so everyone can stay in sync, if that makes any sense to
  you.)<br />

  </blockquote>
  Man, will I have the day where I enjoy doing errands for someone and NEVER
  pass it to anyone else remember when we talked about how Dazai does that?
  Yeah, so yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#BungouStrayDogsWan04) where it
  feels like this series was all directed and scripted by Miyano Mamoru who of
  course you do know voices Dazai, I guess we got more idiots joining the fray.
  Well, for Akutagawa, in this episode, he's thinking Dazai's a higher form of
  being and totally thinks he gets everything this suicidal freak is going on
  with. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yep, it's like this in the main series though to a smaller
  extent, but this one is magnified to some proportions, I can tell you. So,
  firstly, shopping time. Well, doesn't mean much if I said it like this so
  let's try again: It's Akutagawa shopping time!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, Dazai asks him
  for a favour, and if you aren't an idiot to notice this is not for his
  personal benefit because he got the task off someone else (probably Ranpo
  lmao), but seeing Akutagawa's respect for this retard (lol) he did it with
  most pertinence like you've never seen it before. Well, you may have seen
  someone like this before in your life, most likely your mother. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And
  in an attempt to do everything on the list by the time the sun sets, he told
  Atsushi to scram, took the milk on the end row just like any other aunty would
  lol, and carries all the goods... using his Ability powers lol. And then,
  Dazai gave him the drop that he was supposed to pass all these - wait for it -
  to Atsushi. Yes, the one he told to scram. And after finding him around town
  while the dude is trying to run away from him... Haha a wild goose chase is
  not even close to this description haha. Next, we try to control Akutagawa's
  temper. Well, Atsushi is doubtful, so he tries to spy on the other to see if
  he's really, well, innately evil. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I kill ants so I guess I am
  evil. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, because Akutagawa says he doesn't kill, he really
  lives up to his reputation by... not killing anything. Literally, not even the
  mosquito that bit him. Normally it'll take a masochist to not swat that off,
  but you know, Akutagawa. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay so lastly, let's talk about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a>.
  Dazai summarised it really well so I don't have to, and I'll slap in ("Bruh!"
  lol) the dictionary link again if I have to for the nth time, but suffice it
  to say Akutagawa is too serious to take such jokes. For being a master of
  sarcasm, I hate those types of people. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So in an effort to test him
  probably, Dazai laid in front of his path joking about being a marshmallow or
  something, which led him to seriously believe this f**k is doing some training
  or in some deep thought or whatever, I don't know. And then Atsushi comes over
  and proves that he can do a better comedy with Dazai than Akutagawa can,
  pissing him off and then letting Dazai believe that the other two... can...
  do... comedy please one of them doesn't even WANT to talk you call that
  comedy? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, another funny episode, and man they got volumes
  of manga worth of jokes, so please keep them coming. Yeah, there seems to be
  character focus in these episodes now, so that might be a good thing can't
  wait for an episode with just Gin haha okay maybe just Naomi lol

      "He was with another girl" Man Souta you sure know how to be the match for
      this bonfire lmao good now we can actually continue with this series.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#Horimiya05) where any dude is able to hang
      out with as many woman as he chooses to lol, sorry for the initial
      impression because I like to write notes earlier which is how you get a
      long paragraph, but this is a wholesome episode. Trust me, we'll get
      there. Hey, it always ends well which makes it a little different from
      most romance series, I don't know why. So, firstly, about the confession.
      and how at this point Hori is just trying to run away from it. Because you
      know, she thought Miyamura was talking to a (not) sleeping girl... but we
      know that is not true, as the guy will elaborate. But still, she still
      thought she's in this relationship already (I mean) (yes haha), but then
      came in the drop where Souta said he saw some girl going along with the
      dude... man did Shindou try to indirectly kill you here bro stop hanging
      out with this dude already you gonna get killed by your not girlfriend.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, good thing this series loves clarifications, and I don't
      hate that at all because I'm such a person too, but suffice it to say that
      Shindou's girlfriend tripped and so did the guy, and Miyamura offered to
      usher her for the time being. That's all. And "usher" doesn't mean be her
      boyfriend, okay? Hori-san?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See, you gotta make it clear before
      you get beat up with textbooks lol well you calling the girl by name is
      your fault Miyamura, can't help you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, the couple cleared
      things up, they went to the confession in question which I wouldn't say is
      direct but it's still more than a confession over the phone or messaging
      service (ugh) (haha talking about me), so... yeah, Hori wants it. That's
      basically it haha. And just to cement things in, in comes our new
      character in this series: the dad. Yes, someone calls him Kyousuke but we
      don't care lol. Well this dad... is serious. Seriously... weird. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      From looking EXACTLY like Undertaker from the Kuroshitsuji series lol, to
      thinking that Miyamura is his past self with piercings and long hair, to
      practically trolling the heck out of the dude by saying he will not
      approve of the relationship because Miyamura's only kid in his house (and
      more), to not dodging the daughter's violence because his smoking reflexes
      just can't lol... this dad is weird. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But serious talk though,
      "thanks dad", haha, because at least he brought the relationship between
      these two from the grey area into rabbit territory (lmao) (oh the other
      side is called jealousy territory lol yes I made that up) so that's good
      news. Hey, best news this series yet. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Thank goodness it's not
      another 7 episodes or something for this confession result haha. Guess
      what? Worst thing is Miyamura has to tell his bestie in high school now
      that he's going out with the girl he likes. Ouch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not
      least, we have some time for Sakura, because why not? So, if it's not
      obvious enough, Sakura kind of takes a liking to Ishikawa now, seeing him
      from the distance (hey, he be the real ikemen, fight me for it) but got
      caught by Remi who can't help but ask (as a friend) about what Sakura is
      uneasy about these days. Hey, Sakura? A true friend can see that. But you
      know, Sakura went all "it's my own business" thing and decided to keep it
      a secret from her bestie. Because seriously though? From that exchange it
      really feels like Sakura wants some Sengoku lmao. Hey, why not just keep
      smudging the ink until it becomes water, right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Sorry for the
      Chinese saying I don't know the English equivalent) But yeah, soon after
      Sakura blatantly compared herself with Remi-chan here because she thinks
      the latter is cuter... she knows she did a wrong by you know, not sharing
      her troubles with her long time friend. And surprisingly, Remi knows.
      Which is why it's easy to get away with whatever society thinks about this
      friendship, because ultimately, it's just
      <strike>Beauty and the Beast</strike> being together is what is important,
      devoid of societal opinion. (Also please, Remi is the Beast here lol) So
      yeah, Sakura talks about her crush on someone, and Remi is just being a
      good friend. Good friend Remi, just that she's a b*tch haha lol. And we
      end with more couple action as Souta's friend comes over because why call
      that friend Izumi when we can change off Miyamura's name right now lmao
      even Souta has gotten used to it lol more of this conflict next week I
      guess. All in all, really sentimental this episode, which all end up
      wholesome such that I gotta keep wiping off my tears every time for a
      couple of times already this week. Hey, if this series keeps this pace
      it'll be right up on my Anime ranks tbh. Straightforward events which cut
      no bullsh*t on conflict and resolution. Just the stuff I'm into hehe cya
      guys next week for more I guess

    In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan68) I guess we're exploring the

    what happened three years ago, huh. Oh well, we saw what happened
    last episode so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, it's a tale as long as time, so let's
    talk about it shall we? Story goes that back in the time where Eren is still
    helping the Scouts (lol), Sasha is still... alive... AND (haha ugh) we got
    traitors among us. Not giving that video game credit again, but yeah,
    traitors amongst the Marleyeans. So, let's talk about the world outside of
    Paradis. Man, this should've been the start of this final season lol.
    Anyways, there is reason why the narrative is written as such. Firstly, who
    the traitors of Marleys are. As seen from people like Yelena and... that
    other dude lol I'm trying not to be racist here (and the author got real
    close anyways btw), as the enemies travel to try to take down the Paradis
    "devils" here... some chose to surrender or even, betray their comrades.
    They, are anti-Marley volunteers, soldiers or whoever in disguise probably
    siding with saving the Eldians in general, you know, to not be under other
    races anymore. Their leader? Zeke Yeager. Yes, the brother. So yes, as seen
    from last episode, the Beast Titan has plans to NOT support the larger group
    that is Marleys, even though they have like a fleet of ships and so much
    military troops I'm referring them as uncountable already so stop correcting
    me lol. In Levi and Hange's interview with those two Marleyeans... Hange's
    just glad she survived till this day to listen to those military tales she's
    already wet just listening to them talk about guns and planes lmao. But more
    importantly, they are here to give them hope. At a time where they feel
    threatened by the rest of the world which is only just Titans around the
    island and <i>some</i> traitors transforming into Titan we now call them
    Warriors lol, Yelena and the others are just teaching them literally
    everything so they can fight on even terms maybe with the others in terms
    of military power, amongst everything else. On everything else, Zeke's
    primary objective in this case, is to choose for diplomacy. He knows a
    little secret that Eren has been doubting on this whole time that will save
    the Eldians from the world, but it's literally just unleashing all the Titan
    power to eliminate everyone else so... I wouldn't say it's a great plan. So,
    about Paradis' response. For starters, they just took it. Because looks like
    these volunteers didn't have a plan to do otherwise like betray them, so the Paradis people learnt a lot,
    from shooting to eating good food... life was OG. (<span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Sasha...) But you
    know, not everyone can be trusted. So yeah, the Paradis people chose a
    two-pronged approach in order to really test out Zeke's plan. Firstly, go
    against them at the right time. Well, part of them. Remember Pyxis? (Okay
    Moeshi you can go away for now love you) (haha) Commander Pyxis, yeah that
    bald dude haha. They cornered those volunteers so they could have a talk
    which is obviously to prevent them helping Zeke, who is of course, having
    quite a stroll with Levi. Why not, right? Next, keeping Zeke on watch. In their short date, they
    travelled down the roads, Levi dumped Zeke in a forest of a hotel lmao, and
    Gabi and Farco were in jail. Huh. What the heck happened lol isn't this
    before the war opening we just witnessed in the middle of Marley? And in
    Armin's recollection of the aftermath of that war, in case you didn't notice
    this is it... Armin talks to a still encased Annie, the only Titan left who did not fight last week and wants none of all this lol, but also, refused to budge after this long. What is
    going to happen thereafter? I really wonder. I understand how the Paradis
    people were doubtful and will always be of their enemies because they don't
    have allies and going by Historia's father I doubt they have lol, but now we
    know of the calm before the next storm I assume, for if Eren will continue
    to listen to the others in their next strategy of war and not go off on
    himself thinking he can one-man this and then get eaten off his... 3-in-1
    powers (lol) right now. Well, it's not Founding so I guess Zeke wouldn't
    care but we can't afford to give more away man. All in all, an interesting
    plot switch for this series, and I would like to see more of Paradis chances
    of winning this whole thing, lest the nine... well eight Titan powers were
    used for the wrong purposes again. Surprisingly, Zeke didn't die in that last fight despite his Titan age. So yeah,
    it's eight now. And majority Titan powers on this side island, I guess.
    This is really going surprisingly well, this final season. I can't wait for
    more plot twists to make this a more spicy watch haha bye</div><div>

    P.S. "Zeke's purpose is to obtain the Founding Titan. If he can't get it by

      Wow there are too many to talk about this week I may have forgotten about
      the sequence at this point, so let's see if we can pick up the pieces from
      my tweets hehe I knew you would come in useful. I gave three releases
      coming in strong on this week literally on Monday haha. Besides the
      promised
      <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/water/1502936718?l=en" target="_blank">Yukarisa's 1st album</a></b>
      from last year which we said was from a 1x Hanazawa Kana recommendation
      <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1356186351356375042?s=20" target="_blank">which isn't bad</a>
      just read my tweets
      <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1356189623794364418?s=20" target="_blank">I'm sooooo into it</a>
      lol, I saw Apple Music recommend
      <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%AF%E3%82%8B%E3%81%AE%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8A-tv%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1-%E3%82%86%E3%82%8B%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3-season2-ed%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E-ep/1547569105?l=en" target="_blank">Sasaki Eri's new single</a></b>
      which released last week, and I'm glad to be giving her another chance.
      Really, died off real fast after her 1st major single I gave for an Anime
      unless we be talking about her in her indie band
      <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1356407883353575424?s=20" target="_blank">which is presented in this single</a>
      btw. Oh also, because I watch VTubers sing now (if the link is invalid
      means they private it for copyright purposes), I sat in on Hoshimachi
      Suisei's Monday singing stream (in which she got demonetized so that sucks
      because they live on Superchats) and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pb1J47J1VQ&amp;t=1240s" target="_blank">hear her sing a Tokyo Jihen song</a>
      better than the original artist (lol) so I decided to give
      <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/news-ep/1504350954?l=en" target="_blank">Tokyo Jihen's revival mini-album</a></b>
      since their previous work 8 years ago. I've heard their name but never
      given them anything, so now is a good time- How is this another Detective
      Conan Anime theme song haha. Sadly, I only bear to give the one song, so
      oh well. As for this week's releases FINALLY we're getting to those lol,
      <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E7%B5%90%E8%A8%BC-ep/1546091840?l=en" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</a></b>
      is barely passable so I just gave the topic song, and
      <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E8%A1%9D%E6%92%83-single/1549821512?l=en" target="_blank">Andou Yuuko's new single</a></b>
      did surprise me with its B-side so I just gave one of them and thank
      goodness this is not enough for a Klassic Note Review haha. No, I wasn't
      holding back; I really didn't like the third song.<br />
      <br />On news concerning music and Twitter which you may or may not care
      about but it's me I like to share them, ah this literally just appeared
      just as I posted last week's news because
      <a href="https://twitter.com/SPYAIRSTAFF/status/1355848688866713601?s=20" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">SPYAIR is releasing a new album</a>
      due end of March,
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1356620782336684032?s=20" target="_blank">Yoru no Honki Dance new music video</a></b>
      for their mini-album of which the song I gave is "I'm glad I gave the song
      first because wtf" lol,&nbsp;<b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1356165409150394370?s=20" target="_blank">SCANDAL is hosting a best song voting campaign</a></b>
      all the way until August so if you are a true fan (which I'm not lol) you
      should vote for your best 3 songs EVERY SINGLE DAY lmao,
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lucklife_info/status/1356166853484105733?s=20" target="_blank">LuckLife is releasing a new song</a></b>
      on end of the month will let you know once I hear it,
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1358067972875505664?s=20" target="_blank">ClariS new single preview</a></b>
      is not bad so I'll be listening to it the week after, and seriously wtf
      level is
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/FFLOWER_STAFF/status/1357599847843467268?s=20" target="_blank">YUI coming up with a self cover album</a></b>
      of her old songs, courtesy of remaster from her now formed band FLOWER
      FLOWER. Yes, technically another band covering her songs but you know. And
      it's just SIX songs really? Those were your best? Haha they are btw would
      switch "GLORIA" with "My Generation" or something but (Is this not the
      most obvious money-making scheme? lol)<br />
      <br />So for next week, we don't have anything, but the holiday season's
      here... here in where I live, so that's fine. Or else I'll just find more
      songs to listen to if I missed any especially from people I follow on
      Twitter so we shall see. Ah, and ignore those not music-related people I'm
      following on Twitter I'm just giving doujin personalities their
      recognition because they don't have any just like me. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> So don't
      be too surprised (lol) when I'll be expressing myself more often (like an
      otaku) when I have to, just a head's up.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />I would like to end this with... someone I've seen grow on the
      Internet probably; It's
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marupi.baseball/" target="_blank">marupi</a>&nbsp;over at Instagram. Just recently, she announced her own official
      YouTube channel where she will do girl things which is not play video
      games (haha female VTubers gotcha) because apparently this
      university/college student is hired as a model! Hey, congrats, man!
      Really, somehow I like faces which are similar to
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fumika_baba/" target="_blank">Baba Fumika</a>
      for some reason lmao. If you need some history of marupi-chan she's the
      first one I saw (and saved) (ah dammit I unsaved it at some point lol
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEHC-Pin0Xp/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">this is close enough</a>) when I started Instagram like a year ago as she was (like many others)
      modelling for famous hair salons in Tokyo. See? That's how you get
      popular, ladies, so get to it and spent big money if you want to enjoy
      some Internet fandom lol. (No seriously
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKvskAmgep5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">her modelling shots</a>
      look GREAT as my desktop wallpaper hehe) Anyways, cya guys then I gotta
      prepare for "the pilgrimage" for work tomorrow and the next day too to the
      same place somehow but thank goodness the week will be kinda short, and I
      will have Sunday to catch up on Anime because it's hard to visit relatives
      anyways (lol max 2 houses per day), so yeah let's see how it goes. Until
      next time... take care of yourself, would you? I know I won't do enough,
      but I think this year's motto should be "reparation", which is actually
      different from "motivation" by the way. I'm starting from tonics,
      basically. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you all next week.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. You know what's great or even better than the above?
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CK4BoAxlkhz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">Koga Aoi photobook offshots</a>. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'm SO glad I bought her photobook hehe yes Ajuju's competitor is
  her haha LET THE FIGHTING COMMENCE lol see you two girls next month
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>

  Both free of charge unless you live overseas so yeah, it's just a New Year's
  card and a catalogue of December 2020's events so I won't be showing anything
  inside since it's all fanclub exclusive anyways so here's a mini unboxing:
