  Well, the other day I got that membership card so I think I should talk about
  it now that we have 10 months left so <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  Hey, welcome. I thought of doing this on Entertainment News or on the next
  package which is on its way as we speak, but I figured out I did plan a story
  to tell the moment I signed up for it so might as well.
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  Uh, just a small note: I won't be able to show you guys much on this post
  especially the fan club content here (just because I am her fan and I love her
  HAH), but I'll provide evidence of how this worked, and then you can consider
  if you want <strike>it</strike> her for yourself haha

<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">THE ORIGIN</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  It was all because of a calendar. Not just any calendar, it was a 2021
  calendar. Not just any calendar for the year, but because I normally hunt
  calendars for the following year around November of the previous year, this
  was the only one that showed up:
  <a href="https://www.inorimachi.com/news/2020/1026150000.html" target="_blank">Minase Inori 2021 Calendar</a>
  but only purchasable for fan club members. So yes, in the most compelling
  decision ever and not wanting to hang a... calendar of nude photos on the wall
  in my room because it's my room but not my house lol, I went to sign up for
  the fan club named "Inori Machi". Yes, as of sign up dated Halloween 2020, I
  was the 18866th (probably among active and inactive) member of that club, and
  yes, I did end up buying the calendar. Desk calendar, by the way. If you know
  of my travels I rather have wall calendars but you know, they don't have those.

<div style="text-align: left;">THE CHARGES</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  Before we talk about how much I paid without the calendar, we have to talk
  about how these fan clubs work in Japan. There are typically two types:
  monthly and yearly memberships, and any one club will not have both at the same
  time. Years ago I did sign up for TrySail's membership for like a month at
  most I think? I just wanted to see what it's like to look around in their exclusive contents to see if its worth even signing up just for the limited online
  content... (spoiler alert: not really worth it haha) That was in a monthly format, with two tiers of access. If you sign up via their official website, they will provide two
  monthly tiers of 300yen and 500yen a month, with the latter providing
  additional privileges for event ticket purchases (ie. they get to do it first) and
  video content along with images for online content available to view, amongst
  other things of the lower tier.

<div style="text-align: left;">
  For Inori Machi however, it was run under a yearly based subscription, with 5500yen on first year sign-up including membership fee of 1100yen (yes, what
  you'll get in return we will review later), and then subsequent years 4400yen, so on
  average you would pay a little more at the start compared to the above club (which is how they retain their fanbase),
  but you get everything. We'll talk about what in a moment, but yeah, it was a
  deal breaker just for purchasing one calendar because I took a long time to think about how much I want to sign
  this up and watch her fan club online content only (because I can't go to their fan
  club events even if there are any) (livestreams though... we'll talk about how this works too so) for 12 months JUST to get a calendar on my
  desk.&nbsp;
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  Oh, and just as a prerequisite because this is actually important if you don't
  live in Japan: you have to provide a phone number on sign-up. And not just any
  number: they will reject that phone number you use for international shipping
  just like I did lol. You can use 050 phone numbers (just Google a generator)
  and never use it since they will only use it to contact you for events I
  assume, but other than that there's the email so I suppose it won't matter.
  But yeah, just a heads-up because I took a while to get over this I almost
  want to give up haha ugh
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">WHAT YOU GET (AND WHAT YOU DON'T)</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  So, online content first. Even without doing anything else, you get access to all
  online content in the fan club dated from 2016 where this club started (and
  where Inorin barely looked any impressive to me tbh) including:
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      [1] behind-the-scenes photos and content written by "Inori
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/machi" target="_blank">Machi</a>" staff
      (because why would she write it herself considering they refer to her as "the
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chouchou" target="_blank">town mayor</a>") (if you played the Harvest Moon remake of Mineral Town in Japanese you
      learn all this haha) so I can tell you I so far have seen the ones in 2020
      (if you need a reminder it was two singles, and that livestream in August,
      as a highlight) including some content exclusive to the fanclub which are mainly
      the website revamp because they will update that from time to time (I've
      seen it done twice already),
    </li>
    <li>
      [2] free downloadable content (which I will not share) every time the
      website revamps so desktop and mobile wallpapers so yes I have those on my
      desktop now haha,
    </li>
    <li>
      [3] video content from time to time on major events (which will expire) and so far it's just
      the anniversary live and new year greetings,
    </li>
    <li>
      [4] access to the fan club shop to buy exclusive items including yes, the
      calendar which is of course, based on the fan club not just on her like,
      as an artist considering she's not part of <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s5RRsqhWlr0/XiRQiDV3ZrI/AAAAAAAA3-U/DP5okhUjxl0qIdOjSkUrBqBp4Q_z0KJ2ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_20200106_213717.jpg" target="_blank">an idol group</a>,
    </li>
    <li>
      [5] polls and/or feedback content for their sub-regular (monthly?) fan
      newsletter where they talk about Minase Inori (FYI top answer for "why
      people like her" is "she's cute" lol) and everything related to her (For
      December 2020 they were asking for feedback on the recent 5th anniversary
      live),
    </li>
    <li>
      [6] and very recently "Town Mayor's Diary", blog posts written by yours
      truly about anything and everything, which I must say I would totally sign
      up for this long ago if this wasn't just around since September 2020 lol

<div style="text-align: left;">
  What you WON'T get though, basically because you don't live in Japan if you
  are reading this anyways and want to sign up for it, is access to purchase
  tickets to exclusive fan events and/or early access to normal events she has
  as an artist, depending on circumstances, AND depending on results of the
  ballot. Yes, if you didn't know about how event ballots work in Japan, it's no
  first-come-first-serve basis. The best example I can give you, is the recent
  5th anniversary live: You will have to sign up as a member, buy tickets for
  the event which are like normal live performance prices but cheaper if you do
  it early, and if you can still afford it, pay for access to an exclusive after
  talk session with Minase Inori herself and special guest Oonishi Saori, which
  I think you may have seen photos of them on her Twitter page so it's for that.
  Yes, you have to pay for a lot just to enjoy this one event that is online.
  And it's only online because of 2020. When it isn't... you can imagine it
  yourself. So yes, I'm not here for this part, to say the least.
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  To add on, when you sign up, they also stated you will receive "continuous
  special goods" which I don't know if I have to pay for it, but I mean, if it
  meant the greeting card then I get it, but so far, as you can see below, the
  time for delivery is irregular (I had to ship this out first before the upcoming one), so I will not
  be able to control when these will arrive so that I can bundle with my monthly
  (or not) packages to ship to where I live. Also, shipping. International shipping. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span></div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">THE (SUPPOSED) APPETIZER</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  So, I've already enjoyed looking at her fan club's online content for like, 2
  months now (you get notified by email, and Twitter) but this will be the first
  physical item I'll receive from her that is not the item intended for the
  purpose of signing for the club but AFTER signing: the membership card.
  Remember above where I mentioned paying a membership fee? Yeah, it went into
  making a totally cool membership card and it comes with a free gift - a card
  holder to put your membership card in... or whatever you want to use it to put normally I guess haha. Here is what it looked like, and trust me, once a member, ALWAYS
  a member hehe even after my membership ends they can't take my card back lol</div>
