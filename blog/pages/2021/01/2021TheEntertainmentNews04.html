Man, did this week pass by real quick. Maybe it's because I was on-site for two
of those days where I didn't have to "work"? Ah, those were great times,
drinking coffee and having truffle fries in the afternoon lmao<br /><br />Welcome
back. I had a Klassic Note post prepared already, but was too lazy to check my
own content since in case you didn't realise I do that on the go or during lunch
breaks at work, it'll have to take a while. Probably tomorrow or something after
I watch Attack on Titan... if I remember lol it's work man I gotta get over the
Monday blues after enjoying self solace for two days straight haha<br /><br />Also,
just like this week's episode of Horimiya, we have competition on my upcoming
birthday package!!! Oooo I can't wait to break it to you guys who's Ajuju's
rival here haha but you may have found out on my Twitter with my replies somehow
already lol so until then I guess. Let's Anime!
<div>

  </blockquote>
  "The Agency's bathtub broke down, forcing them to go to public baths" Wow this
  kind of cheap plot can only happen in a spin-off series haha. In this new
  episode (#BungouStrayDogsWan02) where man, it's literally everything but
  fighting which is fantastic by the way I love this spin-off already, we talk
  about more random stuff we don't see in the main series because why not? Hey,
  there are a lot of dudes but that's not the point this is a comedy series
  anyways haha. So firstly, o<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hanami" target="_blank">hanami</a>. Also known as cherry blossom viewing, this is normally accompanied by a
  picnic with great food (and alcohol) (I only drink herbal tonics lol does that
  count?) to go along with viewing the spectacular sight that is pink because
  it's the new black. I mean, look how happy Akutagawa is. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay him a
  little later, Kunikida asked Atsushi to reserve a place for the viewing and he
  agreed, but got beat to the chase by... nope not Port Mafia yet since that is
  obvious plot, Kyouka-chan who is even more looking forward to the picnic than
  he is. I mean, I feel bad for Kyouka already but it's fine, let her get the
  credit she even prepared the bentos man lmao. She even waited all night too
  she's like those people queueing up for the new iPhone haha. (She will win
  because she got food stock lol sell them to the queue Kyouka-chan you'll have
  money for the phone) Then, we talk about coincidences because obviously, to
  make this a real joke, the Agency had to be sitting near Port Mafia's team in
  order for Chuuya to flare up lmao good thing there's alcohol to stop him, says
  Dazai. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And now that things have quietened down, we finally can get to
  live the Akutagawa dream (haha) with the two groups hanging out together
  instead of making war because don't you <em>love</em> pacifist Bungou Stray
  Dogs, people? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Man, enjoy it while it lasts haha. Then, the two groups
  take turn to break their baths. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So thank goodness they didn't make
  the conflict thing earlier like the picnic, so let's talk about the Agency
  firsst. Between Ranpo-san wanting to make a fool out of himself in public
  baths, Naomi's desire to bathe with her onii-chan (I be Tanizaki if I had an
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> lol) and
  Kunikida believing everything Dazai is saying which why would you, I'm just
  glad I don't have to bathe again with 1x soap for EVERYTHING lol someone teach
  Atsushi how to do better quality hygiene. Also, teach Akutagawa too because
  apparently Port Mafia has the same problem with their baths lmao. Slightly
  different on this is... wait let me rephrase that last sentence to fit with
  this case. Between Mori Ougai who can't wait to dress Elise-chan up after the
  bath (ugh you freaking loli), Higuchi hoping Chuuya's powers can improve her
  body weight which is a lie with or without abilities (BOOM GOT HER), and Gin
  showing off her feminine powers to Higuchi lol, I'm just glad I don't have to
  use a tub of personal hygiene bottles to do just the one shower haha. Hey, I'm
  not a woman what do I know about skincare and stuff. All in all, great
  episode, and I'm just glad Gin got to talk this episode lmao we got so close
  into not getting Nan-chan to talk for this series haha also the ending if you
  skipped it was an alternative to the conflict between Chuuya and Dazai haha it
  became two groups fighting lol this series is great cya guys next week&nbsp;

        God, can they stop depicting what I look like as a kid in school with
        Miyamura? Geez. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#Horimiya03) you see when
        you have friends then suddenly you won't seem anti-social lol either way
        it's kinda your fault, Miyamura. Anyways, not talking about me in
        school, but man do we need more people to realise that they can help out
        people who... well I wouldn't say abnormal, but teach them to blend in
        with everyone else. You know, as a formality than just because you don't
        want to. Not speaking about personal experience by the way I'm just
        using this as reference material for my novel series haha. So, story.
        Sorry Miyamura I really can't quote everything you say we have to move
        on somehow lol. Anyways, it's about him (ugh) (haha), but now we know a
        little more about him, about him actually being your average student
        until he can't seem to get any friends. Ignoring my case, you guys might
        have met such a person before. So why do you as a kid back then not give
        a sh*t and/or guide him/her to blend in with the others? Social
        construct, it seems. Being a normie, they say. But hey, what am I to
        say? Am I going to say Miyamura is supposed to learn and get used to
        blending with others and look like a fake image of others so that you
        guys can relate? Don't sound like that's correct, okay? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Rant
        over, more story time. Story goes Miyamura is thinking... a lot about
        him and his so-called "friends" now in high school. We got Ishikawa who
        probably was his friend from middle school, Hori who approached him
        because they got a pair assignment and because the teacher says to pair
        up with the one beside your seat and they sat next to each other...
        (trust me, especially when it's the girl you like that's the best hehe)
        (that's LITERALLY me in school I can't even) he's got all the "friends"
        he can get. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> That's all luck bro, that's why you gotta do it
        yourself once in a while. Anyways (man I wrote a long intro lol)
        Miyamura built on his luck to find friends he can hang out with, but
        then starts thinking, unlike many others, whether their friendships are
        real. Come on, what is real friendship anyways? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Don't worry: I
        tried to piss of my friends and they still came back, Miyamura; You can
        do better haha. Moving on I guess, we talk about the relationship
        between Hori and Miyamura in the worst possible way ever, through spit
        talk. No really, this is the nicest I can put it lol. Because you see,
        normal love rivals do not confront their competition and ask for
        permission to take the guy. That's why I say she's a b*tch. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
        Well, I don't think Remi-chan will make of a good rival anyways, but as
        Sakura has mentioned she might have gone too far to test Hori's...
        feelings for the guy. Hey, mind your own business, people. What, this
        will make of good scoop, you say? Go watch Korean drama then haha.
        Anyways, Ishikawa kind of overheard Remi and Sakura talking about it,
        testing Hori and stuff, and took it more seriously than he has to. We'll
        talk about that later, because we got more couple moments to talk about.
        Couple as in the main two, not more of the former lol. Miyamura can't
        take horror films even though my level of fear is similar to Hori's
        which is none lol, and it's also because of Souta hanging out with his
        new friends (BOOM GOTCHA Miyamura lol) that these two get to be together
        alone... hey what can I say it's only enviousness filling my room now
        haha. Last but not least, bro fighting, I guess. Yeah, it's Miyamura vs
        Ishikawa. Guess who won. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yes, I have hit someone before in the
        face, thank you for asking. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ™„">*ugh*</span> So yeah, because Ishikawa had
        "evidence" that Hori actually likes this friend of his who keeps
        thinking that they are just friends (oh please Miyamura), but yeah, to
        be honest? Ironing out things straight up might be better. Like, instead
        of whatever happened that got Ishikawa's face beat in, he could've just
        shared what he heard on the corridor. Miyamura can ignore that, but at
        least he heard it he will start thinking about it, right? Just like
        whatever is the first half of this episode haha. Ah, this series is just
        great, so yeah, I'm giving it the thumbs up after three episodes. They
        got me despite the super relatable protagonist and simple plot. All in
        all, I'm VERY sure that Miyamura wouldn't double-cross on Hori to go out
        with another girl... or will he? Is this an indication of his

        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/jidai" target="_blank">jidai</a>?
        <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ah, sorry for the Japanese it's really those terms that'll get
        you into this series and its tensions because MAN is it hitting me hard
        lol <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>

          </div>
        </blockquote>
        Yes, there are two Ackerman, I can remember that much. And as of now...
        Mikasa isn't looking too great so maybe the other one if he's still
        alive lol. In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan66) ah the gang is here
        Gabi you can stay away for now haha wait does she have any inherited
        powers? I don't think so... right? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ah, what is better than a
        great battling episode from last week? ANOTHER great battling episode of
        course! Hey, we can only ask for more, trust me. Bear in mind that,
        we're at a time where no one is screwing around and everyone is rather
        skilled at using Titan powers right now: spawning, recovering, and then
        re-spawning again as the time goes, so don't be too confused when I skip
        some explaining. So, story goes that, Eren fought with the Warhammer
        Titan, almost lost, but with the help of the others from the island,
        managed to find out where the source is. And then, the Jaw Titan along
        with the others finally showed up. That is most of the Eldians siding
        with Marleys, the military on standby we'll talk about their fate later,
        and Levi. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Haha, come on, we know I've already mentioned Zeke to
        be in one of the three groups in that last sentence. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Let's talk
        about the advantages between the two parties now, let's call them Team
        Marleys and Team... Manuveur Gear? Haha okay I hate to create names for
        people. Marleys have the clear advantage in numbers for Titans, which
        means they can help each other when necessary, like when Cart Titan
        needs some above cover due to carrying a turret the roof is not any
        protection because duh guns can't point up unless you're a sniper...
        haha okay, and when the War Chief ie. Zeke ie. the Beast Titan is smart
        enough to know that they are at the upper hand so making sure Eren gets
        taken down strategically is rather important. The other side though have no time to
        waste, they need a way to evacuate which brings us Hange-san<strike>
          and Armin by the way don't think I can't unsee that whatever face
          lol</strike>
        (Edit: Yes Armin was the Colossal I forgot), and they have to stop every
        single Titan power on ground in order to leave. So far now, the
        assailants have planned ahead enough to make sure that (1) the Titans on
        ground will be disabled for most of them since we kind of know their
        powers probably thanks to informants like... Falco who was feeding info
        to Eren for a long time coming most likely, (2) there are enough plot
        twists (courtesy of the author I guess) to make sure certain stronger
        opponents can be defeated with ease so Levi waiting for a chance to
        strike Zeke and Eren finding out that the Jaw Titan can be used to
        destroy the Warhammer Titan so let us salute to the long-running Tybur
        family which is probably gone by this night. So yeah, The not Marleys
        did just come in to make a mess and then leave right on time though. And as
        their rescue airship is slowly approaching, we know that the fights on
        ground zero will likely be ending by the time it's here, but it won't be
        over just yet. Because along with Gabi and Falco's screams for Reiner to
        be awake and help and I don't even know why that would trigger his Titan
        powers but oh well what the heck, we have the last Titan to stand up and
        fight against the... amalgamation of three Titan powers now? Right?
        That's Attack Titan, Founding Titan and Warhammer Titan in one (they
        call that "3-in-1" lol), Colossal Titan making a crater where Marley's
        entire navy stood lmao RIP, Beast Titan was ripped off the nape by a similar
        beast (Levi please I was complimenting you haha), Cart Titan's human body was shredded into pieces by swords, Jaw Titan was left with his torso waiting to be eaten, and Armoured Titan is preparing
        his death sentence lol. Again, Reiner might not be the first to die
        to atone for his sins, but man, will he be the last one to be killed, I
        promise you. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> *checks wiki* Oh yeah, where's the Female Titan?
        Oooh...&nbsp;All in all... I have a feeling at the end of the series is
        where Eren is the ultimate Titan, possessing all the powers, and
        liberating the world of Titan powers altogether. You know, if that is
        possible. Cya guys next week- Is Gabi really thinking she can take on
        everyone else? Okay, <strike>Sakura Ayane</strike> girl, we shall see
        what you got.

          There's quite a lot to talk about this week, so I guess we can
          actually say the pace of new releases is coming back for the new year,
          or so I hope.
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/dear-dear-single/1547954449?l=en" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana's new single</a></b>
          is not only digital release only which is great when I have Apple
          Music so yay, but nay because I can't give both new songs on the list.
          So, just the earlier song where she used to announce her return into
          singing. Here's hoping for more in the future. I almost forgot about
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/pyxis-best/1547792023?l=en" target="_blank">Pyxis' best album</a></b>
          considering we gave a couple of songs last year, and this... it's not
          that bad to say the least considering my impression of them half a
          decade ago was real bad lol, and I did give a couple of songs
          including one I told to myself not to give from their latest single...
          oh well the composer also wrote Anime "K-ON!" songs so go figure. I
          also listened to
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%A2%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%9C-single/1546420873?l=en" target="_blank">Tsuji Shion's new song</a></b>
          and... I may just give it who knows when she's releasing a new release
          anyways. Problem is... she does have a physical release, but it's not
          on streaming. Eh, Shion-san? Not going to buy your CD just so I can
          hear the other song considering it's also a demo so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I
          think I might just reject
          <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sake-to-inu-single/1540035374?l=en" target="_blank">uminecosounds' new single</a></b>
          from last year considering it's a lot harder to give then their album
          earlier that year.
        </div>
        <div><br /></div>
        In news concerning Twitter and music and maybe I just followed a
        cosplayer just because, I decided to go back to
        <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fivenewold/status/1350795444389961728?s=20" target="_blank">FIVE NEW OLD's upcoming album</a></b>
        which is releasing in April for Baba Fumika-chan by the way and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSsgv0pZ1Y4" target="_blank">that music video</a>
        for their new song for drama (which I am watching when available) is
        really pissing me off lol,
        <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1351503149480124418?s=20" target="_blank">TrySail's livestream</a></b>
        for their Blu-Ray release for their (paid) music livestream last year is
        nothing but fanservice but of course news for upcoming tours, and I
        regretted voting for the wrong choice in
        <b><a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1352653480230416385?s=20" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's best single survey</a></b>
        on some website but
        <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1352653482495414274?s=20" target="_blank">I did clarify</a>
        (in Japanese) that I chose "irodori" based on A-side impression,
        "Eternal" was the single I bought the fastest without hesitation, and
        her debut single "Skyreach" is still my fav after so many years.<br />
        <br />So for next week, we have a couple more releases that I've been
        actually looking forward to for the month, which are
        <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/physical-ep/1546440652?l=en" target="_blank">Yoru no Honki Dance's new mini-album</a></b>
        considering they only released single tunes from last year, and
        <b>Fuchigami Mai's new album</b> because I guess giving her new single
        which is releasing on the same day is not necessary considering the
        overlap? Maybe the B-sides, but we shall see. She's not Collection
        Artist level so I don't have to give things this thorough lol<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        And this will be it. If you need an embarrassing thing to talk about for
        the week... I, uh, finally experienced what it was like to fulfil
        someone's Amazon wishlist. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Not going to write another post
        about it, but suffice it to say on Wednesday a certain someone tweeted
        about
        <a href="https://twitter.com/hu_ton_/status/1351692489141325826?s=20" target="_blank">her Amazon wishlist</a>
        and I decided that instead of paying for
        <a href="https://mi-glamu.com/huton" target="_blank">her monthly membership</a>
        which is like really high,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1351745433048006656?s=20" target="_blank">I replied her</a>
        and spent that amount of money (instead of monthly) to gift her...
        apparently she wants outfits so I got her one her size lmao. My note to
        her is literally "the one from xxx the chest part is too big for you so
        I got this for you instead" lol I hope I didn't offend her again with my
        sarcasm good thing is she probably wouldn't reply...? On her
        <a href="https://twitter.com/hu_ton_/status/1351851456274460674?s=20" target="_blank">birthday livestream</a>
        that night she said she received a lot of outfits but didn't say who,
        ate a quarter of a Doraemon cake and immediately exercised for about 6
        hours straight and even then did not burn enough calories for half of
        what she ate. I feed bad for her now lol thank goodness
        <a href="https://twitter.com/hu_ton_/status/1351952005632122881?s=20" target="_blank">she gave up</a>. Legit was "just expecting her to just play the Ring Fit Adventure
        game only" (I commented, she read, haha, maybe mistaken since I didn't
        clarify) instead of eating and playing unless you want to puke it all
        out really. Oh well, that's what happens when you have lack of planning
        haha. Cya guys next time, and until then... don't give gifts to Amazon
        wishlists you don't like the person for lol I like Futon-chan though so
        I'm good hehe<br />

        You think it'll look great on her? Haha I sure hope so wishlist items do
        not have overlap unless stated in amount so I hope to see that someday
        hopefully not in her fan club I didn't pay for that lol

        money now please
