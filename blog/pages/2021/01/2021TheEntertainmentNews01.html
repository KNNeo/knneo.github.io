HEY. Wake up. It's 2021 already. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> <div><br /></div><div>  HEY EVERYONE!! And... unlike last year which we had a photobook to start the   year lol (Anzai Chika-chan!! Okay me) this year... well many other things   happened like I got a new desk and chair so that's good enough. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Also   also, amongst many more of these mistakes I'll be making because I'm a Minase   Inorin fan now (lol) (as in fanclub member) she sent that New Year's greeting   card... a day after I compiled that upcoming package. F**k me, really. I   wished I could edit that consolidation but yeah, maybe that's what I need to   look for in this service's replacement lol or I could just wait another day   and the email will remind me <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span> </div><div><br /></div><div>  Okay, not Anime time, but I guess this is, because if below isn't like a long   paragraph you know I gave up watching this "BLEACH" author anniversary spinoff   turned animation halfway through haha let's take a look then<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BURNTHEWITCH00">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span         class="head-prefix"         ><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> BURN THE WITCH</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "If magic only works on fools, I'd rather be the one casting the spells"     </div>  </blockquote>  Ah, just so you're aware? They end with the opening lol what. Okay, if you are   also watching this three-part series instead of the actual cut movie of this   mini spinoff turned fantasy action Anime (#BURNTHEWITCH) based on "BLEACH"   author Tite Kubo's anniversary spin-off work... I hope you are not   disappointed. Because we're going to talk about it. Hey, as much as possible,   and with as little spoilers as possible. Let's talk about the impression in   general instead, the pros and cons of this really mini series.&nbsp; </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="180"                 data-original-width="320"                 src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ES2o03iYqgo/X_HBsL9wf8I/AAAAAAABAu4/ZLnJIQA_fMUVPB2RvZ7nngJrhzQm4orxACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/burnthewitch_rickenbacker.gif"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I mean, we gotta show off all the cool GIFs of this animation right?             In the case where "BLEACH" will suck again in the future haha oops           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b_GPH4ngJQY/X_HBwQZGWvI/AAAAAAABAu8/3cYMe8VY9ycBfu84LHoyi0GM7UNTw3rWQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/burnthewitch_macy3.jpg"                 width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Macy please step on me haha okay Hayami Saori I tried to ignore your             actual voice but<br />(Animation is as cute as it gets)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  What's good about this series #1: Animation. I can't even emphasise any   further, hopefully the screenshots below will give it some justice but yeah,   it's pleasing to watch. And for the content presented, you be glad it's done   this well, so good on you, production. #2: Character backstories. Trust me,   that's literally what Kubo-sensei is good at. And we'll talk about the   differences between that and character development here but, long story short   it's real cool to see Dragons manifest, a light beam just appear and pierce   that Dark Dragon in one hit and it's effectively eliminated wtf, and whatever   whatever Macy vs Nina shit thank goodness that was a nice story I literally   thought it was rivalry considering the tabloid and thought Macy would be like   a final boss we have to see kill or be killed here. Trust me, I've thought of   how many times she would be dead in the final fight. Talking about fights! #3:   Yes the action. It's not a Kubo-sensei production without some fighting (yet)   so we be glad it's good. And it's cool too. From summoning normal and Dark   Dragons, to chanting spells (we'll talk about its problems later), to the   worldview of Front and Reverse London... I'd rather he write an action series   worldview and action scene for me because I still haven't manage to reimagine   one myself, to be honest. If you watched anything popular today before you   watched even "BLEACH", I pity for your lack of appreciation even for this   series. Now that pep talk is over Kubo-sensei, let's talk about what was real   irritating to me throughout this.&nbsp; </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VUgVMwRwekQ/X_HCGtqNQtI/AAAAAAABAvI/KjTn6B9mpdIgcXizWZZNHSTjeEy0kTwFACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/burnthewitch_balgo1.jpg"                 width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When I can't get enough of Tite Kubo's lore even though it's a lot             of cr*p haha             <br />(I'm comparing it to Noel-chan btw)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gnTp4JcZD0w/X_HCGmwHk2I/AAAAAAABAvM/ZYjyKUEQrVc6g2g23sCnvQV2TqxeihyeACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/burnthewitch_balgo2.jpg"                 width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When I can't get enough of Tite Kubo's lore even though it's a lot             of cr*p haha<br />(I'm comparing it to Noel-chan btw)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  What's bad about this series #1: References of usage from his previous famous   title. I mean, I know it's a spin-off, it's kind of a leech off anyways, from   I don't really care about the "Soul Society" thing on the banner to maybe how   "WB" is also some American entertainment brand if I talk about they will file   be a copyright lawsuit (lol) to is that a Hollow mask but actually painted as   a mask and we can't sell it on the streets now, but man some things I don't   even know why it's in it. I guess it's for the references to the... "popular"   series (please, it still is to me, but not to my friend) so things like spell   numbers, setting up barriers (really?), and that HQ roundup really is a   problem to remember every time I look at it. So seriously man, if this is   going to be a series can we rectify those? For HQ just replace with the one   guy that is not Bruno just like how "ACCA" did it lol, and just remove those   spell numbers. Trust me; just the spell names will already make it cool. And   what the f**k is Bruno even talking about is that his own set of spells or   what? Well, without much context this wouldn't be easy to criticize on so   we'll leave it at so. And no, I'm not going to be a wizard just so I can   complete achievements and get money haha okay maybe the latter but still. #2:   Character development. Ah now this, because there are also lack of contexts in   this, we're not going to poke into it too much but yeah yeah whatever some   humans can't see Dragons like seriously, I could use a little less story using   Macy and Nina anyways, and why is Bruno the only dude who is pissed off at   something which is considered important, now that we've literally reached a   stage of no return finding Legendary Dragons with the purpose of eliminating   them? Hey, you ask me. #3: I must say I realized I shouldn't have talked about   that now, theme song. The soundtrack is great, don't get me wrong. I just   don't' get why for such a series we get like, an acoustic tune for the song. I   tell you, it was only appropriate as an ending because I only felt it relevant   when it played after the whole thing ended. (And yes, if you have read the   spin-off that's the part animated) It must be really weird watching halfway   and hearing this and be like "What" all of a sudden, you know. Okay, rantings   over haha. All in all... man when am I picking up my own series again?   Remember, "A Pack of Life"? Come on Tite Kubo, I can write a better story than   you haha okay give and take this is just a short animated series. For an   animated short though, I would say this is as good as it gets. If you aren't   bored of Kubo-sensei's formula for coolness, action, and sometimes ecchi   jokes, you won't be too disappointed, just like how I wouldn't be maybe. So   yeah, that was a nice break watching "BLEACH" anyways, and as much as I'm   comparing this to a series 15 years coming... I would say this is a good thing   to watch just as a spin-off. I kind of like it actually, but don't expect fan   fiction anytime soon haha I'll just steal the ideas just like how Bruno is   trying to steal the bounty of Balgo before it went live lol I'm done (just a   moment I have a new Card idea haha here if you haven't read it before, my own   work) </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KjxibvNg71A/X_HCXyZw84I/AAAAAAABAvY/vfA5E-BBwW0fogisD908aKHPoqIyBLIsACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/burnthewitch_shock.jpg"                   width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Not going to point fingers but we know who is MVP this series             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X3IbsO_L_jA/X_HCYVGDEWI/AAAAAAABAvc/eJOj0iQWtAAFkiGkLqBRsWVlyKUkP_QuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/burnthewitch_noel3.jpg"                   width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              See?

Yes,   you won't see the next week paragraph because I just said it here. Hey, I just   said it here so maybe we'll cover a release a day besides Wednesday because   you know new releases day but, uh, I think I'll not list any of them first I   don't even know if I will even give them a chance lol so I'll keep it secret   for now.<br />  <br />So, for news concerning Twitter and music or not maybe because idolism   is taking over my life and "slowly but surely I go on" lol (THE ORAL   CIGARETTES joke), we get another <b>SID live video airs on YouTube</b> in a   week, I think <b>TrySail is doing a livestream</b> to celebrate their last   year's paid online livestream releasing on Blu-Ray and no I'm not buying it,   <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' live video</b> on YouTube is still available until   tomorrow and has English subtitles apparently, and   <b>SCANDAL announced a new single</b> to come out on March for their   anniversary but I forgot how many years I lost count. Hey, we have quite a   line-up, huh. You see, the problem with so many livestreams and releasing past   live videos on YouTube is... I don't have the time to watch them haha we shall   see I've got singles and albums to give too so </div><div>  <br /><br />  <br />  <br />And I'm good for this first weekend. I'm sure BURN THE WITCH was a great   start for this year, you know, as a warm-up, instead of watching this last   week because I have no mood to do so and we've got enough songs for last year   already lol my computer is screaming again haha I think it's the hard drive.   Please, dear PC, tank it for another couple of weeks; your replacement is   arriving soon. And maybe then we'll spend some time sorting out my digital   data- Ah. My work leave's over. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Cya guys next week then, and until   next time... can I bring this new chair of mine to work? It has a built-in   back rest man it's cool China sh*t lol maybe I should bring in the back rest   for my old chair then haha yeah<br />  </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. And... our VTuber of the week because I can't take afternoon naps is...   Uruha Rushia!! You can find out about her by searching her on YouTube because   translators be out there but, I like a lonely yandere who has a boob complex   lmao that's how I got into Anime "OreImo" lol not really though </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
