I know it's yesterday, but happy birthday dad. Yeah, that's all the enthusiasm I
have for anything now my sis and mom are probably more hyped by bringing in a
cake and singing the song haha. What does get my enthusiasm going though...
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I've done it again, and this time it's for real, but my birthday present
  package is next up on the package list. Yeah, I went all out this time, Ajuju.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Probably no need to attend the signing event because... I mean it's
  not about the money now haha it's pretty bad in Tokyo so yeah. Anyways, I
  gotta have some dinner going on later because of that previous paragraph so
  let's get this week's shows going!
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Man, so Bungou Stray Dogs this season effectively did not have an original
  theme song? Hmm, what happens then, me? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I guess they're off the hook
  haha besides it's technically a sequel to a series I know of so since I have
  GREAT PRETENDER which also didn't have an original theme song already... this
  wouldn't make much difference lol<br />
  <br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  I think my objective for watching this series is to like dogs by the end of
  this season lol Ajuju's photobook might have a better chance haha. Anyways,
  dog fans gather! Because apparently that's what the author and Anime
  production thought was missing in their demographics lmao. In this first
  episode (#BungouStrayDogsWan01) where we literally start with a pack of dogs-
  wait is this the season?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I thought I saw humans in the trailer haha.
  From Kunikida needing his dog glasses or else he's an old
  <strike>dude</strike> dog, to how small Chuuya is, to how Kunikida can't draw
  weapons out from his book, to how Atsushi transformed from a dog to a cat
  lol... this series has got everything to make this a totally serious joke
  show. And that's just the intro. Intro to this... half-length series? Uh oh.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Leaving the dogs alone, we finally move on to the actual(?)
  happenings back in the Detective Agency, inside of fictional Yokohama which
  just became more fictional in this series because they got dogs that talk.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, this series I guess is made into shorts, so as you will notice,
  each actual episode will have several short episodes together, where it's
  literally... well it's a joke show so you should know what to get. Firstly,
  Atsushi is on cleaning duty for the lockers(?) in the agency. Accompanied by
  Dazai, they do what cleaners love to do(?) which is open the lockers to see
  other people's inner secrets lol.&nbsp; (I think the bracketed question marks
  should be my shtick for this series from here on) Kunikida has a book of ideal
  Dazai (lol), someone has a bull in the locker (wtf), someone was a brocon
  which we already know since this Anime aired 5 years ago (lol), Ranpo-san is
  just snacking with his snacks in his snack locker (haha), we'll not talk about
  Dazai's locker, don't know why there's no love for Atsushi, and no one wants
  to know what's inside Yosano's locker lmao. Well, it was wine, who would have
  thought? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Then, we have some Port Mafia action. Okay, action as in
  someone is doing
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a> for
  Higuchi from the moment Akutagawa comes back to the bunk to Chuuya arriving
  and them having to discuss something. I'm not going to retort again, but
  somehow Higuchi's love for Akutagawa allows for her to misinterpret sign
  language, have limited field of view, and still feels rejected after all her
  attention to the one she loves lol. What a joke, and I don't even have someone
  to like that I work with. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span> All in all, it's a short series of shorts, so
  I'm not putting my hopes too high, but I'll get a laugh before watching some
  cheesy romance and gore scenes for my weekly schedule of Anime haha

  P.S. If you saw the subtitles which I hope you have read and not skipped

      hello Ishikawa and my middle school days I did still give her a present
      though you should too bro
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Ah good Hori-san if you have no music taste please go on a date with me and
  I'll enlighten you to MY world of Japanese music haha you guys can just refer
  to Klassic Note tag in this blog for reference. In this new episode
  (#Horimiya02) OH YES I FORGOT THE MAMA WAS VOICED BY Kayano Ai by the way haha
  fan recognised mother role even though she is still single. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, what
  do we know. Between releasing a voice actress 10th anniversary photobook and
  mini-album we know she's going to drop the M-bomb soon haha marriage I mean.
  Anyways, story time, we've got quite a lot to talk about. Firstly, the mom is
  here. Yeah, spoiled it real good upfront, but yeah Hori-san's mother dropped
  by. Remember when she was busy with work and loves to do OT? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yeah,
  that mom haha. So, she found out from Souta probably that some dude's been
  popping around at the house without her permission (lmao) so you gotta be that
  gossiping mother and ask kindly about the full details of the boy who is
  trying to get her daughter lol. (I mean, if Miyamura is trying to get Souta
  I'm more worried as a parent tbh haha) And in their conversation, Hori
  realised she doesn't know of Miyamura's
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/namae" target="_blank">given name</a>. (So
  if you only read English subs which are always with respect to American
  reading, Japanese first name is their family name, not given name) So yeah,
  since they aren't that close yet, I guess no one else knows too. From the guys
  in the changing room, to Ishikawa who would rather not talk about other guys
  she is hanging out with (lol) (I'm literally that dude haha but I don't get
  chances to talk to her at all <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>), to why isn't Miyamura smarter so she can
  just look at the grade rankings and find out his full name... it's a lot
  harder than being a mother and asking about some prospective son-in-law's
  name, that's for sure. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, it didn't take long for her to be weird
  in front of... everyone lol it was like three days already, but yeah, it's
  Izumi, not going to keep this as spoilers because not like I want to date him
  or anything lmao I'll just call him Miyamura. Then, we have the student
  council. I don't get the rationale too to be honest even hearing the
  flashbacks, but hey, apparently Hori is just helping out the council's
  president Sengoku to do work. Yeah, like something is going on between them or
  something. Hey, none of us know too much, but it looks like Sengoku has a vase
  for a secretary/girlfriend and is instead asking his childhood friend to do
  all the work. Wow, what an asshole, not even close to atoning all the sins she
  might have done to him, to be honest. And then the next day, Hori got
  questioned. She was supposed to help out with the budget report (important
  things by the way) but then did not submit it. Supposedly. She said she did
  submit it to <strike>the vase</strike> Remi who apparently denied of the
  charges? What a b*tch, dude. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And it's not about apologising over
  quite an important thing by the way, it's about the pride. I'm not going to
  apologise just because someone else lost the stuff I gave to her. What, you
  gonna trace back to me now? Why not doubt the people around you first?
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And so, Miyamura brought my ego into the mix, slammed Sengoku's head
  with his in fury, and passed him the dropped papers he picked up because some
  b*tch said it was unimportant. Yeah, ya think? Haha, and really, this is
  probably one of those many hero moments we will no doubt see Miyamura pull off
  again in the future. Hey, maybe this is the appeal for this romance. And as
  her classmates doubt on her, Hori tries to explain her relationship with
  Sengoku. Apparently it's just bullying and what, he gets to have his revenge
  now? What a jerk. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I must say this series lets you do a lot of
  thinking on your own, because they don't explicitly talk about certain stuff,
  like how long Miyamura will come by her place... probably because of Souta as
  of now. Hey, what do I know. He still came around for her birthday and gave
  her a present. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (I was thinking of giving an album which releases
  around that time for her tbh but I guess the dude just took a hint from the
  earlier part) But yeah overall it does give an atmosphere that is to
  anticipate and worry about, and that's kind of what romance is like in Anime
  anyways, right? Cya guys next episode for more Tomacchan fanservice haha still
  works after a decade though it never gets old hehe

history? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan65) if you're not
speechless, I am. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Wow, real speechless now, as I continue from when I
wrote this paragraph about 2 minutes in haha. So, let's get story out of the
way, then we'll talk about action haha. Firstly, about Tybur's plan to bring out
the "demons" of Paradis. In his conversation with Captain Magath, he mentioned
that the best time for the enemy to strike is literally when he has to do that
speech, which will explain why he has to do it as fancy as possible, so that the
military could cover him when it comes. Well, not exactly cover him, for he was
to be the sacrifice, apparently. So from last week, I was wrong, it isn't Reiner
that was being eaten, it was Will. RIP Will Tybur, you won't be remembered.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Moving on haha, as Eren rises from the ashes, as according to the
Marleyans, the military was first to be targeted by the Attack Titan so RIP all
those commanders lol, some people got killed instantly including Zofia one of
the Warrior candidates so RIP her too also Udo, Gabi is in shock in all this
instant kills, and Will's sister is ready to enter the fight. Cue Warhammer
Titan holder as hinted by Will which is of the family but not him, and her
awesome powers to, you guessed it, build upon our knowledge of Titan hardening
powers so far. In short, and as Eren fought her and noticed too, the Titan is
able to create anything from hardened Titan material instantly for any purpose,
in this case, fighting. And this is where Eren lost his first chance in taking
it down because upon rising, she spiked the shit out of him, and created a
hardened hammer to rip his limbs off, immediately disabling his powers. This
Titan might be too OP haha or also because this might be the most advanced and
trained Titan we have seen yet, considering it has been successfully passed down
by generations from the family that holds the power. But before Eren could say
his last words, cue his reinforcement which he has been sending letters to all
these years while in hiding. Well, Falco did. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And we don't even know
his whereabouts yet lol. So, reinforcements. Apparently, and as you might have
seen the ending part, he was contacting Paradis while observing enemy land. So
you shouldn't be too surprised to see long haired Mikasa, Conny, Sasha who
doesn't look like a food-eating demon now probably because she might be better
off after all these years, and some newbies we've never seen before but who
cares about them haha. Thing is, they came in prepared. Prepared to cover for
Eren as he tries to not just destroy, as the Marley Captain has mentioned, but
consuming of their powers so they can be fundamentally stopped. The manuveur
squad here though, is here to mainly prepare the battleground off any potential
threats including Warriors who of course, can use their Titan powers against
Eren so it'll be many to one which will give them a disadvantage, and to
eliminate all non-citizen enemies which... well they killed all of them anyways
haha. Come on, it's only the one guy who send Eldians cut off their napes into
the desert. So, go watch the series of turns yourself, but suffice it to say,
with some distraction from Mikasa, Eren was able to figure out how to stop the
Warhammer Titan because, a long line runs from the Titan itself to the ground
from the leg, so... hey, what figures, amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So Eren turned into a
Titan, ripped the floor off, and boom, actual human body encased in Titan ice.
Thankfully for the Marleys, someone with Titan powers finally showed up to help
in the case that this falls through, but considering those guys have never seen
the gear in action before, they might be in for a surprise. A real one. So RIP
whoever that was I forgot his name, 'cos if you didn't see Levi coming you got
another thing to think about haha MAN THIS EPISDOE WAS AWESOME!!! Probably all
the female audience came after seeing Levi's entrance haha I'm okay though lmao.
So next week, it looks like we're getting everyone involved. Now THIS is a war.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Don't you love fights when there are as many turns as there are number
of combatants? That's how do you an action Anime haha gotta wait until next week

        Well, I really didn't listen to music this much this week so let's talk
        about what I did listen to. I finally got around to giving
        <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/beast-single/1538264616?l=en" target="_blank">[Alexandros] latest single</a></b> I think it's from last year anyways,
        really thought it was Klassic Note Review candidate, but happily
        rejected the B-side upon second listen haha. I also almost ended the
        week forgetting to give the last release I intend to listen from last
        year which is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/lantana/1541282439?l=en" target="_blank">Keiko's 1st album</a></b> (Keiko as in from Kalafina) and
        uh... it wasn't that great. Turns out, I just don't like her deep voice
        maybe I was into Kalafina not because of her lmao. Anyways, probably
        won't be giving anything from this year- Man this year sucks haha I'm
        just lazy now to be honest at least the next few weeks will be great
        that's for sure.<br />
        <br />
        In news concerning music I care about and them being on Twitter and
        hopefully I have remembered to like them or else it won't be mentioned
        here, you can listen to
        <b>a digest of

        again, they may have just major debut for a year but I've known of them
        since 2017 so go figure.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        So for next week, and this is following that surge of idols who have too
        much free time and can afford time from their marriage to sing again
        since their popularity hasn't dropped to the pits lol,
        <b>Taketatsu Ayana's digital single</b> releases next week and yes I
        will give a listen even though I mentioned last year that it might be
        disappointing. Don't worry, nothing is more disappointing than my new PC
        and monitor already haha okay me stop shitting on my life choices<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />And I'm good. It's been a week, and my new PC is still in a mess
        to be honest. I barely got the OS to work after spending half a day
        installing only 1x SSD because they tied the wires thinking whoever
        bought this CPU won't need to install storage hardware lol, and I bought
        a "cheaper" version of Office which is basically cracked so I could've
        just pirated it online like I always have for free. Ugh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Which
        is why I'm compensating all this by buying a HDD mount to put my other
        internal hard disks which might need formatting because why can't you
        plug and play in another piece of hardware then I might as well buy
        external instead, and more storage to fill my room so that I can stop
        putting posters in the dark corners of my cabinets lol you don't have to
        know too much just know I spent a lot of money. But you also know I
        spent a lot on my birthday present to myself already so <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya
        guys next time then, and until then... well work is rather lax now and
        I'm in charge because someone else had to leave temporarily so... good
        luck to me if something fails haha bye
