<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Happy birthday Uesaka Sumire!!! May your chest continue to grow- I should stop
  writing stuff like this on the first paragraph people will walk into this
  place thinking this is a porno site lol (yes I meant to put just a
  placeholder)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay, let's not talk about birthdays because ironically my superior's birthday
  is also today I found out recently (ugh) (haha), we talk about that package! I
  can only say, if suddenly we're doing an unboxing tomorrow, you need to know
  how much I was rushed to consolidate this order so that I can get all of them
  in one box and not have to pay more shipping, so please forgive me. Will be a
  good week to start this with though considering next week will be my last week
  at work... for the year. Haha I gotcha didn't I
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, Anime and Klassic Note and the latter is only getting more important
  than ever so please me do something about it, I have my cold brew with me
  because I had to wake up early in the morning for prayers (not the church one,
  mine's Taoist) so let's try not to sleep while doing this post, yes? I mean,
  how are we going to top that lingerie leak from last week lmao not gonna
  elaborate you can check last week's post LET'S GOOOOOOOO haha

  </blockquote>
  Man, what does Komi-san got to do with what the class is doing for school
  festival? *imagines vividly* Oh. OH!!! <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah that's why I want
  Komi-san to- In this new episode lol (#KomiSan11) looks like we are concluding
  this series with some school festival! Hey, I would like to say that is all
  the time we have left, but then you realize they have SO MUCH CONTENT it will
  not even end. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Let's talk about it from the start, because even the
  class deciding on what to do for the festival seems like a struggle. In a
  nutshell, Najimi suggested maid café even though it's cliché and we'll talk
  about why in a moment, Yamai-san would like to host a haunted house in case
  you need a reminder of her name and how much of a groping perv she can be in
  the dark lol, I'm going with Nakanaka's suggestion because honestly we only
  need one member in a band and that is Komi-san lmao (also in her defence I've
  never heard Koga Aoi sing besides in Anime "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen?q=kaguya&amp;cat=anime"
    target="_blank"
    >Kaguya-sama</a
  >" so that'll be an <strike>eye</strike> ear-opener if it happened but sadly
  not), Agari-chan wants whack-a-mole because she wants to get hit and I can't
  believe they have a masochist gang in class lmao, but I'm sure they will find
  that Makeru-chan will join them in voting just because she wants a games stand
  lol how many times can she lose, no movie production I guess thank goodness
  haha, we'll talk about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onigiri" target="_blank">onigiri</a> later
  Nene-san haha you see how much interconnection they have in just this one
  episode, and how did three people vote for a disco. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, other than
  some obvious ones which are unlikely, and thank goodness Tadano didn't decide
  for himself as chairperson which he should have, but he did consult Komi-san
  instead so yeah we getting maid café. *yay* Next up, preparations. Turns out
  Komi-san wants to help but can't because the others are stopping her from
  doing so due to her super privileged status (and that's how society works too
  in general tbh) but is kinda saved by Otori-san who is tasked with helping to
  buy some resources but... wait for it... <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> And she said she will do it
  but as you can see even this paragraph will be lengthened if we only let her
  go she will only come back in a week lmao, so she asked Komi-san for help
  since she is very free lol you're not wrong she's just sitting there. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  The actual preparation for the maid café is wearing out the class so no one
  can actually join them haha thank goddess goodness (lol), but Nene-san
  volunteered to join lest they never come back. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> But seriously Sonic,
  slow down. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Because as you may have noticed, this new character is not
  only just *slightly* retarded as in speed, but also suuuuuuper lag as if we
  are dealing with a PC from two decades ago. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> Someone please help I'm
  in nostalgic pain right now lmao. Anyways, Nene-san was worried about them
  getting lost which was the smartest thing I've heard in this series ever lol,
  but they still kinda got lost even though we did get some talk about of
  them... well one's using pen and paper so go figure. Hey, new friend,
  amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Really Komi-san, just join like, two clubs and it'll total
  to 100 people you'll hit it in no time at all at this rate. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Then, we
  have flyers to distribute. Unlike the last time with tissues, this one, we are
  to negotiate placing flyers inside shops to promote the festival itself
  specifically their class, and Najimi really wanted Komi-san to do it haha.
  Well, at least it worked for two places so that's good haha I like how all of
  them share a common process where it's hands out with flyer and black box and
  then it's done even though Najimi and Komi-san did it differently. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  I'm sorry, I meant Kokko-san. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> And we thought we're getting to the
  real thing, we have an all-nighter to burn before the day itself, so it's
  supper time! The girls in class made rice balls which is a thing? Well, in
  Anime it is, and everyone is guessing which one was made by the goddess so
  they can actually NOT eat it and just like, frame it and look at it or
  something- Yamai-san trust me I didn't have to read your mind to know this.
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, turns out, Komi-san made a weird one super well so Najimi
  can go screw themselves lmao, and guess who took it. <span class="emoji" title="*wink*">😉</span> And last but not
  least, the real deal- There's a maid expert? Can we stop introducing more
  idiots we got enough of them already. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> The worst thing is we know how
  this works, remember the aunt at the summer festival with the strings?
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, just like everyone else, he's full of pride about the *shit*
  this Akito-san lol, but he's an
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/otaku" target="_blank">otaku</a> so I guess
  he'll take in anything lmao can we not show him in the shower. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Anyways, I was correct along those lines, but apart from everyone else in
  class which clearly can be associated with a personality, we have a sadist
  maid here just serving him water and staring at him intently... (Must...
  not... mention...
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34618/Blend_S" target="_blank"
    >Anime reference</a
  >
  haha) One would think to be Agari-chan but this dude is probably right in
  referring to Komi-san as
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kuudere" target="_blank">kuudere</a> so I'll
  leave it at that. I mean, she is though, especially when Tadano is dressed up.
  Yes. As a maid. Thanks to Najimi, and if you still don't believe that all main
  dudes in a romance Anime have to look <i>slightly</i> more gay than they
  actually are, you need to watch more shows. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Komi-san's brother is the
  new god now lmao, Tadano's sister already proved to his family that Tadano is
  that way lol, and of course cross-dressing has to be the next big thing for
  our main girl. I mean, look at the "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/6956/Working"
    target="_blank"
    >WORKING!!</a
  >" series. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay I better stop here, all in all great episode I've
  been typing for a long time already, and WE ARE STILL NOT DONE YET!! Man, what
  else can you give me Anime, I don't even know. Hey, just, take off that maid
  outfit please, Tadano? Haha I'm done

  </blockquote>
  Man, Ryotarou, what did you do to your sister that she's willing to walk for
  days to see towards your safety? <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, in this new episode
  (#TaishouOtome11) where it's nothing but sadness now, Tamahiko heads out of
  home to find his beloved Yuzuki. Aww, that is already so heart warming. You
  know, just in case we have to talk about more bad news. *OOF* Anyways, as he
  heads out, the kids from the village came to find him at his place uphill, and
  <strike>Aya</strike> Ryou-san (Why did I say Aya? Is it from Yuzuki? Oh)
  decided to join him mainly because of her brother, if you would recall, left
  home to work in the city in view of the family's circumstances which of course
  includes that useless father but ignoring that lol, Tamahiko in return also
  wants everyone else in the village to be safe and offers his still sturdy
  abode for all of them to stay for the time being. Ah, nice guy Shima is not
  something I'll say everyday but for this, I'll make the exception lol. So
  yeah, the two head out, and as they walk a day and a half towards the city
  from Chiba which isn't very far but it does take a couple of hours via car
  today so you can imagine walking, they witnessed a lot of sad news along the
  way just by looking at the houses that were destroyed... besides the Tokyo
  train station that is still standing. Yep, can imagine how bad that is
  already. Also, if both of them are going good chances one of the people they
  want to see <i>might be in trouble- I don't want to know!!</i> *aches* Okay
  not going to jinx it since I didn't <span class="emoji" title="*wink*">😉</span>, this is also ironically, the
  episode that brought everyone together. Okay, not Tamahiko's dad because I
  rather he be cremated right now lmao, but yay MVP Tamako is back!! <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  And this is our first salvation point: medical assistance in times of crisis.
  We also met the uncle who has prepared a first aid station to help the injured
  and Tamahiko who fainted out of fatigue walking the distance, still insists on
  finding Yuzuki no matter what it takes. But as the uncle said too, it'll be
  real hard without a clue unlike Ryou-san who actually knows where the brother
  is working at so at least it's easier. (Yeah she found him, thank goodness)
  From here on, depression only sets in worse because despite with the help from
  Tamako going along to find Yuzuki while Ryou finds her brother in another
  area, the siblings were still unable to locate Yuzu after days of searching
  and asking around. Serious talk though? There's a Chinese saying I know of so
  really "human if alive, corpse if dead" Tamahiko but going by things right now
  where they just cremate people together this might be hard. Like, really
  impossible hard. However, all is not lost, as we almost witnessed someone
  jumping off a bridge into the river- Just joking that wasn't the case, but
  with that the siblings met the actual Midori-san! Yes, the one who Yuzuki was
  supposed to meet... until they were separated- Ah I F**KING KNEW IT I KNEW IT
  WOULDN'T BE THIS EASY lol ah hey, Anime experience. Well, watch enough drama
  like this you'll figure it out too tbh. But yeah, I'm not going to expect a
  pregnant woman to be able to crowd control under such hectic situations along
  with a shortie (GOT HER lol) to not get lost in the flesh, but as Midori
  blames herself for Yuzuki's disappearance and I assume Midori probably got
  taken care of since she does have a baby on her, where also Tamahiko kindly
  left his sister behind to take care of her while bravely continuing his
  search. Luck finally got to the better of him because apart from finding
  another pair of siblings haha how are the Shiratori guys here I don't even
  know but I could use more of their songs hehe, thanks to Tamahiko... sort of
  helping some kids out he was able to locate their "elder sister" who turns
  out, is whom he was searching for. Aww... so there is hope after all. <span class="emoji" title="*smiles*">😊</span>
  All in all... I mean, I've used two packs of tissues and my shirt already what
  more do you want. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> <span class="emoji" title="*sob*">😢</span> So yeah, thank goodness we don't have
  cliffhangers in this series so looks like we might be good. How will this end
  happy when the world around them is on fire? We shall see. Anime, please don't
  create an Anime death I can't even deal with it especially when we are ending
  this year soon
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "This is about eye level for Yuzu" Dude we're in a crisis right now
  and you can still make short jokes? Tamako teach your brother a lesson pls]

  Wow why did they not just slap this as an ad to promote what companies look
  like at the end of the year?? Haha they are literally delaying projects,
  legally. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah hey, don't ask about mine it's the same anyways lmao in
  this new episode (#SenpaiGaUzai11) since it's this timely let me ask you all
  too whoever is reading: How are you going to spend New Year's Eve? If it's me
  I've taken work leave till the new year so <span class="emoji" title="*dabs*">😎</span> Haha ah hey some companies
  get to break until next year so f**k me. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, more stories to
  tell, so I hope your heart is ready because I sure didn't expect all of this
  to happen despite what we have seen so far. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So, story. It's end of
  the year, I'm sleeping all day at home lol not really for the sleeping part,
  but looks like Takeda might be doing that after his judo training so we same
  on that bro haha, but yeah, turns out Futaba might be alone this year. Well,
  seeing that the gramps is going on a fishing trip with his bros who are crazy
  about this super adorable of a granddaughter haha I feel you guys here, in the
  company dinner the guys talked about their plans for the new year. The boss is
  going on his usual skiing trip lol just wow, Ooishi is likely spending his
  single days with what's his name Hijikata haha sorry, don't guess on Sakurai
  because wink wink we know she might be trying to get Kazama to her place, and
  Kazama rather play video games than- Just joking of course he'll go because of
  Yuuto. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> What a terrible excuse isn't it, asking him out afterwards.
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Back to Futaba though, she feels a little sadness in her heart it
  seems, even after saying the year's farewell to her senpai. <span class="emoji" title="*wink*">😉</span> So yeah,
  Natsumi will fix that in a while lmao ah hey, we got better things to fix. So
  looks like we're kind of playing the secondary couple thing here again this
  episode, because Yuuto gave the 360 on his sister by telling her he be hanging
  out with his friend (Must be that girl he paired with back then right? HAHAHA)
  so leaving her alone at home... with Kazama of course are you joking me?
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yep, it's happening for sure, this thing. I know, I know, you would
  think Kazama should be pissed at this liar of a woman lol but yeah, he doesn't
  mind, we've gone this far, so as you may expect they spent the night...
  together... is this even legal? And you dare say you not a couple?? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  The new year's dawn surfaced, and Futaba and Natsumi went for New Year prayers
  in case you don't know that is a thing with Japan not just Anime lol. Futaba
  wore a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kimono" target="_blank">kimono</a> for the
  occasion, but it's not until Natsumi saw Takeda at the shrine too that got her
  embarrassed wearing it. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, with the main couple alone lol, it's
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/omikuji" target="_blank">omikuji</a> time!
  Ah, for this I think the subtitles might have screwed up since not like anyone
  knows of the order of fortunes, so I'll help debunk their argument here by
  saying that... *confused?* Futaba's is higher than Takeda's luck from most of
  the Google search I just did lol, but it really depends, so be sure to get the
  reference slip when you are at your next shrine visit, yes? <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Man,
  didn't know this is a cause for argument too lol. The two then ate ramen at
  the usual place after losing to each other over their argument haha, and... I
  must say Kazama you are just in time to make sure your death day is on the new
  year lol RIP Kazama you will be remembered haha I can't believe we have a
  character death in such a wholesome slice-of-life romance Anime. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  That's why they say you can't judge a book by its cover I guess. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last
  but not least, I guess Kazama wins as he gets to rest on Sakurai's lap I can't
  even- Oh please just <strike>fuck</strike> get together already haha I know
  right? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, Sakurai is going to beat that kid up who tried to
  show something to Kazama with her camera lmao oh dear girl you should've
  uploaded to the cloud haha ah~ ah I think that's good enough for this series,
  isn't it? <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Hey you there, you want wholesomeness and real life all
  put into one love package for your lonely (or not) hopeless romantic heart?
  You've come to the right place. Might I recommend you start from the beginning
  again, and watch how this ends next week. Man, can't describe how good this is
  already, so yeah, we shall see how this ends we still got the main ship to
  ship in this trading company so <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>

  for Futaba-chan's voice it's just too good- Okay, you gotta understand how
  sometimes despite all the simping around not people like her and whatnot some
  of them still turn out to be surprisingly good and I think this is one of
  those cases this is the "brings characters to life" thing I adore about Anime

  that just dropped and I have no idea of, on her birthday on Friday too
  apparently. Yes, it's a digital single, and yes, it isn't great haha okay I
  gotta say more I guess. Overall I just think the melodies aren't great, the
  pop is just there to make it work to be frank, but I did get interested in the
  lyrics of the last song because they started with "bye bye" for some reason
  lol so I guess I might just give that if I had to pad the song count haha
  unlikely because of this anyways<br />

  my side so yay haha it's good man do take a listen to the music video in full

  until this year<br />
  <br />So next week, as confirmed by me lol, we are making next week the final
  week of reviews for Klassic Note 2021, with <b>tacica's best album</b> which I
  will hope I can give more of them considering I'm slowly but sure getting
  interested in them and their album trailer was good, and

  I klike how Sumipe's birthday livestream on Instagram is literally her having
  dinner and eating cake haha even after I went for dinner and choked on a
  fishbone&nbsp;(Audience: lol wut) (yep) I still am able to continue watching
  her stream she has gone for real long I was just doing this post while
  watching/listening to it lol it lasted for 2 hours. Cya guys next time then,
  and as I mentioned earlier in the post, we might be meeting again sooner than
  we think, so let's see if that package is the last spurt I need to finish this
  year's work haha bye

  P.S. I'm probably more excited about the announcement of Anime "BLEACH" and
  its final arc starting... about a year from now in October 2022 so yeah
  that'll take some time but the animation quality is real good at first glance
  so let's hope to not have terrible animation like
