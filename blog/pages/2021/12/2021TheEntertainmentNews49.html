Is this it? Is it that I'm not bored at work and have something to do that I'm
not just tired over the weekend? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay, me, I still don't understand
you lol you literally cried for help at work I can't believe you can still smile
today <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, welcome to the weekend or by the time you read this the weekend is
  over already, but yeah, we are at the final stretch! Of 2021 actually lol that
  package might just appear by this year who knows it's not even sent out yet
  haha by next week I guess. So yeah meanwhile, we have a couple more music
  releases to talk about, the Anime this season I watched are still phenomenal,
  and I may have refreshed social media too often because I'm that bored lol I
  should just play more video games or something
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah, more Anime and music this week, let's get to it! Did you see that
  Fuchigami Mai tour pamphlet

  Looks like we have a student from the countryside? Hey, does this series need
  MORE lore?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where sadly the summer holidays are
  over (#KomiSan09), I guess we have more characters to introduce- You think
  this won't get a season two? I'm just waiting for the end of this month to see
  it happen lol. Anyways, let's talk about country bumpkin and if my Japanese
  were better I would've remembered what her name is because don't forget every
  single character in this series mentioned has a name literally derived from
  their behaviour, so introducing
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/inakamono" target="_blank">Inaka Nokoko</a>
  lol okay what a name, I really thought she was a transfer student until I
  realized (1) she has a Hokkaido accent because she ends with -dabe and (2) she
  is just like everyone else in class where they admire Komi-san too much they
  think everything she does is perfect which is not speaking which does say a
  lot about idolism today so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Nokoko here thinks Komi-san is
  the perfect girl in the city considering her experience being in it lol not
  wrong, but she also gets amazed on how Komi-san can go into a... sandwich
  restaurant I don't want to reference anything intentionally lol, and under
  Najimi's crazy instructions once again, order some ridiculous menu in which is
  obviously not done right but again remember, she has communication problems so
  I must say I'm quite impressed on how she can keep doing this silence thing
  EVERY SINGLE TIME lol I feel like I'll get beat up in the alley if I don't
  speak. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Nokoko probably did a better job than her because she
  probably spoke out her order, and Najimi had to apologize again for what pains
  she let Komi-san go through lol. Next up, and this is why you have a phone
  Komi-san, so friends can message you to invite you to hang out. And so did
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chuunibyou" target="_blank">chuunibyou</a>
  nerd Nakanaka, who despite probably not hanging out with many people, decided
  to take a step ahead of Yamai-san how dare you lmao, to invite her to her
  place and maybe play some video games if dear Komi-san even knows how to use a
  controller lol. But yeah, Nakanaka is just thinking about refresh rates on her
  THREE 4K MONITORS you monster lol, while Komi-san is just thinking if normal
  people had rooms like these. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Spoiler alert though, Komi-san? No, this
  is abnormal. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, for having my dear RumiRumi (Audience: Gross) (I'm
  terribly sorry lol) say so much nerd stuff even I have to question myself if I
  knew of them... I feel sorry for her I feel like I should pay her to stop her
  from voicing this role. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Eventually Nakanaka can't deal with two of
  them alone, so she asked for Najimi's presence who then suggested (and this
  could've been done from the start) (yeah imagine if it's not Tadano teaching
  Komi-san to play but the nerd <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>) playing some party or fighting game
  like... I'm not going to do more references but I think you can guess if you
  are nerd enough lol, and you know, see Nakanaka have a fun time with her
  friends, and when I mean her friends I meant Najimi because that's all she had
  anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, we have part-time job? I thought Komi-san would've
  been better being the mascot since she doesn't speak, but that'll ruin her
  image as the appeal factor to... distribute tissue papers? Okay. And
  ironically, she isn't doing it until the one person who CLEARLY wants tissues
  lol the name is
  <i>so meta</i> (nope, not gonna explain the name) (yeah Facebook come sue me
  lol), where the queues started forming and (why are you here as crowd control
  Yamai-san lol) Najimi and the gang eventually got the work done. <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span>
  Sure, man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not least, they gotta end with a cringe moment
  which I don't mind, but yeah, Komi-san's dream is those future-predicting ones
  in case you don't believe those exist because I dreamt of people having a
  sesame seed on their face lol, and... we can just refer to each other by
  family name lol they haven't gone steady it's too early to call dibs on
  lovey-dovey names yet HAHAHAHAHA lol. All in all though, great episode, we
  don't need new characters stop printing more thanks, and I feel that
  Komi-san's appeal... is running low. Well, at least to me. And I would
  appreciate it if no one comes to my house for death threats, thanks. *locks
  door* Cya guys next time haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Bear in mind this is not an educational programme where we teach you
  to improve your communication skills because as you can see Komi-san can dodge
  everything just by being beautiful and having a broken vocal chord lmao]

  </blockquote>
  Oh Tamahiko and Yuzuki, so that's not true? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> GOT'EM lol in this new
  episode where Hakaru MVP for getting this ball rolling (#TaishouOtome09),
  let's just say all the songs are great when there's only like, 3 of them
  within the village, yes? Ask yourself how many songs people are listening to
  nowadays when like, two decades ago without the Internet we are still
  listening to the same set of tunes. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Rant's over, story time. Man, I
  sound like a Hakaru lol and we will find out about that later, but first,
  Kotori-chan's reason for being at their place. She wants to know about love. I
  mean, she can just go to the nearest brothel to learn about those lmao, but
  yeah, she wants the pure ones, the ones she heard from her twin brother that
  exists for real and is still piping hot... yes she be talking about our main
  couple here. She explains how much scoop she wants from these two, and they
  obligingly agreed just because she be their idol and also, they understood how
  music can be so powerful it makes Klassic Note Song Awards exist lol, but not
  everyone. Hakaru, specifically. Not that he doesn't we'll get to that in a
  moment, but more like, whatever Kotori-chan is now, how she can write songs
  and be an idol of talk, how she can be writing a column for a girl's
  magazine... what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sorry but is this a thing in 1920s Japan? Don't
  forget context, people. Is that really a thing? I don't know now lol. Anyways,
  the two eventually figured both of them out, these twins, especially how
  Hakaru is totally avoiding his sister for some reason, did not even bother to
  talk to her about music no more, considering yes, we saw some flashback of
  Kotori with her brother with the guitar and singing together. Since Tamahiko
  is such good friends with the dude now and he did take a piece of fish from
  his lunch lol, Tamahiko decided to pop the question. Similar to Tamahiko
  though, Hakaru also fell ill as a kid even though he started this music thing
  on both of them, who then decided to give up on music in order to focus on
  recovering, which I guess is fine but you know music can heal wounds too? Not
  just the mental ones? Well I guess you can't really guitar in hospitals so
  that's understandable, but yeah, in just seven years not only did Hakaru
  recover probably be an even bigger miracle compared to Tamahiko's lol I'm
  sorry to say that but your dad is still hating you for killing his wife lmao
  what, Kotori-chan also became a singing legend recognized by many for her
  creative work. Man, it's all the more reason why you should fulfil your
  promise back then. I mean, it's no Tamahiko disability dude, you can totally
  go back into music- You know how cool would that be if it's a twins band??
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I'm sure that exists somewhere, but you know, just an idea?
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, everything else in this episode is not important besides
  the singing with the kids and the last part, so if you missed that I don't
  know why would you, because that was so good I started thinking of my love
  life as a kid- Okay that's impossible that was so long ago haha. All in all,
  it seems like every other episode in this series is meant to make me tear up
  so you're welcome I guess, but yeah, looks like we're only getting more of
  these as their love settles down and we start to link everyone's lives
  together to actually show how much the main couple's lives have changed since
  they were together. And looks like we're getting more wholesome moments where
  Yuzuki goes back home to visit her friend in school. I'm very hopeful from the
  preview that this won't be sad, but we shall see.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "Catching up to Kotori-chan right now would be exhausting" Yeah
  Hakaru, is it though?]

  I know right? Futaba be like questioning why is the whole Anime cast here when
  I'm already disappointed about why aren't all of them in swimsuits right from
  the intro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where it's summer I guess lol and I
  don't hang out with my colleagues at the beach or even for anything <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
  (#SenpaiGaUzai09), I guess this is the fanservice episode, yes? Ah, this is so
  good I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, story. Story goes that Sakurai asked Futaba
  out for a weekend at the beach of course including lodgings, but turns out she
  invited the whole gang. How she invited Natsumi I have no idea, they know each
  other? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, they had a great time. The end. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What, you
  want to know more? What's else to know? We already know the main couple's
  great senpai-kouhai relationship; We already know the secondary couple's great
  lovey-dovey relationship; We already know about Yuuto's soft cheeks... Wait,
  you don't know the last part? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Please, don't even ask me if there's a
  thing between Natsumi and Yuuto, because I'd like to believe that she wouldn't
  be ruining his relationship with the girl he knew at school, but more of,
  Natsumi is surprisingly a nice person despite her... rowdy tendencies like
  skipping school as a kid lol. (Oh yeah she did punch a dude but so did I so)
  (*sshh*) But you know, the gang played on the beach, went for a swim unless
  you're Futaba-chan because for her we gotta start kicking first lol, ate great
  food at the hostel, played with fireworks haha I hate my country for this lol,
  slept or unless you're Kazama or if you're one of the girls who talked about
  relationships with the lights off I doubt you slept haha, and so much more. I
  rather let you experience all the fun that has to be had on this episode
  alone, even the swimsuit reveals don't do them justice. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You know how
  it's always the dudes change faster and they can wait for the girls to line up
  and you see Futaba-chan and you punch yourself in the face? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, I
  feel like I'm going to end up insulting Futaba when I don't want to so I might
  as well stop here. This trip is also technically a time for Natsumi to find
  out about Futaba and her colleagues and it definitely made her feel relieved,
  if anything. We probably wouldn't even need to be worried about how things
  will turn out at this rate, for I rather have Sakurai and Kazama be the main
  couple if I could change this series out lol it'll be a different title by
  then though. All in all, great episode I especially like Natsumi's rack lmao
  hey Kazama I'm with ya, gotta love that smug on Futaba's face when she found
  out about Kazama's thing with Sakurai lmao, and guess who forgot to put on the
  suntan because she got sheltered (literally) by the grandfather every summer.
  I guess we can let the Gramps get pissed off just this year. Wait, next year
  too, Futaba? You can't do this to your
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ojiichan" target="_blank">ojii-chan</a> lol
  who cares amirite?? Haha cya guys for more cringe life stories

  Last stretch, people, so let's end Klassic Note this year with a bang with
  more album releases! Haha man, I wished it was singles and they don't release
  in that Christmas week but oh well. <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> Anyways, for this week, we have
  <b

      target="_blank"
      >Cider Girl's 4th album</a
    ></b
  >
  and despite me talking about me bumping into their releases from time to time
  is always timed on each album lol I did listen to one of the singles tbh, but
  yeah, their style should be easy listening to many but it's always the
  melodies that fail to impress. For this one though, I thought it was actually
  good and accompanied by the short hiatus I had not giving new songs, I was
  able to give a good amount of songs other than the obligatory Anime theme song
  I had to give which was unsurprisingly bad because why would you change pace
  after the first chorus. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So anyways, that was great, and I hope the
  rest of the month will end this well. None of them here are Top 20 contenders
  though lol I just thought

  >. Man, when I realized it was over and tried to listen to a couple of songs
  and they cut me off? Welp. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well I've listened to them many times
  over the years and I'm not so much of a live person so I'm good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (No
  really, I am)<br />
  <br />So for next week, I hope I can review <b>LuckLife's new album</b> which
  is quite a while already I've been giving new songs but I could use more of
  them, before I get totally owned by <b>ChouCho's best album</b> and her
  infamous Anime theme songs trash the heck out of an independent band and I
  have to give half her album already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, ChouCho's prime is

    >like this one that I made recently</a
  >
  with some new type of virus type (lol) (I'm trying to be vague so this won't
  be recorded in detail here, the fire), and only found out maybe I was weird
  after all...? (I had to explain that this irony happens in our bilingual
  society where people do not know of the latter term and I heard it in the
  evening news for half an hour haha) Well, not surprising but their reactions
  are. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Package will be planned to come up by Christmas hopefully I'm
  not going to let that get stuck unintentionally with holiday orders I still
  have a Klassic Note Review due, and I still have the calendar for next year to
  set the next package in so, this and the upcoming one will be the last of this
  year. And maybe in a while because the taxation is coming blah blah blah even
  if not I will likely go for more digital approach ie. not buy physical goods
  and do digital stuff, say e-books or fanclub memberships. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
  <a href="https://fc.toyamanao.com/" target="_blank">I have plans</a>, so we
  shall see. Cya guys then, and until next time... I hope you're still happy.
  I'm not, and I mean deep inside thanks to work, so yeah, I may want some
  change by next year, maybe starting with dealing with Army stuff I don't even
  want to deal with but have to. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Bye.

  P.S. Oh wow the new launcher which hosts that DOAXVV game will check your
  region? I may need a plan B for this because I don't have any lol maybe web
  version? That wouldn't be easy for grinding OR will it look good on my 24"
  monitor though so DMM GAMES can we don't
