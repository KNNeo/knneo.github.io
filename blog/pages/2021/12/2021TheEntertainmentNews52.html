Hey, it's the last week of the year in case you don't know there are 52 weeks in
a year so let's finish all this up! From this season's Anime and the ones next
week because if I'm not wrong it starts as early as next week on the new year,
to Klassic Note for the year, looks like we have a lot to wrap up! Let's do this
properly and in style, yes? Yeah don't worry I have the mood to do so now I'm on
work leave until next year WHOOOOOO haha ah hey
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I did play some Christmas in the past few days apparently. I got my package
  delivered which you should read back on the post I love how it's just all
  bromides lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, I got a new sweater yesterday during that Secret Santa
  exchange which isn't bad but I love the one I bought for myself haha, and I
  finally rolled some new outfit in the Christmas event in DOAXVV. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay
  the last one is just for me but have you even tried to play that game? You'll
  know haha ok Anime time but let's clear out the current stock first before
  talking about what's next<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KomiSan12">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span
      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Komi-san wa, Komyushou Desu.</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "Komi-san, can you walk 100 metres around the classroom?" lol that's show
      business for ya
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Wow Komi-san brings out the old crowd and brings in the new ones haha she's
  almost like a tourist attraction. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode for this
  season <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> (#KomiSan12) we conclude this school festival, I guess. Hey, I
  know we must always end with good endings as Najimi-san would have wanted but
  we will still make that happen no matter what... right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, we
  don't have evil villains in this it's at most Yamai-san or something haha.
  Anyways, story. Firstly, Najimi be thinking of how to boost sales for the
  class maid cafe which they thought of and of course, wanted it to be good just
  because since there's a class ranking in place and they are bathing in lots of
  not money but festival credits or vouchers, and asking Komi-san to be free PR
  isn't exactly bad it clears out the crowds real well considering you might
  only be able to sit in there for at most 5 minutes lol, but things like
  exchanging vouchers for direct interactions with the maids probably went too
  far they got the attention of the teachers in school so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> With that in
  mind, Najimi changed tactics (lol) by expediting on Komi-san's unheard of
  popularity by letting her walk the school premises to promote the cafe but
  also since she is interested to see what's up around the festival too, from
  haunted houses to whatever confession corner that I'll never go to anyways I'm
  not going to talk about new characters because I seriously don't care haha yes
  I know cute ghost, and thank goodness this is over sooner than later as Najimi
  got sent to the meditation club haha. The class did effectively win the school
  festival but I guess it's against the rules so don't expect too much lol, but
  they did have a fun time. You know, Najimi trying to smoke this I can't even.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then, we have the evening dance. It's great how they make sure
  Tadano stays in that outfit because besides being a real disguise to let him
  be with Komi-san and not have the rest of the school trying to stab his back
  lmao, I guess it's a "she" now, she can dance with Komi-san for the same
  reason. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Serious question though:&nbsp;<i
    >HAVE YOU TURNED GAY BECAUSE OF MAID TADANO YET??</i
  >&nbsp;lol) (Yes, female audiences included here haha) And Najimi joined in on
  the dance so it wasn't that fun anymore haha. Next up, it's karaoke time. Hey,
  we know at least two songs will appear in this namely the ending and opening
  theme songs for the series but yeah, looks like they are not even deliberating
  on these too, so don't expect any new songs for the soundtrack, by the way.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Najimi planned for everyone to sing a song which means
  Komi-san too but you know, you don't have to listen to her sing you can just
  imagine it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And I like how everyone has a sort of theme song to sing
  not including Najimi who sung am equivalent amount to my music library of
  2000+ songs lol but seriously if this is 2008 and Anime "Kannagi" would've let
  them sing and make these into a song collection album. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> *ahem* Oh
  well, they ran out of budget haha. Anyways, I hope Tadano's singing will be in
  the soundtrack lol why is even BUMP of CHICKEN getting so much indirect
  credit, even though probably only Komi-san liked it as everyone else is
  basically when I am Tadano singing in the karaoke haha don't worry that didn't
  happen I don't go karaoke with friends. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And between Komi-san picking
  the ending theme and the guys trying to sing the opening theme together and
  you know that will not happen they really ran out of budget lol, it was a fun
  time and a great way to end this season. And speaking of budget, yep if you
  have been following their Twitter you should have known, because apart from
  the totally subtle hint from Komi-san at the back, you would have believed
  this will get a sequel, and so it did. So yeah, I guess we will find out what
  happens to these two huh. Hopefully. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, we can but hope. We hoped
  for Anime "Takagi-san" season three and look what is going to happen next
  season. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, we can make this happen we're letting Komi-san
  transcend boundaries in popularity from the Anime world into real life we'll
  make her the next Justin Bieber or Ariana Grande- Oh it's still licensed by
  Netflix Japan? Oh well forget it haha I guess I'll wait for the next time this
  happens lol. All in all, this series has been nothing but surprises and fun
  and jokes, from the weird reality they throw at you having a plethora of
  personalities on the classmates but then eventually converging into a common
  affection to Komi-san, it's all easy if you have such a class in your high
  school life to look forward to. Ask how many of us had such an experience.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, it's Anime, it's fun, hopefully Komi-san will speak as much
  as her mother someday or maybe her dad lol, but yeah, it was a joy to watch
  this. Just... get the licensing out of the away it's hard to get subtitles for
  this haha cya guys next season

  You know how we already know if the ending is good before the final episode?
  Hey I'm not complaining I just said I missed shows like these where it doesn't
  turn into a cliffhanger and kill everyone at the end lol. In this final
  episode (#TaishouOtome12) we know we be trailing a different kind of tears,
  and not because of sadness we have experienced so far. If you need a hint, we
  can understand this through Yuzuki's flashback. So, story. I guess we start
  with Yuzuki's... unconsciousness state? Because apart from her seeing her
  mother and thinking if she can live to tomorrow (OOF), we have also learnt the
  other half of the story we have heard from Midori-chan when we saved her last
  week. But more than that, we also got a glimpse of the story before all this
  happened. So yeah it's basically Yuzuki did something for the father so I
  guess the mom didn't let her go she probably was also mad having to deal with
  the uncle's debt- What in the actual fuck? Anyways, that is all decided it's
  not like there is any other choice, Tamahiko's dad be b*tching in the car with
  Yuzuki about how terrible of a son he has because he lost his wife and somehow
  it's his problem lol ok f**k you dad, but I guess Tamahiko got lucky anyways
  he got a great wife. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> We then saw what happened after the separation
  from Midori, where Yuzuki had to tread ground to seek shelter, chanced upon
  those two kids and were hiding in shelter from the cold alone... until I guess
  she can't hold out anymore, this Yuzuki. But yeah, as we have also learnt last
  week, eventually Tamahiko found her, and she was brought to first aid where
  the uncle is with everyone. And yeah, in true Yuzuki fashion, because she
  regretted not being able to tell the guy in her life about her true
  feelings... and I guess shame doesn't matter anymore you can only do this once
  and who knows if another earthquake were to strike haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Talking about
  the strike, looks like this disaster also struck the Shima family. No, not
  talking about Tamahiko or Tamako but&nbsp;I really thought we getting this
  episode concluded real smooth but guess what, we got some backend lore to put
  in, so cue the rest of the Shima family I guess. (I normally would've thought
  seeing lore like this would put this along with Anime "Shingami Bocchan" with
  a sequel but I guess... eh sequel? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) Tamayo is the elder sister who
  came with the father and no surprises there, it was because one of his (other)
  sons Tamaki is down due to the earthquake and I guess he required his
  brother's help ie. the uncle? Oh, excuse me, he summoned for the uncle.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, is it surprising that this dude ie. the father will have family
  problems from his siblings too? Go figure. Anyways, the uncle refused and gave
  him a referral to get someone else in face of staying here to take care of the
  people here yeah brave dude here, so the other Shima people left for now, not
  even asking for regards. Tamahiko was being nice though by knowing of their
  safety, but I guess this won't pay back anyways when you dealing with a bunch
  of heartless jerks *BOOM* Haha moving on ugh (lol), it's been a month and a
  half, and they finally got back to the village from Tokyo, everyone in the
  village is fine, how did an
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onsen" target="_blank">onsen</a> appear in
  the mountains near the village I don't even know, the girls be doing their
  secret talks which made Tamako jealous lmao I love her already (haha ah hey),
  Ryou apologized for her actions due to her being in the circumstances similar
  to Yuzuki but she got off better haha I know right, and Hakaru is the coolest
  guy on Earth. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And you can enjoy the last part yourself haha how many
  times have they kissed? I mean, I would be satisfied with hugs but Yuzuki be a
  pretty horny bit- All in all haha, this is a great series to cry to. Haha I
  say this in the nicest way possible, but not because I'm a nice person lol I'm
  not as bad as the Shima father lol, but also because, they give you good
  reasons to cry to, with a beautiful plot line and circumstances that would
  make everyone jealous. If your love was as bittersweet and perfect as these
  guys... don't tell me you got sold off to the rich okay? Haha this series is
  amazing the historical context only made it more cringe hehe it's good though
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I see the opening theme every week and I see Kotori-chan and I ask
  myself is there anything else better than her and yes there is it's Tamako
  HAHA hey she is MVP every week okay even if episodes she wasn't in lol yeah
  she MVP in episode 1 too]

  so I don't know what you meant HAHA GOT'EM "The Shima family as no use for
  him" I'm like you gotta wonder if Tamahiko would one day screw over his dad
  and make him die along with him isn't it? Well, your son has been nice to you
  FYI
</div>
<div>
  P.P.S. "Thanks to the clumsy kindness Tamahiko-sama has shown me..." This
  series in a nutshell haha I aim to be a man with clumsy kindness hehe<br />
  [Goddamn, just imagine how good that'll be if we get to talk about every other
  person in the Shima family besides the dad! Tamayo voiced by KitaEri too? That
  is such a treat I want to see life-changing stories from a bunch of jerks to
  people like Tamahiko haha maybe that's how we get the sequel]

      this series in a nutshell lmao
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  After what I have gone through at work, I think my work life is only going
  further away from the perfection that is this Anime haha what am I saying.
  Anyways, in this final episode (#SenpaiGaUzai12) we answer the ultimate
  question: why is Sakurai's rack this big- Okay, me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's try this
  again, we answer the ultimate question: What is Futaba going to do about
  her... affection towards Takeda? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay this is weird too can we move
  on? No? Haha well then I guess we will talk about this instead. Story goes
  that Futaba feels lonely. Haha, if this is not obvious enough since Episode 1,
  you need to watch this again from the top. And with Futaba doing well at her
  job but Takeda in a different level now literally landing contracts that keep
  the company going, you gotta wonder how the distance between their job levels
  are expanding further away from each other even if they both are improving.
  But yeah, maybe that's why Futaba feels weird, as evidenced from herself being
  happy for Takeda to say the least as seen by Tsukishiro and then Natsumi haha
  (Oh yeah don't worry everyone is prepared to roast Futaba she is on the grill
  already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>), but also, that others especially girls are happy to
  celebrate the occasion with this senpai. You know, other girls in the company
  apart from Futaba. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I guess that's a problem lol, and she still egged
  him to go despite Takeda not willing to play along with the party the others
  intend to hold for him. But as the days pass and Futaba helps out her dear
  senpai at work when he's in a pinch, or how he even gets lectured by her
  specifically for not playing along with others haha I know Takeda that's a
  problem for me too it's always hard to say no, Futaba just ended up enjoying
  some alone time she didn't ask for just because of these recent events. As
  Futaba drinks alone in the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/izakaya" target="_blank">izakaya</a> instead
  of being with Takeda like she normally does, she recalls the days when she
  started with him which is how you get the title drop haha, Takeda how did you
  mistake the newbie as some kid on tour of the premises? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, I
  wouldn't even dare to say that even if it's just a baby in the office.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, Takeda screwed up big time teaming up with her, but as
  Futaba is such a matured and forgiving adult (see what I did there? haha) and
  is so nice to her co-workers she decides to forgive him, but yeah, that's how
  she learnt he's annoying. Even till now. But it's also this annoyance and
  being together for so long (at work, at work) (haha) that really brings up the
  rapport between them, especially when Takeda came to save her at her most
  hopeless moments even if it's some drunk thinking this kid is here to drink
  lmao okay that dude is already dead as a newbie in whichever company he's in.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But despite all this, and I can't reiterate too much this paragraph
  is doing itself lol, no one can still get rid of this... level of relationship
  between these two that is honestly not romantic. No really, it's the stuff you
  wish will last forever in your career but we know it's not that simple. I
  mean, I wouldn't expect to enjoy my rapport with my superior after I leave the
  company I work now so, so shouldn't anyone else. But at least for now
  Futaba-chan is in great hands, so what else is new? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, the
  last part with the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/aiaigasa" target="_blank">aiaigasa</a> is
  probably the stuff you came here for if you watched this haha, the
  illustration at the end is the PERFECT representation of this series as a
  whole, and I CAN NOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS haha okay the adulting stuff is
  probably half the reason I gave this series a try. But apart from that, this
  is a great series to watch overall, and I'm sorry if you can't relate to any
  of these yet especially the work part but trust me, you will if you worked a
  couple of years in your full-time job like me. And for that, I thank this
  series for showing me the way and make me not hate my work for three months
  lol it has been rough haha I meant my job HAHAHA all of them here are having a
  great time
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; If you need a differentiation between this and other similar shows,
  Futaba-chan is nothing but shame and it makes of the best kind of drama haha
  really think about it]

  So as usual, I'll talk about the stuff happening in the next couple of months,
  and I already know quite a few that I'll be watching because sequels so let's
  see what else I can be watching that is not sadness and cringe adult romance
  haha:
</div>
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      I don't think I'm ready for
      <b>"Hakozume: Kouban Joshi no Gyakushuu"</b> just because this main girl
      wants to change her job as a police officer but can't and I've been at the
      same place for 3 years. Please stop me haha
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>"Tokyo 24-ku"</b> seems real cool but I don't think I want to take in
      any fake society bullsh*t considering these guys have special powers so no
      thanks lol
    </li>
    <li>
      I know for sure <b>"Shuumatsu no Harem"</b> is a show for ma bro and not
      for me so I'm good- Is that blood?? Okay I'm good
    </li>
    <li>
      Hmm looks like

          target="_blank"
          >"Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi o Suru"</a
        ></b
      >
      [Premieres 8th January 2022] might be actually a thing after all, being
      all weird with circumstances this might sound interesting, but with ecchi
      references I don't know I can get around with, and a more obscure genre of
      not cosplay but dolls I am definitely hesitating to give this a shot. The
      romance seems to be interesting though, might try an episode so see how
      this goes actually. I mean, stuff you don't get in real life is Anime
      right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      We are still in for

          >"Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3"</a
        ></b
      >
      [Premieres 7th January 2022] because mainly the new season of Takagi-san
      seems to be able to conclude the story between blockhead Nishikata and
      master teaser Takagi who both, can't get around to being together other
      than middle school (yep) classmates. So yeah, we shall see how. Second
      season provided such a strong premise, I can't wait to see more of Ohara
      Yuiko singing the opening and per episode ending covers by Takagi's voice
      actress Takahashi Rie lol okay yes I'm in for the plot especially the
      other three girls haha
    </li>
    <li>
      And yeah I guess we had to finish this at some point but not one year ago,

          >"Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2"</a
        ></b
      >
      [Premieres January 9th 2022] will of course be on my list just because I
      ended up giving that first episode where I see Eren's mom eaten up by a
      titan. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay that was 2013 already so my regrets have long
      subsided as I see the final season be pelted with nothing but warfare and
      deception and how Eren will end up taking all 9 Titan powers for himself
      maybe ending this war in a stroke but who knows, but whatever happens I'll
      be glad to be done with this sh*tfest lol okay it's not that bad the
      action is the reason I'm here anyways
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>"Tensai Ouji no Akaji Kokka Saiseijutsu"</b> sounds like a life I want
      to have where I do stupid things and get praised for it which of course I
      don't start waking up already reality is harsh unlike Anime so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      I get it that
      <b
        >"Koro<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shiai" target="_blank">shi Ai</a
        >"</b
      >
      is literally a word pun for what the plot is about (killing each other or
      as the spacing as indicated, assassin love), and I think that sounds like
      a great idea it reminds me of partners at work similar to Anime "Kyokou
      Suiri" where you had to choice but to let the one-sided romance happen
      because of job reasons. But hey, at least that's how you get away with it,
      slapping the romance genre on this series lol. But it really looks way
      more serious than I thought, so eh... maybe not haha Oonishi Saori is in
      this though the last time she was main was like what, Anime "Sonny Boy"?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    So yeah, in summary I'll be already watching two sequels potentially their
    final season adaptation *looks at Takagi* and picking up one new if I can
    take the main girl being such a hottie and showing so much flesh- <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
    I think I'll be alright and if I don't I'll just bail haha this upcoming
    season sucks man... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  </blockquote>
  So this is the final week for this year of Klassic Note for giving new songs,
  and not that I padded the numbers for this because I'm listening as casually
  as I always do besides the judgement haha, so let's see what are the last ones
  to make the list.

  wasn't too bad but I can't bring myself to give even half the songs on the
  list at this moment so maybe we'll revisit this next year (no promises) if I
  have the mood.

  came as a surprise because I legit thought their 15th anniversary as a band is
  that mini-album back in August with songs written by others for them, but I
  guess I was wrong because this is an album full of new songs and I guess I
  gave a few to end the year for them. And yes, I gave the one song from

  to pad this, but not by much it's just to battle my OCD lol. And just a note,
  Kuso Iinkai's new album which will be released next week will be delayed in
  review (from me) to next year, so they will start the year with a preset list
  of artists I've liked over this year, so we will see about that when it
  happens.

  going on from some days ago to some time next week so about next Wednesday?
  Yeah, I'll talk about them again next week if you don't mind lol<br />
  <br />
  So for next week, in case you are not in the know, I'm a solo listener of
  J-Pop and J-Rock maybe Anime songs for the past 13 years and for the 14th time
  coming known as Klassic Note, and I decide yearly what songs make the best out
  of my year and/or what doesn't, also known as the
  <b>Klassic Note Song Awards</b>. Well, we don't promote the ones that are bad
  so only good songs haha I know right I get to handpick 200+ songs a year and
  there are <i>still</i> songs that suck? Impossible lol<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  And as I finish probably the final post for the year besides the Song Awards
  and listening to Kohara Konomi's Instagram live in peace haha it's great I
  can't afford to miss it, I probably will come up with a couple more posts
  since I'll be super free next week so either I'll just sleep or catch up on
  streams I've missed over the months lol, or I'll do up a roundup for the
  packages this year even though we haven't gotten the calendar next week.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, it's here, it shipped into that forwarding service warehouse so
  we are halfway there already haha. Cya guys next week, I mean, next year then,
  and until next time... oh yeah if I have nothing else I'll just say "Merry
  Christmas and a Happy New Year" lol I've become so old I forgot about
  formalities haha get out of here<br />
