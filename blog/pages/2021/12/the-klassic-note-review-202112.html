  Ah hey what did I tell you about seasonal reviews? Haha just that it's not
  SCANDAL singles lol they didn't release one in December anyways there's
  already an album for next year
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Talking about NOT those girls lol, we talk about the new stuff we have picked
  up! And thanks to Anime once again, I've found myself treading new yet
  familiar grounds with great songs to please, and I can't wait to talk about it
  too! Congrats Anime "Komi-san" for the season two announcement yesterday by
  the way; This couldn't have dropped in at a better time haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Without further ado, let me introduce to you to Kitri!</div>

  (That's all to be honest; It's not like we know if Komi-san knows how to play
  the piano)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: I think it comes off as surprise to me as it is to them, but this
  sisters singer-songwriter group is doing pretty well for themselves. Pretty
  much all of the songs are written by them, they had to let a producer in to do
  his work for Anime ending theme of "Komi-san", but that doesn't mean they made
  it worse, because as we have learnt that's how they get their styles in, and
  as we will talk about in detail, you'll realize they have the same vibes as if
  you have missed hearing them a decade ago even though they are totally new to
  the industry. Let's see what is in them in an age full of image that makes
  their music stand out.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Hikare Inochi [Charmed Life]</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Charmed (by) life</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Shouting from within the heart</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Whenever the hardship might be too</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "The sky is nice" and so on, those nice words
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">And move forward with (those)"</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>
  I have to say that I was pretty impressed with this song at first listen, and
  being an Anime theme song does have its benefits, but more than that, we have
  overlooked on what was inside it that makes it good. For starters, it is a
  wonderful ending song, and it always hits the heart every week, so you can
  understand how nice this is already in impact. But more than that, since the
  girls wrote the lyrics, they also knew to write them to suit the main
  character in the Anime who is in essence a very fresh but yet nice person,
  which will explain her desires to break out of her social anxiety to make
  friends, in her case. In this song though, the lyrics bring more of hope and
  motivation of life itself, and how we are stronger being with others. For
  these, I'm proud to have given this song.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Better than normal Anime theme songs Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Sympathy</div>
<div>From first verse:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Cool person? Nice person?</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">The type to hold (a) secret?</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Making judgements based on image is such a taboo
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Before (the) brain decides to befriend or otherwise
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Let's try to talk (to each other)"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  Ah, this felt like such a joke because of its use in Episode 1 of the Anime
  until you realize its potential. At first listen, this didn't hit me more than
  a meme because it was literally used as a drop to answer in silence, but now
  that I've actually heard the piano plays from the girls and listened to the
  lyrics, it's actually a really good song, combining the actual meme of the
  Anime main character's social anxiety issues but also, to show that hint of
  romance and crush and whatever makes of love these days, it's great. So yeah,
  as the first chorus says: "misunderstanding (this song) is fine, is fine"
  after all.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Super cool Above Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: I've not been impressed with a single for a while, and this comes
  in as a fresh yet familiar feel that I know I will no doubt sink into in the
  near future. There isn't much to explore for now, but as they continue their
  journey beyond their 2nd album, I know I can find something that might get
  into my alley, especially with this much piano and emotion you can't find
  anywhere else. For this, I would say ignore the Anime, for Kitri is definitely
  a lot more than you can imagine.

  So yeah, there aren't many surprises with this release because this is not
  some idolism thing I have to care which is great, even though for mainstream
  I'm still&nbsp; &nbsp;unhappy with them not using a non-Anime cover since it's
  such a neglect to the artist itself, which is why I didn't hesitate to choose
  which Komi-san bromide I'd want lol. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Don't worry, I
  <strike>outsourced</strike> offloaded that task to my friend who also watched
  this Anime and the one from

  What is interesting in this though, is besides coming with the long awaited
  package for about a month which I thought initially this CD can't hop in for
  the ride but it ended up waiting for two weeks more lol, is that the lyrics in
  the booklet aren't your usual font, which makes me believe that
