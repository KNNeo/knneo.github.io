The only kind of treat I'll get is not getting bugged with work on a Sunday. Hope I haven't jinxed it by writing this in the morning haha <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span><div><br></div><div>Now that you figured out I write my intros prior to the rest of the post lol, in order to keep up with this weekly stuff and NOT be manipulated by the exclusivity in power of streaming services ie. Netflix haha, I'll watch Anime "Komi-san" - as much as I hate it - in Chinese, my native language. The last time I had to do this has almost a decade ago where in contrast, the lack of English subtitles made me follow Chinese fansubs. This is similar but where is the progress, people? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Enough about politics and my package appearing next week because it's for the better for it is (technically) a 3-day work week for me HAHAHAHA yeah I totally planned this week by the way by staying at home whole week and... eating... medication lol the latter is not part of the plan haha let's Anime and music<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KomiSan04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Komi-san wa, Komyushou Desu.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Did (Komi-san) bribe the judge?" lol Makeru-chan why would she do that</div></blockquote><a href=https://jisho.org/search/shintaisokutei target=_blank>Health check-ups</a>? GOOD LUCK KOMI-SAN lol well I guess she can use her hands but really man... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I should've not spoke in school to see if anyone will rage at me lmao well in this new episode (#KomiSan04) man is this episode is really dark with Yamai-san at the helm- Imagine if Komi-san could speak. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, I would've. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And as with past episodes, don't expect this to be a smooth ride because we may have made some exceptions which we will live to regret in the near future... especially dealing with a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yandere target=_blank>yandere</a>. I must say though, this is a first in many things including understanding how this character type is handled in friendships instead of romance so let's talk about it at length. Before that though, we'll talk a little about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/makeru target=_blank>Makeru</a>-chan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As her name implies, she has a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/makezugirai target=_blank>sore loser</a> personality but considering she is already a sore loser the moment she was given her name lmao, and her comparing herself to bespoke goddess Komi-san (haha) (Yep see what I did there?) is just asking for a showdown we will never speak about again. Well, Makeru-chan here won't anyways she lost in weight and in torso height ie. she got shorter legs (are they daikon though, that's the question) (JOKES! lol) and Komi-san... let's just say she can still smoke the whole check-up session without opening her mouth. I mean, it isn't hard, but considering mannerism in Japan is also to speak up... well she is getting out of it easy though, good for her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (FYI <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yada target=_blank>Makeru's family name</a> is also a joke, because people say that when they lose lmao) And then, on to the topic at hand because if we delay any longer I'll get death stares lol. We should know of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yamai target=_blank>Yamai</a>-san, who threatened Tadano to never lay his hands on perfect goddess Komi-san lol whatever (Yamai-san please keep that chopstick away lol), who is nice and fashionable on the surface but reeks of the darkness no one would ever question about not even Najimi-san you should've looked at the expression on their face haha. Anyways, this girl wants to be friends with Komi-san I mean everyone does, but you know, she just chose to do it in her own way. Besides ridding of competition with just her very, very menacing attitude and I'm not talking about Komi-san's anxiety lol, she also will do literally ANYTHING, to force them off her target. In this case, the target is Komi-san of course. Unknowingly to her though, Yamai here has done some hideous things to Komi's recently made friends. Scaring Agari-chan away, threatening Najimi-san to get a chance to talk to her to even having lunch with her, to locking Tadano inside her bedroom... wait wait, what was that last bit? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yep, I don't know how Tadano can stay there for hours on end without alerting anyone else in the abode haha hard to say the parents may be working, but yeah, you kidnapped my very first friend in high school Ren-chan I think you need to be buried in the mountains. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Somehow Yamai just sticks to Komi-san especially assuming the Tadano seat just because lol, and Najimi suggested Komi-san going to her place to talk more if she wants. Yamai chose that over the hostage she locked up at her place, and I think you can guess the rest. I mean, dealing with this normally and seeing all this unravel as Komi-san even, but man is this kinda surreal. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, at least Komi-san did tell her off, and Yamai did apologize for what she has done (begrudgingly lol), but overall I must say this is quite an experience one wouldn't easily forget, let alone forgive. Lastly, I hate to say this because I have no friends lol, but friends are not meant to be protected. They are meant to be with you whenever you need them. That's it. Everything else doesn't matter. If they serve to protect you, or vice versa, that's on them. Think about it. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay maybe I'm telling my head off lol no one will save me when I'm kidnapped by Yamai-san in her room lmao actually that'll be great that might be my only chance in any girl's room BOOM GOT ME haha just... just be careful of that girl for the rest of you guys lmao cya guys again for more friends to befriend... with extreme personalities because don't forget this is a prestigious school we have all sorts of weird f**ks in here lol (mental hospitals be the same BOOM GOT THEM haha ok bye)</div><div>[TL:DR; Really, if your focus isn't Komi-san speaking A WHOLE SENTENCE in this episode, go back and watch that again, please. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOZU_I4sIrPEsFhQJ6z-EBPnq7VlrdJSfWeWMNt827r3JNmSpAqC1XgP_8DhN3dzMtEVD-eLmRt6YMYoFuxpCLlyzpmwo-pgV-OgPrAXQ4MbS4hbJqLPFy5kyvKeIbdzuhjin21QD2nUBTHRwfpjav2rKJKbEUIs2L-Pl6T9fR-bK40w/s320/komisan04_punk.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This series is pretty screwed so let's talk more about it<br>(How you know you the real punk in class lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6Mkp9mnUPzgvme8fp2u_-5NE-0754N_rHQFwodqPmOz4upmsDGtyEdFtKmlOyuOjILJ5lV5pEomC1KpvTophCtQ2eT8hn85i6Dp_4PxAF1ejCfeGzac4gutoWtykAQ63uniIV7IT1f9BIw8KTWcb6XF50JLdtcM1ezfw7Uve_Hb3Wmw/s320/komisan04_photos.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This series is pretty screwed so let's talk more about it<br>(Maybe I should start doing this to my idols haha ah)</table></div></div>P.S.

Not at all!" Haha okay Tamahiko you being a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsundere target=_blank>tsundere</a> here? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>"Yuzu... take good care of her" Yeah okay like we can rely on you Tamahiko lol- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this at all, huh. Too real, man, too real. In this new episode where all you need is introduce new characters to piss me off lol (#TaishouOtome04), someone was down. Well if it's Tamahiko it's like every other day considering his pessimistic personality, but I'm talking about the waifu. You gotta wonder though, it's not about whether Yuzuki will be down, it's just when. She takes care of the house and its occupants which increased to 3 including herself with the sister's arrival, so it is not surprising if it's adding to the only worker for things around the abode. Still, Tamako has been a trouper by helping out so that's a plus, so it's no wonder that the sister took control once they found out about Yuzuki falling ill and not telling them. And this is where we actually see the problems that they will have to face being nobility especially losing an arm. It's no surprise no one knows what to do, so finding a doctor around the village will be first priority. Even Tamako knows her brother is not good with people especially losing the power from an arm, but she still took the initiative to actually find someone despite how society views of them which is basically paying money for things to happen, like any other nobility. But that doesn't mean they aren't humble, but we'll leave that part out for now because no matter how much they do, the dad will never change anyways. *BOOM* Still, Tamahiko realized how useless he was at this situation even being a male, can hardly ever carry Yuzuki with a fever to the nearest bed in the house. So yeah, time to be pessimist now, I guess. Yuzuki fortunately is okay within the day, and Tamahiko got sh*tted on by the doctor and his assistant who is FEMALE WHAT THE F**K WHY YOU HIRE LOWLY FEMALES- Okay joke's over. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways haha, you get the gist, it's 1920s Japan where people think they are talking down to others and no one has manners lol, but blah blah that's why this series is rather depressing considering they had to kinda talk about social hierarchy things here and there every time. Come on, the dude is just paying for your services. What is admirable though, is how much Tamako is holding on to her personality on the surface such that the doctor can know she is from the Shima family, yet be matured enough to know these lowlifes (lol) don't know about how much these guys have grown to be able to... well, how should I describe it? Hold on to their pride at the right time? Yeah, let's go with that. And that, I say Tamako be MVP because the brother is literally just Episode 1 again where he thinks he cannot support Yuzuki and let her overwork being under her care. Dude, emotional support be important too, yes? Also, trust. Ironically Yuzuki didn't trust the members of the household enough to say anything, huh. That's on you, girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, we learnt about Yuzuki's 2nd weakness lmao did I mention this is Anime and she is the perfect Anime waifu, Tamako decided to not extend her stay at this outpost to pursue a doctorate good luck lmao, and all is well. Tamahiko is still technically dead though, I don't know how the doctor knew one of his arms didn't work lol maybe he is only dead to the eyes of the brothers fiance families I suppose haha bye I need to read up on more vocabulary lol</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpwomncJ6yVwc6bZ0Dn_Bw3gIVykV2EjS5CX-lkqzP_XrXoTIwqgO1y-GuSGNvb9YcaIZdQJStVk-b5CnHA9Cv4N-PQXi52gPneOanJqMk-wJeGYNYHUdbFJsR5xja8hwmA90VK6nXH8EksLYhVB6cLW49cI70nhd2toye5dWrHDY-cg/s320/taishouotome04_fire1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When I meant "she's in heat" I didn't mean this<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwriYSEF0nCZI0o64jtQ0AnVUwtAUJrqgxou5-1NcIrm79PV9_JFbReBgmlS0ZS7D8VigdbDjMJ2jHWhRB_FUSVYopCfVTh_45bnFbumo1RuWHF_xLQjeCJE4PIff9urtie2rC65MJqqbhB5HieaCu3AnfjJ2OL5Wdpf4083TRuYoRyQ/s320/taishouotome04_tamako8.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Nothing better than setting a hot bath for yourself after a hard day's work.<br>Too bad I don't even have one *copium*</table></div></div>P.S.

The happiness thing is just icing on the cake. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, new episode (#SenpaiGaUzai04), Takeda only has a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/garake target=_blank>not smartphone</a> haha great start, and Futaba-chan is down. I have a feeling there is a theme to this week's Anime episodes lmao why are you all mocking on my predicament earlier this week, but hey, not like this dude's gonna leave her alone and do nothing. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Ah hey, instead of thinking it the romance way, let's consider it in the too real way when you live alone and no one is there to take care of you. Specifically, family. Oh, and I'm assuming your family cared about you before you went to the city to work, fellas. Anyways, this is all on Futaba, and I just wonder how hard it is - hear me out - to reach out to others to curb that illness- Uh, I mean, loneliness. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> So, story. This episode is this week for me in a nutshell. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah, we done with the review? Thanks for reading haha okay serious talk now, because it's actually rather similar. First, we talk about the illness. Yeah, and honestly this is the only similar part haha because apart from just getting the cold which I often do if the seasons change fast and give me days of cold weather and/or I forgot to take some pills to get rid of preliminary symptoms, this is normally what happens when you fall ill, kids who are still not working, so pay attention. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, the Anime summarized it perfectly especially in a modern context, you don't really have to do anything but inform your colleagues inside normally you guys would have a group chat it's 2021 already we don't do calls lol Takeda please get a smartphone haha, and then see your local GP and/or rest. Well, depending on your job scope, you may be interrupted of your rest so I can't assure if you will recover in 2 days lol that's what happened to me earlier this week, but yeah, we don't call those doctor advices like "take ample rest" for no reason, let alone deal with it without them. But hey, in both cases, I guess, doctors aren't important I guess haha because when you have each other... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay we touching on this romance stuff again, huh. But yeah, Futaba-chan got it first, and Takeda only initially dropped by with groceries which I will also never do unless we're real close more than colleagues even *giggle* (nope, not happening), but yeah, she took it off on him (lol) because the first thing you would have realized is, dealing with recovery is a pain when you are living alone. You have to get stuff to eat with a body in fatigue even if you don't cook which means fresh, hot stuff is hardly gonna happen, you still gotta take some meds which again if you don't have enough you have to buy them... basically means dealing with it alone sucks. So yeah, can't wait to land on a job where this can happen to me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh yeah, I gotta move out first. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But that's essentially the episode though, with Takeda not having a smartphone so he didn't know Futaba took sick leave in the first place, now also has one so he doesn't have to... I don't know how he did it before, call the office? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh he never falls ill? Wow, envious of those dudes I have to rest a week. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Anyways haha, we can clearly see the differences between Futaba and Takeda's rooms, uh, I mean, behaviours toward helping each other when they are down even physically, the gimmicks at work doesn't even mean anything anymore.

These girls not becoming idols anytime soon. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I've taken to assumption that these will be on streaming services already, huh. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/continew-world-disc1/1589754576?l=en" target=_blank>ORESAMA's new album</a></b> is my focus for the week I guess, and I feel that I have never been more lenient on their music style which is dance pop if you didn't notice, thanks to all the pop songs I've been listening for the year, but that doesn't mean I gave a lot of songs off the bat though. A couple might be at most what I can give these guys, and I'll listen to the cover album which is not part of this when I have the time. Those are also the ones you can hear on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwJpCPxmkVoTBqshUhF0ghg target=_blank>their YouTube channel</a>, if you have taken a look before, singing their own and sometimes other people's songs.<br><br> On news concerning music and it's on Twitter, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1453662836878544897?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari is still releasing more live videos</a></b> leading up to their upcoming live video release, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Yogees_band/status/1453511863057059842?s=20" target=_blank>Yogee New Waves' new music video</a></b> is the reason why I didn't give this song from their new album, I don't think <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1453920273363836929?s=20" target=_blank>SHE'S new music video</a></b> will change my mind of this song from their new album anytime soon, don't expect too much from <a href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1453333529274638346?s=20" target=_blank><b>GLIM SPANKY's recent collaboration with an indie singer</b></a> because I didn't haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1453316628662288391?s=20" target=_blank>cinema staff's new music video</a></b> might still be a mess by the time the album releases, and after listening to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1452892753772400640?s=20" target=_blank>Touyama Nao's new music video</a></b> (yes I listen to videos) I'm probably not listening to the single which releases next week. A lot of new music videos out there, so be sure to fascinate yourself in the world of Japanese music if you're not already. Uh, don't ask me why I'm not buying into music videos haha<br><br>So for next week, we have a couple of releases to set us off for November, so <b>yanaginagi's new single</b> which I didn't catch fancy of but Collection Artist so I'll give a listen, and also Collection Artist and a long time coming, <b>cinema staff's new album</b> which I thought will be a welcome release considering their previous is three years ago WTF, but also this is born out of this pandemic we're in so I'm not that hopeful. From the album trailer though, I hope for the best. When these guys are weird, they can be REAL weird, and I'm not that far now so...<br><br><br><br><br></div><div>Even until now, I hesitate to continue on Minase Inori's fanclub subscription which will expire today. It's a yearly payment so it's no different than me buying goods, it's also the best fanclub I've been in to be honest her exception 2nd fanclub event within the year is selling goods next week which I will have to miss <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, but I really want to explore further grounds with other people I have not tried on. From Touyama Nao's to Takahashi Rie's but this one apparently due to complications of the membership it expires end next March regardless of entry so not a good time to join now, there is so much out there of the married revived fanclubs (lol) and the new ones that surfaced within the past year, which I can simply try out just by signing up online. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Maybe I should stop Akarin's fanclub in favour of Inorin's. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Uh oh, I'm following the majority soon lol. Cya guys next time, and until then... I have a hard time waiting for Animal Crossing New Horizon's new and final major update to come out. It hurts. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I did stop playing for 7 months but this makes me want to play more... just not the Halloween event today haha Happy Halloween guys now go back to work <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Why not choose by which calendar for next year is out? I think I didn't mention this but it'll be Kotobuki Minako, and no membership required it's from her time in the UK, so this criterion will not work no more. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. And... the best "cosplay" (because they can cheat and use camera apps so I excluded half of them lol) for Halloween this year is... Nagae Rika!! I mean, <a href="https://twitter.com/rikachimalu/status/1454768829871972352?s=20" target=_blank>she dressed up as a girlfriend</a> what else do I want? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay <a href="https://twitter.com/ibuking_1114/status/1454725831452880902?s=20" target=_blank>Kido Ibuki</a> is a close second along with <a href="https://twitter.com/azumi_waki/status/1454680884502667277?s=20" target=_blank>Waki Azumi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1454754861958897668?s=20" target=_blank>Kitou Akari looks great with a hat</a> lmao</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
