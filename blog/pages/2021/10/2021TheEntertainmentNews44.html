Happy Halloween everybody I guess. The only kind of treat I'll get is not
getting bugged with work on a Sunday. Hope I haven't jinxed it by writing this
in the morning haha <span title="*silence*">😐</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Now that you figured out I write my intros prior to the rest of the post lol,
  in order to keep up with this weekly stuff and NOT be manipulated by the
  exclusivity in power of streaming services ie. Netflix haha, I'll watch Anime
  "Komi-san" - as much as I hate it - in Chinese, my native language. The last time I had to do this
  has almost a decade ago where in contrast, the lack of English subtitles made
  me follow Chinese fansubs. This is similar but where is the progress, people?
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Enough about politics and my package appearing next week because it's for the
  better for it is (technically) a 3-day work week for me HAHAHAHA yeah I totally planned this week by the way by staying at home whole week and... eating...
  medication lol the latter is not part of the plan haha let's Anime and
  music<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shintaisokutei" target="_blank">Health check-ups</a>? GOOD LUCK KOMI-SAN lol well I guess she can use her hands but really man...
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I should've not spoke in school to see if anyone will rage at me lmao
  well in this new episode (#KomiSan04) man is this episode is really dark with
  Yamai-san at the helm- Imagine if Komi-san could speak. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, I
  would've. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And as with past episodes, don't expect this to be a smooth
  ride because we may have made some exceptions which we will live to regret in
  the near future... especially dealing with a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yandere" target="_blank">yandere</a>. I must say though, this
  is a first in many things including understanding how this character type is
  handled in friendships instead of romance so let's talk about it at length.
  Before that though, we'll talk a little about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/makeru" target="_blank">Makeru</a>-chan.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> As her name implies, she has a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/makezugirai" target="_blank">sore loser</a>
  personality but considering she is already a sore loser the moment she was
  given her name lmao, and her comparing herself to bespoke goddess Komi-san
  (haha) (Yep see what I did there?) is just asking for a showdown we will never
  speak about again. Well, Makeru-chan here won't anyways she lost in weight and in
  torso height ie. she got shorter legs (are they daikon though, that's the
  question) (JOKES! lol) and Komi-san... let's just say she can still smoke the whole
  check-up session without opening her mouth. I mean, it isn't hard, but
  considering mannerism in Japan is also to speak up... well she is getting out
  of it easy though, good for her. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (FYI <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yada" target="_blank">Makeru's family name</a> is
  also a joke, because people say that when they lose lmao) And then, on to the
  topic at hand because if we delay any longer I'll get death stares lol. We
  should know of
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yamai" target="_blank">Yamai</a>-san, who
  threatened Tadano to never lay his hands on perfect goddess Komi-san lol
  whatever (Yamai-san please keep that chopstick away lol), who is nice and
  fashionable on the surface but reeks of the darkness no one would ever
  question about not even Najimi-san you should've looked at the expression on
  their face haha. Anyways, this girl wants to be friends with Komi-san I mean
  everyone does, but you know, she just chose to do it in her own way. Besides
  ridding of competition with just her very, very menacing attitude and I'm not
  talking about Komi-san's anxiety lol, she also will do literally ANYTHING, to
  force them off her target. In this case, the target is Komi-san of course. Unknowingly
  to her though, Yamai here has done some hideous things to Komi's recently made
  friends. Scaring Agari-chan away, threatening Najimi-san to get a chance to
  talk to her to even having lunch with her, to locking Tadano inside her bedroom...
  wait wait, what was that last bit? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yep, I don't know how Tadano
  can stay there for hours on end without alerting anyone else in the abode haha
  hard to say the parents may be working, but yeah, you kidnapped my very first friend in high school Ren-chan I think you need to be buried in the mountains. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Somehow
  Yamai just sticks to Komi-san especially assuming the Tadano seat just because
  lol, and Najimi suggested Komi-san going to her place to talk more if she wants.
  Yamai chose that over the hostage she locked up at her place, and I think you
  can guess the rest. I mean, dealing with this normally and seeing all this unravel
  as Komi-san even, but man is this kinda surreal. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, at least
  Komi-san did tell her off, and Yamai did apologize for what she has done
  (begrudgingly lol), but overall I must say this is quite an experience one
  wouldn't easily forget, let alone forgive. Lastly, I hate to say this because
  I have no friends lol, but friends are not meant to be protected. They are
  meant to be with you whenever you need them. That's it. Everything else
  doesn't matter. If they serve to protect you, or vice versa, that's on them.
  Think about it. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Okay maybe I'm telling my head off lol no one will
  save me when I'm kidnapped by Yamai-san in her room lmao actually that'll be
  great that might be my only chance in any girl's room BOOM GOT ME haha just...
  just be careful of that girl for the rest of you guys lmao cya guys again for more friends to
  befriend... with extreme personalities because don't forget this is a prestigious school
  we have all sorts of weird f**ks in here lol (mental hospitals be the same
  BOOM GOT THEM haha ok bye)
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Really, if your focus isn't Komi-san speaking A WHOLE SENTENCE in this
  episode, go back and watch that again, please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>]

      here? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  "Yuzu... take good care of her" Yeah okay like we can rely on you Tamahiko
  lol- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this at all, huh. Too real, man, too real.
  In this new episode where all you need is introduce new characters to
  piss me off lol (#TaishouOtome04), someone was down. Well if it's Tamahiko
  it's like every other day considering his pessimistic personality, but I'm
  talking about the waifu. You gotta wonder though, it's not about whether
  Yuzuki will be down, it's just when. She takes care of the house and its
  occupants which increased to 3 including herself with the sister's arrival, so
  it is not surprising if it's adding to the only worker for things around the
  abode. Still, Tamako has been a trouper by helping out so that's a plus, so
  it's no wonder that the sister took control once they found out about Yuzuki
  falling ill and not telling them. And this is where we actually see the
  problems that they will have to face being nobility especially losing an arm.
  It's no surprise no one knows what to do, so finding a doctor around the
  village will be first priority. Even Tamako knows her brother is not good with
  people especially losing the power from an arm, but she still took the
  initiative to actually find someone despite how society views of them which is
  basically paying money for things to happen, like any other nobility. But that
  doesn't mean they aren't humble, but we'll leave that part out for now because no matter how much they do, the dad will never change anyways. *BOOM* Still, Tamahiko realized how
  useless he was at this situation even being a male, can hardly ever carry
  Yuzuki with a fever to the nearest bed in the house. So yeah, time to be
  pessimist now, I guess. Yuzuki fortunately is okay within the day, and
  Tamahiko got sh*tted on by the doctor and his assistant who is FEMALE WHAT
  THE F**K WHY YOU HIRE LOWLY FEMALES- Okay joke's over. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways haha,
  you get the gist, it's 1920s Japan where people think they are talking down to
  others and no one has manners lol, but blah blah that's why this series is
  rather depressing considering they had to kinda talk about social hierarchy
  things here and there every time. Come on, the dude is just paying for your services. What is admirable though, is how much Tamako
  is holding on to her personality on the surface such that the doctor can know
  she is from the Shima family, yet be matured enough to know these lowlifes
  (lol) don't know about how much these guys have grown to be able to... well, how
  should I describe it? Hold on to their pride at the right time? Yeah, let's go
  with that. And that, I say Tamako be MVP because the brother is literally just
  Episode 1 again where he thinks he cannot support Yuzuki and let her overwork
  being under her care. Dude, emotional support be important too, yes? Also,
  trust. Ironically Yuzuki didn't trust the members of the household enough to
  say anything, huh. That's on you, girl. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, we learnt about
  Yuzuki's 2nd weakness lmao did I mention this is Anime and she is the perfect Anime waifu, Tamako decided to not
  extend her stay at this outpost to pursue a doctorate good luck lmao, and all
  is well. Tamahiko is still technically dead though, I don't know how the
  doctor knew one of his arms didn't work lol maybe he is only dead to the eyes of the
  brothers fiance families I suppose haha bye I need to read up on more vocabulary lol

  </blockquote>
  Wow that intro is real good animation, Futaba-chan shivering and stuff. The
  happiness thing is just icing on the cake. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, new episode
  (#SenpaiGaUzai04), Takeda only has a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/garake" target="_blank">not smartphone</a>&nbsp;haha great start, and Futaba-chan is down. I have a feeling there is a
  theme to this week's Anime episodes lmao why are you all mocking on my predicament
  earlier this week, but hey, not like this dude's gonna leave her alone and do
  nothing. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Ah hey, instead of thinking it the romance way, let's
  consider it in the too real way when you live alone and no one is there to
  take care of you. Specifically, family. Oh, and I'm assuming your family cared
  about you before you went to the city to work, fellas. Anyways, this is all on
  Futaba, and I just wonder how hard it is - hear me out - to reach out to
  others to curb that illness- Uh, I mean, loneliness. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> So, story. This
  episode is this week for me in a nutshell. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah, we done with the
  review? Thanks for reading haha okay serious talk now, because it's actually
  rather similar. First, we talk about the illness. Yeah, and honestly this is the only
  similar part haha because apart from just getting the cold which I often do if
  the seasons change fast and give me days of cold weather and/or I forgot to
  take some pills to get rid of preliminary symptoms, this is normally what
  happens when you fall ill, kids who are still not working, so pay attention.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, the Anime summarized it perfectly especially in a modern
  context, you don't really have to do anything but inform your colleagues inside normally you guys would have a group chat it's 2021 already we don't do calls
  lol Takeda please get a smartphone haha, and then see your local GP and/or rest. Well, depending on
  your job scope, you may be interrupted of your rest so I can't assure if you will recover in 2 days lol that's what happened to me earlier this week, but yeah, we don't call
  those doctor advices like "take ample rest" for no reason, let alone deal with
  it without them. But hey, in both cases, I guess, doctors aren't important I
  guess haha because when you have each other... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay we touching on
  this romance stuff again, huh. But yeah, Futaba-chan got it first, and Takeda
  only initially dropped by with groceries which I will also never do unless
  we're real close more than colleagues even *giggle* (nope, not happening), but yeah, she took it off
  on him (lol) because the first thing you would have realized is, dealing with
  recovery is a pain when you are living alone. You have to get stuff to eat with a body in fatigue even if you don't cook which means fresh, hot stuff is hardly gonna happen,
  you still gotta take some meds which again if you don't have enough you have
  to buy them... basically means dealing with it alone sucks. So yeah, can't
  wait to land on a job where this can happen to me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh yeah, I gotta
  move out first. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But that's essentially the episode though, with Takeda not having a smartphone so he didn't know Futaba took sick leave in the
  first place, now also has one so he doesn't have to... I don't know how he did
  it before, call the office? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh he never falls ill? Wow, envious of
  those dudes I have to rest a week. <span title="*sob*">😢</span> Anyways haha, we can clearly see
  the differences between Futaba and Takeda's rooms, uh, I mean, behaviours
  toward helping each other when they are down even physically, the gimmicks at
  work doesn't even mean anything anymore. Aw, too wholesome man, not real at
  all. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, loved the episode, can't wait for Sakurai to take
  sick leave lmao (what, you gotta wipe her body down) (haha best simulation
  video game ever 10/10 lol), Futaba-chan did karate chop her senpai lol, and I
  think Natsumi is so unimportant in this... Haha cya guys next week for more of
  this romance cringe I don't have haha ah

  I did spend a lot of time on bed this week so I'll focus on the stuff I intend
  to review from last week. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> And maybe give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/machinegun-single/1587638616?l=en" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new
  song</a></b> while I'm at it haha man it's not their best but I guess I'll give it.
  <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/annoying-sunsun-week-ep/1586756083?l=en" target="_blank">Anime "Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi" opening theme song single</a></b>
  isn't too bad, but since it's just some Anime release I just give the theme
  song and move on... yeah, really. These girls not becoming idols anytime soon.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I've taken to assumption that these will be on streaming services
  already, huh.&nbsp;<b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/continew-world-disc1/1589754576?l=en" target="_blank">ORESAMA's new album</a></b> is my focus for the week I
  guess, and I feel that I have never been more lenient on their music style
  which is dance pop if you didn't notice, thanks to all the pop songs I've been
  listening for the year, but that doesn't mean I gave a lot of songs off the
  bat though. A couple might be at most what I can give these guys, and I'll
  listen to the cover album which is not part of this when I have the time.
  Those are also the ones you can hear on
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwJpCPxmkVoTBqshUhF0ghg" target="_blank">their YouTube channel</a>, if you have taken a look before, singing their own and sometimes other
  people's songs.<br />
  <br />
  On news concerning music and it's on Twitter,
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1453662836878544897?s=20" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari is still releasing more live videos</a></b>
  leading up to their upcoming live video release,
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Yogees_band/status/1453511863057059842?s=20" target="_blank">Yogee New Waves' new music video</a></b>
  is the reason why I didn't give this song from their new album, I don't think
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1453920273363836929?s=20" target="_blank">SHE'S new music video</a></b>
  will change my mind of this song from their new album anytime soon, don't
  expect too much from
  <a href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1453333529274638346?s=20" target="_blank"><b>GLIM SPANKY's recent collaboration with an indie singer</b></a>&nbsp;because I didn't haha,
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1453316628662288391?s=20" target="_blank">cinema staff's new music video</a></b>
  might still be a mess by the time the album releases, and after listening to
  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1452892753772400640?s=20" target="_blank">Touyama Nao's new music video</a></b>
  (yes I listen to videos) I'm probably not listening to the single which
  releases next week. A lot of new music videos out there, so be sure to
  fascinate yourself in the world of Japanese music if you're not already. Uh,
  don't ask me why I'm not buying into music videos haha<br />
  <br />So for next week, we have a couple of releases to set us off for
  November, so <b>yanaginagi's new single</b> which I didn't catch fancy of but
  Collection Artist so I'll give a listen, and also Collection Artist and a long
  time coming, <b>cinema staff's new album</b> which I thought will be a welcome
  release considering their previous is three years ago WTF, but also this is
  born out of this pandemic we're in so I'm not that hopeful. From the album
  trailer though, I hope for the best. When these guys are weird, they can be
  REAL weird, and I'm not that far now so...<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</div>
<div>
  Even until now, I hesitate to continue on Minase Inori's fanclub subscription
  which will expire today. It's a yearly payment so it's no different than me
  buying goods, it's also the best fanclub I've been in to be honest her
  exception 2nd fanclub event within the year is selling goods next week which I
  will have to miss <span title="*sob*">😢</span>, but I really want to explore further grounds with
  other people I have not tried on. From Touyama Nao's to Takahashi Rie's but
  this one apparently due to complications of the membership it expires end next
  March regardless of entry so not a good time to join now, there is so much out
  there of the married revived fanclubs (lol) and the new ones that surfaced
  within the past year, which I can simply try out just by signing up online. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>
  Maybe I should stop Akarin's fanclub in favour of Inorin's. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Uh oh,
  I'm following the majority soon lol. Cya guys next time, and until then... I
  have a hard time waiting for Animal Crossing New Horizon's new and final major
  update to come out. It hurts. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I did stop playing for 7 months but
  this makes me want to play more... just not the Halloween event today haha
  Happy Halloween guys now go back to work <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Why not choose by which calendar for next year is out? I think I didn't
  mention this but it'll be Kotobuki Minako, and no membership required it's
  from her time in the UK, so this criterion will not work no more. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. And... the best "cosplay" (because they can cheat and use camera apps so I excluded half of them lol)
  for Halloween this year is... Nagae Rika!! I mean,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/rikachimalu/status/1454768829871972352?s=20" target="_blank">she dressed up as a girlfriend</a>
  what else do I want? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay
  <a href="https://twitter.com/ibuking_1114/status/1454725831452880902?s=20" target="_blank">Kido Ibuki</a>
  is a close second along with
  <a href="https://twitter.com/azumi_waki/status/1454680884502667277?s=20" target="_blank">Waki Azumi</a>
  and
