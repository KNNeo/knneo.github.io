From my Minase Inori fanclub's membership, to my very first Japanese mobile game, to how did this package even arrive and oh it's because I forgot to check when it's delivering lol, there is a lot to deal with next weekend once it's over. Sadly, I think I'm going to be down with some viral infection real soon so I better get this done and over with first before more bad things happen to me come tomorrow lol at this point I had to do support on weekends for some project and that is <em>not</em> very fun, trust me. Maybe that's got me this infection, the virus of "work" lmao</div><div><br></div><div>Well, with all the sadness in front of us, let us talk about Anime! Not getting any new songs though, I'm just literally on a nostalgia trip recently and it's getting boring haha maybe animation will make me happy<br><div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=MierukoChan03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Mieruko-chan</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"You can't have him!!" I mean, you can have him lol just <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>"The more (prayer beads) you got, the more powerful they are, right?" Ah, I won't say that is true but let's see how bad this goes lol talking about bad things in this new episode (#MierukoChan03) they still keep them comin', I tell ya. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes again, the pace of this series may be slow, because that's the point they want to buy you into the creepiness using animation from the start, and I hope you like it because I may not take this for another 9 weeks lol. Let's talk about story. It started with Miko-chan meeting Hana-chan at... some coffee shop lol I'm not going to explain the name haha, but yeah, she was on the bus but no one is talking. Yep, but she can hear sounds. I assume if you're that psychic you probably can, but with the whole bus in silence you gotta wonder. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, somehow she got to her stop, but didn't alight because the ghost alighted? Okay, that kinda works with her freaking luck, I would say. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And she just had to play the Hana dumb and miss a bus stop or two and it'll be fine lol the friend missed train stops. Then, it's her at the coffee shop with some dude across the room. I didn't expect to be talking about jealousy again, but yeah since Miko-chan can see it it's kind of a problem, especially with the guy who already has a girl (not the ghost lol) thinking that he can chat up a high school student yeah right how dare you, is also probably triggering the ghost into thinking the girlfriend is Miko-chan herself. She had to play it off by showing some muscle men in her phone so to make it think otherwise, but it worked, I guess. And she definitely ran away with Hana-chan as soon as she arrived and got a drink lol. Kinda relieved that I'm single because then I won't have ghosts haunting me thinking that I'm getting laid so long as I chat up a woman- Is that how this works? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en" target=_blank>J-J-J-Jealousy~</a> <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then, we talk about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/juzu target=_blank>prayer beads</a>. Miko-chan thought it'll be a good idea to get some of them - even though they are expensive for a high schooler - to deter against those things, but as we have learnt from after she walked down the streets with what, FOUR sets of beads, it got ruined in an instant walking down a dark alley which, surprise surprise, is full of ghosts. Hana-chan seems fine though, but as much as she is ambivalent of these paranormal beings, Miko-chan is trying so hard to defend her friend from any sort of contact with them, it seems. Well, she just went through one of the ghosts like, twice by the way so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><span> Last but not least, we talk about the Godmother. I thought this was part of the lore, it might be, but looks like she got relations with the kid we saw at school a couple of weeks ago Yuria, as we see her spying on the fortune teller probably scammer on the streets. Well scammer because that fat chick of a customer probably won't get laid even with the beads even with a ghost lol, we found out that she might be a real thing, like, she knows ghost presence too, but somehow not the same as Miko-chan. Why? Because from the small period of time where the Godmother introduces Miko prayer beads, even the best ones on the house... a Hana-chan probably has more aura than whatever this old lady had over decades haha ah hey none of those items survived but this chick did. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> </span>Eh, that'll be 3000yen please. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And yep, that's how the granny knows she's the real deal. Of curses, probably. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She is so woke of it though, she literally just retired and turned over a new leaf lol it's this powerful, my friends. All in all, I really enjoy pretty much every aspect of the series even the jokes, but the ghost presence thing which is, in essence, the whole point of this series, is really not getting me. You can say I have the same emotions as Miko-chan every week it's just freaking me out. So yeah, we shall see if I have the courage to pick this up again, but I highly doubt so, so this might just be it. And don't tell me some nerd ghost is looking at me type all this right now haha please don't</div><div>[TL:DR; Can I like, just give this Anime's opening theme song? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's just so cute]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpFHYTJAeqe6WxjOwUWSha2FXCLp-OYXNrbGE82w_XwKagBNjf83DXffULwUUY1MrpjWGL5HIMsedMTwdaHemKb6yn-QQdQ8uOhq-xDoGP9cfe44ixpevCwihiC9_c-cBCW1c9ruFPwdl3OGKTYsWjdNVOSoQ3aRw1OqRBRD2W5Too8A/s320/mieruko03_aura1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>See, all the aura comes from the chest haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjliBb9HTwDEDSNKL87HULsZzzgeqTEsFgvKacQCjEwvn9Oa0WPi0axOsVwsoWz2cON5RFPG2Qxm_4kBJ1aPBlHTa4lMvtkoK7xI4uy9xZQTb409fcsdbKkedcEU-cwBA4XmMcT19WEut6veUkb3jaAJU61jPtpr9q_FqzStPqsfGTR4w/s320/mieruko03_aura3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>All the aura comes from her desire to punch you lol<br>(<a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/169393/Miko_Yotsuya target=_blank>Ten-chan</a> please and thanks haha)</table></div></div>P.S.

They call you a p*ssy when you get anxiety as a male, trust me. In this new episode where Komi-san be stalking people now lol hey it's hard getting LINE contact before we can actually talk openly in her defence (#KomiSan03), yeah tell me which one is scarier Mieruko-chan or Agari here freaking out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, new character introduction, and as our social circle for Komi-san expands, we get to see how much screwed up this class actually is lmao oh well. So, about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/agarishou target=_blank>Agari</a>-san. As her name suggests as with everyone's name in class in case your Japanese isn't that good don't worry I got you covered, this girl is a nervous freak. Which is basically me in school as a girl but hey that doesn't exist so pretend that this is a thing in this Anime, yes? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She... has been stalked by Komi-san not because she is weird (she is weird enough already lmao), but mostly because of Najimi's plan of getting friends for Komi-san is way more effective than loser Tadano's haha, is starting from people who have similar traits to Komi-san herself. Well, sort of, but yeah if you pair someone who can't talk to another, you not gonna have new friends tbh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Agari ran away in embarrassment but so did Komi-san, so it somehow ended up being one stalking the other haha. And somehow, Agari got over her awkwardness and was able to transmit a message from the teacher to the class, as furiously as it might have sounded. But yeah, all's well ends well, I guess. Well, not that well, we somehow got a masochist role out of this lol what <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Najimi is right, Komi-san really needs some translation apart from the death stare haha they are just crying for help every time Komi-san makes a move lol. So there you go, that is now THREE friends in class so we are halfway to our goal lol, but next, we gotta keep them permanent. You know, the easiest way besides having a social media account because guess how someone forced me to sign up for Facebook 15 years ago lol, is to get their contact info. Oh that's assuming you bought one though? Even those <a href=https://jisho.org/search/garake target=_blank>not smartphone</a> ones? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And yes, if you didn't take a hint and I suppose Komi-san did along with Najimi, as Komi took some numbers down she also knows that Tadano is dumb enough to not give her his number... first... well Agari spoilt it so haha ah hey tell me there isn't a romance subplot somewhere in there. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But it is great, we gotta get back to this later because for now we have to decide on class committee positions! So yeah, that is Tadano for class lead lol, Najimi for vice class lead and Komi-san as goddess? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Great summary right there but yeah thanks to the defence of her friends she was able to come out tops. Well, as in class ranking way higher than anyone would've imagined and now class committee chairperson sounds like trash so they just let Tadano do it. Thanks, Najimi. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then, we have the best subplot so far, Komi-san calling to Tadano... accidentally haha because the joke here is, she can talk without looking at them. So yeah, not really a problem if you think about it now huh, she can nail some phone job interviews even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, Komi-san gets to play games with her classmates at breaks. Yeah, this sounds unbelievable even at Episode 3 but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, with the cast so far besides Agari who probably will never play this with them she will always try to lose anyways lol, Najimi pulled the two out to play along with them, hearing as Tadano thought of letting Komi-san play along with her current friends, Najimi just took a step forward to make her play along with more. I'm not going to talk about the rules with the two games if you played them before you'll know your local equivalent if any, but suffice it to say in the first game they were just pacifying Komi-san so she wins lol, but with a punishment at the second game they can't afford to lose but Tadano had to sacrifice himself to make sure we don't get to see Komi-san do the punishment. Welp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, lovely episode which reminds me of myself lol, I'm digging in on the subplot of romance somewhere in there, as deep as it is buried at right now. Hopefully it'll soon surface, so that we can actually see Tadano get beat up on the rooftops or something lmao I'll be watching this till the end I think Komi-san can do it haha <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ganbare target=_blank>ganbare</a>~</div><div>[TL:DR; "Her voice is so beautiful!!"

Wait, YOU'RE TWELVE?? lmao</div></blockquote>Well, Tamako, you brought it upon yourself so don't say your brother hates you. In this new episode where we're only on the tip of the iceberg that is family issues (#TaishouOtome03), how did this episode even make me tear up, I don't even why. Let's talk about why then. This episode we welcome, well, it was unexpected but Tamahiko's younger sister Tamako took a visit. Despite her refined and even matured appearance, she is younger than Yuzuki lol how, and you know, her poisonous mouth sure worked wonders on the couple, from mocking on the brother's supposed death to doing all the height insults which again I gotta do that later so I'll tone that down this week lol, is a total brat as we can see. She even is displeased with her choice of room from Yuzuki, and talked about many things one would've killed themselves with if it isn't from some posh lady of a rich family. Hey, context, remember? So yeah, turns out, Tamako here has some past without the mother that is again, thanks to the dad, resulted in lack of love from anyone from the family. And when she thought going to school will make her friends, jokes on you because Komi-san who can't even speak got friends and you're just a gossip target so BOOM <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Again, I can roast her for days even putting in the century ago context but I shall stop here. Thanks to the past two episodes and a harsh winter, Tamahiko soon recovered from his own depression even with the arrival of the sister, and a trip up the mountains where they live brought us some couple moments we wish we could lose an arm for haha okay me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like really, I consider this borderline pornography I swear Tamahiko be licking Yuzuki's hand like a dog. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Soon enough did we realize that Tamako might be in her own depression as well, because besides her strong appearance, she can hardly sleep at night thinking about how screwed up her dad was without the mother (Really, paying servants to entertain your kids? What's the difference between you and rich parents who push their iPads out today-), and I don't even need to mention about her brothers who were the ones preparing for marriage and it's not the one that's "dead" lol, for she screams at the so-called "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/shunrai target=_blank>spring thunder</a>" which probably is already taken as normal for Yuzuki. Well in Tamako's defence this house is a little big and empty and lack of consistent lighting so compared to her comfy and warm and congested mansion full of a**holes haha, this is a little bit daunting for someone who is 12. Haha yep, you forgot her age already, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'm not going to talk about how she wet herself in fear because can you even air this on national TV? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But we'll talk about how much Yuzuki will do for her to get her into the bath, rid her of all the p*ss (<span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ah-) and get her cleaned up again and ready for sleep, even under such harsh weather conditions. Goddamn, find someone else a heroine to praise Tamako, for calling her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/onee target=_blank>onee</a>-san won't even redeem on the stuff she did for you. Well, we are taking this with regards to societal status so please take that with a pinch of salt in your almond maracons. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So next episode and you bet I'm tearing up again, looks like our humble housekeep is down, and we shall see how the other two will learn from running the place by themselves. My guess, is it is going to be a flop. Haha cya guys next week I'm TOTALLY giving this by the way this might be best show this season even</div><div>[TL:DR; Sorry but does anyone in the audience have a p*ssing fetish with regards to like, <a href=https://jisho.org/search/AV target=_blank>AV</a>?

I'm going to turn into a saint by the end of the year. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I hear it's a Christmas special so here's my shtick here again Merry Christmas everybody haha (#SenpaiGaUzai03), I see the two are still going well, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You know who I'm referring to, I'm literally those guys who stand by and see Takeda and Futaba play around with each other... as colleagues, please. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Goddamn, let's talk about story, because wholesomeness is still an understatement for what we saw before the snow falls. Firstly, the company had to play Santa lottery. Well in short (sorry Futaba) (haha) it's just choosing people to play the Santa role to give out stuff to the staff, and sadly or fortunately, because the company likely expanded to include more people which means more gifts to give, there are two "winners" for this draw, so yeah surprise surprise, Sakurai and Futaba took the extra job for the day. Yeah, Futaba is just unlucky to do this two years in a row, but I don't have such a thing in my workplace so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, it's Christmas, we know Futaba's itching to give something to her senpai for all the help he's done you know it's a friendly gift I'll take that on the surface lol, and her friend Natsumi had to chip in to the conversation. So she ended up giving a necktie, but never had the chance to give it to him. I mean, with that extra bag carried around all day until she was able to give it to the certain someone? You gotta think. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Futaba did go through every single method she can think of giving a gift including my p*ssy way of placing it at your target's desk haha, but yeah, with all the work at the end of the year and stuff you gotta wonder if there will be ample opportunities ahead of her where she can do the deed. Kazama got teased real good by Sakurai who can't help but think of his feelings towards her (which, I'd like to believe, it's mutual) (Aww...), and they had some time to eat together. You see, when you can spare some time to not just play video games on Christmas... <span class=emoji title=😚>*chef's kiss*</span> Haha hey I'm just glad for them okay they are half the reason I'm watching this. Again, better than a gift because it won't be left out or even framed because a certain senpai will feel bad about tainting it... just wear it goddammit haha Futaba-chan wants to see how great it looks on you, bro. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I wrote this short of a write-up because I can never dictate how lovely every single scene in every episode in this series so far has been, and I can't praise it enough. From Futaba's sense of shame, to Takeda's matured image which sometimes can deviate for some reason, to Sakurai's expert teasing on guys who like her which is everyone and who she also likes which might only be one hehe, to Kazama teasing Futaba lol and Tsukishiro who can't take a hot drink haha, this is a diverse cast I know I will enjoy watching. Screw the <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/6956/Working target=_blank>WORKING!!</a> series man, this is the new WORKING!! I'll be into, so you're welcome, Anime. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[GIF FEVER!!!

Oh well, next time then and we'll see if I can give the former first.<br><br>On news concerning <strike>music</strike> Klassic Note and it's on Twitter, there's<b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1451566548028571649?s=20" target=_blank> an interview of THE ORAL CIGARETTES on their new song</a></b> I haven't read yet but you can check it out it's in English, <a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1451488506765774874?s=20" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new music video</a>(?) is literally her softest song yet I don't know I should even give it lol her new single is next week FYI, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kusoiinkai/status/1451141457369186304?s=20" target=_blank>Kuso Iinkai's new album is slated end December</a></b> because they hate me doing Klassic Note lol but also it's the same day where their very first album released 10 years ago so yay welcome back I'll review this next year haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1450788583736938501?s=20" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's new music video</a></b> from her recent mini-album is in spatial audio with lots of CG but I gotta say the close-ups are awesome hehe, I don't care about the two songs SPYAIR was on THE FIRST TAKE for, and last but not least Ikimonogakari's singer <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1450476927404240896?s=20" target=_blank>Yoshioka Kiyoe's very first solo song will be out end November</a></b>. Yes, her coming up with songs from last year was all cover songs, just so you wonder. Maybe I should listen to that when it comes out. I mean, how else can it be different besides music style? I hope so, Ikimono's style is kinda wearing off me tbh<br><br>Next week is coming soon, and to get ready I'm going to listen to a couple of song which will lead up to <b>ORESAMA's new album</b> which I think they became indie again though I must say their popularity is going up faster than ever, so that's good news. Let's see if I can give a couple of songs from that the topic song with the music video isn't the one I was eyeing for though from the previous digital single releases but we'll get there.<br><br><br><br><br>I'm seriously not feeling well now so kudos to me for being able to do all this up within today and not have to declare a delay in posting this (I hope) at any point. Please, I don't want to break any records I've had on this blog already haha. Cya guys next week, and remind me to do all the stuff I had to do to conclude October, yes? Haha bye</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I'll schedule this at 10pm unlike every time I'll check again on Twitter to fill in the news segment AFTER 10 but I don't feel too well so anything else I'll cover next week :)</div></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
