Man, there's so much to do this weekend I CANNOT EVEN STOP DUDE!! <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Give me
60 hours a day or something haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Doing what, you say? Well, other than scanning bromides I got recently if you
  noticed the recent posts isn't one for the past week lol, I'm planning for the
  web interface for Klassic Note and I think it'll be on soon in time next year
  for 15 years don't you think I'll forget that, and yeah, things have been
  going well. Probably better than work but who cares about those lol it's on my GitHub if you want a look</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  What you SHOULD care about are the new package review and Klassic Note Review
  I just did early this week, literally, just Monday and this dropped by, and it
  made my week. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, go see why Hondo Kaede's bromides aren't in
  it as I thought, so I guess next time it'll be at November or December maybe?
  Then whatever if the government wants to tax my packages from next year I'll
  just stop by then tbh haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So, Anime time! I may have to think of how to pad the music segment because I
  only listened to Yogee? Haha ah hey it's 2021 I don't go find songs, songs
  come to ME lmao we'll talk about that later but first!<br />

  Man, I really pity all these guys who voice these things, did they gather all
  the ones who did voiceovers for Anime that had ghosts? All of them gathered
  here? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#MierukoChan02) where we are still basking
  on the honeymoon period that Miko-chan is still scared of ghosts only she can
  see haha, I'm pretty sure we're going to see some <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ahegao" target="_blank">ahegao</a> from this girl real
  soon. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, we're going to see her flip her eyelids lmao. Or maybe I
  will too, who knows? It's okay; I'm not watching this at night. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So,
  story. firstly, and once again, they are really emphasizing on this real good,
  the girls are in the changing room. For what, you say? Definitely not ghost
  hunting, but we are close. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Besides offering nothing but fanservice
  fans will enjoy (please don't include me on this I'm over it already lol?),
  they had to just slot in some reality into Miko-chan's life with the ghosts,
  and it's still freaking her out to be honest. Besides this though, we have
  been given plenty of lore as to the ghosts' interactions with the real world.
  For starters, they can touch inanimate objects. Yep, from the textbook
  Hana-chan is holding, to shaking the table, to then fondling her chest lmao
  yep that's inanimate, it looks like there are no bounds to what the ghosts can
  physically touch, so that is already a freakout even in my opinion haha.
  What's worse, Hana-chan thought her friend is not feeling well so they head to
  the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hokenshitsu" target="_blank">infirmary</a>,
  and that ghost is still clinging onto her. Turns out, that one ghost likes
  some rack lol okay it's all messed up now, and thanks to the sensei who walked in who has an even bigger rack lmao, that one ghost got off Hana-chan.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't know if I should be happy about this or not. Because to be
  frank, there seems to not have any gravitational effect (not talking about
  boobs but) (haha) on any object(s) the ghosts are physically possessing on,
  for better or for worse, I guess. Like, it doesn't make them feel something of weight is on them. Maybe that's good? But yeah, the focus here
  is definitely on the viewing process: They are making sure you get scared
  LOOKING at what you saw, which, I would assume the rest of the senses are just not going to work in terms of remedies seeing how Miko-chan tried alcohol on the ghost (not talking about
  Hana lmao) and it didn't have any effect on it. And don't ask me how there's
  that last part about a wild cat, because apart from seeing a ghost in the box
  with the cat haha hey
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/neko" target="_blank">neko</a>-chan are you
  okay? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We also know that the tone of spiritual activity can determine
  one's character, seeing how Miko-chan knows giving it to that young dude will
  not be better than that one gangster face who, turns out, had a life with a
  wife who passed away and who also liked cats, just like how he's enjoying
  their company now. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> No really, THIS is the only wholesome part, right at
  the end of the episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I think I'm not happy with
  this series mainly because I don't like the slower pace of the series so far,
  mostly because they had to justify the ghosts and their presence every time.
  It just feels off pace with shows running a lot faster than this normally?
  It's just not right. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, we'll see how far this lore can take us,
  and by then we will decide. This series is placing A LOT at stake just so they
  can make elaborate disgusting ghost scenes as if I've never seen them before.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> For this, I better be fingers crossed, it looks like it might get
  worse haha WHERE IS HANAKO-KUN DUDE WE NEED TO CONTROL THIS lol bye

  Man, I really don't like those series who just literally narrate on this talk.
  You think we can't get the subtle reference, or this is some PR for some
  government organization or awareness campaign? <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> Haha anyways in this
  social anxiety Anime lol (#KomiSan02) we finally got Komi-san another friend
  besides whoever that dude is from last week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What? *whispered to*
  Yeah, just one more friend. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, I know the pace isn't good
  enough if she needs to get 100 within three years of high school, but we're
  getting there exponentially, you know? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, story. Tadano (Hitohito sounds retarded when you have to type it twice too so) tried
  to ask for people to be friends with Komi-san, but didn't actually realize how
  much people don't like him which will also explain why he has no friends too
  but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, that's already going to be rough considering this is an
  elite school where if you don't make friends within 2 minutes good chances
  you're alone the whole journey. Introducing... well I guess you should know
  him/her too you guys met before some time in your life lmao, it's Osana Najimi
  (I'll leave the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/osananajimi" target="_blank">childhood friend</a>
  name reference here) and just like his- their name lol I'll go with this
  pronoun, they have a lot of friends. So many, everyone's their friend. Just...
  not Komi-san for some reason. And as we have heard from themselves, it seems
  that even the most sociable of people cannot interact with people who just
  won't speak and give death stares. This is not even close to those series that start with a main guy who says he looks fierce. So yeah, Komi-san, in case you need
  feedback on why you don't have friends, you're welcome. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> But
  under Tadano's influence if he has any, Najimi here tries to give Komi-san
  again a chance, a new chance since when they met in elementary school wow. In
  just a short walk home from school, within just minutes Komi-san can barely
  carry herself a conversation which is kind of obvious because as I said last
  week next time start with LINE lmao hey even Tadano has Najimi's number why
  not hers? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, Komi-san technically saved Najimi from some other
  childhood friend (lol) who wants to confess to him... her? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah,
  you get the idea. Good chances it's a he though, so don't think too much lol.
  So yeah, that'll be something to remember. Under Najimi's training though,
  this might be rough, for even if they want to have lunch together Komi-san can
  freak out because of course they aren't going to sit together to eat since
  they have other lunch meetings to go lmao, but also, Najimi gave Komi-san an
  assignment to order something from a coffee shop.
  That... well dear Coffee Master, if I would have your resignation letter by
  next Monday because you screwed up an order from someone who can barely
  speak... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I had all the laughs, and I'm still laughing at
  my pathetic life, so yeah, Komi-san you win. You got TWO friends now which is
  more than what I have had in my life EVER- Just joking what are friends
  amirite? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, it's funny, I'll probably stay in for the jokes, I
  doubt the lore will happen this soon even next week, but yeah, Komi-san could
  speak more. Or you know, a change of body language would help, as much as I'm
  the worst person to ask for advice on haha get out

  In this new segment which I just made up (lol), I'll compare MY level of
  social awkwardness (yes I still have it at 28) to whatever Komi-san attempted
  within each episode, and suggest what she might have been able to do to be
  better! (*Latter is not guaranteed to work, subject to level of communication

<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      Instead of "let's be friends", maybe bowing down would be a good start for
      Tadano to say the rest. Even with assistance, you shouldn't ruin the
      impression with robot reflexes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instead of not talking or stuck in words, a simple nod or shake of head
      will make a difference. For example, nodding when people say they met you
      before, and shaking when denying that you are popular.
    </li>
    <li>
      If speaking full sentences aren't your thing, a hand gesture when handing
      an item over will signal appreciation of say, a dropped item which belongs
      to that person. Well, provided your target doesn't think otherwise lol</li>

        The best kinds of practice dealing with longer orders with heavy customization
        at an eating place is as of now, using delivery services. Unfortunately
        it will not work for Komi-san's case so I'll leave it at that lol (I've
        only done it a handful of times at location too, so I feel you)
      </li>
      <li>
        Research on the menu on the way there, find out how it works and
        rehearse. We know Najimi is being a d**k here but even so, analysis for
        eventualities would better prepare you for the actual deal. The last
        time I had surprises on my usual order is when they said they don't have
        non fat milk and asked if skim milk is okay. Boy that freaked me out lol
      </li>
      <li>
        Gestures won't work on a restaurant if it's not on the menu, girl.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You normally start with an enquiry if it's on the menu. Which
        is why secret menus exist, unspoken rules not written on the board. Then
        again one normally starts with what's on the menu so this is on Najimi
        tbh
      </li>
      <li>
        I wonder how hard reiterating someone else's order can be IF you can
        remember it, to be honest. I may be socially awkward but I forget stuff
        so I just don't order for others. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, your first complete words to learn to say especially in Japan,
        should be "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sumimasen" target="_blank">sumimasen</a>" or "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/gomennasai" target="_blank">gomennasai</a>", so start with that first for anything, Komi-san. Not going to
        mention how bad even just being able to say those only will be though,
        we'll do this one step at a time</li></ul></ul>

  Is this intro a joke? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Probably not, and since it's pureness all over,
  we might be in for a good time. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, I'm just guessing at this
  point, don't quote me on this. In this new episode though (#TaishouOtome02) we
  got more couple things we can talk about! Well, it's not wholesome enough
  without the balance, so let's start with the sad stuff. <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> So, story. Story
  goes that Tamahiko got a letter from the dad and if you need context, this is huge news but on a totally official manner because not that the dad
  wants to see your face but hey same here *BOOM* (Haha),
  the dad decided to pronounce him dead in view of family reputation to marry
  off (lol) the siblings in the house (yes including the brothers, if like, the
  partner is some rich girl or something) so to like, "clean up" the family
  image. Yeah, we have been there lol, I probably don't feel so but my bro with
  4 other siblings might, but hey, you have given him quite a bride already, and
  Tamahiko will hardly ever leave the house, so yeah, pronounce him dead, man,
  he's LITERALLY in Heaven haha I know right. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, Tamahiko here had to go through
  the depression stage lol remember when he said he was the pessimist? Still
  holds true right now until we get Yuzuki to change his perspective. Meanwhile,
  cry all you like, don't coop up in the room, and please do something to her
  kimono which you have ruined. By crying on it, by the way. He didn't do
  anything white or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, which will explain the miracle
  that is happening right now, Tamahiko suggested going to town with Yuzuki.
  Yep, it's a date. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay more than that, I thought we're here for
  like, divorce papers considering I'm a pessimist in thinking that a pessimist
  can only be there to do sad or bad things lmao, we're in Tokyo Central to buy
  new clothing. For Yuzuki, of course. That surely puts a smile in her face, for
  literally whatever Tamahiko has right now is everything but status, he already
  felt bad ruining the very first outerwear Yuzuki made for herself. But you
  know, if there's one thing money can buy... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Haha ah hey, I'm
  not rich I'm just making rich guy jokes because I can. And don't tell me to put this in
  context when he says 10 yen is affordable in 1920s Japan when their currency
  is devalued and then tied to USD until the 60s. (For context, I only found Wikipedia being
  the most reliable, so that is 1 yen to 50 cents USD which is ~76USD for that
  kimono cloth today so that is the price of a suit from where I live now) (And
  he bought two, yeah) Anyways, it was a great trip downtown it was an
  eye-opener even for me the animation for that is amazing my reactions are
  literally Yuzuki's lmao, and we had to end the episode with a guest. Yep,
  remember when he was pronounced dead? So this family villa which was a temp
  location for him is <em>TECHNICALLY</em> empty now? If you would respect the dead I suggest they leave soon but yeah, things are only going to get ugly
  real soon. All in all... as mentioned last week on the first episode, I'm only
  worried about the family lore. With the last part, my worry is comparable to
  Tamahiko's reaction to the letter from the dad, and I don't think all of this
  ahead can be resolved with Yuzuki's positive attitude. For this, I really am
  worried this series will make me change my mind. For now though? I think we
  are good. I can imagine the reason behind the sister's arrival at the house
  because I don't think her marriage proceedings went well <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, and um...
  let's see how much the family drama can take us. Man, I wished this Anime was
  just about the two of them, really. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, I think I can make an
  informed decision by next week, so we shall see until then.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; If you found out that Yuzuki after getting the kimono downtown was
  humming the song with the exact soundtrack playing at the back, you have truly
  enjoyed this Anime hehe]

  </blockquote>
  Ah, in this Anime where you can say WHATEVER you want when drunk lol it doesn't matter anyways, this new episode where Futaba's boss can read the atmosphere
  better than I can haha (#SenpaiGaUzai02), someone's worried about something.
  You see, that's the gender difference right there, as much as I would hate to
  say it, but you know, stereotypes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Story I guess, before we talk
  about every single thing this series has done to hurt women all over the world
  even. Story goes that, Futaba is still messed up over the dinner the day
  before, since she did literally drunk talk her
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> about her
  chances of being a wife, to him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But honestly saying, Takeda wouldn't
  mind either way anyways lol I meant the other way where he takes it as drunk
  talk, but you know, Futaba is concerned. And even after telling this to Takeda
  and clearing the cloud after being laughed at, and she still thinks
  otherwise...? Man, when Futaba goes this level of
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/otome" target="_blank">otome</a>... can we
  bring that other Anime I just watched into this? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> THIS is purity right
  here haha okay we should stop talking down to her, let's talk down to her on
  other things. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Didn't know I had to go through another season
  of making kid jokes again, but here we are. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From Kazama's gang
  talking about beautiful women on the streets while eating lunch, to other
  colleagues' image of seeing the main two as father and daughter lmao, this
  series sure is trying to insult as many people as possible through animation.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But you know, it's great whenever we have to talk about boobs, so
  let's do it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Futaba is still thinking about chest at work, so she
  asks Sakurai - arguably the best out of the girls in the company and not just
  in rack - for advice, but she just told her to suck it up. Or well, the author
  did. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What she did say was right though, for Takeda did not see Futaba
  in that way of appeal anyways, and is also more actively shown when... when...
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah her conversation with her grandfather is basically the summary
  and I feel bad for her already so... let's leave for later. She did have a
  great time hanging out with her friend Natsumi though, who is badass by
  kicking all those who approach her chest lol why is Futaba surrounded by them,
  who is a total gamer just because and why don't you hang out with Kazama haha,
  and Futaba shouldn't have taken those cute bear buns just because they are
  cute. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Why you WOULD take those though, is because it'll look great
  stuffed on your- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Honestly saying? This
  is the kind of stuff I'll do on April Fool's Day as a woman. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Wearing
  those to work though? Probably not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically, she went home in this
  manner, and coincidentally meeting Kazama and Takeda on the train home, and I
  think we have a good idea on the differences between one who noticed something
  was off to someone who I would like to deduce that he might not be into women.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We witnessed an ultimate colleague betrayal with Kazama saving
  Sakurai from that dude who keeps asking her out for dinner lol DUDE WHY (Audience: This is Kazama or the other dude) (Yes haha), and Takeda might not have noticed the paddings but he did notice
  someone taking upskirt shots of Futaba on the train- I think Takeda is into legs. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Okay me, we can stop here haha. All in all, I enjoyed this way too much than I
  should have, sorry again to Futaba for everything really, and I can't wait for
  Kazama to get his face beat in once his gang found out he was going out with
  Sakurai HAHA F**K YOU BROS I'M TAKING HER FOR MYSELF lol cya guys next week
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "There's nothing going on with Takeda-senpai and me besides being
  senpai and
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kouhai" target="_blank">kouhai</a>!" Well
  Futaba that will make of a boring series so do something about that, yes?

  </blockquote>And it's another week, another set of new releases, huh. Well, we only have one so might as well talk about it at length. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/windorgan/1587653367?l=en" target="_blank">Yogee New Waves' new album</a></b> is a long awaited one, maybe too long awaited I forgot their style but thanks to never young beach which sounds like them from the same music label don't ask me how they earn money lol, I get to hear more songs I'll like. I gave the topic song already, so the other was just to make me happy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The older songs released as digital singles didn't get me though, and I won't comment any further, to be honest. Yogee is kinda hit or miss in this aspect, but I give songs as I like, and when I do, I like them a lot. So yeah, next time, guys. I also chanced upon another gem from YouTube just because I can't stop the clickbait lol (or that I will never reveal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN-H-RRizYo" target="_blank">where I heard it from</a>), I'll probably be giving <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/time-traveling/1567215457?i=1567215461&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Anthony Lazaro's song from last year</a></b> in collaboration with Sarah King which is obviously the female voice you hear, but yeah, if you need some lo-fi feels I've got you covered haha. The lyrics are also cool for if you have a partner living far away from you. I have one too, just that we have never met before. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span><br />
  <br />On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and why have I not came up with new sub-segment names for these three paragraphs already, this one is hot off the press from the end of Inorin's live tour, but <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1449710802764636166?s=20" target="_blank">Minase Inori's 4th album is coming soon</a></b> probably next year which will be her new album in nearly two years since I gave that miracle of a composition from her first place in Klassic Note, <a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1448268944062644228?s=20" target="_blank"><b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new music video</b></a> is super cool and it's already better than their previous song so I might just give the new digital single, it's kinda cringe where <b><a href="https://twitter.com/anisonha/status/1447162644708818948?s=20" target="_blank">UNISON's bassist and composer is recommending Asakura Momo's new song</a></b> lol industry joke only I will get, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1447170056375394304?s=20" target="_blank">SHE'S new song is for a movie</a></b> which is not in their new album FYI, <a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi_info/status/1449390173419188224?s=20" target="_blank"><b>yanaginagi's new song preview</b></a> for the Anime it's credited in isn't exactly awesome I guess we'll listen again next month when the single releases, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1449209476410601490?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Hanazawa Kana is featured in MUSIC FAIR</b></a> which is a national TV programme so yay for her getting national recognition after this long because normally you won't see them going mainstream but here we are.&nbsp;<br />
  <br /><b>
  So next week looks like I'm empty again</b> they have one of those weeks every month in Klassic Note lol, I may watch back some of the lives I have in my archives and maybe give some artists I don't know. I have plenty of songs to consider for this year already I just accidentally gave one because of YouTube, so yeah, I may just take another break, I guess. And I probably won't have to worry about Song of the day mainly because I'll be working on the web interface and be hearing with all the songs in my library. I built in a "randomize" feature to make sure I can do that lmao<br />

  In more interesting news involving video games instead of anything from the
  above, I coincidentally dropped by into the <b>Animal Crossing Nintendo livestream</b>
  yesterday and heard of the awesome news which - if you have no idea and had
  that game when the world was in quarantine and this was all you had - they
  announced a new update with characters and features to match previous games in
  the franchise nearly A YEAR AND A HALF and seven months after I stopped
  playing the game for almost a year, and a paid DLC which basically remade
  another Animal Crossing selling for half the price of this game. Yep, that'll
  get fans hyped. As a non-fan though? I'm officially ditching The Sims for this
  game lol let's see how long I can play this though. Good news is though? I
  applied work leave on the day AFTER a public holiday which is also THE DAY THE
  UPDATE IS ROLLED OUT!!! No joke, DID NOT plan for this AT ALL. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Now
  you know why I'm looking forward to next month haha ah hey. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys
  next week then, and until then... well this update's already making this month a whole lot shorter so I can't wait to play it hehe I did visit my island earlier today and... it is indeed boring after half an hour without the new update lol I'm not a fan after all haha bye</div>
