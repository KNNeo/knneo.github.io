Probably also because passive work ripples just surface after Friday is over? Ugh, maybe it's time haha<div><br></div><div>I said to do this separately on another day probably yesterday, but looks like we're going for the binge and watching all the shows today, so yay there goes my Sunday afternoon lol. Then again, I spent a lot of money yesterday thanks to mom wanting a new laptop so this is a good way to forget about the big hole on my digital wallet lol</div><div><br></div><div>Life update over, let's talk about animation and music instead! New season, new line-up of shows, problem is I CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE ALL FIVE!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Uh... we shall see about that haha if you need an initial prediction I might only be giving 3 of the ones I'll be testing out this week. Let's see if that is true.</div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=MierukoChan01><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/mieru target=_blank>Mieru</a>ko-chan</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style=text-align:left>"How did you know it was me (Hana)?" It's... pretty... distinctive haha I like how Miko-chan here says "bounciness" lol not wrong it's a one-of-a-kind experience</span></div></blockquote>Man, what is with the intro anyways. They just spook you with a spook story which is likely just a circuit breaker fallout? And then the door opens- HAHA HOW DID I PREDICT THAT lol. Anyways, in this series where if you got spooked you need to stop right now haha (#MierukoChan01), it isn't as bad as I thought. In the preview a couple of weeks ago I talked about how this series will deter me if it's scary or boring, and surprisingly it's neither of them. Well, there is still some element of both though, I'm thinking on how to proceed ahead, so let me talk it out. For starters, it's not scary. It's maybe spooky like how you just hear people talk about a shitty horror story in that Halloween stayover, but otherwise due to the fact that the ghosts appear rather subtle and not like giving you jump scares that will probably freak the girls in the series more than us so, I'm glad it's not that extent. Still, they are leaving that element of suspense in though, so don't expect real-life explanations of such paranormal stuff compared to our world right here. What I'm more concerned for now, is the story. I thought we'll jump right in with how <a href=https://jisho.org/search/miko target=_blank>Miko</a>-chan our dear main girl here will not be scared of ghosts right from the bat (her name is literally the bane of existence for ghosts dude), so then it'll just be a slice-of-life, but yeah that doesn't sound great without much context on how it started, so here's Mieruko-chan the origin story I guess. We explore her discovery of ghosts probably due to interactions of ghosts or attempts of them, on unknowing people. People like the one in the intro will be most of their reactions, but for Miko-chan here... she chooses to ignore them. Still freaked out though to the extent of quivering <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but yeah, that'll probably get more of the bros around her so bad choice, girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What this series will compensate for the obscure genres here though, is fanservice. The episode itself is just littered with reminders that Miko-chan has a friend with a huge rack and a big appetite so think of the ghost that appeared out of the fridge in the intro lmao, and someone else who they bumped into which will no doubt be another of those people who can see ghosts, but we'll leave that for the lore in the future should we get into this. But yeah, from Miko-chan lifting up(?) and squeezing rainwater off her skirt, to obvious panty lines when she bends over, to her friend's squishy boobs... that's every other <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> reference they can put into a high school setting right and locked. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Which... hmm I don't know if that'll do this series any good, but I must say though, if I'm that depraved (and I am though? so) (haha ah-) I can watch this and then get spooked every week lmao. All in all, I must say this series piques me. And I must say that would be enough for me to watch this every week. I fear not for the ghosts though, but more for the lore behind, as I didn't know much when I saw the preview, and I still don't know anything even till now. "Hanako-kun" had a pretty bad run talking about whatever alternate world bullsh*t, and I don't think this will reach that level anytime soon, but I don't want it to be when I realized it's too late. So I'll think on it. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Three episode rule again. And if I can still give straight out Miko-chan freaking out over a rather stale storytelling... and you see the thing is she'll get used to it, so that will only get more boring over time. Which is why I say haha so yeah we shall see how this goes</div><div>[TL:DR; I'll quote this from the next episode preview: "Even if you're thinking 'I do not want to watch this' I hope you will watch next episode" Haha NO <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhIUUF-ymSvdkDAhM1PxlJrwMZbRRMWyTeZW8Pr_gx5DPfLSWr47LnDPXbMBMRJP-uDhi4EM_aPV-HMmtL3Von1IbCpW7EwcJs62cIan3srrwWGYes_8RwXteI5uI2Hs33zt4s66vMrOLoGOufwUIUDekRqJ-KpJaL38vpC9CHr_Y33Pw/s320/mierukochan01_ghost1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I like how this is how girls react when we meet for the first time haha<br>(No, really)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjN-GnJGSCUXZ185uh5FZYo_UyiZIZLwWkNCL2A88d_1DJ7ZcXWO5s9tUt7AjzqFsUWevNamNSJw770oG0QyshvFM0Z5AoojsVHeCqB4MBhwwrOgQXshG-tGS6N7BszxERtdln8vfdn-z0FgAVh_OB5Y9FPE_1LxwT8tPh1Bm871q8liw/s320/mierukochan01_ghost2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I like how this is how girls react when I'm just clouding over them lol<br>(Did you even see her quiver?

I'm sweating out of my crotch man lmao</div></blockquote>Haha okay Botan-chan you don't have to tell us that you have no friends, we know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this action series where we literally just talk about portals in case you don't know what those were (#TeslaNote01), I'm glad I didn't get a Science degree to like this lore because everything else BESIDES the lore is disappointing me so far. For context, that is because I knew of the main girl's voice behind ie. <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/43279/Konomi_Kohara target=_blank>Kohara Konomi</a> tweeting about this series and me having read a chapter of the manga which is basically this episode alone, and even not thinking about what lies ahead, I'm already not feeling it. Let's talk about what is good about it though. Firstly, character development. With the main guy having to doubt and quibble over the newbie girl who has trained all her life so far to be a ninja, the two have to work as secret agents under a private organization to do the Tesla thing which I will not bore you about, but suffice it to say this kind of throwing of insults is a good combination for any action series, and you cannot ask for more, see every other action series haha. Add in a humble boss and a nerd hacker at the back, and you can see how much this team will take off in various situations. Then, the soundtrack. With Lantis on the helm for theme songs I'm hardly ever worried about the songs, but you know, pretty much what I will be b*tching about next is that the genres don't stick with me, and I think the opening song is something I might actually check out in my own free time haha. Pace of storytelling and cliff hangers are alright I can't really talk about much since it really depends on adaptation, but as stated at the front there's just one thing that'll bug me throughout if I ever pick this up: the animation. To keep things simple, I've seen RWBY which is purely made from like, Adobe animation software and it's not known to be awesome in early seasons but this is literally that. So, as you may have not known, 3DCG is known to lack in emotive expression with the compensation of fluidity in animation and supposedly, reduced development of animated drawings. That, is a problem in itself. What really makes this bad though, is it being an action series which I mentioned when I talked about "Shinigami Bocchan" last season, but also, the mix of this with actual animated drawings. This is where the deal breaker is. I can forgive fluidity in animation but you cannot give me this blend. This is not coffee and milk you can't just do this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I think I've made my point, I worry about my sanity if I have to keep up with this animation for my eyes for three months, so like how a portal is suddenly appearing in front of me, I'm bailing out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, recovering crystal fragments isn't exactly fun when <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/46471/Tantei_wa_Mou_Shindeiru target=_blank>taking down an android organization</a> had a better plot which I also hesitated to give last season so... Thanks Botan-chan, I'll miss you being cute, your smile and you being wet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEqWBXkYM12hDTlW9yg36MY0AIGbC3lQnVsIdDnfRCwgzss3yWLC4LfEx9ipm1MGjXpvJT7D0oBbWwxCrhL_UJeDxUQW9_iDiHZUoaqk3xvUwrlYTLXXt28qPp8XkN-bbdCGy-r0N7XZFXKzx6ok6eeUJXN1YSz1SgTOjUZoXuyXleHQ/s320/teslanote01_mad.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I think this is a good sample size to show how bad the animation blend is<br>(The frame rates on the left and right are slightly different and it irks me)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhb2ApE2R9ImZl_j662FtRcj4vAjDqHcEReL3Mkb-oH-xBWQJ-PQb5nq4lbjLZWTMEegnncoJWDNSrscCoivJ_ateUICLjNi42ZTewo1l1r1w_qlEq1pGyuz84O8E3HAlCA4jd0bv9b60B1nhD7fvv1WosnMesbhVPcOO42Rssyw2mTg/s320/teslanote01_thanks.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I think this is a good sample size to show how bad the animation blend is<br>(They rendered the minor character in 2D <span class=emoji title=🤮>*pukes*</span>)</table></div></div>P.S.

Yes? Good. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new series which I hope will be the best around here this season even without dialogue (#KomiSan01) just... just use a messaging app like LINE already, Jesus. Stop writing already we are at least two decades into the 21st century <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, about this series. Honestly speaking? It's all I've wanted in what my impression was about this series. Hey, "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen target=_blank>Kaguya-sama</a>", didn't know you had a spiritual successor already, and you're not even done animating yet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What is that special about this series that will get me and even you though? Let's talk about it. Well, maybe not in speech because literally, quite literally, main girl Komi-san can't talk. Well she can, she will have a beautiful voice just like the appearance she has, just that, she can't communicate for sh*t. To put this into perspective, Komi-san being able to speak a proper sentence even if it's "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/hai target=_blank>yes</a>" is still lesser than how far I can pull down my foreskin- Okay bad analogy. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See, this is what is with main guy Hitohito (lol the name) who just screws up his words in life without getting friends let alone getting laid which is pretty much my life just that I'm not as bad as him tbh so who is going to save me now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, Hitohito here goes along his life smoothly, or as smoothly as it gets, until he realized just how lucky and/or inferior is his life compared to Komi-san, which besides stating that this is a prestigious school and this dude got in with my level of luck which is the only thing I have now haha, is probably a zircon compared to this shining gem in class. Everyone is mesmerized by the girl, and the extent of admiration from the class even including the teachers is very borderline illegal lol what is with the camera view. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But somehow, somehow, everything also works well for Komi-san. Because if she was in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/31646/3-gatsu_no_Lion target=_blank>another Anime world</a> she would've been sh*t on by a lot of b*tch classmates or schoolmates for being high ego and stuff, so she should consider herself real lucky. However, this is where the combination is formed. Hitohito is also the only guy in the room who noticed that Komi-san has that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/komyusho target=_blank>communication bug</a> going on for her. It's so bad we have to watch a blackboard of text (yep, Japan still uses that) of them conversing instead of just opening your goddamn mouths- Just exchange LINE numbers already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know this can lead to misunderstanding and possibly get Hitohito into trouble with the local gangsters lmao, but at least you don't have to use half the box of chalks to explain your backstory lol. The production did nail it with heart warming music which I didn't expect I'll need but yeah, they did everything right in this series. The author literally just had to shut the girl's mouth up. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Okay misogynist me when will you leave) All in all, this series will be as sad as it's going to be awesome because man if this was real life someone is already going to see a psychiatrist and none of this would've happened. So yep, be glad this is Anime. Also, it's adapted in drama already and it's airing earlier than this, so you can see how this is taking off already, the adaptations for this. (It's not any better, the silence goes on longer in drama lol why) We are, however, given more into the story to make sure this goal of Komi-san's won't be done in like, next episode because remember what I mentioned about a prestigious school? Yeah, they take character in school VERY SERIOUSLY. Hitohito wouldn't mind since it's a joke to him and it's likely he'll just get shit on throughout his high school life. Komi-san though... with her main goal in mind... this is going to be rough. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And that's enough for me to like this series already. Adding on titular comedic timing moments (eg.

And we know especially in the Anime world, that you DO NOT say no to opportunities like this haha let's talk about why. Firstly, about the dude. Since we're unlikely to refer to that family of jerks lol, Tamahiko here is technically an abandoned rich kid in the Taishou Era, a time where royalty and societal hierarchy are still a thing, and we can still sell your daughter as a bride to the rich guy because you landed in debt. That, be glad Tamahiko is here to be the receiver of this, because despite all the stuff that he experienced in an accident losing his mother and his right arm's use (it's still there but disabled) and being utterly discriminated by the whole family lol even the servants spit on him I bet, he is REAL lucky to have, in front of his eyes, a bride of the best kind given to him. Yes, and I meant in the Anime context no one wants a cute wife in real life. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Of course, initially it's awkward because apart from the production having to explain how much of a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/peshimisuto target=_blank>pessimist</a> this dude is here (lol English is a thing in the 1920s?) (well they had school so I suppose so) (God my Japan history knowledge is pathetic haha), they also refrained from talking about bride-to-be Yuzuki's side of the story. Because if you thought Tamahiko is the guy to pity here, Yuzuki had to leave her house probably due to useless parents who either can't make a living enough to support themselves OR likely gambling problems leaving the daughter with no choice but to be used as trade. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Anyways, Tamahiko is right, why send such a perfect wife to him who is waiting to die by the day- Happy New Year anyways looking forward to a great 1922 lol (really reminds you about life a century later, huh) (welp) (haha), but as time passes, we learnt a lot about how Yuzuki feels about having to deal with a dude for the rest of her life considering she never gets control over her life in the first place. And yeah, instead of being a pessimist, she chose to be optimistic. Doing her best is her specialty, and she's just happy that she didn't end up with for example, a rapist or someone who will torture her to no end, and that he's actually a nice guy. Well, in formalities is more than enough though, I have that too lol. But still, that is actually good enough reason to be together. This sounds like a lot of deja vu because yes, it's once again two people in unforeseen circumstances coming together and helping out each other in life. As I said, basically that Anime I watched last season haha. All in all... I wonder if this series will touch on more lore than I think, because if it does and it's real dark it'll only make this series real bad in my opinion, especially if things aren't going as rosy as what we have seen this episode which I must say, is already real nice considering the dad's a literal jerk haha. I really can't imagine what will be ahead of us, for if it's not great and they talk about their pasts especially on Tamahiko's side things might get real sad, and I don't want that. "Shinigami Bocchan" didn't do that much so it's fine but I don't want this to be worse. For now, I'll definitely give this a thumbs up, congrats GARNiDELiA for joining Klassic Note sorry for rejecting your song for TrySail lmao they are in charge of the opening song, and I wonder what Yuzuki's 2nd worry is. I guess we'll stay around to find out. There's nowhere else to go already there's only two of us in the mountains tbh MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA haha okay cya guys next week</div><div>[TL:DR; I like how this series is as simple as "Shinigami Bocchan", for Tamahiko is the same: All he needs is love.

Yep shoutout to all dudes out there, this is one thing you'll learn to do when you have a girlfriend haha in this new series about work but we know that's not the focus <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (#SenpaiGaUzai01) we shall learn what it means to be childish as an adult. Or what society thinks of you as a grown-up who still likes stuff kids want, like VTubers. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, as you may have seen, this series is basically a work life slice-of-life romance maybe comedy series surrounding salesperson Futaba who, despite having some work experience in the company where she works, is still being treated as a kid by her senior Takeda. That is not wrong though, as we can see from Futaba's room, to her taste in toys lol and pretending to like coffee... Well, it also fits Futaba to a tee too so yeah Takeda wins every time by the way just so you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And it's probably also this that Takeda treats her this way, as like his kid or something and not like he's married I don't think, but it makes you wonder. Haha moving on, and that's where it really starts. We are given an everyday scenario of their work life, doing presentations haha cringe (if you win this contract Futaba you'll get all the head pettings that you want- Ah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>), screwing stuff up due to a rushed schedule which is just typical in any work life to be honest, and then making things up at the end. Of course, with Takeda's experience and help even if it means grinding work overnight but hey, as my current boss also said during any crisis: There is no point in dwelling on mistakes; They have to be fixed anyways. So yeah, if you worked enough like me you'll understand this, and let this be a good reminder to all the newbies out there, just in case. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And that might just be it all around for the first episode. We know of Sakurai who maybe likes Kazama who likes to prank the heck out of Futaba lol, and Tsukishiro who drinks alcohol in the morning. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We should expect more characters incoming, but as we can see, slice-of-life Anime typically require a cast of characters each with their own unique traits *looks at Komi-san* so that we can have some spicy drama going on between them, and I'll look forward to that. We are also hinted a bit of romance from Futaba I guess, so... sorry I'm not a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/lolicon target=_blank>lolicon</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... honestly speaking, I don't know what MORE to expect of this series. They got everything right already, from story to production behind... they did it better than how Futaba did in her presentation. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But this is also the most worrying part if I were to give this series, because apart from being too real it makes me cry lol, this potentially has a lot more lore similar to say, the "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/6956/Working target=_blank>WORKING!!</a>" series in terms of relationships and slice-of-life stuff that is to look forward to, but somehow, I don't think that's enough. Maybe it's my lack of enthusiasm for the main couple, but I don't know. I guess I'll watch a couple of episodes after all, to see what else is in store besides Sakurai and Kazama. Then maybe, maybe then, I'll sign the contract.

Yeah, I'm totally into their styles now and might as well because they also got their place in <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/shes-applemusicjp/pl.u-GgA52mmsxkNM50J?l=en" target=_blank>Klassic Note Collections</a> so congrats too I don't know if there is any significance for you guys but it will for me. <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span></div><br>On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and if you want to know everything you can check out <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/likes target=_blank>my liked Tweets</a>, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1445403884902658053?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL's new music video</a></b> is still not my thing even if I listened to it again, we finally have confirmation of <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lantis_staff/status/1445720492279689221?s=20" target=_blank>ChouCho's best album</a></b> which will include new songs so I'll listen to them when it's out in December, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1446083027373682693?s=20" target=_blank>SPYAIR was on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> now but not featuring a song I like so we know there will be a second time so I'll wait for that, we know <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kusoiinkai/status/1446357044362027012?s=20" target=_blank>Kuso Iinkai's new album recording</a></b> is going well so here's hoping it's actually good, this is the best news yet because <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1446445323350462466?s=20" target=_blank>cinema staff's new album will be out in November</a></b> which is soon and I can't wait to listen to it considering <a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1446450559733538816?s=20" target=_blank>the album trailer</a> is DOPE, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1446445772002586626?s=20" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES will premiere their new music video</a></b> next week so stay tuned I guess, I totally missed <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1446716228874096643?s=20" target=_blank>SHE'S livestream yesterday on YouTube</a></b> even though they have given us a head start by revealing music video and documentaries to remind us that there's an <a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1446819470559756300?s=20" target=_blank>acoustic live</a> to wrap the evening but I guess I rather watch something else lol, and last but not least since I am likely giving Anime "Komi-san" its opening theme credit <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cidergirl_info/status/1443863556240273412?s=20" target=_blank>Cider Girl's new album will be out in December</a></b> and since I only missed their 2nd album and this is their 4th... why not. Why not, right? I'll be able to give something good in it I literally got jebaited into it because of Anime anyways so <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yoroshikuonegaishimasu target=_blank>pleased to meet your acquaintance</a> again guys haha</div><div><br>So next week, besides confirming the songs from that "Alternative Girls" memorial... album haha, I'll also be reviewing and man did I screw up that delay weeks ago, <b>Yogee New Waves' new album</b> in a while but at the least I'm not expecting what they came up with for the previous album so let's see if this will get me to give more songs.<br><br><br><br><br></div><div>On the bright side this week haha everything above does not come close to this, the upcoming package that I've talking about for weeks is finally on its way!! When will it come I'm not sure but it's definitely some time next week where I'm just tired of work, so tired I may not have any energy left to do a long post because we do have a lot of stuff to cover, so if that's so the new Klassic Note Review will be done on another date just because. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week then, and until next time... ask me again if I rather watch new Anime or open packages because something tells me paying for stuff especially for them to ship over is waaaaay more gratifying haha bye</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Is it just me or is <a href="https://twitter.com/wedding_ainaka/status/1446717562537103360?s=20" target=_blank>Kido Ibuki in a wedding dress</a> so beautiful and perfect I already want to marry her? She's 23 btw but I think I can be with her for the rest of my life haha okay me</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. And it seems like my dear <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> (I mean Ibuki-chan also counts but) <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1447154945288019970?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's YouTube channel turned music channel is coming back</a> with a regular Monday schedule of clips so... 2nd album preparation maybe?
