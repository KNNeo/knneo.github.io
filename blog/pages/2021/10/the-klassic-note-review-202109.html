<div>
  Yeah, this review is also backdated just because haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well, I wish we were talking about new releases even singles, but nowadays
  it's just digital singles doing all the work and they don't even bother to
  release CDs anymore and instead come up with other types of media like vinyl
  and cassette(?) so yeah, I just went back to give a single from 8 years ago
  lol. But hey, at least I'm still giving something.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  This time around though, I am NOT giving another SCANDAL single since I didn't like the song haha, I'm continuing the journey of Taketatsu Ayana's solo
  music career... 8 years after since she started around 9 years ago, so yeah, I
  missed out A LOT. Well, I didn't miss out on everything, I just didn't give
  this one song so this release can sit on my shelf. But now that it has...
  let's talk about it!</div>

  (Do you even, have any idea, how adorable Ayachi looks, when she was
  younger?)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: Hmm where shall I start.... Introducing Taketatsu Ayana, this is her
  4th single from December 2013, which also means I should also mention it is close
  to her 10th year singing songs as a solo artist, and so far, it has been
  great. With her releasing a concept best album featuring songs titled after
  food, giving one of her older songs brought me back to this single which it
  was part of. In a nutshell, this single is like many of her releases, bringing
  much happiness and emotion all coupled with her adorable singing voice, and
  now I ponder how long I've taken to get back to this and experience all of
  what she had to offer.
</div>

<div>
  (1) Shuumatsu Cinderella [Weekend Cinderella]
</div>
<div>From first verse:</div>
<div>
  <div></div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      Didn't have time to (party) in the weekend
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      (Even) on rest days there isn't time to sleep
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">Really, just today is fine, right?</div>
  </blockquote>
  <div></div>
</div>
<div>
  This is a happy song. This is likely a party song, going from the lyrics, but
  if you have never heard of a genre called ska, all the years listening to ska
  music from Japan probably prepared me for this masterpiece even back in 2013. Because with the
  quirks in her singing and an adorably lovable voice, this is only a song to
  love.
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8irU8quSMM" target="_blank">The music video</a>
  only made a better impression out of this song, putting her in the fitting
  role of a princess after a day's work? It feels like a reality check even
  within the lyrics, taking time off a hectic lifestyle to party, play along,
  and have a great night. This song is all about having a good time, if you're
  in for her cuteness. The overall package of this song definitely did capture that
  mood, and I'm glad to have heard of it.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Lovingly Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Marshmallow</div>
<div>From last chorus:</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <div></div>
    <blockquote>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        Someday (I) want to talk to you, about my feelings
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        If it delivers, (I) want to know more about you
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        Wait a little while more, but slowly
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        It's very like me, (to) softly, softly fall in love (with you)
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  And yes, with any release, the B-side is always the deal breaker, especially
  if it took me this long to even give it. At this point, I wonder why I've
  hesitated giving this song anyways, and I have concluded that it is likely due
  to me missing her singing, just in general. The lyrics made little sense
  talking about downloading apps with only a slight mention of mom-made
  marshmallows, so it really makes you wonder how much this would have been in
  the hearts of people who understood or even listened to it, even if it made
  sense it was about the dessert. For me though, I guess I really miss falling
  in love with her voice, and this song had a lot of that, so it definitely satisfied
  something in me that made me sit down to give this song because it isn't even
  bad. I would like to blame it on her subpar singing but since we have come this
  far... You're welcome, Ayachi.
</div>
<div>Rating: 4 stars (Simply Average)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: It's hard to even find a single release as nice as this in recent
  years, and I think this nostalgia trip back did teach me a thing or two. Even
  back then, songs are uniquely different and fresh, representing different moods
  and emotions, and that overall packaging and a solid melody is something many artists even lack
  of today. If you have been a fan of Anime songs, her solo music career will
  not disappoint, and her first three and now fourth release(s) are an easy
  recommendation to get into her as I have back then. Feel for this journey, and
  the rest will make you like what is Taketatsu Ayana for the past decade.

  Now that the hype is over haha, so is the hype (literally) for this particular
  package because it's just the CD now without any special gifts which I would
  have had if I've given this single AND followed the then trend of buying CDs
  off online stores directly after I cornered the market for releases for the
  first five years of Klassic Note haha yeah those were the times

  What we did get though, is a good price on this CD. Really, no joke, this was
  from Amazon Japan, and <i>any</i> of the bromides I bought from the Suruga-ya run
  probably cost more than this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But thanks to "bookkaitori.com" haha thanks guys, I
  was able to get a brand new physical version of this instead of resorting to
  getting used copies which will actually suck, at a <i>really</i> low price. (2
  digits in yen low FYI I paid more for the shipping lmao) I thought it was a
  joke but upon close inspection it's definitely unopened, so it is a new copy
  of the single. So yeah, it fits in well with the recent package around the
  time I was waiting for the others to drop in too, so this just joined the
  queue.

  But seriously though? If I had bought it back then (image credit to Suruga-ya,
  you're the best) the same place as before ie. Neowing ie. <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhzy822NBqOgUUsBl6H5lcWCfALsqXaWLNAGTsWBZu6zZA6J8PgaB8hc1GLVy7EjQPBf54ipNdxG7S8XW-_6FKBh9LKh1Ip4mJtm_iBC-9U-LeuXVsHUFQ6yNLd7ESyaulG0BgE2K-w1v0LrMple4t5tqwVsDj2uDPRQtGWISfR2CZZjHpqZoLMw8gt=s320" target="_blank">CDJapan</a> I would've
  gotten something else which you all should know comes in the form of a bromide
  and even better it seems if it were from <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhftQPGgiM0S3dPjrvCNiZ2Ouau53qa-p_6AyqXw3UCDt7H1E9-WXRmgBNyoRpXhIEkhh30GQRzQxA7icIttRvaIC01RSANGBTGQtlqIyhAYD6iSuBn3HsGtwLUzPwCAxRIDfBSQeeFwEdM5EmSzsPS2AJc0UdCaAEgyMDeM7POLhWi_iWJmAQ77eHq=s320" target="_blank">Animate Online</a> where I first
  bought Mina-chan's and Yocchan's single back then. Ah, I can only do nostalgia
  now it's so cringe lol. Then again, I would have stopped at her 5th single
  which I rejected as a whole even if I gave this, so oh well. It's worth trying
  for this much 8 years later lol</div>
<br />
<br />
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And I guess this is it for the week! I'll be spending the rest of the
  weeknights scanning bromides and staring at posters so if you don't mind I'll
  be excusing myself right about now haha. Cya guys next time though, and
  hopefully then, I might be able to review another single because I don't think
  albums can be a thing since I missed Aki-chan's earlier this year and... maybe
  digital singles can become actual physical releases? I mean, King Gnu did it,
  someone else can try, right? Haha we shall see then bye
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Haha I read the booklet and found out the recording of the B-side
  percussions (apart from drums) is all done by yours truly, so she was doing the
  tambourines? Nice I would love to see that tbh hehe
