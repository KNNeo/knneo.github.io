I thought we- Oh. OH!!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In this final episode of if you can figure this series out you can study for PhD lol (#SonnyBoy12), this series makes you think. How far should we do so though I'll touch on that later as I summarize this series, but let's talk about the story. Last week, Nagara and Mizuho attempted the impossible by leaving Hateno Island and that weird world they were adrift in, and I'll not drop you the details, but apparently they managed to do it, with the help of the compass. They were slightly stopped by Asakaze though, who also provided more context on what happened within the worlds in this universe. Everyone else chose to not leave for they accepted the fate of them and their copies, if you would recall, and within these parallels to not ruin what is of the present and future, so to say. However, Mizuho and specifically Nagara believed in Nozomi's wish in leaving this universe using her powers, and I would say they were just here to fulfil it, as much as it is also another one of those chances in a gamble they have been taking to leave this place since Episode 1. But they did it though. Don't let the cutscenes think that Mizuho and Nagara returned to their respective real life worlds; The story was laid out not in chronological order. Nagara and Mizuho got updated on their lives as of graduation day it seems: Nagara was living alone working on part-time jobs to go by, and Mizuho... let's just say the grandmother passed away along with the cats. So yeah, real life did progress without them. Too real, even. Nagara and/or Mizuho thought when they met each other at the school gate, that they probably are not in the same world, but thanks to a code they shared with each other before they returned here, they know they have done it. No really, Mizuho thought she was alone after she left that world. SheÂ looked through everything in school. The curtains which were supposed foldovers, the toilet which can bring them through worlds... she checked everything. And yet, it seems that nothing called out to her. This is as sad as you can think of, especially when looking at Nagara, Nozomi barely even knew him and only as schoolmates in middle school, and, which is worse in my opinion, she is hanging out with Asakaze who also do not know of him. Yep. You feeling sad now? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (People and animals dying? Me not hanging out with anyone after school? My girl hanging out with another dude? Bruh, too real) (Haha) It's as if nothing happened, and it was as if the two went through like, a joyride of sorts sitting down in a lab chair controlled by the principal or whoever is the cause of this or maybe they had too much weed or something. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So, sorry to be abrupt like what this might actually be about, let's talk about what this whole series is instead. As I mentioned a couple of times throughout the series, I think this series really is about growing up, as Nagara said, letting you think about changing the world. Of course it's not as easy as it seems since we don't have superpowers here to duplicate anything using cats or travel to Japan to meet some AV idols so I can f**k them in this universe... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> But yeah, you get the idea. It just makes you think. Think about what you would have done in a different situation where you can be in control. Mizuho and Nagara both have walked out of their comfort zones because they knew of their powers and think they can change the world. It obviously seems more bleak with societal rules and a limited lifespan lol, but suffice it to say <b>this series is meant to make you think</b>. And I'll not take that freedom away from me. Ever. And I think that is good enough for this series in which producer and director Natsume Shingo is trying to convey. He is going to have an event soon which will explain the overall lore of this series, but I think I don't have to know about that. Being a surreal series in itself, some things are better understood if you think about it yourself, and that's where it matters. I would say it's not for the average joe because someone would've banged their head against the wall to check if they are adrift lol, but yeah, this series is hard to digest, and in a very specific way. Whether I would think this will win all the other shows I watch at the end of this season? I doubt so. What it will do though, is make you think. And for that, I'm glad I took on this wild journey of overestimated production budget and total lack of common sense in storytelling.</div><div>[TL:DR; To quote from Mizuho which will still make you think: "As long as you have some memories of that world, you will be fine."]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM3fsgCTgopeVYmZrd5hZIeLHpQkC4iOx2h4UoaucL2HJ_vswqUU7z8y4Iw5NmeMk_glyL1b2s0Hc_MQTpiR4Dtm2zjQzLZKauK8_e0G139Aoa9xR5-a0F_ccgWy0j3kcwrRHbscqJrmg/s0/sonnyboy12_love.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Moments that made me think<br>(OOF this is just sad to watch it's literally me as Nagara)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKh7IredeSNaElDArsjPwcExWR_SHyrDQ1DDXd-uvdy9Gh4uGp857b-oVG-G6cmVLNPO27i45yu3sj_z-Uvs4m7gHCF6kn-xP1rVEI4UQjGEtNBssbKb0xoTQyZg4UMHXQWFg96ppCD00/s320/sonnyboy12_couple1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Moments that made me think<br>(Hey, glad to see Yamabiko and Kodama were friends irl)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5zGN-6oGFlSrUjnYfaUwFnCKdU7g2jj3K3fhVRzSG5pWxxrCmHgUa2FYbcDG_bleg6DubkAu8KvfpTWMU0zdU0yEuvamOf2bxLt2oN5ETDsP4e0R08vxffrr1rhYSjEQaqmqrpao6UWw/s320/sonnyboy12_voice2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Moments that made me think<br>(Is this a euphemism for parents unable to convince kids to not do otherwise?)</table></div></div>P.S.

You know they put such a strong backing on this just because they want you to THINK (get it?) how you imagine this series as... right? *taps brain meme* Mine is that one where <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/let-there-be-light-again/1582740135?i=1582740142&amp;l=en" target=_blank>they travelled worlds using Nagara</a> after I heard how bad the one where <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/summer-storm/1582740135?i=1582740139&amp;l=en" target=_blank>they released the curtains</a> was]</div><div><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week we have some releases to talk about because my hands got itchy and went to find new songs so <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, let's start with actual stuff released this week. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/moonlight-magic-ep/1583734597?l=en" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new single</a></b> since her marriage and her moving music labels isn't exactly impressive, with technically two songs because the other two were Chinese versions (yep) so I will never consider them in Klassic Note anyways, did not do very well either just because the songs aren't that great either. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/still-still-stellar/1585332601?l=en" target=_blank>Hoshimachi Suisei's 1st album</a></b> definitely did better though, as I continue to give her songs despite the very style which will deter me if you ask me five years ago, and I'm just giving them here and there. Definitely trying to avoid the overly pop styles though, really trying there. Because of my itchy hand hitting on YouTube videos because I kinda want more and avoiding those I have heard of them, I ended up giving <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/boring-thing-ep/1445989932?l=en" target=_blank><b>No Buses' 1st EP</b></a> from 2018 a chance with their two songs with music videos in my list now because I can't stop dancing to poorly sung English songs lol. Thanks to Gotch recommending stuff on Twitter again, I took in some hardcore Rock music with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/capy-love-massacre-single/1570587180?l=en" target=_blank>Sister In The Velvet's single from July</a></b> which really isn't that bad, and made me remember how much I rather give this than Kana-chan and Sui-chan. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Problem is I did give the whole single, but there's only a vinyl release apart from digital. So... yeah. No CD? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> Thanks to one Kohara Konomi's suggestion for songs through her Instagram stories, I gave <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/jukebox-driver/1583690240?i=1583690241&amp;l=en" target=_blank>Penthouse's new song</a></b> a chance (and I'll link to their Twitter because they are hard to search online because of their name) which is like R&amp;B and very like Awesome City Club so chances of me giving anything else other than this is very slim. Great recommendation though, Koko-chan, considering these guys are rather new to the industry.</div><div><br>On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and soon I may not have to translate the posts since they just keep doing it themselves, <a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi_info/status/1443863259774439435?s=20" target=_blank><b>yanaginagi is asking for your favourite song</b></a> for her 10th anniversary of solo music career and yes <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1443892062420537346?s=20" target=_blank>I did Tweet about it</a> even though I know that'll never hit the polls that'll be made in the near future, there's <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1443531075561697287?s=20" target=_blank><b>Natsukawa Shiina's live video</b></a> on YouTube of her recent live, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1443395655280443399?s=20" target=_blank><b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song</b></a> is for a car commercial, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1443201607143878662?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari sang their new song in THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> and yes it is a new song since their buddy left the two to take on music alone, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/nanoripe_info/status/1442084663124639744?s=20" target=_blank>nano.RIPE is releasing a digital single in November</a></b> following the announcement of their 11th anniversary in their special acoustic live on YouTube which I did miss but I did listen I only know of one song anyways, and last but not least because this is 2021 and I'm not joking anymore, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1443912188654096387?s=20" target=_blank>TrySail's members have their solo music Twitter accounts now</a></b> with the vague promise of their Tweets once in a while so we shall see. So that is <a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1443880668849573888?s=20" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's Twitter account</a> which got transformed from that account which started last year if you can remember, <a href="https://twitter.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1443878364725628940?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's Twitter</a> account along with <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1443878606112018473?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's Twitter account</a> which are both newly added. Instagram when, MusicRay'n? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> I followed all of them btw just so you know.<br><br>So for next week, and really finally I must say I've been waiting for these for a while, <b>SHE'S new album</b> is going to be a treat out of all these really, really boring pop styles haha, and let's see if I can give anything from <b>Game "Alternative Girls" Memorial Collection</b> Album- Am I really saying all this? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span> Oh well, might as well enjoy this and the game until it stops end of the month.<br><br><br><br><br> You have no idea how much I want that package right now. I have waited too long for it, I'm so burnt out from work, I spent so much money just earlier this week on especially Ookubo Rumi bromides which goddamn you only see those once in a decade so I'm glad I got it hehe, but yes, even the ones mentioned weeks ago have yet to leave Japan. Yeah, so that's a problem. Let's hope I can send it out within next week or I may have to pay more shipping to ship them separately haha. Cya guys next time then, and until then... man, I need to take work leave at some point. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Work sucks. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Haha I better start applying lest it be rejected due to "obligations" lol bye<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S.
