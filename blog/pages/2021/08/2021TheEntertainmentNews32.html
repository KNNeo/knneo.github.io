  Man, my mind is still stuck with the Anime "Shinigami Bocchan" opening haha ah
  hey now in music subscription services too but you may have a hard time
  finding them considering localization isn't there so... *umph I love my Apple Music*
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp; <br />So yeah, watching these on a Saturday in view of a public holiday
  on Monday which I will, once again, do an Anime Extra once again, so we need
  some buffer on doing this, meaning a break tomorrow. Meanwhile, let's get through this, in
  between my still disabled left ear and half energized body... let's talk about
  Anime and music haha<br />

  Hey, obligatory beach episode, amirite?? And thank goodness we have some
  Siesta appearance I thought we're just done with her after that one-hour
  Episode 1 special. In this new episode though (#TanMoshi05) we are doing a
  flashback arc which will likely last a while, but hopefully not the rest of
  this series just because. So, story. Flashback goes back to... 2 years after
  they met so technically this is the Episode 2 lol, but yeah, they were
  enjoying themselves in the beach- that's how they make sure the quota is
  met haha it's probably like Chapter 300 in the original work. They were
  talking about a heist which they can undertake and probably not retire but get
  themselves more rep I don't know lol where got time to open a detective agency when you're rich anyways. Sadly, this is no "GREAT PRETENDER"
  where every heist is a success *PSYCHE* haha so yeah, something happened, and
  we don't know. Well, we will soon, I guess. But not just that, they also were
  out to scout a seemingly Jack The Ripper type serial killer (Don't know who
  that is? Go watch "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji" target="_blank">Kuroshitsuji</a>" lol), where the guy rips peoples' hearts out. I
  don't think it's just any human because we will see that in a bit, but yeah
  innocent people are dying out in the open so the police had to investigate...
  in not Japan because Fuubi is going back to Japan? Yeah, so let's say this is
  some other country we can afford to send out a biological weapon on haha *looks at England* The
  killer is named Cerberus, and after letting out the bait that is Kimizuka by
  just leaving him alone without Siesta and totally susceptible to assault, the dude
  strikes in the dead of night... but turns out it's Charlotte, that girl we saw
  at the end of last episode so you wouldn't mistake her as the killer... or was
  she? Well, you get the idea haha it's obvious those boobs are fake!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Okay I didn't notice that lol boobs are boobs man even if they are padded-) Anyways,
  looks like this android is also a shapeshifter and likely werewolf, so his
  powers were easily amplified to transform into a woman which I must say is
  highest on the difficulty scale for transformations lol, transformed back to a wolf to
  slice Kimizuka in half. The assistant did buy some time though, with Siesta coming in to
  save him because (1) she knew that the lighter is still with him given by
  Fuubi-san, and (2) hotel rooms have sprinklers to activate in the case of fire
  because (3) this is how we can stop the killer from running away every time
  his wolf nose smells Siesta's presence. Yeah, deep lore here so I wouldn't
  even bother thinking unlike shows like "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/39017/Kyokou_Suiri" target="_blank">Kyokou Suiri</a>" to be honest. Anyways,
  one shot to the body will make Siesta invulnerable to the killer, but instead
  he got killed as he was under instruction to get another
  heart... which you know, his would do, says the SPES leader Hel right here.
  Woman? Okay, girl, whatever. She looks OP. She looks like a problem when
  threatened to be shot with a gun so who knows what powers she has up her
  sleeve. And we were then action-series transferred to an underground facility
  with Kimizuka locked onto a chair which if he can yoga he probably won't have
  to unlock the handcuffs himself wasting precious time lol, enough for the Hel
  girl to talk about a couple of things we will discuss in a moment but most
  importantly, if Kimizuka doesn't join her side, she will just unleash this
  biological beast behind her and send it out upon the world above them and
  it'll probably be slightly better if we suffer from nuclear power plant
  radiation instead haha ah hey. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Siesta comes into save his butt, and
  next episode is likely a fighting scene which will firstly open up a hole from
  underneath whatever Parliament they are under lol. All in all, I think we need
  to be more concerned about the contents of The Sacred What... The Bible, haha,
  to be honest. If let's say we're in this sci-fi world where myths can exist or
  SPES is super OP compared to Siesta who is likely to sacrifice herself at some
  point, then the book might have a lot more truth to it, it seems. What it is
  though, we don't know. Can it predict disasters and disturbances just like how
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/68537/Yhwach" target="_blank">that Quincy God in "BLEACH"</a>
  can? We have no idea. Guess we gotta watch it all to find out. Problem is, I
  really will start to worry this might be the rest of the series, considering
  production may choose to put this flashback in emphasis to tell like, a more
  complete story about the legend herself, instead of talking about the one who
  inherited her heart... right? Oh well Ayachi haha cya guys next week.

  Is it a problem when I get high hearing Viola-chan's voice? Haha yes,
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/172654/Viola" target="_blank">Minase Inori</a> is cute, whatever. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
  (#ShinigamiBocchan05) where
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>-ness is
  my meth lol, Viola-chan drops by again! Probably for Rob because who gives a
  shit about the brother haha, but yeah, this week looks so wholesome I can't
  help but believe this is all we need to watch this series, to be honest. So,
  more Winter stories, I guess. First up, pep talk to Viola versus learning the
  Viola Method? Haha hey which one do you think doesn't involve the sister?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Viola understands that the brother likes this maid, but you
  know, the appeal isn't going back but mainly not because she isn't attractive
  enough as evidenced by later when another dude finds her appeal, Viola thought it'll be great to, you know, teach her some lady charm while we're at it. I
  mean, her charm is just that rack, girl, you don't need anything else.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh okay also, societal status. That one you need to take care of, if we talking
  about early 20th century. *OOF* But yeah, I guess now Alice has more on
  Bocchan to make him succumb to her charms or whatever, as if it's already not enough
  lol. Talking about charm, we haven't talked about how charming is Rob the
  butler even with that white hair, short-sightedness and broken back. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Okay so next up, it's Viola-chan's turn. On her next of many visits to the
  mansion lol I really hope the mother doesn't find out, the guys were cooking,
  so great <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onii" target="_blank">onii</a>-chan
  right here suggested Viola play around dough with Rob... though I would
  think the cat-like dough probably isn't as cute as Viola-chan herself when she
  gets embarrassed and stuff, but you get the point. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Eh, drop the sugar
  on the seasoning, please, I'm already satisfied. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then, which is likely
  the only part with plot progression just because we have to lol (it's like
  kids having to do homework after playing all afternoon), the appearance of
  Cuff's only partner Zain, whose transformation takes shape of a white crow. He
  and Bocchan happen to be together watching Alice skate while swinging her rack around and above the icy lake lol, but man, is this Zain thing literally my buddy who
  can't stop talking about boobs haha shoutout to ma bro here, but besides that,
  Zain is also attracted to Alice likely because of the stark contrast she has
  to whatever boring, uninterested in men partner Cuff was compared to this sexy maid. Cuff's got some chest though, I'll give you that. Just that attitude, I
  guess. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, from Zain getting beat up by Cuff leaving that
  bruise which is total comedic relief, to Cuff not giving up even though I
  would hardly call holding on to Zain walking as skating lol, this author just
  can't stop shitting on the relationships between the couples we've seen in
  this series and I LOVE IT haha best Anime of the year. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> On the night
  of skating outdoors, the two
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/mahoutsukai" target="_blank">magicians</a>
  discussed on Bocchan's case and decided that letting him in on the next
  witch's sabbath ie. think of Harry Potter's magic town where those wizards
  gather, on the next dark moon to find out a solution to his problem. I doubt this will be easy but Alice will be tagging along, so let's
  see if we can even undo the spell without approaching the witch who put it on
  him first lol. Last but not least, what we may have a glimpse on the trailer
  since I remembered it too well, a night between Alice... and Viola-chan haha
  what we got the Bocchan one some time ago already. Anyways, we know Viola
  knows that Bocchan likes Alice, but she doesn't know Alice has someone she
  likes... and is literally her brother so oh boy can't wait for that reveal to
  happen, but yeah, touching a little more on the passive aggressiveness of
  Viola here is the point, that even with the brother complimenting her he still
  gets insulted to some extent. Very unprofessional as cute younger sister in
  my opinion haha. All in all, loved this episode, could use a lot more
  wholesome content every week I must add, but next week might not be the case
  since we may have to advance the plot a bit I guess. We shall see, if the
  sabbath is as scary as we might think, as we embark on an adventure to resolve
  Bocchan's curse. Cya guys then.

  JUST CALL THE COPS~!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Haha we can just do that you know they
  suggested it before too. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, in this new epiosde where Milika
  refuses to leave their abode (#KanoKano06), wow now that I've actually seen it
  for myself and thought of how much the author set up for this... this episode
  is something. Weirdness, cringe, and wholesomeness... all mixed together and
  probably tasted worse than my "Cacao Berry Milk Tea" right now lol (<span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span>
  dark chocolate sucks), but yeah, damn. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, in a nutshell of what
  happened, Milika did leave after all, but yeah, the process is longer than you
  think. Firstly, they took an opportunity to snatch her out of the place.
  Surprisingly not calling the cops because why can't they really, but literally
  selling her camping stuff off when she has to take a leak not at their place
  but at the nearby convenience store lol. Yeah, start cringing now; You're
  going to need it later haha. And if you have not seen someone who comes to
  pick up unwanted goods at your doorstep and gives you money back so they can
  help you recycle or re-purpose those mostly household items... watch this
  episode it's a good summary lmao. They don't pay well though so take note.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What's not a good summary though, is how long this dragged lol. The
  girls may be able to argue that Naoya wouldn't get another girlfriend, but
  yes, as we have learnt this far even the author is self-aware, is that the guy
  can NOT control himself. Yeah, think of Naoya now as our local government
  trying to stop another lockdown from that virus out there, yes? Then you'll
  get his perspective. Then again, he is kind of a jerk so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not going to
  infer about your governments but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You see, Naoya doesn't want to
  disappoint more women and/or have to deal with more women being okay with
  another girl in a relationship, is the thing. And Milika is probably not intending to do polygamy, might also be the issue here. Which will bring us to the
  actual act and having to deal with Rika-chan's... father? Yep, we reaching
  that stage already. This part is probably more of a growing up story if you
  haven't been paying attention lol, and if you haven't seen you'll be glad that
  Naoya is stretching out all the daughter's virtues it'll even make the dad
  jealous lol. So yeah, in order to protect Milika-san for this case I guess
  Naoya has to go that far, but again, look at your circumstances before you
  think of saving others, please. Haha good thing you have TWO understanding
  girlfriends who won't kill you for being honest and nice lol. Even then, it's
  nice to see Rika-chan's life right there, living with her single dad and having
  to dodge old man's perspective including not being involved in a two timing
  and making it three timing lol but of course, more likely, how she is
  making big bucks online as a streamer, even if it means... yeah I hate to say
  this, doing it through whatever means possible. Yeah, flashing chest is not
  right but ask me
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7ktPB6toqucpkkCiolwLg" target="_blank">what ma bro is following on YouTube</a>
  and you tell me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I had to intentionally use incognito for this link
  just in case this ends up in my recommendations lol) (Sorry for being old man,
  okay? Haha) But yeah, whatever whatever I saved your daughter from your bullshit, but more importantly, which is also the title for this episode, we
  found out that Milika is slowly liking this dude Naoya, even if at this point
  it means he had to beg her to date him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah right,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a>
  doesn't work like this: you force her. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, somehow this gets
  resolved and the father took her home without ruining her potential future as
  a porn star lmao, but yeah if you haven't experienced the miracle that is
  Anime "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/24544/Kirino_Kousaka" target="_blank">OreImo</a>" this is pretty much the same character but as a streamer and is voiced by
  the same girl a decade ago, so yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Other than that stupid
  reference lol, I'm just glad we didn't end up in a three timing because you
  bet there were so many occasions that would have happened if Naoya didn't
  control himself enough but yeah, you get the idea. Although I would argue,
  even if they didn't pack her stuff, the dad will still appear and it may end
  up the same way where Naoya would still save her since the two girls probably
  won't, and yeah, I guess the author did it right? No, not right, this is
  already a two-timing Anime series, no. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "Don't you worry that if Milika-san stays here for too long, I'll fall
  in love with her?" That's true that is a possibility Naoya especially coming
  from you lmao]

  Man, if you can make any water drinkable is that water you can drink? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Hey, we're in a series where you have to doubt if it's normal to think like this, mind you. In
  this new episode though (#SonnyBoy04), you know how great it is for the
  animation team to talk about monkeys and NEVER have to animate them? Yeah, I
  want to work on this Anime. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, maybe we don't have that flashlight,
  just saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, man did they get me with this episode after I
  finished with the three-episode rule, huh. Haha so let's talk about what
  happened, in between diving into whatever void and eating curry rice lol. So,
  maybe I'll shorten the part about the monkeys, but you know, in case you only
  remembered the baseball talk from Cap haha, let us talk about what was going
  on. Basically, we have witnessed Nagara's powers: to travel between worlds.
  Sadly, and I'm not going to take the end of the episode to tell you that since
  Bill Nye figured out that too, Nagara can't travel back to the real world. Of
  course, the powers literally only work when you're in this world that you're
  stuck in. It's like asking for a bottle opener to open a sealed bottle when you
  are inside the bottle. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, it all happened over dinner (lol)
  when Cap talked about baseball and how (1) Nagara and him and Ace (one of the
  baddies from Episode 1) were in a baseball team before and even fighting until the
  nationals if not for Nagara's fail apparently and (2) how monkeys in this island were
  playing baseball too. Yeah, I don't see any though. Animation jokes aside, it looked
  like Ace was the only one who can see them, and thus also, taught them how to
  play baseball. And I guess over the course of them being stuck, they made many
  miracles surprisingly only Ace and Cap saw in its entirety, I guess. So we're
  not going to talk about Cap's history lesson, but in summary Blue was a great
  hitter until a referee stopped his final to perfect pitch, and died because...
  he called a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sutoraiku" target="_blank">strike</a> to a
  ball from this legendary hitter who could not, or MUST NOT, disappoint the
  crowd. Man, rules are a bitch, isn't it? *looks at the world they are in* (Oh
  also, I agree with Nozomi for the referee holding up to the rules, protecting
  the sport itself; I mean, look at the original rules of card game UNO) Haha anyways, we
  can't show the footage of monkeys dying too, so yeah, it ended up being a
  showdown in baseball of Ace versus Nagara just because Mizuho wanted to see
  monkeys lmao. Anything for you girl- I mean, you can just order some monkeys
  haha what am I saying of course you can't do that via Amazon. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving
  on haha, the showdown conditions were of course the worst, because besides the
  obvious borrowing of the flashlight so Nagara could jerk off to it- Wait,
  wrong one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So the girls can see monkeys on this island thing what am
  I even saying, but in exchange if Nagara loses he has to send them back to the
  real world where Ace can be his smug self and lose and retire and and kill a
  referee who made him lose his career and beating that dude to death with other
  humans. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Monkey joke) So yeah, unlike Bill Nye, Ace doesn't know
  it's not this simple, and after Nagara lost the match he tried to bring all of
  them back... but it didn't work, which brings us to the conclusion of his
  powers as mentioned earlier. No really, what made you think that was remotely
  possible? We haven't even tapped long enough on Nozomi's power, you think
  Nagara's powers will work? How ridiculous lol. To end this, looks like we're
  busted on the "leaving this world" ideology so we might have external forces
  here to help. Or maybe this Aki-sensei who I must say has a huge rack probably
  saving herself by floating around in the sea lmao, was probably trapped for a
  while going from her only dialogue at the end of this episode. All in all... I
  still wonder if this is God's greatest joke of all time, even in this Anime
  worldview. But hey, I don't know anything about it, so I guess we'll just watch
  and see if it can even compete to other original series I've watched all these
  years. This series is getting better AND worse at the same time I can't even-
  Did you see how long they took to talk about the baseball story just so we get
  to see a beat up monkey on base? What the f-

  August started us up with a slew of great releases so let's talk about them.
  <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%83%91%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC-ep/1577315461?l=en" target="_blank">ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</a></b>
  after quite a while and the first in their 25th anniversary because I might as
  well promote for them lol, is not exactly great but then I recall the years of
  listening to their songs even rejecting recent year stuff and wonder if this
  is probably what I was also missing, as much as I'm into mainstream or idolism
  who are promoting more... standard melodies instead of stuff like this. Hmm...
  Ajikan, I'll think about it and come back to you guys. Meanwhile, I'll take
  the one topic song, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kaleidoscope/1576687324?l=en" target="_blank"><b>Kitou Akari's concept album</b></a>
  probably took the attention this week since I see no difference of this
  release compared to her previous releases since it's still promoting her cute
  and coolness anyways, and is releasing an English version of the topic song
  the only thing they had for this? Okay haha. Last but not least, this is not
  this week new, but recently remembered them so I listened to
  <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E7%A2%BA%E3%81%8B%E3%81%AA%E7%9E%B3%E3%82%92%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%A4%E3%81%91%E3%81%A6-ep/1551584170?l=en" target="_blank">Tsuki no Michikake's new EP</a></b>
  released earlier this year and... they aren't exactly awesome but I would like
  to give something different and I think they came in at the right time haha I
  took a couple of songs anyways.

    songs</b>
  on digital platforms but I know that they will be releasing a combined
  Anime-based compilation end of the month so I'll wait until that. Man, can
  they make Anime theme song releases a little more grand? What is with this
  budget-level theme song mention even<br />
  <br />So next week, it's real empty for new releases and I don't intend to
  find new ones mainly because (1) there's a public holiday tomorrow and I have
  a backlog of music festival videos to watch so I'll find something in the list
  and (2) I can take this time to take a break because I have been listening to
  a lot lately and I think we are on pace to giving a lot more songs in the near
  future so might as well let my left ear rest. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay I take my words
  back haha I'll listen to <b>a flood of circle's anniversary album</b> because
  apart from what I mentioned two paragraphs ago, their album is also the first
  concept I've seen where five different artists (from UNISON SQUARE GARDEN to
  SIX LOUNGE whom I knew) write songs for them as part of their 15th
  anniversary. So yeah, I heard quite a couple of good ones from the preview on
  YouTube and this isn't a big release so I'll tune in to it I guess.

      Well, I knew this took way longer than it should have been which I am
      grateful, but still, I think I've reached a point I'm going to get
      discriminated because I haven't been vaccinated from that virus that is
      killing thousands every day. Good news? I don't have to spend time dealing
      with what happens to me if I took it. Bad news? My dad's probably
      sub-threatening me with a relative's wedding dinner so that I would do
      something about it. Hey, all in the day's life isn't it- You piece of shit
      kid who thinks you HAVE to go overseas every year for your birthday I only
      left my hometown at 10 and NOW I have to protect your a** by getting
      myself exposed to the virus. Whatever dude, you deem what is society
      worthy</span></strike><br />

  Cya guys next week then I can't think of anything good to talk about (ignore
  the previous paragraph, rendering error I can't fix lol) and probably because
  we are getting another Anime Extra tomorrow anyways might as well because why
  would I love needles haha and until then... if your hometown is dying people
  at a way faster rate than mine then maybe you should consider getting poked
  haha just get out and come back tomorrow
