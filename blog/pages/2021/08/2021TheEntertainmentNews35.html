Wow quite a couple of birthdays this week including Koga Aoi which no one cared about
(say sorry to her, me) and Amamiya Sora which of course, since she has her own
YouTube channel now, you can watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KuYZFadAjo" target="_blank">her birthday video</a>... which just shows how screwed up production is but in the face of showing
her other side which is mostly awkwardness so far just because. Our angel can't
always be perfect she gotta be sadist and talk down to us for making her eat
blue-coloured food lmao
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I know right, we should make ALL idols whatever their most natural character
  is in the entertainment industry haha and then turns out it's all sadists lol
  I mean who likes to be acting if they can not do so? That's how you get the
  YouTuber industry today isn't it
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, Anime time, it's a Sunday, yesterday I bought a lot of things in view of next
  month's package which will arrive at October probably when I'm fully
  vaccinated so I can continue to stay at home to open it haha, but hey, at
  least there's Tomita Miyu in it now. MIYU-CHAN~!! Haha okay let's watch shows
  and talk music

        you're still underage
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    "Is Siesta going to die this week?" has always been my question every
    episode since the flashback started, but you know, I gotta wonder. And in
    this week's episode (#TanMoshi08) looks like we aren't quite there yet, as
    with previous episodes. But, we did get some plot advancement, so let's talk all
    about it. Yeah, if you realize something was wrong with Alicia I did too so
    don't worry you aren't being paranoid watching an action series filled with
    androids where anything can happen. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, story. Story goes that
    Siesta is fine now, but that doesn't mean the city is. People are taken off
    their hearts once again, and because we learnt that Fuubi-san is literally
    in Japan now and not where they are which is as I assume is England, which
    means someone has been shapeshifting again. I would like to put my
    deductions here but we were hinted of a Chameleon some time ago during the
    fight with Hel so you may want to put two and two together. Still, Alicia here is
    persistent in joining in the investigations, but yeah, it's hard isn't it.
    With Siesta being serious about her job and clearly not wanting anyone to be
    distracted, clearly Kimizuka is not doing his sidekick job properly and
    shoving tracking devices up little girls'- (<a href="https://jisho.org/search/lolicon" target="_blank">Lolicon</a>! Lolicon! Haha) Anyways,
    things got real emotional where the trio had to talk to the victim's mother
    (Aw the victim was such a beautiful woman why) (lol me) More importantly, is
    what you have to figure out of these investigations. No, not the part where
    Alicia asked Kimizuka to put the ring on her. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, I guess it was
    a preventive measure he did to try to track Alicia just in case she got lost or
    you know, started to kill people or something. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> So, somehow she was
    found injured with a police officer who was almost killed... by just guess who it is it's not hard lol, and she landed in hospital only to be found missing
    in the dead of night. Literally at this point you would have guessed, as the
    duo manage to appear at the same church even with the fallout earlier on and
    them questioning themselves about the coincidences of Alicia's appearance.
    Serious talk though, why do they have to keep on with the conscious
    bullsh*t? With Nagisa having Siesta's heart, now this? So yeah, spoiler
    alert, and thanks Chameleon for joining in in spirit because we can't see
    him anyways, Hel after the fight supposedly lost her memory and has changed
    form. I mean, Hel got Hel-la cute, I gotta say. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Haha I know this is a
    bad joke you can leave now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, that already will put in a lot
    of assumptions here, because now that we know Alicia and Hel are the same
    thing just that she has two... hearts... now? I don't know this sounds weird
    already lol. So yeah, for now let's just assume that Hel has like, multiple
    forms like those people with split personality syndrome or something I've
    forgotten the term since I saw a local drama series with the same type of
    character. Now that'll make sense in a smaller scale where in this
    investigation we can just zone in at all the clues we know of and
    IMMEDIATELY deduce Alicia was probably not on their side lol. You figured
    that out yet? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, I guess we're infiltrating SPES headquarters
    or one of their bases next week, considering the theme songs did not get
    much love somehow lol. Hmm maybe, maybe Hel before she was 17 was a lovely
    girl like this, who knows. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Haha cya guys next week.

    P.S. "Far-fetched logic is still logic" Hey you know what Alicia, you're
    right. But you're too cute to join in investigations and die in this series so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Audience:
    Over like, Siesta?) Ah well, that wasn't my choice lol
  </div>
  <div>
    P.P.S. "Somehow, I feel like that was my daughter talking to me" Yeah then,
    why not take Alicia as your daughter? No one here wants her and you just lost a daughter so you can take it
    lol

    Wow, different intro? That's good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode of series I
    keep sh*tting on the intro every week (#ShinigamiBocchan08), let's talk
    about more people we can sh*t on haha. So firstly let's get right to it, the
    brother. No, not that brother who has a curse on him. The other one. The one
    who is SECOND in line to inherit the family head title because his elder
    brother is not going to be in a position to do so since we don't intend to kill guests
    via handshake as they arrive lol. The one who has probably been covering for
    her sister from the mother every SECOND she decides to do her thing and
    leave for the old mansion which is about a TWO hour trip (Word pun here:
    Viola meant "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/jikan" target="_blank">jikan</a>" as in hours but he heard as "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/jinan" target="_blank">jinan</a>"). And yes if you can guess it after you've read this far, he's real
    sensitive about his position in the household, as the SECOND son of the
    family. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, bro, we didn't intend to burn you though; You are
    just super flammable. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, thanks for covering for Viola-chan
    whenever she misses not the brother and wants to go to the old mansion. (She
    can't say she's into older men~!! Haha don't hit me pls then again hit me pls
    lol what) Yeah, for being such a bro, I thank you for taking in all the
    responsibility that would otherwise fall on your brother's hands, but hey,
    who says you can't be the head of the household when your brother is MIA at
    age five? This dude's probably TWO, I think? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, I'll stop with
    this lol I get it it's a big joke for everyone in this series anyways, the
    character differences. What also has character though, is the encounter of
    Viola with Cuff-san, and yes apparently they haven't seen each other before.
    Some background story here, she and Zain were working at the circus to blend
    in as half-witches, and Cuff specifically wants to learn how to write well?
    Sure, bet you can't write the size of your rack- Anyways (probably "G"?)
    (lmao) so yeah she decided to hang around, but Viola thought she was a
    burglar? I mean, you know criminals run or attack immediately after being
    discovered right? Haha yeah, so that was a thing that the other three
    witnessed, Viola on top of Cuff. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And Viola probably got what she
    wanted when she realized Cuff was with them lol RACK oh Rob please stop teasing her and
    marry her or something already lmao. Last but not least, and this took quite
    a chunk of the episode and I think it's also necessary, is the origin story
    of Alice arriving at the old mansion to work under Bocchan. Hey, we may not
    know much about Alice's story which I was definitely more interested in,
    because we know even after Rob told Bocchan to live on and probably got sh*t on every time since you know, it was depressed Bocchan
    back then, but suffice it to say that Alice living with her aunt isn't any
    better so she probably chose this route to, you know, give both of them a
    chance in living, isn't it? Think about it. Other than that, it's just
    Bocchan rejecting this sexy maid dressed in black (title drop sort of)
    mostly because he refuses to remember the past they had together, and him probably really
    worried why would anyone else want to stay in this mansion with him and Rob
    after he has been LITERALLY KICKED OUT by the mother I would say, and had to
    live quite a meaningless life in itself. But hey, we have goals
    now. Be rid of the curse and marry the maid or something, I think. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    But yeah, from cleaning his room within a night when given three days as a
    threat to kick her out, to complimenting Bocchan every day to cheer him
    up... I must say the healing of a heart which was also rather broken brings
    a tear to my eye. Good though, now we truly know why Alice is here as of
    now, since she, like Bocchan, also desire the wonderful days albeit current
    circumstances, where they were together. Aw, so sweet, isn't it. Hey, it's
    hardly any chance people will come <em>to</em> you when you are in your darkest
    times, especially if you hardly knew of them. Normally people <em>leave</em>&nbsp;when you are in your darkest times,
    whatever it is. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, great episode this time around, and looks
    like we have Christmas vows coming, so start doing those marriage vows
    before Alice gets taken away by Zain or something haha what

    How long are we going to have to deal with embarrassed and maybe
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a>
    Milika-san? I don't know. I just know all these years of lack of Ayachi in
    my Anime life has been compensated with this series so far. Very thoroughly.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#KanoKano09) you know how mind blown is Naoya
    always to the things around him such that if it were Nazi Germany he'll
    totally be the Propaganda Minister? Yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, uh, what else is new
    again? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, story. Wow, how did this still all happen with one
    school day is still blowing my mind I thought this happened in a period of
    like, two weeks or something lol. Anyways, let's talk about what happens for
    Milika after this whole fiasco. Firstly, about misunderstandings. Yeah, she
    found out about the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hatsujouki" target="_blank">in heat</a>" bullsh*t Saki-chan pumped into this poor dude.
    Haha seriously bro, do some online research when you're free; It'll help you
    in the long run. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, this was kinda rough to watch even though
    I must say the reactions are 10/10, having Milika-san go embarrassed to the
    point she kind of has to explain herself while holding up to the
    embarrassment on her red af cheeks... this is just the tsundere material
    I've waited for years haha voiced by a married woman btw. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, but
    Milika-san can't tell Naoya that she likes him even though she's totally
    into him already since she's that tsundere... this series is great haha
    totally filled up my empty meter for such action this year alone. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Anyhow, we thought that like, Milika would be fine here once she knows of
    Naoya never being able to accept her in any capacity, on how because he has
    two girlfriends and that, he'll never go out with this MeTuber, but yeah, that
    is still not stopping her from giving up as far as we have seen these
    couple of episodes, to say the least. And I guess that's going to be a
    problem, even till the series ends, I must say. Just a nuisance, but you
    know, it's a free world and we can't technically arrest her for harassing
    Naoya I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We're reaching the stage where if we don't shit on
    her long enough we WILL NOT let Naoya do the three-timing haha what.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay but serious talk though, no way, like, please don't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Sadly, this has not ended on Milika's side because instead of the "I wish
    him happiness" talk when you know, you have to like give way such that the
    person you like can find happiness thing especially with two other people lol, Milika rather believes in that she should be THE girlfriend, and talked
    about how much Naoya has been in her mind ever since he saved her from her
    father who would swear to delete her online video career blah blah it's hard
    to make money. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But Naoya is still flabbergasted at
    Milika, wondering how even these things can make her fall in love with him.
    Well, it's pot calling the kettle black here already, with Milika talking
    about what supposedly is normal for guys to look attractive to them- Guess
    what I will do none of what Naoya does so I'm with you, girl. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, Naoya is
    a nice guy, I guess. It's hard for anyone to honestly or even in a
    straightforward manner, say things like "I'll protect you" considering you
    guys were only classmates- wait, schoolmates haha yeah it's as if you guys
    don't know each other. But that's the precise problem. Which brings us to
    the kill. Yep, Rika-chan here did the thing. It's the kiss, way earlier than
    those two who were witnesses to this in the sports equipment room haha, and
    man, how many people were sad because of this, you think? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Saki-chan
    was probably right in thinking that Naoya probably didn't get aroused (I
    would though) (Haha), the two girlfriends probably want to kill themselves, and it
    took so much explanation on Saki-chan's side in order for Naoya to
    understand that all this while, it really requires a lot more than just the
    fact that they are girlfriends in name to this dude, to, you know, have an
    edge compared to Milika-san here, all things considered. But yeah, you get
    the idea, f**ked up in storytelling as usual, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in
    all... well Naoya I think you need to research a bit about dating just like
    Saki-chan did as we saw episodes earlier. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> No really, it'll help.
    For me who has ZERO EXPERIENCE in anything love-related, I think I still may
    know how to date someone more than you who has two girlfriends haha. So next
    week, I guess we're FINALLY going on a date? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, what episode is
    this, 10 for next week? Okay, dude, whenever you're ready. I'm already blowing
    up seeing all this emotion overflowing through this series, I'm good with
    wherever Milika-san will be there anyways so MUAHAHAHAHA ah hey I said it
    here first *looks at next episode preview* what did I tell you
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; Yes Rieri was right
    <a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie/status/1431294568780107776?s=20" target="_blank">Shion-san did say something else other than "SakiSaki"</a>
    it was "eh" and "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/nani" target="_blank">nani</a>" lol this series on minor characters man OH NO IT'S WAY MORE THAN THAT SHE HEARD IT uh oh haha]

    </blockquote>
    Wow what's the number on that meeting? Yeah, in case you haven't realized,
    we are reaching a new arc of this series. In this new arc of a series
    that'll still confuse some of you including me (#SonnyBoy07), if you think
    whatever world they were in trying to go back to the real world is only "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/soredake" target="_blank">that much</a>", think again. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because serious talk, we have been given a clearer
    picture than we have ever in the history of this series, trust me. I know,
    you're still troubled about this "world", so let's talk about as much as I
    understand too which isn't much, but you know, it's "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/soredake" target="_blank">no more than that</a>". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You think this Japanese phrase will be overused considering it
    has this many meanings? I won't. Haha but more on that later, we have
    another story to tell. Story goes that, in the previous episode this student
    body has realized that, through their adventures of trying to go back to the
    real world even if it's some years ago, they ended up seeing their real
    selves during graduation day, way after their current state, some even dead
    in the future. Problem is here then, is that they saw themselves as a copy
    of the original, meaning that, they aren't selected to be in the real world
    time space, if Einstein can help you understand this better. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Anyways, this as I heard became a pivotal point of this series since a longer
    promotional video was handed out this week, and we move on to other "worlds"
    which also feature students who were left adrift, likely because of the same
    reason. So think about it this way then, if I were to simplify this:
    <u>Imagine you were the many possibilities of futures you were on now maybe
      reading this post, and other yous may have done otherwise in this time and
      space, but you were the definite future.</u>
    The adrift ones are then the students seen here, with the God or
    proprietor as the school principal in this case, dumping the responsibility
    to move between worlds to Nagara.... or Nagata as he is called now because
    or else anyone who hears his name after that whatever meeting will attempt
    to kill him in seconds now that everyone knows what his powers are. Still,
    that doesn't stop him from travelling between worlds, as seen from that one
    exercise bar in the middle of nowhere on the island. This, took Nagata (yes
    I'm keeping up with this fake name) into a world of... mining? Where people
    here are forced to work by moving blocks downwards, wait for it, to build a
    tower to Heaven. Yes, in case you took longer than Nagata to realize this as
    I did too haha, it's completely in the wrong direction. Which brings us to
    the idea of people understanding their super powers earlier than the rest
    who probably won't consider otherwise or have less useful spells, is that
    this "Koumori" guy is controlling this specific world using his upside down
    powers. We'll get to that in a moment, but Nagata was treated like trash, so
    I guess he does want to get out of it considering what he has seen so far.
    Compare him to himself Episode 1 or
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/futatsuboshi" target="_blank">Futatsuboshi</a>
    here lol that's a long name, who couldn't be much bothered about how the
    world works, and probably will remind you of how the students on the island
    had to work in order to trade for stuff to buy from like, Mizuho because she
    has the ordering powers, remember? So yeah, it's kind of similar just that
    this one instead of First Kitchen burgers or Yoshinoya beef bowls (lol) it's
    bugs. Ugh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From Futatsuboshi though, we have learnt that there IS
    an existing like, leadership body around, delegating hosts to different
    worlds probably doing mundane stuff like this for centuries even thousands
    of years, run by a Beatnik sort of group of leaders who then determine... I
    don't know, their next approach? Like, how they want to get rid of this
    Nagara right now? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay this is quite a write-up so I should
    conclude soon, but yeah since this is a world of nonsense and fiction (RIP
    Futatsuboshi getting eaten up by shooting star bugs lol) Nagata quickly
    learnt of the world's rules, and learnt that working at moving the blocks
    the other way round would (1) get a lot of attention including the chief
    directly above worker them because why would you not follow everyone else
    and (2) get him out of this world by meeting the leadership, and finally,
    make his way down where the source of truth is. Turns out, it's someone he
    has been an acquaintance with as a kid, "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/koumori" target="_blank">Koumori</a>" here is using his powers probably as controlled by Beatnik members or any
    higher entity, to control the population here to, you know, have some
    purpose in their not lives in building a tower towards Heaven, maybe
    carrying some treasure along I guess. So yeah, all in all, this is just like
    other episodes, but we are moving forward regardless.
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/soredake" target="_blank">That is all</a>.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The biggest thing Nagara probably got out of this especially
    considering that Koumori did cover for him in the meeting to leave him alone
    instead of judge him at stake, is that he needs to be more determined in
    this resolution to likely, save everyone from this world. From what though?
    Labour? Freedom? Association to their original future selves? That, I'm not
    sure. What I am sure though, is that this series has brought upon many waves
    of different directions ever since the reveal last week including why is
    Asakaze still on the island instead of being on that party bus with Aki not
    sensei lol, but hey, we got more bizarre stories to tell. See you then.

    This week was quite a week for releases, so as promised I'll ignore
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hug/1579527307?i=1579527312&amp;l=en" target="_blank">LuckLife's new song</a></b>
    haha okay I did hear it first but I didn't fancy it so oh well. What I did
    like though is
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/litmus-ep/1577489011?l=en" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new EP</a></b>
    and its new songs in a while and I gave a couple of songs besides the third
    one because they wrote this for a kid if I didn't remember wrongly and I
    don't think that's sincerity considering I didn't like it so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Anyways, probably what took the spotlight was
    <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%8E%A2%E5%81%B5%E3%81%AF%E3%82%82%E3%81%86-%E6%AD%BB%E3%82%93%E3%81%A7%E3%81%84%E3%82%8B-%E9%9F%B3%E6%A5%BD%E5%A4%A7%E5%85%A8/1582432163?l=en" target="_blank">Anime "Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru." Song Collection</a></b>
    which featured the theme songs which I gave both but I was surprised the
    opening theme was so much better than the ending which was such a drag I have reluctantly given,
    but most importantly, I gave the one Sapphire song Saikawa Yui sang on her
    live because besides being the one out of three songs which were in full
    because why would you do more lol why not though, but also I think through
    <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1430394996130148360?s=20" target="_blank">my Tweets</a>
    you may have figured how much I became a simp to Yui-nyan after this week.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I also chose not to sleep this weekend (which is a bad idea because
    staying awake next week at work is going to suck lol) and listen to a couple
    of live performances including<b> SCANDAL's recent 15th anniversary live</b>
    which also happened on drummer RINA's birthday so happy birthday anyways she
    turned 30 haha but hey the new song didn't sound great so I'm not planning
    to review that (lol), and <b>Kitou Akari's live performance</b> is just too
    good, I know not to give more songs to listen to because I've already
    exhausted myself in giving just her adorable singing voice. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay I'm
    done talking about this haha<br />
    <br />On news concerning music and is on Twitter and I'm excluding Hololive
    VTubers from this paragraph because look at next paragraph,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1431627489541955586?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Scenarioart released a new song</b></a>
    which I must say isn't bad so we might just give it before it lands on a
    major release,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1431270283420254211?s=20" target="_blank">for Amamiya Sora's birthday they have kindly released her THE FIRST
        TAKE recordings</a>
      on digital platforms</b>
    which is nice,
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/horieyui_staff/status/1431196037822271488?s=20" target="_blank">Horie Yui's new song</a>
      for upcoming Anime</b>
    releasing October actually sounded good from the trailer so I might just be
    giving this one,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1430470005993492485?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Hanazawa Kana's new music video preview</b></a>
    is nothing but cute so get hooked on that before the actual
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1430470758325706756?s=20" target="_blank">full YouTube premiere</a>
    next month, apparently
    <b><a href="https://twitter.com/takagi3_anime/status/1430122740229443591?s=20" target="_blank">there's an animation music video for like Anime "Takagi-san" season
        two</a>
      ending</b>
    which was in theme song single of Ohara Yuiko so I won't go through that see
    what I wrote two years ago lol,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTimesN/status/1429884169111293957?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Porno Graffitti's new single title</b></a>
    is just pure hype even if it's a title, and there's
    <a href="https://twitter.com/FFLOWER_STAFF/status/1430092518402658310?s=20" target="_blank"><b>FLOWER FLOWER's recent live digest</b></a>
    if anyone wants it lol. Oh, and Part 1 of it is six months ago haha
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />
    <br />And since there aren't any new releases I'm into next week, I thought I could
    take this time to review all the <b>Hololive VTuber member songs</b> since
    they have been pushing those out a lot lately so apart from
    <a href="https://twitter.com/suisei_hosimati/status/1429094657049317381?s=20" target="_blank">Hoshimachi Suisei</a>
    which I intend to give her 1st album end of next month (which by the way she
    worked hard on ie. paid for the production of it, which is I guess how it
    works now for them idol VTubers) I also will review the new songs (in no
    particular order, I'll post links) where I might as well list them properly for
    our convenience, what I know of them and whether I've listened to them yet:
  </div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/tsunomakiwatame/status/1428710021810909187?s=20" target="_blank">Tsunomaki Watame</a>&nbsp;which we have given her first song earlier this year and she is
      pushing out releases left and right even with a YouTube live just like
      Suisei apparently,&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/amanekanatach/status/1428331118638501891?s=20" target="_blank">Amane Kanata</a>&nbsp;which I hope she doesn't sound like a gorilla so I'll hold my
      breath,
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/natsuiromatsuri/status/1418225087694610432?s=20" target="_blank">Natsuiro Matsuri</a>&nbsp;which is her first ever original despite being a 1st Generation
      member,
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/sakuramiko35/status/1431617029056786441?s=20" target="_blank">Sakura Miko</a>&nbsp;for her 3rd anniversary recently and I even know
      <a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1431613080199303172?s=20" target="_blank">yuiko-san wrote the lyrics</a>,
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/minatoaqua/status/1424717290340196352?s=20" target="_blank">Minato Aqua</a>&nbsp;which will probably disappoint since I'm not used to her higher
      pitched singing but I recall this has a mellow mood which would be great for me now,
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/omarupolka/status/1430813965815189506?s=20" target="_blank">Omaru Polka</a>&nbsp;but she is a circus herself so I doubt this will be anything but a
      joke lol,
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/shishirobotan/status/1426831679935574025?s=20" target="_blank">Shishiro Botan</a>&nbsp;from latest 5th Gen because why not for her 1st anniversary

    </li>
    <li>

      <a href="https://twitter.com/murasakishionch/status/1427615120440455174?s=20" target="_blank">Murasaki Shion</a>&nbsp;which is her first ever original and is a 2nd Gen member I like

    <li>

      have heard of
      <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%81%8B%E3%81%AE%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F-%E3%83%88%E3%83%8B%E3%82%AB%E3%82%AF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A4-op/1529852413?i=1529852414&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Anime "Tonikaku Kawaii" opening theme</a>
      you know what to expect (which is no go for me the Anime was an
      exception),
    </li>
    <li>
      and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ookamimio/status/1428729799770460164?s=20" target="_blank">Ookami Mio</a>&nbsp;from Hololive Gamers so between 1st and 2nd Gen- how did you get
      ZAQ-san to write a song for you I have no idea.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    Tell me if I missed anything and not EN members or those JP ones not listed
    here because I don't care haha and yes, I am listing out all of them for my
    convenience in the need that I have to search all of them up to add into a
    playing queue haha WELCOME TO 2021 BABY!! I'll space these out over the week to listen to as many as I can during work or on commute I guess
  </div>
  <div>
    <br /><br /><br /><br />
    Wow, that list above took quite a while, I must say. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Really, I
    wished there was a place where the official group will list all these out.
    Or maybe I don't know where to do it, but seeing that I can't find them
    easily unless looking at their Twitter accounts... it has not been easy
    haha. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I may really need to see the doctor I want to hear clearly out of my left ear tbh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Oh well, if this comes from work it's only just like fixing flooding with poor irrigation systems lol what kind of example is that. Haha take care of yourselves then.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Something tells me I need to check out <a href="https://twitter.com/kanokari_pzl/status/1431919645024407554?s=20" target="_blank">this ultimate Anime girlfriend simulator on mobile</a> next month when it comes out HAHA it has many characters from familiar Anime series like "KanoKari" from last year and "KanoKano" from this year too (It's like "Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing" but it's a dating simulator and Sonic is "KanoKari" lol?)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>P.P.S. When you rather listen to city pop in the form of
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRBfnGSB44" target="_blank">Ueda Reina's new song</a>
  than Awesome City Club... lol Ueshama~!! Haha argh "<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/scapesheep/1579813254?i=1579813417&amp;l=en" target="_blank">scapesheep</a>" is such a good song to dance too I want to see her in a tight skirt dancing
  in like, club lighting with the composers TECHNOBOYS doing the whistle at the
  back dressed in suits <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span> We're not getting that isn't it <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
