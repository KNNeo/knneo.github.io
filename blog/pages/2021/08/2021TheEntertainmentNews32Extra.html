Don't ask me how I would not care much but don't  expect me to give you anything in return especially openness from the  biological fire that is upon us haha no seriously<br />  <br />Let's talk about more Anime, shall we? I promised we will come back for  a closer to real time review of these Sunday airtime series yesterday so let's do it!<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TanMoshi06">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "Siesta... How did you procure such a thing?" I mean, Kimizuka, is this      surprising to you? She's THE detective, bro, she can get her hands on      anything including you lol    </div>  </blockquote>  Please, Siesta, we'll only do stuff inside this robot AFTER this is all over  haha why is this sounding like a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hentai" target="_blank">hentai</a> now. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode  which I guess we are going against that SPES leader already (#TanMoshi06), we  have quite some stuff to go through I think, considering I don't think we will  get to <strike>Hell</strike> Hel this easily haha since you know, if that is  done why would we be talking about someone's death isn't it. So, story. Story  goes that Siesta came in with a government issued secretly developed robot  (government as in British apparently because where would the Big Ben be at)  (at under construction state haha got them) to go against Hel and her biological weapon,  I don't really quite get the action that is happening because I swear any  action series I watched got me more excited than this (yes, even the whole "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2787/Shakugan_no_Shana_II_Second" target="_blank">Shakugan no Shana II</a>" which was a total drag), but long story short Siesta just straight up  crashed that robot into the monster who is about to spew all his biological  juice on this planet, likely destroying it in the process(?). Hel survived  though and managed to escape, so whatever, that's the whole point anyways lol.  Siesta apparently got injured so she is on a wheelchair now but seriously why  isn't she dead yet haha, and the couple is enjoying their lovey-dovey time in  some motel and doing everything but follow up on Hel's escape. As Kimizuka went  out to buy groceries specifically apples which are probably better than the  ones I eat after dinner lol (sorry dad but it's true), he saw some girl sleeping in a box on the streets  of London? Okay, sure, Anime, you do you. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> She introduces herself as  Alicia, she's seven<strike>teen</strike> haha (yes I doubt her statement too),  and (more importantly) she can't remember anything much. I sure hope  this is not like, a spy thing to ambush on these two but more of an extension  to help her continue her detective process considering her current situation,  but we don't know. At this point it just looks like a kidnapping incident done  by Kimizuka himself and only himself lmao, so we don't know much about that  besides the reality we see in front of us. Also, Fuubi-san is back?  Coincidental? But yeah, she's here to fill these guys up... this family haha  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span>, but suffice it to say she might be staying instead of leaving again  just because that heart ripper is back in action, which of course you would  remember that guy who was doing it was killed which can only mean (1) Hel is  doing it herself and probably doing it without a wheeze since she can just  disappear in an instant with someone helping her out and (2) that monster  might still be alive somewhere since that's the only thing the monster eats. I  mean, if Hel is eating human hearts too I wouldn't be surprised but you know.  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All in all, pretty straightforward episode, we are hinted with that  eye in which Saikawa Yui is wearing today so that's something, and I still am just sitting here for the ride which would explain this comparatively  shorter write-up, but you know, I'm already in it there's no way I can say no  to Siesta. Or Nagisa. Or Charlotte. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Because we know like, this series  needs plot advancement but it's too easy to progress so they had to dedicate  half this episode into shitting on the kid and/or Kimizuka because all of them  are savage now for some reason haha Fuubi-san included lol  <div>    <div>      [If you have heard enough voices in Anime you would realize the voices      behind      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/21543/Yumiri_Hanamori" target="_blank">Hel</a>      and      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/30901/Maria_Naganawa" target="_blank">Alicia</a>      aren't that surprising they themselves have held similar roles in the      past]</div><div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V-_jKUwCgQA/YRDA6W-uAHI/AAAAAAABHK4/dEQBmso851wwEe1AAQDrEJRNawh9xCwbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tanmoshi06_robot.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Can't believe I'll say this, but imagine how bad it smells in that            cockpit haha<br />(Ah hey I wish I was Kimizuka lol)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9Gny8SBfMp8/YRDA7ewiNFI/AAAAAAABHK8/2dJcmwuwjGUk5_MCzOJtUXy4u5f0wvttwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tanmoshi06_hel4.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when I say something wrong and immediately got shit on lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>      </div>      P.S.

Ah      yes, that sixth dimension parallel I've heard rumours about lol we call      that "Anime" haha in this new episode though instead of going sci-fi      (#ShinigamiBocchan06) we're doing fantasy theme it seems, since we are      promised a trip to the wizarding world so f**k you Harry Potter let's talk      about big boobs which also doesn't exist in your world haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span>      Anyways, story. (Man, I only need Cuff to burn an award-winning      movie series lol) I guess they need some comedic relief or just relief to      show off actually Bocchan's potential in killing living things, as they      clean up the conservatory. Well, as Bocchan mentioned, two servants can      hardly manage the whole place so that the royalty can do their reading      anywhere anytime lol, but suffice it to say it's just another day in the      house, with Bocchan of course talking about what he has known about his      curse so far, and presenting anxiousness in going to the sabbath just      because. Again, why worry when he literally has the power to stop      everything living... well I guess the problem is on the "everything" huh. No exceptions? Haha we'll see that in action in a bit, but yeah, thinking      back on again, how any witches would ever drop a curse on this little boy      without any intention might be unlikely, which will bring us to the visit      to the wizarding world (go away Hogwarts) along with Zain and Cuff, which      looks like the focus of this episode. No really, cats and boobs are      getting in the way. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So, the trip to the sabbath. Besides      witnessing some great 3DCG magic here and there, I'm still impressed on      the efforts to make an alternate world seem bizarre enough and also      jokingly close to reality because unlike other fantasy series, this      sabbath is just like attendance taking and news updating lol I mean the shortened National Day celebrations in my country with the world on fire took longer      than this lmao. *ah* Anyways, it's all cool until a couple of things      happened which, thankfully, will bring us more to the truth      behind the curse. Firstly, I like the idea of Zain having kids with Cuff      lmao okay who gives a damn about Alice now <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> but yeah, they had to      pretend these two humans cloaked in I guess human detection material would      not be discovered by others lest... they put them in as food for their      magical beings as we also saw in the episode. Then, are the guys playing ball?      Okay that is not important lol you play ball in the wizarding world?      <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Last but not least though, is the talk with the host of the      sabbath, <strike>Hikasa Youko</strike> Daleth haha ah hey who knows what's      under that mask like what Zain mentioned if it's the real deal I'm not      even surprised, (someone make      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Youko_Hikasa" target="_blank">Yocchan</a>      do a Daleth cosplay with the mask on haha sorry just my fetish or whatever) and because besides seeing      super sexy witches smoking, this one leader in what is likely a group of      witches I'm just guessing, seems to know a lot about everything making me suspect      she might be the direct connection to the original series author lol. So,      in summary, Daleth talked about how she was "just" an acquaintance of      Alice's mom which will already lead me to believe the "witch who put the      curse on Bocchan" is likely someone they all know, but sadly that witch who cursed      Bocchan is already dead which I guess is a bit like Siesta because lastly,      this witch died because she was too powerful which is likely also her      greatest weakness. And yes Bocchan ironically the curse isn't broken when      the witch is dead... Which also means that as Bocchan mentioned after they      barely escaped being found out (maybe Bocchan should be a magician you see      how he battled those magical vines?) because Daleth was quite a      <strike>bitch</strike> witch in revealing their identities (lol), we now      know that breaking the curse at this point might be unlikely after all,      considering it's a high level spell probably tested out of prowess and the perpetrator has passed      away...? Yeah, probably just to put us down for now, but hey, at least      Zain and Cuff did help him out and got two kids out of it so win-win...?      <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So next episode... wow why must next episode's title sound so      boring? I mean, it's only boring if Alice is ill or Bocchan is not himself      either so how boring can it get? Haha I guess we shall see it... next      weekend by the way we hit our boob quota this week lmao bye    </div>    <div>      [TL:DR; "It's tough never being able to touch the one you love" Oh      Alice-chan you cad]</div><div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sJsOPpvyHtc/YRDBvNYkStI/AAAAAAABHLY/WP4RgDr-37c12vjTyuhDL4NWXLYnkaXGACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan06_alice4.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Seriously though I think Alice just has a large bra and keeps all            sorts of stuff in there lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rw2yhCdrTpk/YRDBw5ytjTI/AAAAAAABHLc/yyphRtuvBq8Jo01VwBuQ7vXtn7R_UZY5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan06_cuff6.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Ara kawaii haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QPLJ5oy0WHE/YRDB_3C7iGI/AAAAAAABHLg/PY6uByc9H_AuT-mWtVds2fB8y72JouyBgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/shinigamibocchan06_yes.gif" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            See?
