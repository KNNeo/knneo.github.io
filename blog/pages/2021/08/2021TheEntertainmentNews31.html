No really, this week passed by too soon. We're in August already, can't you see?
*looks at Inorin calendar* Mmmmmmmmmm...!! Haha<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Also, too soon because I've been dreaming of idols back to back is what
  happened. From hanging out with Minase Inori solving mysteries if I recall
  correctly from two days ago, to Touyama Nao's alternate self (no really, there were two of her) wanting me to do a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kabedon" target="_blank">kabedon</a> on
  actual her last night... it's all sci-fi level fun and games all the way if you don't
  have to wake up in the middle of the night because your nose keeps acting up.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Yeah, which is why I didn't bother writing them down because they always
  happen on the first half- See, I like to dream out the good stuff earlier?
  Haha okay not about me anymore we can't keep discussing on
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-cy9Yy1JMM" target="_blank">what I watched on YouTube</a>
  let's talk about Anime shall we?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Talking about Anime, I'll probably skip on "Jahy-sama" even though I do have
  plans to watch it, because I mean this is already taking up half my Sunday we
  don't have to make this any longer haha I know I'm enjoying this but doing up
  this weekly post takes time and is still somehow my weekly fuel but still.<br />

  </blockquote>
  Did you even realize how they intentionally make this a heart transplant so we can blatantly stare at Nagisa's chest whenever they talk about it? GENIUS haha ah hey.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode of an arc which is going to end I think
  (#TanMoshi04), we resolve on Saikawa Yui's mystery... can we not mention that
  she's an idol? Haha Nagisa-chan that title is not just misleading but then again I'm
  on Kimizuka's level of thinking so we good. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay, not that close but
  let's talk about what happened. Firstly, the live performance. It's the actual
  day, fanboy Kimizuka was familiar with the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/setori" target="_blank">setlist</a> and is totally ready to
  join the audience haha not, but you get the idea, he is here to determine an
  opportune moment for something to happen. What it is though? We may have to go
  back a little. Remember the initial idea from Saikawa here is to help protect
  a sapphire gem in her mansion with all her guards protecting her in the live
  event? Yeah, likely a farce because all you need to know is that the idea wasn't about protecting any treasure in the room because again like what
  Kimizuka said last week, the in built defences is more than enough to protect
  any intruders. And she did not even approach the cops too. So yes, the treasure is not in there. And the lie? Saikawa's
  the treasure. Okay, not fan talk haha, but yes, it's on her left eye,
  that sapphire. The two clutch saved her at the last moment when an assassin
  was about to send a crossbow into her left eye with I don't know how we can
  even predict Nagisa suddenly showing off the bad guy's location with a scream from Kimizuka lol (and how is
  the android guy involved in this again isn't that dude in an underground
  prison?), but yeah even if so they barely got hold of the idol on stage before she
  really dies in front of thousands. Well, that is, until we know that is not
  the truth too. Apart from her left eye which was actually given to by her
  parents, and why would you do that unless you yourselves are also evil, the
  eye was also with special powers, entrusted by her parents to this kid right
  here. Yeah yeah, remember this is still sci-fi based of a series so this can
  happen, and yes I can only predict the non sci-fi parts because we don't know
  this world well enough anyways, but suffice it to say Saikawa was with the
  same side as the bad guys, and of course, something fell apart and the bad
  guys now want to target her. Remember that all this time after losing her
  parents and ignoring her fanbase guards lol, she has always been alone. So to
  make a decision to not take sides is an issue, even if it means trying to get
  into the life of this... detective sidekick lol, to ask him for help to
  protect a treasure while exposing herself to danger anyways. That, Kimizuka
  saw through her so yay to the new ultimate detective because Siesta is DEAD
  haha okay no more dead jokes, but yeah, Saikawa then realized she was targeted
  as well. Well, not until Kimizuka convinced her that she has been conned on
  her side as well, trying to set the treasure room up at her mansion to blow
  these two up because the baddies told her to. That's the point man: if the treasure room can
  be blown up then the real treasure can't be in there. Think about it. All in
  all, let me lay down on what I thought of this case before I saw this
  episode, yes? I think I might just do that for all the future arcs going
  forward because you know, where's the fun is watching a mystery series without
  guessing the answer yourself? So, before the left eye reveal. I really thought
  Kimizuka mentioning Saikawa was lying was just due to her taking the enemy
  side only, with the assumption still that the treasure in the room might just
  be a fake which means they can ignore that and find a real culprit in the live
  event. But as soon as the left eye reveal was there, it really became clear to
  me that she was definitely taking the enemy's side, whether on her own accord
  or being threatened, but you know, Kimizuka still managed to save her butt.
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So yeah, so far so fun, I would say, and we are seeing more of the
  worldview as it unfolds with mysteries to solve so it would be unfair on the
  audience's perspective to figure out more so just watching might be more
  surprising instead of second-guessing anything since I'll never figure out the sci-fi references anyways. Talking about guessing, we
  don't have far to talk about how Siesta died, because new character appearance
  here is an acquaintance of Kimizuka after news spread of how he saved an idol
  lol, and might actually talk about Siesta's hand-drawn will for her own foreseen
  death. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Cya guys next week for more of this I guess.</div><div>

  </blockquote>
  O~kay must they put that intro in for every episode now? Goddammit why
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode and you bet I saw Viola in the previews haha she's not in though (#ShinigamiBocchan04), I think sadist eye Alice might be a thing in this
  series haha what. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Man, Bocchan making up his own retorts is ROUGH
  lol. But yeah, one would have guessed, unlike me who is as confused as Rob
  when he asked the butler to touch the maid. Man, what has become of this
  series haha. So, episode. Firstly, the cold. Man, it's going to be winter in a bit but we
  don't have to do that this quick lol. But yeah, it looks like Alice is not
  doing the harassment as often or even any to Bocchan after the night she
  dropped into the lake with him so guess who's feeling ill. But you know, this
  is just another reason to get into her shed... room just because there are NO
  RULES around this house- Boy aren't you glad you are cursed so you can be
  placed somewhere else apart from the main house lmao. And then we learnt it's
  not because of the lake but Alice snooping on Bocchan sleeping... from outside
  of the house when it's snowing lol. Talking about snowing, it's winter time it
  seems so once again this is the South Hemisphere talk now lol, but yeah, gotta
  get the weak af Bocchan out to play in the snow, so guess who made a new scarf
  for him. Nope, not the mother, that will never happen now. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Everyone in
  the mansion ie. the three of them went out to play in the snow as it happens,
  and we get to see like, Alice's super dodge skill as if she was a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>
  herself (yes this is a very subtle "BLEACH" reference lol), dodging all the
  snowballs from Bocchan and letting him get hit so bad he's probably going to
  drop dead in the snow. But man did they play outside for a while, and as the
  sun sets on the cold day Alice then found out she lost her earrings which were
  given from her mother ie. head maid at the main house who I believe she's still
  around lol, and she probably wouldn't even step out considering the fierce winds
  out there at night. So, Bocchan did the gentlemanly thing by braving the snow,
  digging out layers of white stuff just to find himself... a dead body because
  remember how I mentioned he was weak? Haha okay me shout out to myself there
  anyways lol. Anyways, cue new character appearance who is technically not here
  to save his life but here for shelter and food, half witch half female human
  <strike>Cuff</strike> <strike>Caph</strike> Cuff (lol official website is this
  though lol
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/178092/Caph" target="_blank">fan site</a>), who saw him drop dead in the snow. Well, she was nice enough to help him
  out, and Bocchan let her in with some food so he can ask her about witches
  while we're at it, I guess. Sadly, she isn't much of help as apart from her
  being ostracised by the humans and being hunted which explains why she is out alone with her buddy who we will of course see soon I hope, she also is rather
  novice in skill and doesn't know what evil witches do to little boys
  like him years ago lol how does that sound wrong haha. But yeah, not much of
  help, but I'm sure this will go a long way to get the guy to help us at some
  point. Come on, Bocchan saved her from starvation(?) surely the boyfriend can help- A~nd she
  ran away. Hey, you dumb bitc- uh, I mean, dumb witch! Come back!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> (I
  like how the transformed bat is still head down in shame lol) So yeah, all in
  all a wonderful episode to introduce more people who will be able to help
  Bocchan out on his curse, but we shall see how this goes. Going by how this
  looks... this might take a while because that one literally just bailed so oh
  well cya guys next week haha

  Okay you say Naoya's a weirdo already so why do you want to be her girlfriend
  knowing he has already two? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I will never understand this series lol
  harem by the way. Also, cute voice Ayachi is just too much coming in from a
  married woman- ANYWAYS IN THIS NEW EPISODE haha (#KanoKano05) where we have
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/188637/Nagisa_Natsunagi" target="_blank">Nagisa</a>
  as the ultimate detective haha wait
  <a href="#TanMoshi04">which Anime is this</a> lol, hey how much do you think
  any female needs to convince Naoya to take them in? Haha think about it. So,
  story. I think we have reached another level of effort, since Nagisa has shown
  her efforts in trying to confess to Naoya with her... everything I guess, we
  now have Rika-chan here who we will refer to as Milika since the trio also did
  too, who also wants to be Naoya's girlfriend. But, thanks author, unlike the
  previous confession which the guy did agree on, this one he rejected the heck
  out of even if she appeals so much in front of him, literally, just waving her
  chest in front of him too even. Are we actually going to see a rejection scene
  in this Anime?? Wha-t?? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Nagisa's doesn't count haha this one's the
  real deal now lol. For even with actual trial periods where if we compare to
  Nagisa when she showed her her cooking and her banging body, this one... even
  if the trail period is literally touching her boobs lol, Naoya also gave the
  rejection flag somehow. And as he has mentioned himself too, it's more like "I
  can't get another girlfriend" more than "oh you want to be with me too why not
  join in" type of situation, which means we can technically remove the harem
  tag from this series...? Yeah right haha. Anyways also, she has lesser reason
  as a f**king bimbo on <strike>You</strike> MeTube to be with him, mainly due
  to showing of effort that Nagisa has gone through and I doubt Milika here will
  forsake her current career to be with this guy, and without a childhood
  friend context this is going to be rough. Yes, like their current abode grass
  patch type of rough haha. So yeah, pretty assertive, this Milika girl. So
  assertive, she decides to live on their grass patch lol yep you heard me. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So
  yes, this is the putting in effort part of the episode where we see Milika
  actually relentlessly or maybe desperately wants a boyfriend seeing there is
  quite a good one here and don't ask me why she doesn't have one up till now
  lol streamer problems(?), actually set up house in their backyard to convince
  the guy to be with her? I mean, you can hardly make a dent on him if you are
  literally "outside" his social circle since those two can just wear swimsuits and walk
  in while he's bathing- Wait, they did?? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay that aside though, it is
  definitely a joy because I <strike>sweat</strike>&nbsp;(yeah as in her
  sweating from working out all night) swear the author knows what fun it will
  be for her to be suffering in May rainy season weather outside alone in a tent
  fighting bugs and doing exercise while doing videos while she's at it
  blatantly showing off her cleavage- Am I really writing down all of this?
  <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Man, so thanks to the support of her fanbase she managed to survive a
  night and get more supplies so she can literally camp outside Naoya's life in
  order to get him to fall in love with her. Man, this is dumb; Really should've
  called the cops on her for trespassing. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, I would say this
  is a wonderful episode as much as I also know how screwed up this is at its
  principle so much so that Saki-chan has to walk in to the bathroom to show
  the guy her nipples- Okay not that haha as in, discuss on how to deal with
  this bimbo of a fourth person no one wants to be in a relationship with lol. So yes, I
  actually liked the stark contrast in attitude compared to Naoya's previous
  experiences with women which will naturally make this series even funnier
  than it should've been, as much as also, how screwed up it is because just
  like how much Milika is going to extreme lengths to get the only dude in this
  series to like her lol, we're also presented with ridiculous scenarios for the
  characters to make sure you remember how awkward it must have been while
  recording the voices in the studio. No really, thanks
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/186043/Rika_Hoshizaki" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana</a>
  for everything up till now. Haha cya guys next week for more of this I guess
  but yes it is rather clear that she will be the so-called "relationship dump"
  as far as we are concerned and I'm sorry in advance Milika-san for everything
  you have to do because who doesn't some TITTIES!!! Okay I'm putting up
  the rated ban on this blog haha

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Okay now I don't even know what to make of this episode haha and we are just
  starting, guys. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode where we likely have another
  world rule that is taking form (#SonnyBoy03), people are now reported missing.
  Again, I would like to emphasize on how much of this is a growing thing for
  most of the teens here so wink wink, it's like we don't know the idea of
  seclusion from society, but hear me out, this is the Anime that'll talk about
  it figuratively. So, what happened. And I'll try not to talk about society in
  reality too much and how much it's screwing us up to being human haha. So, it's the second person who was found frozen in place lol yep no one
  even bothered about the first one until it was mentioned during the gathering,
  but yeah, sounds like a problem they needed to solve even if it's just one of
  the world's rules. And since Mizuho is so free, literally, of time because now
  everyone has to work in order to get some digital cash and buy stuff from her lol capitalism talk basically right here the rich get richer, she... decides
  to help in the investigation or else the Student Council will probably
  strangle her grandmother's cats or something lol. What they found out though,
  is that despite the victims held in place with a black shadow, they can be
  heard doing stuff if you stand close enough, implying that they may not be
  dead but "trapped" in another dimension. Looking back, we are about a month
  into this phenomenon which is Satan's death game in school lol, the guys have
  been trying to find the point Nozomi was pointing to using her superpowers but
  to no result even runner Asakaze is getting sick of it because he can't see any of this for shit, and of course Nagara who apparently can identify portals to other
  world which may, of course, bring them back to reality, or so we think.
  Putting two and two together, it would seem like they have identified the
  cause and a familiar resemblance to what they have found in the audio
  visual room while they were finding portals in the school itself: secluded
  black curtain worlds where one could do what they like. Yes, among reasons
  provided by the victims as they were found out, they listed seclusion from the
  group and no intention to work as reasons for their "disappearance", if that
  is any surprise to you. But what is probably more surprising is how they
  resolved this. Because really, first time for now, I have not understood what
  is happening. They just... blew the curtains to the dimension up and over??
  Someone please explain to be like I'm five what is happening right here lol I
  guess it's removing the barrier literally to increase inclusion of community?
  That's what they were going for I think? If it is though, it's a fresh idea,
  to say the least. I just don't get it haha. So, all in all, don't ask me questions about this Anime
  anymore I can't answer them lol find the scriptwriter and ask him instead
  haha, but yeah, I would like to bring attention to what is happening soon,
  with Pony that Student Council girl holding on to a dimension pullover. Yeah,
  evil things are happening and we know it. Yes, also with Nozomi's conversation
  with Hoshi, the one I suspect is probably one of the bad guys in this series,
  but we can't be for sure until we see it happen. Or maybe we won't even.
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/1086/Sousuke_Aizen" target="_blank">Illusion</a>, guys, is the hardest thing to see happen because quite literally, we might
  be already in one. Yeah, think about it. So yeah, we shall see how it unfolds lol the curtains, for it is only getting more interesting and confusing at the
  same time. You know it's good if I didn't spend time to type anything here
  beforehand haha you won't know I did it behind the black curtains haha bye
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Okay if you want a drop on this from my perspective, think of the
  rules of this world as rejecting brutal honesty because notice that Mizuho
  might be rich and smug but is not trapped in a world of her own. From this to
  trading without return this world is effectively revealing and throwing out
  all the honest opinions of life]</div><div>

  [I appreciate Mizuho with the total reality talk about capitalism man THIS is
  what happens when you are rich and have power haha I'm with Nagara though if
  you rich you can just give stuff out for free why make people work? If you
  hate work what makes you think others will like it also this is not reality so

  Wow I almost forgot about this and went to bed haha so let's recall what I listened to this week before we reset for new songs for the month, yes? <b>Anime "Shinigami Bocchan" single</b> released this week came with another song apart from the two theme songs which is kind of ironic but then again I did give two but even then I probably won't give the third one mainly because is just "I love you Bocchan" which is kind of cringe so no thanks I guess haha. Also I don't review Anime releases so yeah. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> On other songs, <a href="https://twitter.com/gotch_akg/status/1419649451635843072?s=20" target="_blank">Gotch dropped in with a recommendation</a> again but ironically I liked the second song in the list instead of the lead song which had a music video and that is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/the-extended-mind-bedside-single/1576290856?l=en" target="_blank">Bearwear's new single</a></b> which is also in bandcamp which means you can donate any amount which is what I saw from his Tweet. Really doesn't sound bad though, so may our paths pass again, guys. Also, I took some listen to recent live festivals now that they are kind of opened for now (see what happens after the Olympics they gonna have lockdown lol) so yeah took a listen to literally Yogee New Waves rival <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/yashinoki-house/988344952?l=en" target="_blank">never young beach's 1st album</a></b>&nbsp;back in 2015 and their most popular (summer) song, and maybe if I can't wait for the former's new album to appear by the end of September maybe I'll find more of the latter's songs to listen. Ironic, because both under the same music label too with the same style- How do they even make money? Maybe they trying to corner the market here? Haha I guess so</div><div>
  <br />
  On news concerning Twitter and it's music-related so forgive me for talking about Anime I have to, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/tanteiwamou_/status/1421487062876758018?s=20" target="_blank">Kaguranana's new song</a></b> which is ending theme for Anime "TanMoshi" is out in full on digital so it's this and the opening theme which we will have to wait until end of August which I don't mind to be honest, I probably repeated this but&nbsp;<b><a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1421380359552262146?s=20" target="_blank">ClariS' new single releases in September</a></b> is for Anime again no surprises there, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1421047930774073344?s=20" target="_blank">Earphones' most voted song on Twitter got a free limited time preview</a></b> of the song on YouTube which well I have watched before last year but then again an earlier live version of the same song was on the same channel so we are not really losing out but really go listen to it before the video disappears, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1421047918476374023?s=20" target="_blank">Kitou Akari's 1st live tour footage is premiering on YouTube</a></b> in a couple of days following her upcoming concept album, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1420519438152048643?s=20" target="_blank">SHE'S new song</a></b> is for a movie so yay more songs for their album due December anyways, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1420519798761398276?s=20" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</a></b> is a meh to be honest, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_mu/status/1420308119490465799?s=20" target="_blank">Yogee New Waves' new album is due September</a></b> so man am I excited already, and finally <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1419478869011173376?s=20" target="_blank">ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new song is for a new movie</a></b> of Anime "Boku no Hero Academia" which is interesting to see their rise again after quite a quiet time before their 25th anniversary, and will be in their upcoming single releasing next week. Personally more excited for Yogee New Waves to be honest since never young beach can only carry me this far... hehe HYPE haha<br />
  <br />
  So for next week, we have a couple of releases to talk about, which are besides that Anime "TanMoshi" ending song there is of course <b>Kitou Akari's concept album</b> which I hope it doesn't disappoint I just followed your official music Twitter account lol, and <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</b> in about 2 years, so I'm expecting some good... returns next week haha I may be wrong it's 2021 man anything can happen lol<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  I may not even watch the Anime "Mieru-ko" when it comes out next season but I
  probably will now, because of
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teQqkvjYA18&amp;t=3214s" target="_blank">their pre-broadcast livestream</a>&nbsp;(link is timestamped) starring freak-out Amamiya Sora because ma girl
  Hondo Kaede is ambivalent to horror and is not scared of bugs. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>
  Goddamn the camera literally cut out at the wrong time haha Ten-chan losing it
  is always a sight to behold lol. Also also, I just spent just now reading up on another Inorin-based Anime "<a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1421668470500954116?s=20" target="_blank">Aharen-san wa Hakarenai</a>" featuring her as a little weird girl- Why does she always voice those <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/144908/Aurora_Suya_Rhys_Kaymin" target="_blank">she did one last year</a>! Haha maybe she's just perfect to voice these lol also the problem with this normal romance Anime is that, communicating with this girl is like talking to aliens in space, just that she actually replies. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And hey looks like I'm giving you another one, author of Anime "Denkigai no Honya-san" haha that one was actually good too if the Senpai's confession from her ex isn't the best part I can't even convince you to watch it anymore. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... man I can talk about Anime for days... provided I have someone to talk about with haha I should start doing so huh lol bye<br />
</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Okay I seriously need to stop haha Chapter 10 by the way just nice end of Volume 1 so yeah let's forget this and fall in love with "Aharen-san" again next year, yeah? Good haha</div>
