Bad news is, probably won't be in time for use when my cousin is holding his wedding ceremony end of next month. Oh well, not that I'm one of the limited 50 guests important.</div><div><br></div><div>...</div><div><br></div><div>ANYWAYS, we have marriage stories to talk about this week specifically, from Anime "Tonikaku Kawaii" because their aforementioned OVA is out now, and ironically where Japan has to buy the physical copy to watch, the international audience gets to see it through streaming platforms. It's kind of a trend now huh, sooner or later the Japanese will realize how much they have been disadvantaged because they still believe in a Sony. Blu-Ray, I mean. Haha let's talk about story, yes?</div><div><br></div><div>On other things that matter to me because that's all I care now... the package might have to split in half again next month. Fingers crossed, if I can even make them all into one order. Help me save money, Japan. I have to pay taxes next year to not you guys already haha<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TanMoshi07><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"But this (detective outfit) was handed down from Siesta" Yeah okay Siesta when did you even wear this lol</div></blockquote>Man, they gotta keep burning Alicia with the she's seven<strike>teen</strike> jokes huh. Well, so will I if you don't mind <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where Alicia is Siesta now but seriously she will never replace her <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (#TanMoshi07) we... I don't think we deserve an episode quite like this. Wholesome content in THIS Anime series? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yes, I think we do have. So, story. Remember last episode where Siesta got injured, so she has to stay in a motel or something? But instead of being protected by Kimizuka who can't even hold for himself, he has to babysit literally, that new girl he found on the streets. Because apparently, Fuubi-san dropped by their abode and talked about finding the "Eye of Sapphire" which, if you can remember, is at this point not three years ago, is in Saikawa Yui's possession. We will talk about why the sudden drop of this because even last week me was doubtful of this, but yeah, Kimizuka just literally let an injured detective stay indoors prone to attackers while he takes care of a kid... we don't even know if she's a kid. Probably will be a problem in the future haha all kids are problems lmao, but looks like even after a bunch of searching, that sapphire was nowhere to be found on the streets. Yep, no shit, "detective". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What we did get out of this though, is after two weeks of doing this making Kimizuka a proud father lol, the mother finally recovered (lmao) and you know, I guess the finding of the sapphire isn't that important anymore haha. I mean, who cares, dude? Which brings us to the second part of this episode: drunk Siesta. Yes, I never thought we will talk about this at length, but looks like we can now we got permission to do that lol haha what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, I'll probably watch that whole part again, but looks like Siesta can't hold a drink ie. 10 glasses of wine lmao, and you know, Kimizuka had to babysit her now lol. But trust me, you would rather not babysit some kid who we don't even know her age but still knows of shame and women's instinct like a seven<strike>teen</strike> year old lol, than this beautiful woman with a cute face, an actual rack, and a drunk demeanour you wouldn't even mind sticking your tip in on the bed at the dead of night. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Okay, this is as clean as I can make this sound, but yes, this is very good fap material will come back to watch this part again. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I like the mention of their supposed BDSM relationship where Siesta's the sadist and I'm the masochist pig lol, but yeah, as they wake up in the next morning on the same bed... thankfully not both naked so that's good news, but you know, Siesta woke up and... wanted to make sure last night did not exist. I would argue though, give Kimizuka such memories so he can't cheat on you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Please, as an assistant. I know he wouldn't go for Hel as her sidekick, but you know, just in case it becomes some form of competition. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (You think Hel has rack? I don't remember lol) Talk about competition, they may have lost at some point because apart from lacking behind in investigations of Hel's whereabouts and stopping her from whatever she wants to do with the Bible lol, Fuubi-san also contacted them from I assume Japan, asking about their progress. Yes, Fuubi. That policewoman. Who did not appear at their abode to talk about a specific sapphire. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Someone was doing a transformation, yes, if you wondered. Which only makes me believe that that werewolf dude probably did not die, and he's still doing the Ripper stuff. Or well, maybe it's not true now, now that we have been literally deceived, but the problem is then, was what Hel? Was Hell at their doorstep at one time? (Yes, intentional character there, not spelling mistake) Hey, gotta watch to find out. But I'm just glad there was the beach episode and this one night stand without Alicia because how else you going to review this Anime series? 10/10 Anime of the year haha Siesta~!!</div><div>[TL:DR; Dude, isn't the bed talk as good as some <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/47669/Saki_Miyashita target=_blank>Miyashita Saki</a> ASMR content? *Hmm* I think she got me again haha]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1666 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDqgRgcK8lqyNxkn4DTR3cEKGo1xUPbskTi_wdyv4sL5Rav3dGTEhUxlfXl7s5ZA5n8ssWNCUCUvIEiVNXaEsfhimzpDryOryuGIHCVyr_DxxaLKbzdjguMr6n6n243Ielg1Wu7WHmG7_Io_lPZJF7MWuCjG3xxMOhEQFI4NS3Y8fPQA/s417/tanmoshi07_couple1.jpg width=417><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You see, it is a very fine line between helping a detective and realizing it's babysitting lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTF8ubY2APn4peYRBwnfhDXjlmp5Jgv1cqnqkxoVdrWhl-YHDpQONCPIeg7qHsSJuPxFSHbE4rUdmgWZda6qrwda6CdR8h-uE_S7nXOh6UFkY2fEN2pRj7P-I0W8V01Jeb_dx3to6c6r18KEGMcdmE7Gp5HKUYzb7-Rj7tgqoij4a_1g/s320/tanmoshi07_bouncing.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The bed scene is so good I'm glad my memory is wiped after I clip this GIF haha wait</table></div></div>P.S.

In this new episode though (#ShinigamiBocchan07) we still have gratuitous boob shots haha, magic apparently, and Viola-chan haha yes let's talk all about them. Firstly, a magic pot? Alice thought it'll be great to test out anything and everything considering they hit the dead end on Bocchan's curse last week, so yeah, I guess this is the only part that is maybe plot progression lol. So yeah, ironically, the pot is kind of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ojisan target=_blank>ojisan</a> and horny so I guess don't ask what the commands have to do with the cooking, but just that you should also wonder how Bocchan can manage to be deceived by Alice to think that they aren't making a potion of sorts to remove his curse but making what, a love potion? Haha okay sure Bocchan make a love potion and try to touch your girl then BOOM GOT'EM lol. Moving on, they did try out that formula to make some concoction that'll supposedly remove the curse, but as I used that one word you would have guessed that it probably tasted as badly as it would have worked, so yeah. Gotta try out anything now that our only line of hope is gone, isn't it? Hey, maybe consider like, soul transportation to another body? That'll solve the problem maybe haha. And since the pot is effectively useless other than be a comedic bit now lol, Bocchan gave the pot to Rob, in which the pot got immediately interested in- Like seriously, why is everyone attracted to Rob? Come on butler, leave some p*ssy for us, man. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Audience: You mean some Viola p*ssy-) (Please don't get me banned thanks) (lol) Next up, Alice found a book or should I say, manuscript which may help them with the curse (I'm being real ambiguous here) which involves a ghost MacFarlene who is comparable to Zain's level of perverseness on Alice considering he's probably stuck to this book for centuries and was waiting for someone to play his final piece when he lived, so that yes, you may have guessed it, MacFarlene here can be rid of its curse. So not Bocchan's. Okay. Haha what a waste of time. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Yes, this tune will be in the soundtrack haha) Maybe that's what made the people who play this tune go crazy, this ghost going all around and whining about people not playing his music properly lol. Then, maybe this is the uneventful part of the episode, where we talk about whatever suspension bridge effect courtesy of the Viola Method lol, yeah but suffice it to say anything to scare Alice would just be Rob catering to Viola's affections ie. nothing will work haha. *gets punched by Viola* From scary stories to scary paintings hung up which ended up scaring Bocchan, Alice did not even flinch so that's not very fun haha girls are supposed to be scared, man. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What did make her flinch though, was the breaking of the vase in which Rob warned of its importance in relation to this former main mansion, was probably furious at Bocchan breaking it and got him into hiding from the butler, even if it also revealed the case of stolen jewellery from where it was hidden in. Wow, that was quite a mouthful haha. Good thing thanks to Rob's bad eyesight and hearing, Bocchan can just play off as sexy Alice and hide under the bed to avoid the butler for now lol, and what's even better, Alice is joining him on this haha ah hey I also like cramped places wait what. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Last but not least though, is from another trip to the library because apparently there are a lot of magical stuff there don't ask me why there is no solution to the curse, but this time, it's the Alice from that Wonderland we know of asking to find her rabbit, in, you guessed it, dreamland which means both Alice and Bocchan are in a dream world. Between all the hype and excitement of being able to do physicals on each other lol I knew the kissing scene would be cut out, but yeah they did not care about getting the rabbit though that's actually a lot of fun even in my opinion, just why must that book's Alice be such a b*tch- All in all haha, wonderful episode which I must say, you can dump me as many of these slice-of-life stories I don't even mind sitting through, but I have to say I kind of miss Zain and Cuff. Especially Cuff. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Sorry Alice haha cya guys next week for more not removing curse stories I guess</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCHl7hyphenhyphen9DMIB7iCYtWeXd-MUvPuaOS3IoQeteV9V9aq-obHz-g3wXmhoaH1hC4Mi2HcXPNjP6o4wGQE6PY6yzF5M8qccVkQ3grAXSQPYG8pE8yU4xi03WMVejh34O0WhTw5B-7zn4pAZoNBPgBwvb7RNfTdMhebRYKecdb_76qon0uMw/s320/shinigamibocchan07_aalice2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I like how this Alice has personality you know would exist on an Alice in Wonderland spinoff</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDvcUlMJI7UqFj3KDyj7ElfYfF4LXxQyg1G1eX8sN2qvtjlFB9oOPLavUhiVGrBCKWGfcSgdXR7SyxWjywiRaDSEhrOWsLTD5E6plquna8S-mxNGMW4X5ChCV8dyykuY-8A5YWGGcBvhWtE28GgCI_Elbsd_OSONLYIvlLaQXFbVsjIg/s320/shinigamibocchan07_malfarlene2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This sick af composer is literally Bocchan's inner pervert haha</table></div></div>P.S.

So yeah, this whole episode in general. Milika is aggressive, Saki-chan is trying real hard to make sure that doesn't happen in school but it has not been easy. Because in a land of opportunity, unless you are inside each other <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (<span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> lol) it's not possible to be occupying someone all the time in any relationship you know, even for the duration of school or how else are you gonna lesson. But that is what Saki-chan is intending to do as part of her extreme methods to make sure Milika-san doesn't stand any, and I mean ANY chance, of getting her hands on this idiot whom she just recently fell in love with lol. And Saki-chan is only continuing to win because besides Nagisa not being able to interfere since we have drawn the line of the act in school, we can also hear the moans from her in class because Naoya just can't let go of her- This Anime is the best. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I gotta admit though, that sounds great but man, if your teacher even allows your girl to sit on your lap while in lessons, please do tell I gotta report the teach. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, this went on all day in school without even a moment in ease haha maybe at least when Milika has to be in lessons like everyone else so they can probably go to the toilet individually at that time, but not even when they had to change for PE lessons apparently. Yeah, we're going that far haha. I see Saki-chan you're going with the "f**k you b*tch" method by bringing your boy to change clothes in not the restrooms- 20/10 Best Anime of the century lmao. Also, it's in the AV room so I hope the mic is on HAHAHAHA ignoring that, but yeah, did we just end up with the "you watch me change" portion of this porno- This series is LITERALLY A PORNO lol more on that later, but it looks like Saki-chan's genuine concern is worrying that she can't win Milika in looks by any mile if Naoya really falls for her to any extent... Yes you're right Naoya; She is lonely. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> More importantly though, thanks to Nagisa with the assist and we can't deserve her more for being such a supportive role <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, she managed to distract Milika away such that they can at least get the changing stuff going and not make this end up being a strip tease or something lmao. (Seriously how did I totally wipe my memory of Anime "OsaMake" after watching Sakura Ayane in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/186041/Saki_Saki target=_blank>this role</a> haha) Then, we have ultimate occupancy Part 2 it seems. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Since you know, in school <strike>Sakura Ayane</strike> Saki-chan did have her way with Naoya, of course, as a distraction to make sure that easy big boobs (lol) doesn't take advantage(?) of the boy at any point, then had to end up allowing the other girlfriend to, you know, get her daily cuddles from her boy I guess- What Anime am I watching haha. So yeah, the worst part is, because the author also has such a fetish I suppose, they had to let Saki-chan watch them embrace just like how, I guess, Nagisa is likely watching those two on each other (lol) in school haha. So yeah, how f**ked up can this series get? Well, I think it's already overboard once we have to let Saki-chan explain her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/netorare target=_blank>netorare</a> fetish here haha NTR4LYFE baby, but yeah, we are 8 episodes in I'm sure Saki-chan loves jacking off to other girls doing it with his guy- OKAY MOVING ON haha, we have some plot progression with regards to Milika's advances, I would say. At this point it seems Rika-chan is already trying to walk with him to school despite the existence of the girlfriend in the way, and man is it getting irritating to even walk home with the dude, so instead of letting him be because why would you lol have you read the write-up above so far haha, she, and I guess Nagisa is here for the ride, has to <strike>deceive</strike> <strike>brainwash</strike> dupe him into believing that (1) Milika does not have a crush on him because why would you love someone who has two girlfriends lol and (2) Milika is just being a horny b*tch just because- Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Problem is though, that besides Naoya thinking that the latter is like a womens' period thing so it's tough and maybe he would think of helping Milika out which is only going to make things worse imo, he also then thought he misunderstood that Milika, in fact, is having a crush on this dude. Yep, I think you get an idea now haha. To that, I think we did end with an actual drop here, to be honest. We are going to have the most retarded confession/rejection* (*Cancel where applicable) of all time maybe haha. So, all in all, man this Anime continues to impress. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, for the comedy bits, 10/10, trust me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You... may have to understand what NTR means first though haha but hey, once you get over those technical knowledge, you'll love this series just like how much Naoya likes... everyone apparently haha. But yeah, great episode to go on, and I really wonder how much ridiculous this can go remember the friend Shino-chan hasn't joined in on this, but I'm glad the author is so smart, he can make every turn in this maze of love have a clown standing by at the corner ready to jump scare us. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "Please don't three time us, Master!"

LOL quote of the Anime season from Nagara haha</div></blockquote>Did this island just become a boot camp with Aki-sensei? Haha I knew it those boobs were deceiving as heck, immediately saw through that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#SonnyBoy06) we may have more things to worry, because besides the fact that the student body has been split into factions following the slew of events we have seen last episode, we... might not even be real. Yeah, the Anime production dropping us this reality might have been the real joke, besides whatever God's joke in leaving these students in here. So, keeping in a spoiler-free analysis for as long as I can haha, let's talk about what happened. It has been two months since last episode after the fallout of Aki-sensei and her gang with Asakaze, against Hoshi's group of innocent students and there's Nagara and the others including Bill Nye, it looks like the latter group of the latter group (lol) ie. Nagara and the others, were travelling from world to world to avoid getting found out to, you know, I don't know, get punished? Hey, don't ask me what is the sentence for not being obedient in these worlds already haha because in our case, we finally get to see Hoshi's role in this series. Good thing he's not the <em>actual</em> antagonist haha sorry for last week bro, but the idea is that in his talk with what is supposedly the perpetrator which we will refer to again later, Hoshi's job is just to save them. These students. From what specifically? I must say, from disaster. Yes, that's why there's the concept of building an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hakobune target=_blank>Ark</a> as I've learnt this word from a song title (<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/noahs-ark/1358089461?i=1358089470&amp;l=en" target=_blank>thanks yucat</a>!), and him being like, the Student Council level trusting role as likely what the perpetrator assigned him as, so think of him now as the balance portion of all this drifting. Doesn't mean he's good guy in general, and him taking sides is just helpful to whoever he believes in, apart from what his job is here in the first place. Next up, Bill Nye's solution in bringing them back to the real world, with Nagara. So turns out, Nagara is <em>amazing</em> haha we know that already he's way better than me lol, but yeah, the two end up in a world of films, supposedly, taken from Nagara's perspective. And with some light editing just like some YouTuber's joke, <strike>we can also be content creators with millions of subscribers</strike> we can change the contents of the footage and thus, supposedly change the future. We can't change the past though, that is still a no go. Even so, this led Bill Nye to think that it is possible to like, copy paste themselves into say, their school footage years ago, to teleport themselves into reality. Well, that's the idea, and they had to test it out. Problem is, Asakaze and the others might be catching up to them. If you haven't paid attention because of Aki-sensei's rack haha, with Asakaze and his... how to say, nature manipulating powers mostly wind-based, along with the sensei and her, you heard it, relativity powers...? Hey, no one said about having a teacher around before. Which brings us to one thing before we talk about the confrontation. <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/200614/Yamabiko target=_blank>Tsuda Kenjirou</a>- Excuse me, that dog of a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Trust me, you'll recognize his voice in popular Anime series so well you thought you were the dog lol what) The Nagara crew found him or well, Mizuho found him hanging around in the worlds and wondered what this dude is doing here considering (1) he's not in the same class as them not even same era he graduated when these kids came in and (2) why he's a dog. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> The second one isn't that simple but we shall leave that that as is now, but as from his statement which shall I guess be our reference for now, he mentioned that ONLY STUDENTS were adrift in this world and... we know who the bad guy is. Who God is. Okay, which is why I had to refer to the devil previously mentioned as God now, because now we know the identity, for better or for worse. Coincidentally, it's the principal of the school. I'll talk about why in the conclusion later, but suffice it to say... I'm mostly right, in thinking that this is someone's joke, in putting students in this world and never to be able to go back just because. But there's more than that. From the senpai recognizing Aki-sensei being an exception to the world's rules (so yes Aki-sensei is likely a senpai of this school... some years ago lol), to how Nagara can manage to manipulate this much of the worlds until they really managed to teleport into reality as they know of... this series is already making my headache worse every week haha. I thought this was over, but turns out, they were not in the actual reality, as they can see themselves in graduation which is already kind of weird especially with Nozomi missing lol how did she die anyways, but also, that nothing has changed even if they WERE teleported back to reality. Meaning, yes, the tables have turned, people. Those people in the reality they travelled to? They were the real ones. As mentioned by the principal which looks like a total Einstein lookalike and I wouldn't be surprised if he is a descendant living in Japan lmao (According to the official website he is just a manifestation of the "voice" we have heard that is the so-called God- Can we put the lor "inside" the show please?), they were chosen to be in an experiment it seems, mirroring the roles of the characters in reality. Yep, we're in this level of a psychological thriller, people. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, think back on Aki-sensei talking about the world being preserved because they can't really escape it anyways, and how that dog senpai talked about how he was already trapped here for an estimated 5000 years. Yeah, we in this sh*thole now. Haha okay jokes aside, I only continue to ponder on things such as why would the Anime production make such a terrible joke even for an Anime original lmao, and why did the principal of the school wanted to do such an experiment? What does he get out of this? If it's like, a growing up story where then he can paste these souls back into reality to help them grow that sounds like an unorthodox method, but I can't think of anything else. And no, this series is only halfway there, it has NOT ended, so I wonder what else can they come up with now. Will they be stuck in here forever ending up like the senpai(s) who have been here since the start of time? Or how did the principal even have these powers? Who knows? I won't say it's God because it's a lazy explanation, but hey, Nagara can be God, whatever.

An industry first or blessing RIGHT from the start haha ah hey don't ask what my marital status is because I already lost to these guys lol. In this special episode though (#ToniKawaOVA) I don't think this is from the original but I think even so it has a special message to deliver: when you are married you can do whatever you want at night. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, sorry, I'll try this again. "Even with social media it can never compare to loneliness away from our partners". Yes, this. *Phew* Haha okay, let's talk about what happened. Of course, we have a showcase of all the characters in this series so far, and we shall touch on all of them. With the introduction of Tsukasa the wife having a smartphone, this will be much easier to start with. Nasa-kun the husband finally got her a phone after a bucket list of things to help her settle down into her new home, he helped her set it up because ask a woman to set up a smartphone because she can't (lol misogynist joke), and Tsukasa had a great time exchanging LINE information with everyone in the bathhouse... which is within the same premises because this is still the part where they got their apartment burnt down after their trip to see his astronaut parents lol. Yeah, if you would recall the couple was staying at the back room for a while until the tenant can get another apartment built. So, from seeing the sisters at the bathhouse (shoutout to <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8BYKVkvdHL0tBl5tcyEpC2-FoOxpsfrpOS26Ye2B3tkUvTc_XrMKWewXXpt0hoj4BUs7zmkmtzRCSNbAKNDoiIBVdUxOQe4xcIuhL7G20OsYMrSbtBUctL9q-OPevo7GbM2mAyhObQ3Zs6OnEW0FbCy8HozOH8QVmY4SNKwZCbrvxrA/s320/hanakokun09_daikon.jpg target=_blank>ero-daikon</a> haha you know which Anime I'm talking about), to seeing Tsukasa work at the place and Nasa-kun having to work on his previous workplace just because... it's nothing but memories to talk about, for each and every one of them. Kaname is such a bossy pants haha, that gamer <a href=https://jisho.org/search/anesan target=_blank>ane-san</a> doesn't want to go to school lol <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/179344/Aya_Arisugawa target=_blank>Sumipe</a> do you even know what Resident Evil is (also referred to as Biohazard in Japan), someone was eavesdropping on their conversation we'll talk about that later... it's just life as normal in the world of "ToniKawa". But yeah, Nasa-kun going out all day and leaving Tsukasa alone seems to be the problem. Because despite giving her a phone and the husband being contactable, doesn't mean that you know, he will be readily available to accept all your messages for starters, and yeah, Tsukasa is me struggling with sending messages when I got my first smartphone... almost 8 years ago wow haha. I mean, I don't care now I just spam stickers lol oh not to my partner I still don't have one <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Anyways haha, but yeah, the episode is definitely highlighting on Tsukasa feeling so lonely despite the presence of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/SNS target=_blank>SNS</a> in her life right now, as she still really craves her husband's company even with all the messages sent to her telling her to sleep first and he may not be done until the next morning. It was around 4AM when he was done, and as tired Nasa-kun went home to see the wife still awake, they, uh... I guess Kaname is right in that they had fun that night haha wasn't Nasa-kun tired?? AHAHAHAHAHA oh well the maid from Chitose's mansion heard of it so welp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Well, thankfully they didn't do much other than the usual make-out lol even Episode 12 was more intense than this) (Okay maybe not because of the saliva? <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span>) So yeah, just as a finale, we took a look at the maids and specifically Chitose because you know, why talk about the newly wed couple but not talk about <strike>their obstinate mother</strike> <strike>their guardian</strike> their annoying (step)sister-in-law. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Besides seeing some fanservice that probably won't get me on because no rack haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, more importantly it looks like at least from this perspective Chitose is less concerned about the stuff they do at night as a wedded couple so good for them, right? All in all, a nice episode to have, I'm sorry Japan for paying so much for this OVA because we didn't it was on streaming services <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> (well they are the driver of sales and a season two so), but suffice it to say I missed this series. It has the feels different from many romance series I've watched over the past decade, and it will continue to live on as a series to remember. If there was a season two though, then I guess they will talk about Tsukasa's hidden identity, in case <a href="https://twitter.com/4_4n_aka/status/1376914259808972802?s=20" target=_blank>their Anime official Twitter</a> haven't <a href="https://twitter.com/hatakenjiro/status/1397780107842916355?s=20" target=_blank>dropped enough hints</a> for you <a href="https://twitter.com/hatakenjiro/status/1420919181243928577?s=20" target=_blank>from the author</a>...

Still, quite a few notable releases I've reviewed, so here's to reminding myself to pick some male vocals this year to even out that survey for the Song Awards haha. Anyways, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%94%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%95%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF-single/1579010633?l=en" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new single</a></b> is... sadly not on my shelf which should also make her a Collection Artist, but I guess the B-side did NOT get me so no thanks. I mean composer for that song, you heard of the B-sides of Mocho's singles? Yeah, I want those. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E7%A5%9E%E7%84%A1-kanna-ep/1574302173?l=en" target=_blank>miwa's new single</a></b> is also disappointing, and I didn't even bother to give irregular melodies and closed one eye giving the B-side... miwa-san, please tell me there's more to you than oldies. I want something new, and I don't mean credited tunes, please. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/nebula/1579813254?l=en" target=_blank>Ueda Reina's new album</a></b> probably took the spotlight this week, but that doesn't mean I was lenient with her just because I knew of her songs from last year, but more of I could find something to listen despite her soft voice and... rather weak release overall in terms of emotion. Also, Pop tunes, too much of those. I miss Rock music already lmao</div><br>On news concerning Twitter and music and unless I come up with sub titles on each paragraph I'll have to write this paragraph's intro lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/suisei_hosimati/status/1429094657049317381?s=20" target=_blank>VTuber Hoshimachi Suisei's new music video</a></b> for her upcoming album and particularly got me to watch it just because the limited edition release features a Making Of video of the music video which also means this is not just any animated cut, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1429041846844497921?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL is releasing another single end September</a></b> as with what they did for the rest of the year so far which no doubt I will give a listen to see if the one song is worthy of my shelf, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1428703375227383814?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's THE FIRST TAKE performance on YouTube</a></b> features a song I've lived to remember since 2012, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1428342943195099139?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</a></b> is for their <strike>album</strike> single next week so we'll talk about it at length then, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1428295688056500235?s=20" target=_blank>Earphones' new music video</a></b> for their concept album next month is uh... very them haha they be starting with introductions already, I think I may just drop by <a href="https://twitter.com/nanoripe_info/status/1427088979015344130?s=20" style=font-weight:bold target=_blank>nano.RIPE's YouTube live next month</a> for their 11th anniversary, <a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1429433519193812995?s=20" target=_blank><b>Primary expanded their music library</b></a> on Apple Music with an album I've never heard before lol, and...
