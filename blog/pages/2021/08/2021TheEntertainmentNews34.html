    Haha hey I've done so many intros I'm just coming up with something
    different lol
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Yep, if you need great news, I've become a
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/normie" target="_blank">normie</a> by
      (okay not like, go outdoors but) taking the vaccine that the world is in
      fear of a pandemic of. Bad news is, probably won't be in time for use when
      my cousin is holding his wedding ceremony end of next month. Oh well, not
      that I'm one of the limited 50 guests important.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>...</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      ANYWAYS, we have marriage stories to talk about this week specifically,
      from Anime "Tonikaku Kawaii" because their aforementioned OVA is out now,
      and ironically where Japan has to buy the physical copy to watch, the
      international audience gets to see it through streaming platforms. It's
      kind of a trend now huh, sooner or later the Japanese will realize how
      much they have been disadvantaged because they still believe in a Sony.
      Blu-Ray, I mean. Haha let's talk about story, yes?
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      On other things that matter to me because that's all I care now... the
      package might have to split in half again next month. Fingers crossed, if
      I can even make them all into one order. Help me save money, Japan. I have
      to pay taxes next year to not you guys already haha<br />

      Man, they gotta keep burning Alicia with the she's seven<strike>teen</strike>
      jokes huh. Well, so will I if you don't mind <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
      where Alicia is Siesta now but seriously she will never replace her <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
      (#TanMoshi07) we... I don't think we deserve an episode quite like this.
      Wholesome content in THIS Anime series? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yes, I think we do
      have. So, story. Remember last episode where Siesta got injured, so she
      has to stay in a motel or something? But instead of being protected by
      Kimizuka who can't even hold for himself, he has to babysit literally,
      that new girl he found on the streets. Because apparently, Fuubi-san
      dropped by their abode and talked about finding the "Eye of Sapphire"
      which, if you can remember, is at this point not three years ago, is in
      Saikawa Yui's possession. We will talk about why the sudden drop of this
      because even last week me was doubtful of this, but yeah, Kimizuka just
      literally let an injured detective stay indoors prone to attackers while
      he takes care of a kid... we don't even know if she's a kid. Probably will
      be a problem in the future haha all kids are problems lmao, but looks like
      even after a bunch of searching, that sapphire was nowhere to be found on
      the streets. Yep, no shit, "detective". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What we did get out of
      this though, is after two weeks of doing this making Kimizuka a proud
      father lol, the mother finally recovered (lmao) and you know, I guess the
      finding of the sapphire isn't that important anymore haha. I mean, who
      cares, dude? Which brings us to the second part of this episode: drunk
      Siesta. Yes, I never thought we will talk about this at length, but
      looks like we can now we got permission to do that lol haha what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      So yeah, I'll probably watch that whole part again, but looks like Siesta
      can't hold a drink ie. 10 glasses of wine lmao, and you know, Kimizuka had
      to babysit her now lol. But trust me, you would rather not babysit some
      kid who we don't even know her age but still knows of shame and women's
      instinct like a seven<strike>teen</strike> year old lol, than this
      beautiful woman with a cute face, an actual rack, and a drunk demeanour
      you wouldn't even mind sticking your tip in on the bed at the dead of
      night. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Okay, this is as clean as I can make this sound, but yes,
      this is very good fap material will come back to watch this part again.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I like the mention of their supposed BDSM relationship where
      Siesta's the sadist and I'm the masochist pig lol, but yeah, as they wake
      up in the next morning on the same bed... thankfully not both naked so
      that's good news, but you know, Siesta woke up and... wanted to make sure
      last night did not exist. I would argue though, give Kimizuka such
      memories so he can't cheat on you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Please, as an assistant. I
      know he wouldn't go for Hel as her sidekick, but you know, just in case it
      becomes some form of competition. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (You think Hel has rack? I don't remember lol) Talk about competition, they may have lost
      at some point because apart from lacking behind in investigations of Hel's
      whereabouts and stopping her from whatever she wants to do with the Bible
      lol, Fuubi-san also contacted them from I assume Japan, asking about their
      progress. Yes, Fuubi. That policewoman. Who did not appear at their abode
      to talk about a specific sapphire. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Someone was doing a
      transformation, yes, if you wondered. Which only makes me believe that
      that werewolf dude probably did not die, and he's still doing the
      Ripper stuff. Or well, maybe it's not true now, now that we have been
      literally deceived, but the problem is then, was what Hel? Was Hell at
      their doorstep at one time? (Yes, intentional character there, not spelling mistake) Hey, gotta watch to find out. But I'm just
      glad there was the beach episode and this one night stand without Alicia
      because how else you going to review this Anime series? 10/10 Anime of the
      year haha Siesta~!!

        </div>
      </blockquote>
      Wow, it really was uneventful. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, not to that extent, just
      that I guess, there isn't any much progress compared to last week. In this new
      episode though (#ShinigamiBocchan07) we still have gratuitous boob shots
      haha, magic apparently, and Viola-chan haha yes let's talk all about them.
      Firstly, a magic pot? Alice thought it'll be great to test out anything
      and everything considering they hit the dead end on Bocchan's curse last
      week, so yeah, I guess this is the only part that is maybe plot progression lol.
      So yeah, ironically, the pot is kind of
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ojisan" target="_blank">ojisan</a> and
      horny so I guess don't ask what the commands have to do with the cooking,
      but just that you should also wonder how Bocchan can manage to be deceived
      by Alice to think that they aren't making a potion of sorts to remove his
      curse but making what, a love potion? Haha okay sure Bocchan make a love potion and try to touch your girl then BOOM GOT'EM lol. Moving on, they did try out that formula to make some concoction
      that'll supposedly remove the curse, but as I used that one word you would
      have guessed that it probably tasted as badly as it would have worked, so
      yeah. Gotta try out anything now that our only line of hope is gone, isn't
      it? Hey, maybe consider like, soul transportation to another body?
      That'll solve the problem maybe haha. And since the pot is effectively
      useless other than be a comedic bit now lol, Bocchan gave the pot to Rob,
      in which the pot got immediately interested in- Like seriously, why is
      everyone attracted to Rob? Come on butler, leave some p*ssy for us, man.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Audience: You mean some Viola p*ssy-) (Please don't get me
      banned thanks) (lol) Next up, Alice found a book or should I say,
      manuscript which may help them with the curse (I'm being real ambiguous here)
      which involves a ghost MacFarlene who is comparable to Zain's level of
      perverseness on Alice considering he's probably stuck to this book for
      centuries and was waiting for someone to play his final piece when he lived, so that yes, you may have guessed it,
      MacFarlene here can be rid of its curse. So not Bocchan's. Okay. Haha what a
      waste of time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Yes, this tune will be in the soundtrack haha)
      Maybe that's what made the people who play this tune go crazy, this ghost
      going all around and whining about people not playing his music properly
      lol. Then, maybe this is the uneventful part of the episode, where we talk
      about whatever suspension bridge effect courtesy of the Viola Method lol,
      yeah but suffice it to say anything to scare Alice would just be Rob
      catering to Viola's affections ie. nothing will work haha. *gets punched
      by Viola* From scary stories to scary paintings hung up which ended up
      scaring Bocchan, Alice did not even flinch so that's not very fun haha
      girls are supposed to be scared, man. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What did make her flinch
      though, was the breaking of the vase in which Rob warned of its importance in relation to this former main mansion, was probably furious at Bocchan breaking it
      and got him into hiding from the butler, even if it also revealed the case
      of stolen jewellery from where it was hidden in. Wow, that was quite a
      mouthful haha. Good thing thanks to Rob's bad eyesight and hearing,
      Bocchan can just play off as sexy Alice and hide under the bed to avoid
      the butler for now lol, and what's even better, Alice is joining him on this
      haha ah hey I also like cramped places wait what. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Last but not least though,
      is from another trip to the library because apparently there are a lot of
      magical stuff there don't ask me why there is no solution to the curse, but this time, it's the Alice from
      that Wonderland we know of asking to find her rabbit, in, you guessed it,
      dreamland which means both Alice and Bocchan are in a dream world. Between
      all the hype and excitement of being able to do physicals on each other
      lol I knew the kissing scene would be cut out, but yeah they did not care
      about getting the rabbit though that's actually a lot of fun even in my
      opinion, just why must that book's Alice be such a b*tch- All in all haha,
      wonderful episode which I must say, you can dump me as many of these
      slice-of-life stories I don't even mind sitting through, but I have to say
      I kind of miss Zain and Cuff. Especially Cuff. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Sorry Alice haha cya guys next week for
      more not removing curse stories I guess

      Well, I must say, Saki-chan won that intro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
      (#KanoKano08) I guess Milika is going on the offensive now huh, and just
      like how I don't care about calling her by her not MeTuber name anymore,
      she also doesn't care about who Naoya is already in a relationship with, I guess.
      So yeah, this whole episode in general. Milika is aggressive, Saki-chan is
      trying real hard to make sure that doesn't happen in school but it has not
      been easy. Because in a land of opportunity, unless you are inside each
      other <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> (<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> lol) it's not possible to be occupying someone all the time in any relationship you know, even for the duration of school or how else are you gonna lesson. But that is what Saki-chan is intending to do as part of her
      extreme methods to make sure Milika-san doesn't stand any, and I mean ANY chance,
      of getting her hands on this idiot whom she just recently fell in love with
      lol. And Saki-chan is only continuing to win because besides Nagisa not
      being able to interfere since we have drawn the line of the act in school, we
      can also hear the moans from her in class because Naoya just can't let go
      of her- This Anime is the best. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I gotta admit though, that sounds
      great but man, if your teacher even allows your girl to sit on your lap
      while in lessons, please do tell I gotta report the teach. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Anyways, this went on all day in school without even a moment in ease haha
      maybe at least when Milika has to be in lessons like everyone else so they can
      probably go to the toilet individually at that time, but not even when they had to change
      for PE lessons apparently. Yeah, we're going that far haha. I see
      Saki-chan you're going with the "f**k you b*tch" method by bringing your
      boy to change clothes in not the restrooms- 20/10 Best Anime of the century lmao. Also, it's in
      the AV room so I hope the mic is on HAHAHAHA ignoring that, but yeah, did
      we just end up with the "you watch me change" portion of this porno- This
      series is LITERALLY A PORNO lol more on that later, but it looks like
      Saki-chan's genuine concern is worrying that she can't win Milika in looks by any
      mile if Naoya really falls for her to any extent... Yes you're right
      Naoya; She is lonely. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> More importantly though, thanks to Nagisa
      with the assist and we can't deserve her more for being such a supportive
      role <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>, she managed to distract Milika away such that they can at
      least get the changing stuff going and not make this end up being a strip tease or
      something lmao. (Seriously how did I totally wipe my memory of Anime
      "OsaMake" after watching Sakura Ayane in
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/186041/Saki_Saki" target="_blank">this role</a>
      haha) Then, we have ultimate occupancy Part 2 it seems. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Since you
      know, in school <strike>Sakura Ayane</strike> Saki-chan did have her way
      with Naoya, of course, as a distraction to make sure that easy big boobs
      (lol) doesn't take advantage(?) of the boy at any point, then had to end
      up allowing the other girlfriend to, you know, get her daily cuddles from her
      boy I guess- What Anime am I watching haha. So yeah, the worst part is,
      because the author also has such a fetish I suppose, they had to let
      Saki-chan watch them embrace just like how, I guess, Nagisa is likely watching those
      two on each other (lol) in school haha. So yeah, how f**ked up can this
      series get? Well, I think it's already overboard once we have to let
      Saki-chan explain her
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/netorare" target="_blank">netorare</a>
      fetish here haha NTR4LYFE baby, but yeah, we are 8 episodes in I'm sure
      Saki-chan loves jacking off to other girls doing it with his guy- OKAY
      MOVING ON haha, we have some plot progression with regards to Milika's
      advances, I would say. At this point it seems Rika-chan is already trying
      to walk with him to school despite the existence of the girlfriend in the
      way, and man is it getting irritating to even walk home with the dude, so
      instead of letting him be because why would you lol have you read the
      write-up above so far haha, she, and I guess Nagisa is here for the ride, has to
      <strike>deceive</strike> <strike>brainwash</strike> dupe him into
      believing that (1) Milika does not have a crush on him because why would
      you love someone who has two girlfriends lol and (2) Milika is just being
      a horny b*tch just because- Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Problem is though, that
      besides Naoya thinking that the latter is like a womens' period thing so it's
      tough and maybe he would think of helping Milika out which is only going
      to make things worse imo, he also then thought he misunderstood that
      Milika, in fact, is having a crush on this dude. Yep, I think you get an
      idea now haha. To that, I think we did end with an actual drop here, to be
      honest. We are going to have the most retarded confession/rejection*
      (*Cancel where applicable) of all time maybe haha. So, all in all, man
      this Anime continues to impress. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, for the comedy bits, 10/10,
      trust me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You... may have to understand what NTR means first
      though haha but hey, once you get over those technical knowledge, you'll
      love this series just like how much Naoya likes... everyone apparently
      haha. But yeah, great episode to go on, and I really wonder how much
      ridiculous this can go remember the friend Shino-chan hasn't joined in on this, but I'm glad the author is so smart, he can make
      every turn in this maze of love have a clown standing by at the corner
      ready to jump scare us. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

      </blockquote>Did this island just become a boot camp with Aki-sensei? Haha I knew
      it those boobs were deceiving as heck, immediately saw through that.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#SonnyBoy06) we may have more things
      to worry, because besides the fact that the student body has been split
      into factions following the slew of events we have seen last episode,
      we... might not even be real. Yeah, the Anime production dropping us this
      reality might have been the real joke, besides whatever God's joke in leaving these
      students in here. So, keeping in a spoiler-free analysis for as long as I can haha, let's talk about what happened. It has been two
      months since last episode after the fallout of Aki-sensei and her gang
      with Asakaze, against Hoshi's group of innocent students and there's
      Nagara and the others including Bill Nye, it looks like the latter group
      of the latter group (lol) ie. Nagara and the others, were travelling from
      world to world to avoid getting found out to, you know, I don't know, get
      punished? Hey, don't ask me what is the sentence for not being obedient in these worlds already haha because in our case, we finally get to see Hoshi's role in
      this series. Good thing he's not the <em>actual</em> antagonist haha sorry for last
      week bro, but the idea is that in his talk with what is supposedly the
      perpetrator which we will refer to again later, Hoshi's job is just to
      save them. These students. From what specifically? I must say, from
      disaster. Yes, that's why there's the concept of building an
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hakobune" target="_blank">Ark</a> as
      I've learnt this word from a song title (<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/noahs-ark/1358089461?i=1358089470&amp;l=en" target="_blank">thanks yucat</a>!), and him being like, the Student Council level trusting role as likely
      what the perpetrator assigned him as, so think of him now as the balance
      portion of all this drifting. Doesn't mean he's good guy in general, and him taking sides is just
      helpful to whoever he believes in, apart from what his job is here in the first
      place. Next up, Bill Nye's solution in bringing them back to the real
      world, with Nagara. So turns out, Nagara is <em>amazing</em> haha we know that
      already he's way better than me lol, but yeah, the two end up in a world
      of films, supposedly, taken from Nagara's perspective. And with some light&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;editing just like some YouTuber's joke,
      <strike>we can also be content creators with millions of subscribers</strike>
      we can change the contents of the footage and thus, supposedly change the
      future. We can't change the past though, that is still a no go. Even so,
      this led Bill Nye to think that it is possible to like, copy paste
      themselves into say, their school footage years ago, to teleport
      themselves into reality. Well, that's the idea, and they had to test it
      out. Problem is, Asakaze and the others might be catching up to them. If
      you haven't paid attention because of Aki-sensei's rack haha, with Asakaze
      and his... how to say, nature manipulating powers mostly wind-based, along
      with the sensei and her, you heard it, relativity powers...? Hey, no one
      said about having a teacher around before. Which brings us to one thing
      before we talk about the confrontation.
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/200614/Yamabiko" target="_blank">Tsuda Kenjirou</a>- Excuse me, that dog of a
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a>.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Trust me, you'll recognize his voice in popular Anime series so well you thought you were the dog lol what) The Nagara crew found him or well, Mizuho found him hanging
      around in the worlds and wondered what this dude is doing here considering
      (1) he's not in the same class as them not even same era he graduated when
      these kids came in and (2) why he's a dog. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> The second one isn't
      that simple but we shall leave that that as is now, but as from his statement
      which shall I guess be our reference for now, he mentioned that ONLY
      STUDENTS were adrift in this world and... we know who the bad guy is. Who
      God is. Okay, which is why I had to refer to the devil previously mentioned as God now, because now
      we know the identity, for better or for worse. Coincidentally, it's the
      principal of the school. I'll talk about why in the conclusion later, but
      suffice it to say... I'm mostly right, in thinking that this is someone's
      joke, in putting students in this world and never to be able to go back
      just because. But there's more than that. From the senpai recognizing
      Aki-sensei being an exception to the world's rules (so yes Aki-sensei is
      likely a senpai of this school... some years ago lol), to how Nagara can
      manage to manipulate this much of the worlds until they really managed to
      teleport into reality as they know of... this series is already making my
      headache worse every week haha. I thought this was over, but turns out, they
      were not in the actual reality, as they can see themselves in graduation which
      is already kind of weird especially with Nozomi missing lol how did she
      die anyways, but also, that nothing has changed even if they WERE
      teleported back to reality. Meaning, yes, the tables have turned, people.
      Those people in the reality they travelled to? They were the real ones. As mentioned by the principal which looks like a
      total Einstein lookalike and I wouldn't be surprised if he is a descendant
      living in Japan lmao (According to the official website he is just a manifestation of the "voice" we have heard that is the so-called God- Can we put the lor "inside" the show please?), they were chosen to be in an experiment it seems,
      mirroring the roles of the characters in reality. Yep, we're in this level
      of a psychological thriller, people. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, think back on
      Aki-sensei talking about the world being preserved because they can't
      really escape it anyways, and how that dog senpai talked about how he was
      already trapped here for an estimated 5000 years. Yeah, we in this
      sh*thole now. Haha okay jokes aside, I only continue to ponder on things such as why would the Anime production make such a terrible joke even for an Anime
      original lmao, and why did the principal of the school wanted to do such an
      experiment? What does he get out of this? If it's like, a growing up story
      where then he can paste these souls back into reality to help them grow
      that sounds like an unorthodox method, but I can't think of anything else. And no,
      this series is only halfway there, it has NOT ended, so I wonder what else
      can they come up with now. Will they be stuck in here forever ending up
      like the senpai(s) who have been here since the start of time? Or how did
      the principal even have these powers? Who knows? I won't say it's God
      because it's a lazy explanation, but hey, Nagara can be God, whatever. Haha
      cya guys next time for more mindf**king I guess

      what the dog senpai has been talking about because Aki-sensei as senpai is
      so useless I could slap those b*tch t*ts HAHAHA okay. He mentioned about a
      margin of error of eight months of going back, and Bill Nye mentioned
      about chance being a factor in the editing of the films in Nagara's
      perspective of a world. So meaning...? Yes, they have a chance of being
      themselves in reality? Or maybe ironically, they can replace themselves with
      these fake selves? Haha hey I prefer a Nozomi who is alive and a Nagara who
      has a girlfriend who is alive lol winky face emoji we shall see]

      "Could it be that she was so lonely, she missed me that much?" Yes, Nasa-kun.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah, the marriage-first Anime. An industry first or blessing RIGHT
      from the start haha ah hey don't ask what my marital status is because I already lost
      to these guys lol. In this special episode though (#ToniKawaOVA) I don't
      think this is from the original but I think even so it has a special
      message to deliver: when you are married you can do whatever you want at
      night. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, sorry, I'll try this again. "Even with social media
      it can never compare to loneliness away from our partners". Yes, this.
      *Phew* Haha okay, let's talk about what happened. Of course, we have a
      showcase of all the characters in this series so far, and we shall touch
      on all of them. With the introduction of Tsukasa the wife having a
      smartphone, this will be much easier to start with. Nasa-kun the husband
      finally got her a phone after a bucket list of things to help her settle down into her new home, he helped her set it up because ask a woman to
      set up a smartphone because she can't (lol misogynist joke), and Tsukasa
      had a great time exchanging LINE information with everyone in the
      bathhouse... which is within the same premises because this is still the
      part where they got their apartment burnt down after their trip to see his astronaut parents lol. Yeah, if you would
      recall the couple was staying at the back room for a while until the
      tenant can get another apartment built. So, from seeing the sisters at the
      bathhouse (shoutout to
      <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg3U_PFUBQ-G2wLVJmczZuAS8zRWgEZQD1NlIfICx7sDOHim_zPJzJzrdly9lrIdUxg0fM7PCXgK50x3ILk_2ZGRNu87MQM2UOkCTG6ZgPlDyZFnCSV2yEBXRVBvGvH48UdaF7lu1SXM6r6dqqAb3TJS9c0MsoV6mGx9AA1j_jLci9IbpQIbFyzNyPP=s320" target="_blank">ero-daikon</a>
      haha you know which Anime I'm talking about), to seeing Tsukasa work at
      the place and Nasa-kun having to work on his previous workplace just
      because... it's nothing but memories to talk about, for each and every one
      of them. Kaname is such a bossy pants haha, that gamer
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/anesan" target="_blank">ane-san</a>
      doesn't want to go to school lol
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/179344/Aya_Arisugawa" target="_blank">Sumipe</a>
      do you even know what Resident Evil is (also referred to as Biohazard in
      Japan), someone was eavesdropping on their conversation we'll talk about
      that later... it's just life as normal in the world of "ToniKawa". But
      yeah, Nasa-kun going out all day and leaving Tsukasa alone seems to be
      the problem. Because despite giving her a phone and the husband being
      contactable, doesn't mean that you know, he will be readily available to
      accept all your messages for starters, and yeah, Tsukasa is me struggling
      with sending messages when I got my first smartphone... almost 8 years ago
      wow haha. I mean, I don't care now I just spam stickers lol oh not to my
      partner I still don't have one <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Anyways haha, but yeah, the episode
      is definitely highlighting on Tsukasa feeling so lonely despite the
      presence of <a href="https://jisho.org/search/SNS" target="_blank">SNS</a> in her life right now, as she still really craves her
      husband's company even with all the messages sent to her telling her to
      sleep first and he may not be done until the next morning. It was around
      4AM when he was done, and as tired Nasa-kun went home to see the wife
      still awake, they, uh... I guess Kaname is right in that they had fun that night haha wasn't Nasa-kun tired?? AHAHAHAHAHA oh well the maid from
      Chitose's mansion heard of it so welp. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Well, thankfully they
      didn't do much other than the usual make-out lol even Episode 12 was more
      intense than this) (Okay maybe not because of the saliva? <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span>) So yeah,
      just as a finale, we took a look at the maids and specifically Chitose
      because you know, why talk about the newly wed couple but not talk about
      <strike>their obstinate mother</strike>
      <strike>their guardian</strike> their annoying (step)sister-in-law. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Besides seeing some fanservice that probably won't get me on because no
      rack haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, more importantly it looks like at least from this
      perspective Chitose is less concerned about the stuff they do at night as
      a wedded couple so good for them, right? All in all, a nice episode to
      have, I'm sorry Japan for paying so much for this OVA because we didn't it was on
      streaming services <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> (well they are the driver of sales and a season two so), but suffice it to say I missed this series. It
      has the feels different from many romance series I've watched over the
      past decade, and it will continue to live on as a series to remember. If
      there was a season two though, then I guess they will talk about Tsukasa's
      hidden identity, in case

        Okay, the write-ups for Anime are pretty damn long, so let's keep this
        short. Still, quite a few notable releases I've reviewed, so here's to
        reminding myself to pick some male vocals this year to even out that survey for the
        Song Awards haha. Anyways, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%94%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%95%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF-single/1579010633?l=en" target="_blank">Asakura Momo's new single</a></b> is... sadly
        not on my shelf which should also make her a Collection Artist, but I
        guess the B-side did NOT get me so no thanks. I mean composer for that
        song, you heard of the B-sides of Mocho's singles? Yeah, I want those.
        <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E7%A5%9E%E7%84%A1-kanna-ep/1574302173?l=en" target="_blank">miwa's new single</a></b> is also disappointing, and I didn't
        even bother to give irregular melodies and closed one eye giving the
        B-side... miwa-san, please tell me there's more to you than oldies. I
        want something new, and I don't mean credited tunes, please.
        <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/nebula/1579813254?l=en" target="_blank">Ueda Reina's new album</a></b> probably took the spotlight this week, but
        that doesn't mean I was lenient with her just because I knew of her
        songs from last year, but more of I could find something to listen
        despite her soft voice and... rather weak release overall in terms of
        emotion. Also, Pop tunes, too much of those. I miss Rock music already
        lmao
      </div>
      <br />
      On news concerning Twitter and music and unless I come up with sub titles
      on each paragraph I'll have to write this paragraph's intro lol,
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/suisei_hosimati/status/1429094657049317381?s=20" target="_blank">VTuber Hoshimachi Suisei's new music video</a></b> for her upcoming album
      and particularly got me to watch it just because the limited edition
      release features a Making Of video of the music video which also means
      this is not just any animated cut,
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1429041846844497921?s=20" target="_blank">SCANDAL is releasing another single end September</a></b> as with what they
      did for the rest of the year so far which no doubt I will give a listen to
      see if the one song is worthy of my shelf,
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1428703375227383814?s=20" target="_blank">miwa's THE FIRST TAKE performance on YouTube</a></b> features a song I've
      lived to remember since 2012,
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1428342943195099139?s=20" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</a></b> is for their
      <strike>album</strike> single next week so we'll talk about it at length
      then, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1428295688056500235?s=20" target="_blank">Earphones' new music video</a></b> for their concept album next month
      is uh... very them haha they be starting with introductions already, I
      think I may just drop by <a href="https://twitter.com/nanoripe_info/status/1427088979015344130?s=20" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">nano.RIPE's YouTube live next month</a>&nbsp;for their 11th anniversary, <a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1429433519193812995?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Primary expanded their music library</b></a> on Apple Music with an album I've never heard before lol, and... I did not listen in to
      <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1426831789230751744?s=20" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES' recent YouTube livestream</a></b> haha ah hey the
      archive is there if you want to listen though. *looks at video* Okay it's
      not music performances lol nvm<br />
      <br />So for next week, we have
      <b>Anime "TanMoshi" music collection album</b> which will technically be
      my official review of the theme songs since they have released on digital
      earlier this month and even have
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAjXT8Q109U" target="_blank">music videos</a>
      for them we will talk about who they are next week,
      <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/litmus-ep/1577489011?l=en" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</a></b> will be our main course which I
      hope I can give something other than the digital singles that were
      released since their album from last year, and if all else fails then
      maybe I'll listen to <b>LuckLife's new song</b> haha I don't think we will
      get this far lol<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />And since I got crazy over <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoPbNPkrLM4" target="_blank">Asakura Momo's new musc video</a></b>&nbsp;(they could've took this chance to slap the Anime credit or stuff but no, just the song title on the video) which I
      must say is a thing to celebrate because this is also the talent company's
      FIRST EVER full music video on YouTube- Welcome to 2021, MusicRay'n.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, let's do a mini review full of GIFs because I don't
      bother to do it in another post haha cya guys next week if you're not into
      Mocho then why wouldn't you? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Will eventually fix earlier music video reviews as I moved it from the
  older site 2 years ago so... I'll get to it someday lol so meanwhile...! Enjoy
  haha I think after doing this I may have regretted not doing this as an
  individual post itself hehe

P.P.S. Personally I think that and I think I mentioned this before, it's like this
MV split Mocho into 4 different "her" which if put together will still form her,
if that makes any sense. In reality though? I believe Asakura Momo privately is
probably SHY just because; She isn't as cool or mysterious or sweet as we
thought she might be, think about it.
