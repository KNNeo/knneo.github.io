Back to Saturday Anime viewing again!! Because somehow my afternoon tea became coffee
with pearls- Who even orders this shit?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't worry I got my revenge on Sunday it wasn't as good as I thought though lol you think it's a sign? Haha<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So hey, welcome back. It was a boring week for me because I was really,
  <i>really bored&nbsp;</i>but you know, you still pretend to work.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> People are leaving again so that's rad. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways, my life
  outside of work is still more interesting even if it's just watching YouTube,
  literally this and playing transport simulation games haha let's finish this
  'cos I wanna play more... Well I didn't play more I did try to fix the blog more though, hoping for a site content refresh soon. This place is still as messy as I branched out two years ago</div>

  </blockquote>
  Can we like, stop the rumours of Ryou going out with a teacher who is older
  than him so we can actually get Matsushima on this love... rectangle? Haha in
  this new episode (#KoiKimo06) where lovesick <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/187178/Arie_Matsushima" target="_blank">Kana-chan</a> is great as it is
  irritating lol, Ryou be hitting on the mother?? So the rumours about him are true...
  Happy Mother's Day everybody. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, story. We have an obvious character
  focus episode again, and surprise surprise, this time it's Matsushima. I know
  I can't stop referencing her marital status to <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa" target="_blank">her voice actress</a> but I will
  try not to for the rest of this review. Keyword being "try". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Matsushima got off from meetings back to office as anyone would, and dropped by the nearby cafe for some
  drinks as anyone would (lol), and saw Ryou there. I like how she has to go
  to the toilet to... what's that phrase they use in "The Sims" video games? Ah
  yes "Gussy Up" haha. So yeah, that but she still screw it up lol thanks fallen
  leaves, but she managed to strike a conversation with Ryou mainly because of
  what Ichika-chan likes: Anime. Some people be lucky to find such a partner or
  anyone around them who does so sucks to be me, but as you may have and Matsushima has noticed, these two women have similar tastes that Ryou is now
  into. Sort of. Ryou asks for recommendations from Matsushima hopefully
  thinking that the Netflix recommendation method will work for him too ie. Ichika
  will also like what he might be watching so they can strike a conversation,
  but you know, at least it's working out over here. Back to work, please,
  you two. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ryou thinks of killing Tamaru in the car lol, and he fetched
  his sister to Ichika's place for a stayover. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, Ryou not included
  by the way Ichika will NEVER let that happen lmao. So next up, the stayover.
  Probably happens often, but considering Rio is doing all the talking thanks to
  the mother bombarding her with questions about their family, for now it's good
  to know, but boy do I not want to see their father appear in this series lol.
  (But what about the marriage proposal? Ryou can't <i>possibly</i> get approval
  from his parents with this girl haha) Also, Rio be a heavy sleeper lol just
  gotta mention that a little. Then, we have the sports tournaments. Yes yes,
  this is a good time to show how cool Tamaru is to Ichika because the friend
  keep passing him balls to score which, I must admit, gets the girls in but
  somehow not Ichika lol why, but suffice it to say it was a great exhibition
  of... you know. "coolness"? Also, can this Anime stop reminding me on how I
  was like as a student? Okay, maybe not on the soccer part because I suck at it
  but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Let's see, that was student military and it was girls from class
  after curriculum time hehe) (Nope, not going out with any of them at any point lmao) Then,
  we have the Matsushima confrontation. I know, I know, but someone had
  to ask about the rumours floating around the company about Ryou, so yeah, why
  not the best female buddy at work? That's where we draw the line though,
  because Matsushima thought she could get away with asking that question in a
  drinking party with colleagues which wouldn't be weird, but you know, they would just talk about how cool Ryou is so... thanks to the friend I think, she
  cut out a path for those two to chat a bit. Ryou stated that he's not going
  out with anyone steady (yes those women he called to his place do not count
  lmao), but did state an infatuation (crush, if anyone is not into that
  vocabulary) which is also into Anime like Matsushima is. Yeah, so basically
  not you, Matsushima. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And yeah, you have no chance, girl. He's into
  kids. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, teens. But you know, this is getting her hopes higher
  than ever, I must say. So, so much spiciness when you see her desperately
  wanting to get into the action because she is asking the Internet for a plan
  like those other people who did the same search lmao. All in all, it's this
  interconnectedness that'll make this series good, and I believe I'm going to
  enjoy this to the end. That spiciness is going to pay off like a spicy hotpot
  once we see all the ingredients put together in the stew, so that's going to
  be exciting. Meanwhile, we can enjoy these small but sweet doses of happiness,
  hope, and maybe not the conflicts that might happen in the near future.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We can but hope haha

      same generation I-cup so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  You think Gotou will think Yoshida is a criminal now after revealing the truth
  that is at his place? Ah well she said it <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this hard-hitting
  episode (#HigeHiro05) I keep thinking to myself why this confrontation should
  even happen in the first place. Because seriously Gotou, are you going to peg
  into her past and then make the decision for her to go home or otherwise?
  She's 17 man she can make her own decisions. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Uh oh am I going to be
  arrested? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, story. Man, did this episode feel like forever.
  Actually, every episode for this series because I can't stop to comment... to
  myself lol laugh it off like Mishima please. So, what happened. In case you
  haven't noticed, yes, Gotou is visiting Yoshida's place which has Sayu-chan in
  it to... probably confirm the lack of presence of a love rival but we don't
  know, but more importantly, to have a talk with her. Again though? I don't
  know what's the purpose of this, but if the intention of (the author or) Gotou
  is to tell her to get off her disguise and be herself (Yeah Sayu-chan try
  telling what you did in the past six moths to a virgin HAHAHAHAHAHAHA MOVING
  ON!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But as you can see here, that's how little Gotou knows about the
  situation) and confront her problems... I think this episode got it through.
  Please tell me that's it haha unlikely but we can hope. But yeah, Yoshida
  isn't the loose guy like all the others in the streets haha what. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We
  have iterated on those already, so I will keep it down for now. But as you can
  see, it's not normal circumstances so technically everyone was worried about
  Yoshida and Sayu-chan in general, and this is what you get. Serious talk
  though, Gotou, that's why no one cares. It's not just a label, dude. It's
  society. That label is just convenience, just like how convenient it is for
  Sayu to walk in and out of them, really. This talk probably helped Sayu since
  Yoshida won't explain sh*t as easily as someone of the same gender, so
  hopefully this will do. And yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the
  expected but worst case scenario: We will be seeing Sayu confront her actual
  life before she arrived here. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Well, this series is a bit reality-facing
  so go figure.&nbsp;Next up, since Yoshida got chased out to do some shopping
  so they can set up the lovers' arena lol, Yoshida spotted Mishima on the
  streets, on the way to his place. Wow. Just wow. THANK GOODNESS he was out.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ooooo this is becoming peculiar of a situation by the minute, folks.
  Is this what it's like to be a in a harem? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Mishima asked him if she
  can accompany him (please say yes oh thank God) and not surprisingly, she has
  been tailing him. Yes, please refer to last week's episode because I can't
  even believe Mishima actually did all this like she's a stalker haha. But you
  know, genuine concern does spawn such abnormal behaviour and she is cute so
  you're forgiven. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Mishima's concerns are likely unnecessary
  but seeing as how Yoshida has to explain this to everyone in his
  increasingly larger social circle lol. Mishima wants to drop by his place
  (Uh,&nbsp;not tonight, girl. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) but of course, since with all the
  stalking, she just finds it weird that Yoshida can allow someone who he likes
  to be with some stranger who literally lives at his place because cohabitation
  is literally the symbol of a deep, romantic relationship maybe haha. Guess
  what, Mishima? Yoshida's priority - and quote me here - is being nice. That's
  it. Being too nice even. That's the point, Mishima. I like how we're how many
  episodes into this already and the author still has the capacity to dig into
  something that has hit concrete lol. But still, the point is to get all this
  across to all parties involved, so yes, author, we get ya. Meanwhile, it's
  Sayu's turn to ask questions to Gotou, and she asked the obvious since she
  already knows a lot of this "mysterious woman" from Yoshida who recently found
  out the truth too. Yes time to flip that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/taiyaki" target="_blank">taiyaki</a> around,
  girl! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, this really will depend on Gotou whether she will do
  the b*tch move and... I think maybe it's the rack-off but yeah, Sayu may not
  have any capacity to be involved in "adult affairs" here since once again,
  that label as a high school girl. She is indeed matured enough to realize that there's something going on between them though, so hopefully that infatuation or jealousy will come back to bite her
  someday lmao I can't wait. As Yoshida sends off Gotou for the night, we hear
  the same thing we have heard once everyone realized why Yoshida can allow a
  female high schooler into his place, and all is well...? Well, things are
  going too smoothly though lol. We need some "external threat" haha so I
  guess next episode, we have some problems incoming. What is this new guy
  going to do to Sayu-chan... mentally? (Haha in many ways than other because
  "physically" and "psychologically" also counts) I guess we'll find out soon
  enough.

  [TL:DR; Gotou: "So you basically grabbed some girl off the street to live with
  you?" Yes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> HAHA

  like, the whole school lol, it might be a dream but it's so real, even I would start
  playing gravure idol
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shiritori" target="_blank">shiritori</a>
  lmao ("<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shiri" target="_blank">shiri</a>-<a href="https://jisho.org/word/%E5%8F%96%E3%82%8A" target="_blank">tori</a>" amirite???) (sorry) Okay I'm tired of my jokes thanks to caffeine overdose
  so let's move on. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, story. As you can see in the intro, looks like
  the three parties have concluded that their next move to show themselves in
  school after that embarrassing... incident... is? In that festival, yeah. For the girls, to blame on each other, and for Sueharu... let's just say he has more
  problems on his hands, this harem master. Also, they didn't expect what
  happened after they actually go back to school. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because first up,
  the aftermath. Main point is probably "Tetsuhiko accidentally uploaded the
  last part of last week's episode <strike>on YouTube-</strike> online" which,
  besides throwing him into a world of recognition because people do remember
  Maru Sueharu I guess, it also got a lot more attention than he would have
  expected. Introducing new character <strike>Momo</strike> Maria but Momo sounds cuter, because this b*tch... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As you may have noticed and we will
  talk about that later, she is taking a physically aggressive approach here
  which the other two have not much privilege to haha okay maybe Kuroha when those two are alone but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Other than that though, it would seem like Shirokusa
  can get her cut into the action probably using her dad as a segway to talk to
  Sueharu after the incident so she
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kachi" target="_blank">wins</a> (Get it?
  Because it's her family name too), unlike Kuroha where even just walking close
  to Sueharu will give him nightmares lmao he just turned into a monkey haha
  what. Now that I realize it, something that has been bugging me, that is this
  is very extrovert-level drama right here, since normally it'll just be less of
  clashing but more of thoughts and stuff. Maybe that's why. You see, talking
  out loud about romance and stuff in a classroom isn't really a thing even in
  Anime so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;AND AS IF THAT IS NOT ENOUGH!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Please, I
  need a place to breathe for a bit so stop stuffing your chest against my face,
  Rena-chan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Can this Anime not get more stupid, you think? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Man, this Anime is going to be more dumb, in like 20 other ways (as in girls)
  than other at least lmao. These other ways besides the above include...
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (1) Jack of all Trades Rena-chan who knows Tetsuhiko who
  got him apology pizza because of all the ad revenue he's going to get from
  uploading the one video without the actor's permission lol, (2) Sueharu is
  into big boobs lmao (ah I see... haha), (3) there is crazy understanding here because even the man himself knows Kuroha is just playing around with him and
  can never show her true feelings considering the initial confession and
  rejection compared to the recent ones, and the list goes on. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I can
  mention as many of them as I like but I think you can think about it yourself.
  And as if this isn't enough of a sh*t fest with Tetsuhiko just checking if the
  paparazzi are out of his place, Maria-chan appeared at his place haha what.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, let's talk a little more about Maria-chan who just became his
  temporary(?) housewife lol, about what we know on these two "childhood
  friends". (Title drop haha) He taught her a lot of things apparently, you know, "childhood
  friend" things lol but mostly acting (haha) but seems like he got her far
  enough in the drama industry to (surprise my a**) chase off that media
  overhead which is probably Tetsuhiko's fault in the first place (Did you just
  "interrogate" his mom?
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kowai" target="_blank">KOWAI</a> lol also
  RIP the mom who lost a finger or two before losing her life) and somehow,
  provide a good chance to talk about her situation in the industry now. Well,
  let's just say this is the cumulation of everything thus far, as now the entertainment industry is interested in them. Maria-chan lives in a talent agency which
  changed leadership so who cares there are too many characters to talk about
  already just in the one harem circle, but more importantly, the leader himself
  wants to seek an audience of Sueharu and - hear me out - Kuroha. And as he
  might be trying to... patch things up with her? I guess we might not have to.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being absolutely ridiculous
  in the history of scripted plots... I don't even want to talk about it.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> First time in a long time have I felt tired watching an Anime series.
  Yes, even more than HigeHiro above. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I guess the approach to watching
  this series is to follow through. Because even I can't deal with Kuroha's
  amnesia haha what SHE WAS JUST TALKING TO TETSUHIKO A WHILE AGO THOUGH!!??
  Cya guys next week haha ugh my head hurts I'm stopping here (oh it's the
  caffeine)

  Well there isn't much in new songs this week, but I did give a couple of releases worth talking about. Don't ask me about <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/senkou-single/1562144211?l=en" target="_blank">[Alexandros] new single</a></b>, overrated stuff and I did give it a listen, so don't expect me to give the English version anytime soon lol. I did say to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E3%82%92%E6%8A%9C%E3%81%91%E3%81%A6/1562255994?l=en" target="_blank">anewhite's 2nd EP</a></b> since I knew of them from last year as they were featured in the indie segment of a rock festival, and I must say this release isn't too bad. Can't wait for them to get popular to beat the likes of mol-74 lol. I did give a couple more songs from YUKI and Tsuzuri Zukuri from last week, but more importantly, I listened to <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%81%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AC-single/1562830500?l=en" target="_blank"><b>AyumiKurikaMaki's last single</b></a>. Yeah, they labelled it real well on that one. Welp, hardly even knew them from Anime and they're gone now. I did enjoy the songs I gave them though for the past couple of years. Too bad we're done with them now haha. In their defence though? Genre with their calibre and with the niche rapping and all? Dozens of idol groups out there are better off than them so go figure.<br />
  <br />On news concerning music and Twitter and maybe I'll take this place to do status updates on artists I follow so we know they're still alive, I found out from one of my past blog posts about <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1389444082422804485?s=20" target="_blank">the one song featured in Anime "Kaguya-sasma"</a> (specifically during Hayasaka's "bath scene" lol) featuring Kusano Kayoko but the song was not featured anywhere else so I might not have access to it unless I check out the Anime video releases, <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Floor_/status/1391319252104216577?s=20" target="_blank"><b>The Floor's new song is for a TV show</b></a> in Japan so that's some news from them since their 2019 album, <a href="https://twitter.com/maruritoryuga/status/1386955775982018560?s=20" target="_blank"><b>MaRuRi to Ryuga's first full album releases end of Jun</b>e</a> so yay I thought I had to wait longer after seeing their digital singles compared to ACE COLLECTIOn lol, <b>Anime <a href="https://twitter.com/kakushigoto_pr/status/1390592490537848833?s=20" target="_blank">"Kakushigoto" is getting a music album release along with soundtrack</a></b> one whole year later after the show aired lol wtf, <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1390227227996942338?s=20" target="_blank"><b>TrySail's new song is on digital pre-release</b></a> I think I mentioned this before and if you can't understand there's subpar English now lol, <a href="https://twitter.com/toysfactory/status/1389950511399329798?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Komatsu Mikako's new music video</b></a> will get her to Collection Artist status real soon and also <a href="https://www.toysfactory.co.jp/artist/mikakokomatsu/news/detail/4492" target="_blank">the single is delayed a week</a> I almost forgot, <a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1389882569706115075?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Touyama Nao's new music video preview</b></a> for upcoming concept mini-album is worrying because I feel a lot of Earphones vibes ie. sound effects and voiceovers in songs, and <a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1390634061153013763?s=20" target="_blank"><b>cinema staff released another live video on YouTube</b></a> again so if you really miss them go hear more of them if you like.</div><div>
  <br />
  So next week, we got a good amount of releases coming up, including <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> which is opening theme for Anime "Nanatsu no Taizai" because FINALLY she has been singing only endings for that series so far, and <b>Touyama Nao's concept mini-album</b> which focuses on relaxation but hearing the music video I may feel apprehensive. Don't worry because we will have the holiday and work leave next week to deal with these so HAHAHAHA we good (hehe)<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Speaking of holidays and work leave because that's how you pad your days off to get max benefit out of them since your boss don't give you benefits lmao, I missed Ayachi's Instagram live so bad I feel bad for her fanclub live event getting delayed already lol, and RYTHEM's... revival livestream? It's coming in soon, it's the week after. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Oh well, we'll get there haha. Cya guys next week then, I'm sweating rushing through this because I was watching some gameplay video on YouTube of Resident Evil 8 (yes tall mom step on me lol what) which released recently, and barely had time to do this up and I should sleep early but I think that's not possible. Until next time then ugh my neck hurts<br />
</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Kana-chan photobook purchase on that local bookstore got rejected so I'm compensating it with another Suruga-ya run. (Nope, this is TOTALLY because of Akarin hahahahaha Kayanon~) Seeing how the whole of Japan is taking a break due to Golden Week over this week alone I hope my order won't suddenly lose like 5 items and I have to pay more because I lack that shipping discount minimum purchase. Ugh, oh well, still cheaper than that auction run a year ago lol I'LL TAKE IT haha bye</div><div><br /></div><div>P.P.S. Oh yeah and Happy Mother's Day or whatever lol (I guess my female colleague is right "it's the thought that counts" I have no thoughts though haha ugh)</div>
