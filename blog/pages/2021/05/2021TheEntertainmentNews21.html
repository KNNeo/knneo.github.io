I know this week might be boring, me, but NEXT WEEK haha well it'll still be
boring if we're not talking about packages it'll never be as good as last week lol
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Welcome back. It has been a week. I may have to work from home, which may be
  good or not depending on how much you like to do takeaways and/or negotiate
  food delivery with your family members distracting you from work at home.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Either way, it's only 2 days for next week so WHO CARES HAHAHAHA okay
  ask me if I enjoyed next week... next week haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I see a lot of stuff happening on the Anime official Twitter accounts so let's
  hope I didn't see too much to be spoiled- Are there TWO new insert songs for
  "OsaMake"?? lol wtf is their budget<br />
  <br />
  <br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  OH YEAH the presents thing haha uh oh I almost forgot about this-
  This is going to go well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#KoiKimo08) where "it
  only took me a second to change my opinion about Valentine's Day" lol Ryou,
  F**K CHOCOLATES AMIRITE??? Chocolates are so not 2021. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If you didn't die in
  the intro where Ichika gives Ryou his Valentine's Day present you are not a
  man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And so Ryou died-ed on the front porch haha Ichika is the best. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I
  would've dropped dead too if I were given a hug. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways before I
  get beat up by him haha, there's someone else who wants to get beaten by him
  lol. Introducing, surprise surprise, Tamaru who was also given chocolates on
  Valentine's Day by Ichika because you know, Ichika is kind enough to repay him
  for lending her manga to read and stuff. Hey, it is not easy to find someone (yes, Matsushima) (yes, Ryou haha) to talk this otaku stuff with, trust me. However, Tamaru wants to take this
  not as a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tomochoko" target="_blank">tomo</a>
  chocolate but a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/honmeichoko" target="_blank">honmei</a> one?
  (Just putting in definitions for context in case you don't know about Japanese
  love culture lol) Man, sure, whatever, bro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Problem is though, this
  probably affected Ichika's weak maiden heart (lol) more than she would have
  thought, because honestly as she said it herself... she doesn't dislike him.
  Hey, guess who is standing in the way lmao wink wink it's not Ryou. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  (Yeah right it's TOTALLY him haha) Next up, remember Matsushima with a box of
  chocolates? Man, she is SO SLOW when it comes to the latest news from Ryou the
  whole company knows about it already lmao. So yeah, she would've noticed
  thanks to her fellow colleague with the rumours that chocolates aren't Ryou's
  thing. But then again those women aren't Ryou's thing to be honest haha as
  even if Matsushima didn't consider an alternate gift like what Ichika did (which was a hug btw lol), she wouldn't have the guts to do it either and more importantly as we see
  in context, she also worked overtime so didn't had the time to go
  get something else, and only saw Ryou at the train station to have barely
  enough time to give him the chocolate she has been holding on since the
  morning... and they were still separated by the ticket gantry lol. Good luck trying for that hug, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey guys,
  tell me you use your&nbsp;<strike>bank cards</strike> smartphone to tap in and
  out of your metro now, please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Thanks, Google Pay! Haha)
  Interestingly, as assertive as Matsushima is at giving these chocolates away
  (they probably aren't cheap she probably just didn't want to eat it alone lol)
  Ryou did accept them, unlike the probably dozens of chocolates he rejected since the
  start of the day lmao. Man, you should've seen the smile on Matsushima's face-
  Why can't he make every woman who wants to give him chocolates that happy?
  Haha maybe he just wants supper? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then, since this is technically happening
  on both sides with similar resolutions, is the... less than known fact about
  Tamaru's confession. Ichika looks sad because she is worried about how she
  should respond to such a drop, but yeah, people around her are getting
  concerned. First, her bestie Rio. The Literature Club of newbie seiyuu
  probably got mistaken about these two lol (hey me don't eat them out you don't even know who they are lmao), but as Rio "confronts" Tamaru about
  what happened the day before, Tamaru blatantly points out her friend is being too
  bossy about their relationship which I must say, is about to
  blossom. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But Rio is right though: Tamaru told her that he doesn't
  think that way towards Ichika like, 4 episodes so or something. Damn, someone
  let me punch the ground or something haha *slams desk* But I guess Tamaru is right? Rio is
  concerned as a friend, but this is kind of their thing? But again, Ichika
  doesn't have such a problem so far into her life, so yeah it is concerning.
  Just like how she has to deal with someone wooing her who is a decade older
  than her <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, this also means Tamaru will go against that thing,
  so good luck I guess haha. Then, we have Ichika with Ryou. I mean, and that's
  why you don't talk to him every day over the phone, because that'll get the
  dude worried with just a slight chance of your mood and start appearing near your school so the whole class will know
  you've been two-timing Tamaru with an old dude- Hey, I'm not the one who came
  up with this plot, don't blame me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ryou is real persistent in finding
  out the truth though, but I'm more surprised how they made it up on the spot
  instead of lingering this for like 10 episodes like those other romance series which I'm not going to reference lol. Ichika still insisted that she deal with her worry herself though, so I
  guess Ryou can't get the early news about him having to deal with a rival he
  probably is going to lose to...? But serious talk man, for Ichika it's less like "whether I like Tamaru or not" but more like "I've got one irritating
  dude I don't need another one" haha ikr. Our dear girl has had enough of men lol Rio is so much nicer to her than these dudes who make her worry more than
  she should have as a person. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, this episode man... I know
  this might just happen? But really, I didn't expect it to still go this
  smoothly haha no really. And that's why I still think this is the best out of
  the three I watch this season: It has enough spice to make you like this
  series just like how Ryou continues to like Ichika every single day haha. Moving
  forward? I really think Ichika might have to do the thing and try... emphasis
  on the "try", to get along with Tamaru instead of continuing the line with
  this persistent stalker lol. How though? I believe it might be hard (and sad
  of an ending, if any), Ichika might have to really be quite bad to that blondie in
  order to settle things straight to the extent of even not be friends with Rio which might
  actually be bad, but all in the name of love? Go away Tamaru stop ruining this
  happiness haha cya guys next week

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Really? Is that car parked outside the convenience store with Sayu's dad or
  something? Call me Detective Shouhei haha okay I know it's not stop telling me haha. In this new episode (#HigeHiro07)
  where if you have Yoshida's contact number you have officially joined his
  harem group lol, we have quite some progression this
  time around so let's get to it! Firstly, about a suspicious car parked outside
  the convenience store Sayu-chan works at. We will get to that a bit later, but
  yeah, her past might be creeping up on her by now so... yeah. So firstly
  firstly, Mishima to Yoshida. It's not like she doesn't understand what is
  going on between Yoshida and Gotou and Sayu-chan. I guess hearing Gotou out
  won't help even if it's over lunch, but suffice it to say that Mishima
  probably thinks all this is getting in the way of her liking him. Like, for
  real. Mishima just wants a piece of the action, <i>man</i>. (Get it? Man? As
  in Yoshida? Haha sorry) I swear if Yoshida continues on his harem path at work he's
  going to get physically slingshot by Mishima across the office lmao mark my
  words haha. But you see Mishima, even finding out the truth about what Gotou
  did to talk to Sayu-chan and blah blah blah, Gotou-san here already secured
  her seat in Yoshida's... heart? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So she's not that worried. YOU
  though... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It really feels like Mishima wants to take the aggressive
  approach on this poor dude who already got his hands full with women (lol) but
  you know, this is kind of a special situation which involves literally
  criminal action that might be liable to be charged in court lmao. But Gotou is
  right though: As long as Sayu either doesn't leave Yoshida's life OR chooses
  to be with him further than we think right now, we don't know and may have to
  wait and see. At some point something bad will happen, and that's when the
  author will hint to us to take action- Ah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp; But that won't stop
  Mishima from taking action though. So next up, dinner's in the way for a movie
  date. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, if you watched the episode you will get the idea, but yeah
  Mishima kinda forced Yoshida to exchange contact information with her because...
  because... she took an interest in him, is the nicest I will put it. And she
  told him to the face too. But goddamn that took a while. Yeah, Yoshida, like
  most other guys, are <b>total idiots</b> until you lay the truth on them which is
  normally a confession so yeah, thanks for doing this Mishima I almost choked to death on anxiety.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But hey, I like a jealous Mishima haha she's kinda cute too so I
  don't know why Yoshida would go for JK and big tits- Oh he's into older women?
  Never mind. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Which brings us to what is up next, Sayu digging through
  Yoshida's treasure trove, while she is cleaning up his house. Thank goodness
  it's not toys or something because I would be found out (Ah-) lol, but of
  course Sayu-chan would be keen in looking through his high school graduation
  album after she landed on him or something haha. (I swear the author be like
  "what can I do to spice up this volume of manga" lol) Hey, it's basically
  going steady already if that happened in a romance Anime, don't you know?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Sayu discovered a woman in his past, and it's a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a>, and
  yeah, they went out together like those relationships people with traditional
  thinking will reprimand you for lol, but you get the idea Yoshida IS into older
  women- What did I tell you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Stop
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/karakai" target="_blank">teasing</a> him
  Sayu-chan; You're not in
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san" target="_blank">that Anime</a>
  lol) And then blah blah blah Sayu-chan thinks her case is the same as when he
  went down on his girl in high school haha what. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on because
  that is too cringe even for me lol, Yaguchi helped defend her from... a bad
  customer. No really, he's not here to buy anything. Yes, it's the one in the
  car parked outside the convenience store. I know I shouldn't explain this too
  much, but the name card will explain how Sayu might have a very rich family
  just like Asami. Ugh, rich people kids problems agin, huh. Hey Asami; looks
  like you two were made to be good friends. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... wow that
  ending. Like really, if that didn't get you, it did get me. Not like as a
  surprise: We have talked about how much this will happen soon, but as Sayu has
  mentioned... She doesn't have the liberty to think of when to go back. She HAS
  to, and it's happening sooner than later. Okay now I can say honeymoon
  period's over and we might have to go back to her story again. Hey, thanks for
  the Yoshida story and ex because we don't need more of that already he's got two women
  behind his back lol we shall see how it goes then. Again, we have NO FREAKING
  IDEA of what Sayu's family is. She could be lying about her parents not giving
  a damn all this while, considering the brother's in to find her now. Cya guys
  next week haha

  Ugh, must we recall this part? I already don't want to know about this sh*t
  fest haha okay me. In this new episode which hopefully we can move away from
  the actual sh*t fest that is the entertainment industry (#OsaMake06) and I'm
  glad one's a subset of another because let's get around this, yes?
  So, story from last week was someone got amnesia <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> from the Confession
  Festival, the video of whatever embarrassing rejection from a confession got
  into a video online with views that'll get Sueharu into the industry, we
  visited a prospective entrance into this very industry along with
  Maria-chan... and the President of that company got dunked on with wine.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I'll try not to reveal the truth too much if you want to know skip
  to the later part of this super long paragraph lol) The guy immediately went for
  the phone to call the cops as Tetsuhiko tries to beat (his dad) up (oops)
  (haha) (How? I don't even know) instead of trying to give Sueharu face to recover from this incident because really
  reputation is at an all time low right now, Shirokusa's dad walked in
  revealing him as the next prospective customer of a commercial Sueharu and
  probably Kuroha were likely going to be on, and Maria-chan might have saved
  the day by... proposing a commercial contest between a major talent company
  and some high school group with a production level equivalent to whatever you
  saw two episodes ago lol. I think I know specifically what is bugging me so
  far. It's this micro level analysis that has to be done with every major event.
  It's irritating. I see those in <i>every single real life drama</i> I DON'T WANT to
  see it this obvious and so laid out in an Anime. Like really, it's bad. But I
  like how Maria-chan had to do all this planning and suggestion just so she can
  say "of course I'm taking my talent company's side" to Sueharu lol dude you
  think you getting her this easily? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah yeah blah blah <a href="https://jisho.org/search/CM" target="_blank">CM</a> fight or
  whatever, we know who's going to win anyways, so everyone starts placing their
  bets on whatever conditions that can satisfy all parties so we get the ending
  we see... in a moment lol. Like really, from Maria to Shirokusa to those who
  don't have to put their bets on paper, everyone did something behind the scenes.
  Which will bring us to the results, I guess. As we can see from Maria-chan's
  PC at home with her sister lol I don't even want to talk about their past, I
  wish we get to see a commercial featuring Maria-chan but I guess not, because
  guess where the production budget for this series went to lmao. I guess they
  can take this time to make as much bullsh*t as they want, huh. No, not talking
  about Aquamarine Channel. Talking about Anime production. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Haha see?
  You were the one who got jebaited lol) In a nutshell in case you don't get the
  hint, it's major talent company's production of a standard commercial meant to
  promote the product or else how you get the profits, versus a YouTube channel
  literally extending what they did where Tetsuhiko uploaded that video
  featuring Sueharu twerking for the world to see lol. And with a hint at the
  end of the video, a further upload of a music video probably meant to get the
  kids in likely nailed their win in the coffin. It's not a level of excitement
  where we stand on stage or whatever because we did that already haha, but I
  guess we should bring the attention to what Tetsuhiko and Abe-senpai talked
  about in the end, on who the real winners are. So yeah if you don't think the
  amnesia is a dumb thing, Kuroha came out tops because she wanted Sueheru to
  not go back into entertainment considering how much he knows about him as a...
  wait for it, childhood friend (haha), and Tetsuhiko... let's just say he took
  the liberty to be friends with Sueharu when he's at his weakest. Really, that
  idiot doesn't even know...!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But Kuroha's cheating is way smaller in scope
  and more effective thanks to Tetsuhiko's dad ie. the President of that talent
  company, so yeah, win win. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Amongst other things, Maria-chan managed
  to quit her agency just because that's her bet, and guess who's the new transfer student in
  school. Ugh this Anime is too predictable I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all...
  I hope I was wrong about this series being a drag because of the deliberate
  proceeding of events in general with this story. Maybe it's because there's a
  lot of history involved, maybe that's how they can get all the characters
  together with some background to deal with future events which I have no idea
  what that will be unless you tell me it's Japan politics haha please don't,
  but you get the idea, everyone is as scheming as you can see, other than pure boy Sueharu apparently lol. But again, it's not going to get me out of this just
  like how it can't be with Sueharu in a harem now haha, but that aside, we
  might be at the end of this major arc. If you have followed the drama so far,
  the point that they have to make things this elaborate is also to get things
  going, but also maybe, to get this over with so they can actually get to the
  actual topic of this Anime: the harem. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like really, it's no joke now
  that it's all over. Or maybe I'm wrong we may get more of the micro planning
  crap again just in other forms. But I hope not, and I wish for this series to
  move on from this entertainment whatever stuff and really show me what a harem
  is truly like in an Anime haha. I know I only have "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou" target="_blank">Nagasarete Airantou</a>" in my watch portfolio but you know, it's a good reference lol
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tehe" target="_blank">Tehe</a>!"
  Haha best summary of this episode from Kuroha lol somehow the author hinting
  that "childhood friend" on the title may not be just anyone but specifically her
  who did grow up with Sueharu]

Well it's not the best I've heard even this month but you know, I could use some emotional songs, and they have them. So I'll take it haha it's for Anime too huh and that's how I can talk to people about this while not being able to talk about how more awesome the B-sides were compared to the topic song haha oh well</div><div>
  <br />
  On news concerning music and it's on Twitter which is within my radar because I probably didn't spend enough time to look around and/or even look at YouTube content that is not music lol, if you missed <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1395730070061281280?s=20" target="_blank">RYTHEM's revival livestream</a></b> even just the intro it's still on YouTube and it's more exciting than Kuso Iinkai (lol me) but yes <b>RYTHEM is returning under a new label</b>&nbsp;(ie. not Sony Music Japan) which is the one Niitsu Yui was on 2 years ago after she re-branded her solo career under her actual name, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1396001345132322821?s=20" target="_blank">TrySail's new music video</a></b>&nbsp;(preview, as usual) might make me not give the single a listen next month (but as with all Collection Artists because they are I'll still listen to the B-side), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1395719640660144135?s=20" target="_blank">Scenarioart suddenly announced a livestream for next week</a></b> featuring the new five-piece band so let's see what they got now, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1394986199828230150?s=20" target="_blank">Asakura Momo's new single is releasing in August</a></b> for an Anime I'll likely watch but we shall see, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1394864552701878274?s=20" target="_blank">Ryououshoku Shakai's sponsored livestream</a></b> if that is not obvious enough to promote their new song for that one drink is actually great so win win I guess, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1394653151752429572?s=20" target="_blank">Primary's yuiko announced their music library is going to be on music subscription services</a></b> on her (audio only) livestream (which I didn't... listen lol) and it is a surprise considering they are a doujin group which means you can only see them in Comiket as physical CDs but hey thanks anyways, and <b>you can read <a href="https://twitter.com/higehiro_anime/status/1394585901070651397?s=20" target="_blank">this Tweet</a> yourself</b> lol yeah it's about the opening and ending theme song singles for Anime "HigeHiro".&nbsp;</div><div><br />So for next week, I wouldn't even say it's long awaited because <b>Komatsu Mikako's new single</b> is already like a 3 year wait to be honest (Okay maybe 2 years if you count <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/inochi-hamu-soul/1491312430?i=1491312432&amp;l=en" target="_blank">that one song for Anime "Babylon"</a> which I ended up liking it anyways hehe) and <b>Polkadot Stingray's new EP</b> I didn't even know it's happening until like the start of this month? Yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, never too late anyways so I'll catch those on time upcoming Wednesday... when there's a public holiday and I have ALL the time to listen to them MUAHAHAHAHA (FINALLY)<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />And that will be all this week. Man, that was quite a lot, eh? I really wonder why I don't look at this and be amazed at my effort every single week lol. Maybe because now what I do in my free time is taking a toll on what I want
  to do so much so my sis is interested in the stuff I do? (lol) Which is Klassic
  Note ironically in case you wonder haha and how automation has slowly changed my... attention span for those things now even just listening to new songs feels like pain, let alone things not Klassic Note which is for example, here. Because how to say, I have been
  thinking every weekend what I shall do, and somehow it's not grinding mobile
  games (<span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>) or catching on livestreams from VTubers and even voice
  actresses today. I can't believe I say that, but it's tiring. I used to spend
  so much time and have so much fun playing video games even if it's The Sims 3 (haha yes The Sims 4
  sucks blah blah blah)</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm getting old haha cya
  guys next week<br />
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. As I looked through my older blog posts (like, very old lol), I noticed I
  talked about what I would put almost every day as my wallpaper every week. But
