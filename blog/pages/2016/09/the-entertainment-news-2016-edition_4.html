Ugh, my stomach hurts too much not from eating but the thought of just thinking of my future. I've been dabbling a lot of this stuff I cannot put on my portfolio, and too little time being a member of society. Haiz, looks like I may have to bullhead through this one. Not soon though, because this'll take about... nine months at least. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>Yes another episode, huh. Feels like yesterday when the previous episode is out lol. The episode talks about a couple of things. Firstly, that "treasure". It lines up easily with what Imari-chan and Colette-chan and even Tachibana-sensei is finding, and they can't seem to get rid of it. Well, at least there's Uchimaki taking one for the ladies. Then, there's a love triangle. Which is good, almost. That guy I don't remember his name that didn't win Uchimaki is back for another duel, with drawing Usami-chan as the challenge. Well, considering that guy doesn't really know how to draw well (I suppose) and has never met such a friendly girl who just wants some competition for her crush, I guess it's kind of great. Now I want to only see this side of the romance in this show haha. Lastly, Moeka. I'm in for the mother (for obvious reasons, and it's not I'm MILF lol) (don't look that up please), but then kids are great. Especially mature and obedient ones. Well, as obedient as it inhibits their freedom of actions of course. Which reminds us that things don't have to be going serious and that freedom shouldn't be taught with a ruleset, but a whitelist of exclusions instead. Otherwise we'll be dealing with a Moeka who doesn't have to be tied to the mother while she's cooking lol. Also, her sense of superiority is real wrong. That or maybe we should let her go hug the president haha<br />P.S. Owara Ari for most valuable voice actress this show. Usami-chan just gets cuter with her voice around xD Also, because I can fix an image from the show, this one below is a gift haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSCkldH9PiQ/V8uuCLw4vlI/AAAAAAAAacc/Lz7ju6-dAQEq1iBN-z0fYdmQT4_xRZWqwCLcB/s320/konobi09_usami.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="265" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A cute pose you'd do if asked for it in 10 seconds? I can't do it, Usami-chan. you're good.</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Time Travel Shoujo: </b>Hey! More Mari-chan! Can they reduce the number of cute girls in Anime soon? lol Anyways, this episode. It continues from last week where I talked about Mari-chan coincidentally landing on the location where Bell is to showcase the telephone as persuaded by the father (Mari-chan's), and yes it's just a part of history. Sure is easy to say, but then again there are a lot more things in this story. The truth is out at least within the family (hopefully Mari-chan won't be depressed about the mother not letting her use that teleporter anymore haha), and that finally that Mikage is intending to take action. Well, he kind of did when he told the underling to steal the book anyways, so... yeah. Also, if things are going to get wrecked it better be more than that armillary compass failing, yes? I have a feeling the ending may be too epic for me to comprehend, which may turn out to be just a fight scene or two lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L7o0MVZ5GdU/V8u1ue-pL7I/AAAAAAAAacs/9lWIW61XWwcUfzwbb0asTuopMbFUNzpBQCLcB/s320/timetravelshoujo09_compass.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Please let this be the real future. Please, someone. Then again engineering this will be a b**ch, huh.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Nagasarete Airantou: </b>Okay first things first. There are two Beniyasha. Yeah. Likely the same accomplice and also a novice (I just don't know which one it is), they lead the others to solve the mystery without Ikuto around. Well, Ayane gets most of the credit this time (with a lot of help with her penguin-like sidekick) and we're close to the answer. Will anyone stand a chance against the Beniyasha duo to stop them from stealing the sealed treasure? With Ikuto first on the line, my guess is a no. Then again, we shall see.<br />P.S. Thanks for the three pages of pure ecchi stuff Takeshi-sensei; it sure was tantalising for me lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQRc3hTIsnM/V8o1fJOc74I/AAAAAAAAab0/oTRaawh5D-ETr_2_GG9Ki-ZVKWKYxrOtQCLcB/s1600/airantou146_giraffe.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="171" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQRc3hTIsnM/V8o1fJOc74I/AAAAAAAAab0/oTRaawh5D-ETr_2_GG9Ki-ZVKWKYxrOtQCLcB/s320/airantou146_giraffe.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Giraffe porn, everybody. This is so wrong. Just, so wrong...</td></tr></tbody></table><b>A Channel: </b>The tests are coming for the girls again, and hey why not form a study group? (For me I just...) And yes, Run-chan is her own weird self, Tooru is just here to supervise her, Nagi-chan gets cozy in Run-chan's house and Yuuko just wants to get cozy with Nagi haha. Hey, it all comes around. Also, let's get a quote fro Tooru-sensei shall we? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g7UWPajUHbs/V8o32UIv-UI/AAAAAAAAacA/T7oWVQx2p1g2f6Luxz6agZIe1AIhKBucwCLcB/s1600/a-ch91_genius.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="228" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g7UWPajUHbs/V8o32UIv-UI/AAAAAAAAacA/T7oWVQx2p1g2f6Luxz6agZIe1AIhKBucwCLcB/s320/a-ch91_genius.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">That didn't work for me, Tooru-sensei.

Maybe I should start naming the chapters already. *thinks for a while* Maybe not.<br /><br /><b>Tonari no Kashiwagi-san: </b>YES! He has done it! And yes, the reply will unfortunately come next chapter, along with the final volume. Goddammit Shimotsuki-sensei! How can you do this??<br />On the other hand, the other couple is doing well, seeing as how much Sayaka-chan has done for Kazu-kun is admirable. THAT is love, ladies and gentlemen. And will Kotone get the direct call and agree? We're chapters away from the end (which will probably be next year for me anyway lol), and I'm excited. It's these romance stories that keep me going lol. Hey, mine was 10 years ago and it didn't even enough to write a chapter about it, okay? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span><br />P.S. How perfect is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/tOYUAcqJv1A?t=1m20s" target="_blank">this song's chorus</a> synced perfectly the moment I looked at the confession page of this chapter? It may not be a love song, but still. I love these kinds of coincidences...<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PEFgzSWZzt4/V8waMCIUMDI/AAAAAAAAac8/jS_t8A1qAqUReKjRlx_UriUnzIdZ4YrhACLcB/s320/kashiwagi77_hug.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You deserve a hug, Sayaka-chan.

(Sucks because I'll miss the special gift campaign I cannot participate in anyway lolol) Then again the single isn't much until I talk about it in the review probably tomorrow if I have the time (you bet I will screw internship haha), so that is that. I also took the liberty to read cinema staff's Tweets and found out they are in a live (which is probably over in Japan by now) with "plenty", and yes that name is a band. Sound a lot like OGRE YOU ASSHOLE if you know who they are, otherwise they maybe a little off, and first impressions are great. Their live performances each year are on YouTube, and I've been reviewing <b>plenty's album from last year</b> in preparation for their latest one releasing end of the month, it seems. We shall see. They're style is pretty good. Most of the time it's the melodies that make me dissatisfied, I guess.<br /><br /><b>FLOWER FLOWER's new single</b> in like, two years is coming next week, so that's something to look forward to considering I didn't hear anything in preview. <b>Ten-chan's first album</b> also comes next week, and its topic song already got a TV show credit. Yay Ten-chan. But then considering I miss TrySail's radio show real often (they play during Tuesday dinners here man) I have so far only known about two of the new songs available. So we shall see. I like a black box review, along with FLOWER FLOWER too, it seems. In other news, Q-MHz probably screwed up <b>Mikakoshi's new single</b> already (I don't know; it seems different from the album early this year), and <b>the new WORKING!!</b> is getting theme songs the same way they have been done, three girls for opening and three guys for ending. This is going to be great. Can't wait.<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I'm too moody to think of entertainment now (I'm drowning in YouTube videos and I only watched the Anime episodes today), and until next time... I really need to get my lazy ass off. Seriously. Cya guys then, and until next time... I need someone in my life. And it's definitely not my family. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span><br /><br />[P.S. Don't miss the Ikimonogakari's new single review, yes? I took time to write it. It was like... 5 minutes lol]<br />[P.P.S. You're lucky to open some of those images in full size because I forgot to resize them and re-captioning in Blogger is troublesome.
