<div class="header"></div>
It's another week, it's another week of... everything, it seems. Dad's questioning my presence at home instead of school (no I'm not skipping it), I'm hooked to more video games (well only one actually), and I can't stop myself from not listening to new songs. Okay, let's move on haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>And that's why you shouldn't just watch using a 3-episode rule. Introducing a new character now, halfway into the series? I don't know about that.<br />The episode brings us the last of the main characters, Imari Maria. I mean, they mentioned enough of her name I can write it down without referring to the video again. (Then again I saw her name coming from the website already lol) And yes, this one is special because she can communicate with the blockhead that is Uchimaki, and yes, she is a "Manga and stuff" lover. Perhaps a little too much, really. I just didn't think using too much Anime quotes in real life will shock a kid enough to let go of his balloon haha. Anyways, this is going to spice up the Usami-Uchimaki relationship, and that's actually the point, and I guess I can like it, just like Usami will like Imari-chan too. Yes, Uchimaki is solid as a rock. &lt;Insert boob squeeze image here&gt; (You know I won't) (No not even at the end of this post) But then that's the point; this is a comedy slice-of-life. And unless you're WORKING!!, no one will go out dating. Then again, the jokes are fabulous as usual, and I had a good laugh. If Imigimuru-sensei wrote Usami's imagination about Uchimaki piggybacking Imari, that is in the animation's credit for making it awesome haha. But yeah, I have a feeling Usami is thinking too much into it, just like how any of them will ever see her underskirt when Maria just jumps to the tree basically showing her panties to even that kid. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Really, the jokes never end with this cast of characters. And truly, this show really does have a problem. And I won't say "Art Club" until Imari-chan joins it. Which is about like, next episode I suppose lol<br />P.S. Didn't notice but Touyama Nao sounds so like Mikakoshi. Don't mind me girls, just an opinion.<br />P.P.S. Damn I miss the mother already <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> And I almost misspelt (and fixed) the title again. Thanks, Moeka-chan.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v2GjMeUd2wk/V621Zki3lLI/AAAAAAAAZ9Q/qcwbXGCLSOAqAnoLPlliapFXQR8qOT44wCLcB/s320/konobi06_sketch.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This must be the animation team's laziest drawing ever lol</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Time Travel Shoujo:</b> And yes, here is another episode of someone feeling lost. And this time, it's Waka-chan. The episode just takes it a step further to ridicule Faraday to be stealing the experiment from his superior without agreement, and yes it's not going well for him. Unfortunately, it's worse for Waka-chan, but then not really. Mari-chan just forgot somehow after like, 3 episodes? Yeah, she didn't tell Shun what her father told her. Then again, all is well again, I guess, and on the antagonists' side, we have more info. Now about a book, that doesn't lose its text after time travel now. Oh well, all this sounds absurd up till now, and will only likely be resolved within the last 2 episodes, so I'll just enjoy the fun in the meantime, yes?<br />P.S. Only in Anime will Aki-chan sound like the best friend to care for you ever. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wfuynp8fj68/V68Fk62A3BI/AAAAAAAAZ-U/9XNwI2JxE-EJ8KKzpzFr9XXJ1Gpm-8nlwCLcB/s320/timetravelshoujo06_waka.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">There's a lot of crying all episode, so I picked the best one.<br />(Mina-chan you're great at "crying" xD)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Tonari no Kashiwagi-san: </b>Even though the exciting part is next chapter (probably), but this one has already made its impact. The guys had Christmas celebrations also in conjunction of sending Tina-chan back home to Germany, but then again it was fun. (Seriously I want to see Anime adaptation so they can make one page of the manga awesome haha) But of course, gifts. And Tina-chan may not want to go home, Kou definitely will make her regret the decision. It's real close to proposal, but you know, it's just a ring. He didn't emphasise on anything. Not yet, anyway. Nonetheless, two more couples are left on this wonderful day in Japan (you know, Christmas is A THING in Japan), so that's going to make the next chapter a whole lot more interesting. Yuuto is picking up his courage from the ground, so we may be in for something. I'm looking forward to (next month) it already.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="188" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BOtxObRkKzw/V66AOTyA8bI/AAAAAAAAZ-E/SwYKl-JawR0j8RRTjAT2uU17k-Y4JQt0QCLcB/s200/kashiwagi76_tina.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">All good things must come to an end, Tina-chan. So is this story lol</td></tr></tbody></table>Also, <b>no BLEACH</b>. For the last time probably, no last chapter. Yet.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>After some awakening from the past year songs of Klassic Note (yeah they sounded out to me lol) and continuing my choices for giving new songs, I've finally settled on how many I would be giving after all. <b>nano.RIPE's new single</b> makes me miss all of her songs till this year, <b>Goose house's new single</b> is good enough I just love the chorus (both their singing and the main part of the song), I picked up <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new single </b>to give just one song which is not the first one on the list, and instead of SHISHAMO I gave another song from that <b>Shin Rizumu's debut album</b>.<br /><br />There may not be much this week, and I have been hesitating in giving songs this week besides the above early this week, then again I've been listening to future releases.<b> Aimer's new single</b> has more potential than her previous one that I missed, <b>wacci</b> (remember KimiUso?) is releasing their album at the end of the month so I'll listen to the released new single until then, <b>Aki-chan's new single</b> previews sound like when I heard Mina-chan's earlier this year (a hit and a miss), and <b>Ikimonogakari's new song</b> will make a huge difference to when I'll be doing my next review. We shall see about that last one, though. It isn't that impressive, honestly. Also, <b>THE ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE</b> is following wacci's approach by releasing a single (in this case digital only) and an album later in the year, and I think I'm enjoying it till now. Hey, who says there aren't songs to listen this month?<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I feel tired typing using my nails on a sticky keyboard (like, literally), so I better finish this quick to I can clean things up. (Audience: What the hell is you room like anyway?) Seirously, you don't want to know what's in my room. Anyways, cya guys till next week, and until then... the Olympics? Fiji isn't the only country grabbing their gold medal this week. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br />[P.S.: No I'm not a citizen of Fiji lol. And yes, it isn't pictures of women I like haha. I'm still getting used to not typing this last part.]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
