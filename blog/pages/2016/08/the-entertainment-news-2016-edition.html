<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Been thinking about life recently. Totally because there's internship coming my way and I'm nowhere in it yet. That's the problem. Okay, let's move on. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Kono Bijutsu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!:</b> Another week, another episode. Hey, who says they can't advance the romance in this slice-of-life show?<br />The episode starts with a mysterious other room of the Art Club where it hosts its storage. Rather unknown to the club besides the President, it comes with a very rusty sliding door as the entrance. And yes, like typical romance shows, Usami and Uchimaki must be stuck in there in the evening of the school day. Hey, it's a roller coaster for Usami, but not for Uchimaki and his 2D wife. That wife can do amazing things, like shining out of its eyes (I wish it'd be somewhere else, but...) (lol) and scaring the teacher scouting around at night (lolol). Also, Imari-san came over (I don't know why she isn't in this club yet though) and apparently ended up in a treasure hunt. Unfortunately the "treasure" isn't something great even though it's of good reason why it is hidden this well, but yes, they're talking about that Hentai magazine next week too haha<br />P.S. I can post as many images as I want because I have the inner urge (lol Colette listening to Sumipe songs), but I shall refrain myself because jokes are to be remembered. And shared of course. That's why there's one lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cwBKs8ir0hE/V8F7Myz9KKI/AAAAAAAAaTA/-LrsSkW0zWgrQQ91itb-VOBRYX3--0FWQCPcB/s320/konobi08_usami.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The face when you notice you potentially have to spend the night with that someone.<br />(I know, Usami-san. Rabbits. I know.)</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Time Travel Shoujo: </b>Hey, more development! Now we're talking about it. This episode brings a summer episode. Come on, you know it's coming. Rather than be disappointed about the lack of bikini (Talking about you, Mari-chan), we focus on the prescence of the bad guys. Yes, they are bad now because someone's trying to steal the book, and the others are setting up surveillance in the lab as everyone is enjoying themselves in the beach. And yes, Mari-chan had to send herself back to the past, with good hope that Waka-chan and Mari-chan's younger sister is behind her and that Mari-chan probably will go to the past to meet the father and Graham Bell in the exhibition so that telephony can become a reality in the future and Mari can explain things to her father in today's time. See? This show is too easy to read. Hopefully everything will come together so that all the guys can summon their inner Bruce Lee and have a good fight out on whether... I mean, science does somehow get in the way of everything. Even if I tell you Mari's father is probably finding out the technology that his daughter is making int he future? Haha this show has plenty to uncover, so hold your breath until then, yes?<br />P.S. Man, that fence jumping in the opening theme, Shun-nii. I bet that will make me super cool haha. But I swear if I try to jump over any fence I'll get caught haha (No I'm not talking about Pokemon GO lol)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_b72MjYByAQ/V8GDR_YZV6I/AAAAAAAAaTM/XaMXlSRVSD0ICmZ6tZ9KvkEjYhINW3rhQCLcB/s320/timetravelshoujo08_beach.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">YES! <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />(Yeah why the hell Mari-chan is in that swimsuit?

This everyday life thing sure is fun haha. Tooru visits (*searches for name* Ok I got it lol) Yuuko's house where her sister Kei starts getting worried as how Tooru gets worried of (*searches for name again* Dammit this once in a blue moon release...) Run-chan expanding her social circle. But then again, considering I'm male and I also worry, then this shouldn't be abnormal. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gZ9MyQL84sU/V7xeFCGIdsI/AAAAAAAAaOI/K441CVqp3IIxxh95rX49L5zqCsOq7oWmgCLcB/s1600/a-ch90_smile.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="231" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gZ9MyQL84sU/V7xeFCGIdsI/AAAAAAAAaOI/K441CVqp3IIxxh95rX49L5zqCsOq7oWmgCLcB/s320/a-ch90_smile.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yuuko said Tooru hasn't been smiling in a while, so here it is.<br />(The right was Kei-chan btw)</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Kuroshitsuji: </b>Another chapter leading to the intentions of the ball. Then again we get half the chapter a recall to how the Phantomhive hall came to be in like, two weeks. That, and the reapers have been investigating. We're introduced to fundamental blood types with that Green Witch, and then someone here may have known who's really behind all this. It may be a farce, but it's not going to cover the truth for long, I guess.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--IxVvmzkrmo/V7xgp9E5l_I/AAAAAAAAaOU/rTvYuMF2VGA5PFqCEZCygLvDQnwbK2bmgCLcB/s1600/blackbutler119_19.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--IxVvmzkrmo/V7xgp9E5l_I/AAAAAAAAaOU/rTvYuMF2VGA5PFqCEZCygLvDQnwbK2bmgCLcB/s320/blackbutler119_19.png" width="125" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You may not recognise half of them, but after they transform you'll recognise none haha</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Nagasarete Airantou: </b>Yeah, even I've lost direction on where this is at already. The most I can remember is the guys on the island are battling Beniyasha, and is, if you didn't know, just a disguised mother of Shinobu (the girl obsessed with technology) so she can write her next novel lol. Other than that, they are close to solving the mystery, and amongst the nosebleeding and panties and partially nude girls, Ikuto has prevailed (somehow) and given the last clue. Well, it'll not be out until I know of the next chapter (it's taking its time for sure), but little do I notice that I've actually reached the 24th volume of this series. Wow. Now to catch up to Seitokai Yakuindomo too; that manga also is long as hell too.<br />P.S. Now I need to find a clean image to put in this post. Sure is tough for this manga lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xVn79wDkrUA/V8JURz912_I/AAAAAAAAaTc/UKdb1Mw4D00dgebeBVUamwQuk3fUzxwuwCLcB/s320/airantou145_beniyasha.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="240" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sorry for spoilers, or otherwise you'll be seeing panties lol<br />(Kind of shows Beniyasha's ruthless yet kind side, you see)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Another week in (I know, I used these phrases a lot as intro) Klassic Note, another bunch of releases. <b>Ikimonogakari's new single</b> got the flag of approval, but so is also Aki-chan's new single due next week, but we'll talk about that a little later. This week also brings a couple more releases which I swear I didn't remember until this week lol. <b>AOP's new single</b> for the Anime "Time Travel Shoujo" isn't half bad, so that's good news because I don't think I want to give the ending theme song anyway haha. <b>Cocco's new album</b> in two years (which explains why I don't even know her in the first place) after her performance of its topic song in TV when I just wanted some performance from Aimer (I told you it's a long story) left an impression, and I'm here to give a song or two. Actually, I gave three. Hey, she can write songs despite her age, you know. (Not guessing it btw, and neither should you) I'm likely giving the thumbs up for (because "7!!" looks stupid in text)&nbsp;<b>Nanae's&nbsp;new single</b> topic song because it's summer (still), and I've gotten myself some more live performance videos so I shall see if I can give a couple more songs or not.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">I can't stop liking her songs, this Toyosaki Aki-chan.<br /><br />When it comes to pre-order, she breaks records in Klassic Note. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/768799855565082631" target="_blank">August 25, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />Next week brings us the long awaited (now that it is) <b>Toyosaki Aki's new single</b>, in which this and the reviews for both singles (refer above paragraph) will likely be done during next week. I'll do it, screw school haha. More previews of songs have also surfaced, including <b>Amamiya "Ten-chan" Sora's first album</b> topic song "<a href="http://www.amamiyasora.jp/artist/amamiyasora/video/9056" target="_blank">Absolute BLUE</a>" (which sounds freaking cool btw), <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/769073121731248128" target="_blank"><b>Numakura Manami's solo debut song</b></a> (that scream man; the last time I heard one was Yocchan), and many else that I probably forgot lol. Anyways, I see a great next month in front of us, not forgetting I still can source for new songs, so that's great. Adding on, the weekend of Anisama (if you didn't know what it is) brings a lot of great performances from Tomacchan, Ayahi-chan, TrySail and news that will shock me. Well, we have confirmation now, so that's great. I really wonder what'll Asakura "Mocho" Momo sing in an Anime movie insert song.... Hey, you tell me.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">"HoneyWorks meets TrySail"? Asakura Momo solo debut? That's the best news I've heard in weeks!<br /><br />Ah, the Anime industry is awesome...</div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/769852145780731904" target="_blank">August 28, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br /><br /><br />That's it, if I didn't forget. Maybe next time I need to pre-record things that happen in the world of Klassic Note too already haha. (lol "world") Okay, I guess I need to go rest now. Well, mentally because I can't take it the moment I leave my comfort zone. Well, not for music and entertainment though. Cya guys next week, and until then... don't think I forgot about APoL. It's different from getting a job, but this project is eternal. I'm determined to complete it somehow.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
