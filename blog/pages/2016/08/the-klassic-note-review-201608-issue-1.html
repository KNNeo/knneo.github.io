Also the only issue for the month. Aki-chan's new single will likely come next month. I mean, it's like 2 days to the end of this month.<br><br>Forgive me if you wish to tell me how dumb I am to getting a single with a repeat song, but then again it's like that in Japan. This is their best way to release content. Then again, this song has quite a meaning, as I will mention below.<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=IkimonoLastScene><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span><span style=font-size:large> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Ikimonogakari - Last Scene/Bokura no Yume [Single]</div></blockquote><div style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy class=mfp-img src=http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/32/ESCL-4659.jpg height=320 style=max-height:979px width=320></div>(Them today, and them before their major debut, if I'm not wrong. I barely even know them back then.)<br><br>Origin: Let this be known. I'm doing a commemorating review for one of the honorary artists within Klassic Note. Yes, (album cover, from left to right) Mizuno, Kiyoe, Hotaka, you guys have made it. It's been ten years. Ten years of never ending music, giving us the smiles and emotions through all these years. Well, I didn't join in the full ten years, but I was close. I remember the first time I heard of them is from Anime "BLEACH" (RIP btw) and then it was a lively song. And after listening to a couple more songs and in 2008, the supposed first year in Klassic Note, I've been impressed to the extent that they are one of the "highest contributed artists in Klassic Note", as I used to determine how many songs I've heard form them. This single though, it may not be representative of the fabulous tunes they have provided, but it's one to remember. Remember about half a year ago I was reviewing their 10th year best album (this was their second), and now we are here. moving on as they usually do. Not all melodies can hit, but hey, the mood of the songs are things to remember, and is rather unique in them, I must say.<br><br>(1) Last Scene<br>No, it's not some final performance of any kind. The song itself sure feels like it though. We're presented with a pure Mizuno production here this time round (I know Hotaka, mood swings), and he has always been known to create tunes for many occasions, typically on demand to be honest. This song also took credit to the real life movie from Anime "Shigatsu was Kimi no Uso" (which I'll likely not be watching), but the song is good enough. It may be long, as typical of Ikimonogakari anyway, but the mood of the song is always a hit with me. The lyrics also sing to me of the feelings of love, and losing such love is also typical in the love songs presented by them. If you want another love song from them, then this is right up your alley. The music video compliments the understanding of this song by putting Kiyoe as one of the actors of a love story, even if it's a sad one. Not fantastic, but fan recommended for sure.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Below Average)<br><br>(2) Bokura no Yume [Our Dream]<br><blockquote class=tr_bq> <i>"[From The Klassic Note Review 2016.04 Issue 2] ...I can accept an average long typical pop style song from them again. I've been giving chances, and this song I cannot miss. Even if the "baby" thing is irritating and it doesn't mean Kiyoe or anything..."</i></blockquote>I may have been sarcastic when I was <a href=../../2016/04/the-klassic-note-review-201604-issue-2.html>reviewing the 3CD album</a>, but half a year down this was actually, amongst the songs I gave, the best one I ever remembered. Maybe because the 'baby' thing is easy to remember too. Overall a good song, I must say. Then again I've been liking it too much by playing it too often haha<br>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br><br>Conclusion: Overall a decent single. Not their best, but then again it's not their worst, I suppose. I've been listening to them all these years, and I'm glad they reached their 10th year before Klassic Note reaches theirs. This single, probably for fans only. To remember how much we all have loved their songs, and Kiyoe will always be our songbird. To all of Ikimonogakari, this one is for you guys.<br><br>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br><br>THE PACKAGE<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=236 src=https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bHKYv42I3LE/V8VK6dMfDjI/AAAAAAAAaag/59BERSCG7jctmrYjYUSU9m8XfPb_RgIWwCLcB/s320/IMG_20160830_161712.jpg width=320></div>Well, unboxing time. Too bad it's just a single so it probably isn't much. There is another nostalgic image of them inside the booklet, but I guess I'll keep that luxury to myself haha. Otherwise, the Ikimono cards are probably things to live by by now, and... that is it, actually. I've been expecting this for quite a while already, so... I may not be that hyped to when I heard from their music video weeks ago, I guess.<br><br><br>This is it. Stay tuned for the weekend probably (if I can get the delivery going) for Aki-chan's new single. I'll be preparing for it, if you need a hint. I've not even heard the full songs yet. This is another level of fandom in Japanese music already, apart from Ikimono above of course.<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
