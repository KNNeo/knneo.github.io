Wow we're starting this new month with a long issue. Yeah, you bet I'm doing it. I've already done it actually (lol), but then again it's to keep the best first impressions. Yes, enjoy reading. Also, probably won't be this long next week already, so please come back next week, okay? More images to facilitate reading too, to make sure even I will be interested in reading.<br /><br />Why I so happy? I'm more like, relieved, after weeks of tension. It's not over though. It's just I'm taking painkillers now if you get what I mean haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>WWW.WORKING!!: </b>Wow, I'm amazed.<br /><br />Let's talk about how much this show is reminiscent of the original series. Well, you got a family restaurant with a bunch of weird people. And to whoever has watched the whole Anime series (including me) then this would come out as too much information to remember of most of the members introduced in this series. Otherwise, it'll just come out as weird as you'd probably need a long time to get used to the bunch of weird people (WTF?) in this workplace. Higashida has a solid foundation of why he works here, but I have a feeling the family is just in cahoots to convince him to work part-time, which will not be surprising after all. Miyakoshi-san is a strong yet funny woman to talk about to say the least, because if you think it's a prank for her to make chocolates I'm highly doubting about her cooking skills lol. Shiho-san (as I will refer to from now) is rich, we're not spoiled on why she is working in a restaurant anyways, but somehow she is the most materialistic woman I've seen in any Anime. I mean, she gives out money, man. That's gotta be something. And she pranks that poor guy Yuuta-kun without a change of face. Well that, I'll have you guys figure it out. Things are working out for that poor freak though, even though his current circumstances of having to work many jobs and taking leftovers from the food chain is not without reason. Sayuri-chan (because she's kinda cute) seems to be the most normal person in the shop, but then again as Higashida may have mentioned she has some eye for spiritual beings? Yeah, that's going to freak someone out. Adachi and Kendou are the guys in the kitchen, and they seem most normal for now, I guess. But hey, never judge a person by his cover, I would say. Kisaki-san is the last of the main staff (the manager later), and besides smoking her favourite past time is slacking off and making people think of her crazy knowledge she learnt from university. Problem is Higashida is as smart as her being a high school student so she's going to get to work somehow. The manager Sakaki seems to have a connection with Miyakoshi-san, as in being a target of violence. Hey, can't hurt with some cigarettes, violence and slapping of cash, right? This show got all the wrong stuff covered.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kVlCQn-_9Ko/V_B1jefEVeI/AAAAAAAAa4M/VzBozeV7GP4lKORkXRMCyZAe9XTfxTzewCLcB/s320/www1_money.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">That's sincerity right there lol</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: x-small;">(Where the f*** did Shiho-san learn this??)</span></td></tr></tbody></table>All in all, I'm impressed. Even the opening theme song. It's fast-paced and real catchy. I think I'll grow to like this show a lot. Man Shiho-san please slam all the money you have on me please!! (I'm talking about Ten-chan here, but we can talk about that in future episodes xD) Anyways, this is something to watch if you liked the original, the weird stuff here are a lot more practical as it seems (I mean, I saw a katana somewhere in the ending) so it may be more to relate to...? Forget I said that. This show is just going to be a whole lot LOLs from here on.<br />P.S. The kitchen staff are probably weird too. They mentioned about being special in their floor. Hmm... I'm curious. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />P.P.S. I'm starting the series with a bang! So two images!!

Turns out it was all decoy and the real McCoy has been seeking guidance from the true ruler of the island Kairyuu-sama, but then again we only know of this much. That obviously is a lot more interesting than Ayane turning into I don't know what and fighting a fake, and whatever is happening in the real Japan that is a coincidence of whatever sorts. All in all, this has ended, but we're let with new clues. Books apparently are still able to pass between these worlds, which is a good sign of all of them reuniting, for good or for worse. Let's hope it's not like an apocalypse thing where everyone wants to know of that mysterious island. Someone is feeling guilty as of right now...<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M9acHbkWmW8/V-zx85v1DaI/AAAAAAAAa1c/ybvEMSNpLRENOM65JA8UYUTa81YaiHoqQCLcB/s320/airantou147_shrine.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="223" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I hope this is not too much spoilers. Well, read it to find out yourself.</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Kuroshitsuji:</b> It's a Halloween special! Well, it's more like a nostalgic route down memory lane as Ciel lights up the spirits and everything else in between on the story thus far. I hope Yana-sensei will also take this time to remember that Ciel has to grow up, otherwise a yearly celebration will be real stupid. But then again it's her story, so I don't really care haha. Otherwise, I like the details she puts in every time, and I appreciate myself reading through it all too. The art is amazing BTW<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3gCQ8bQeAR4/V_D08Gi6LkI/AAAAAAAAa5I/iILD13IaW88bx0dXjqqflEvlq1u05xNawCLcB/s320/kuroshitsuji120_lights.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="259" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Man, Ciel's past is kicking inside him right now.<br />(Even though he's only 13)</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>From head in a box to pool cleaning to shadow games with Moeka-chan to Usami-san's classmates to whoever that guy is... you know, the manga has everything the Anime has to offer. Also, the manga feels more connected than the Anime, but then again in an adaptation these kind of things happen, so I guess it's fine. Actually, it's pretty well done as far as I can cross-reference them. (Well I'm just enjoying the manga being animated haha) Chapter 19.1 was funny in that they were eating lollipops and the prank for Uchimaki-kun did not work lol.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I2R3zu8nfLE/V_CoI4fc5mI/AAAAAAAAa4g/-m6NeO9VO7YJYSsw4kBCoJB5fAmq45zpwCLcB/s320/img000012.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_DNXigaAGKM/V_CoJ79mMYI/AAAAAAAAa4k/sC7w58rAhM81kNWZ9gmHpU21EeMGY7zVACLcB/s1600/img000023.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_DNXigaAGKM/V_CoJ79mMYI/AAAAAAAAa4k/sC7w58rAhM81kNWZ9gmHpU21EeMGY7zVACLcB/s320/img000023.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Lol Uchimaki-kun #paedophile</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Man this manga doesn't give a SH*T about<br />mature content at all lol</td></tr></tbody></table>More importantly, it's good to focus on the manga, in this case where the Anime has stopped, around Chapter 35 where a new character is introduced. (You thought that wouldn't happen, huh) She is Nonoka, a 3rd year like the President of the Art Club, if you remember. And if you don't remember, she is a childhood friend of his. Now that's where it gets interesting. I'll leave it for you guys to read on, but suffice it to say we now know of the reason why the President likes big boobs. But then again, he's so shallow about women, that man. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> There are a lot more hijinks than I can list them here, even including a cross-gender dressing (yeah you heard that right) and a whole lot more beach trips, but hey, I like this manga. Imigimuru-sensei has done an incredible job in using the best elements (I assume it's) he knows of well and making the story go all over the place so that jokes can lie... all over the place. Also, <strike>Nonoka-chan has a nice butt lol, and really,</strike> this story... I'll keep reading.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="173" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-okcbek6siq4/V_Co-b0YuYI/AAAAAAAAa4w/YLoccrjRtkcS7POdJEeGc2og0b-MzfBNgCEw/s200/img000003.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Satou Satomi-chan, if this show gets a second season...</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Nonoka (above) totally reminds me of a character in another Anime that runs a manga shop in an electric shop district, but less drunk and perverted. I mean, Tsumorin maybe awesome, but this Nonoka...<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UcBlKmFYqiE/V_Co9Cf3BGI/AAAAAAAAa4s/tO8BQmhmzHYYNegpqHvG5qjugKUfOXe8ACEw/s1600/img000006.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UcBlKmFYqiE/V_Co9Cf3BGI/AAAAAAAAa4s/tO8BQmhmzHYYNegpqHvG5qjugKUfOXe8ACEw/s320/img000006.png" width="320" /></a></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fKgnkA9XJKU/V_Co_KZ4p_I/AAAAAAAAa40/_zmk-1LMOXsXaLbYel_s29Xorqe9GKNDQCEw/s320/img000011.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="279" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Lol Kaori as novel writer. It was honest feelings though.<br />Nice one, Imigimuru-sensei.</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">If you know the context you'll get it.<br />Otherwise, it's manga, so you know it must be indecent lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>I have bad news. We may have been stalled for reviews. Then again this week isn't much, so that's fine. Unfortunately, this has also led me to <a href="../../2016/09/the-cost-effective-plan-part-2.html" >discuss about the possibilities of music streaming services to assist me in reviews and buying music selectively online so I can fill up my music collection on time</a>&nbsp;(also a long post), and am planning to do it starting December, where most of the new stuff is appearing, as I'm aware of from Twitter. Also, a good time to pick up the pieces of releases that have not been reviewed where at this time I'm only ripping off the music videos and pasting it in my music library. Ugh, the agony...<br /><br />In reviews, I haven't gotten my hands on <b>Aqua Timez' new single</b>, but I know from previews I'll be likely rejecting the only B-side, so that's fine. Also, their new album is coming end of the year, so that's more great songs to look forward to. Provided I get to hear them full. <span class="emoji" title="*sob*">😢</span><br /><br />Next week brings <b>KANA-BOON's new single</b> and <b>miwa's new single</b>, both I have given approval after listening to their respective music videos, and I think I'm in for a good time. I'll also take some time to listen to some other songs next week, maybe visit Audioleaf and Skream, of the many resources online. Damn this time of the year is NOT the best time to review music...<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I hope you have came to read this part before reading everything else above because you know it'll take time haha. On other things, I'm still rethinking the fate of APoL (I know, I'm stuck at the moment now), about my life, and everything else in between. <i>Does sharing an umbrella, having lunch together, and her calling me at night count as dating?</i> I don't know; this girl is pretty desperate... (Audience: Kind of explains your ecstatic mood now.) (Nah, a lot of good things happened this week. Met up with friends, secured an internship, amongst all things...)<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
