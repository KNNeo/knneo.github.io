"Android Studio vs APoL: The Great Battle"<br /><br />I'm just thinking of what to do for next week. Too lazy to do both, and want to do at least one of them. <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span> Such is life. (Audience: Or "No Life".) Yeah, I know. This weekly post is evidence of my character. Let's move on.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Assassination Classroom S2: </b>And they are left a couple of months and now what... Civil war??<br />Hmm, it seems Nagisa's plan to save Koro-sensei isn't going well with the class, and it is to be expected due to the nature of reasons that will arise from just thinking of whether to kill or not kill that octopus. (Personally, I'd still kill him because it's tough to protect a fugitive from the society even if he can be saved.) So yes, two camps have appeared (unsurprisingly split in half) (as half as possible) (that Ritsu AI still got to vote?), and that octopus has decided to make the class unified by killing each other. Hell yeah it's exciting, but then I guess it's an important process to bring them back on their track. It's "Assassination Classroom" anyway. Everyone's been "killed" one way or another, and it's left to the biggest enemies and greatest fighters Karma and Nagisa. Man, I wished it would end this episode, but that also means next week's will be great. I cannot wait.<br /><b>Bungou Stray Dogs: </b>Haha I had a great laugh. Today we talk about Edogawa Ranpo-san. And if you need an introduction or if you have NEVER watched Ranpo Kitan from last year (please help yourself to it; it was a great show celebrating the author's 50th death anniversary), this guy (and also if you read the Manga review I did a while ago) is a famous detective series author, and yes he specialises in writing detective cases. This is also a tribute to the person himself, and yes so does the guy in this show. He apparently is an ability user who can deduce crimes faster than anyone in the police can do, but not without a special condition. His glasses. (Audience: Hey quit the bullsh*ting already we know the answer) Yeah, he's not an ability user. The point the good side of ability users lies in a detective agency is also due to him, as he can deduce crimes even with the smallest of clues, as mentioned by Dazai. Dazai is smart too, being able to see through most of the crime, but I guess that's what makes Ranpo here special: He is just good. *salutes* The author of this show really gave this famous author its due respect and power man. I salute to both of them.<br />P.S. First thing that came to my mind when I hear someone got caught drifting in the river, and yes, if I'm the superintendent I've already ordered my troops to capture Dazai as a suspect first haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>BLEACH: </b>Okay, so that I do not get it wrong, it just got morning?<br />So this chapter, after the awesome attack from the shinigami, of course they should know of the fundamental "miracle" that is common sense, where the Quincy can just absorb spiritual particles so long as they are alive. Yes, that jerk is still alive. And now, we see the next morning arrive, which of course means the power levels of two people will change if you can recall, as Ishida has not killed the leader of the night at his strongest and Ichigo is going to meet his death lol. Fingers crossed.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Oh, I was so enjoying my solo karaoke session at home. (See, such a loner *points to self*) Thanks to a couple of HDMI cables and Joysound app for Android for this. Even though I'm not in Japan to have this for free (region restricted apparently), but still.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NBAJjf-nYck/Vy8okbZRooI/AAAAAAAAXL4/pV2_8IkDlWUvi06r9lZbC1IXPDYfmJs_QCLcB/s1600/Screenshot%2B%2528May%2B8%252C%2B2016%2B19_04_42%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NBAJjf-nYck/Vy8okbZRooI/AAAAAAAAXL4/pV2_8IkDlWUvi06r9lZbC1IXPDYfmJs_QCLcB/s320/Screenshot%2B%2528May%2B8%252C%2B2016%2B19_04_42%2529.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This one's for you, Inori-chan. #thelife</td></tr></tbody></table>And yes, as expected of myself from last week, I decided to venture to <a href="http://www.audioleaf.com/" target="_blank">Audioleaf </a>(first), if you guys would remember, is infamous in Klassic Note of creating miracles of importing new songs from indie artists into my list of songs. And yes, there is a result. In fact, two. A couple more artists have came under my microscope, namely <a href="http://jack.ro69.jp/contests/jack2015cdj/artists/32954" target="_blank"><b>titilulu</b></a> and <a href="http://jack.ro69.jp/contests/jack2016rijf/artists/33676" target="_blank"><b>Light Palette</b></a>, both participated in a indie live artist event <a href="http://jack.ro69.jp/contests/jack2016rijf" target="_blank">RO69JACK hosted by ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL</a> to promote indie artists. The latter artist participated in this year's event, so when you read this post you still have roughly about... 23 hours left to vote. (That big orange button) No restrictions, no registering. Once per device (I have three lol), and as many artists as you want. And yes, piqued by curiosity I managed to scour a couple more artists who are waiting for me to vote them so they get an increased chance for performing at a large stage. As I say, it may not be our business, but them getting famous just buy clicking a button... hey, I'll do it. And you should too.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="it"><a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote" target="_blank">@KlassicNote</a> arigato-!!!</div>â€” ãƒ©ã‚¤ãƒˆãƒ‘ãƒ¬ãƒƒãƒˆ (@light_palette) <a href="https://twitter.com/light_palette/status/728089857684176898" target="_blank">May 5, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />The other one came a longer route, this time from <a href="http://skream.jp/" target="_blank">Skream</a>. (Man, if you have no idea what I'm talking about please Google them for goodness sake) (or checking out the Twitter page would do) <b>The Floor</b> - and I'm not joking about the name - released a new song and also their first album and their latest music video... isn't as fascinating as their first music video for their debut single. Seriously. They are this-year new, so go check them out. Them and titilulu's music videos are added to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">my YouTube playlist</a>, so feel free to take a listen. As for Light Palette... here you go.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="189" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cErNuun8MMY" width="336"></iframe><br /></div>Man, I feel like a music promoter. Even though I'm not. Thanks for the recognition anyway. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> I'm still in consideration of another artist I heard over the weekend (<span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> chocol8 syndrome <span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span>) so I'll talk about it next week.<br /><br />Talking about next week, we have <b>TrySail's 4th single</b> in view of their first album by the end of the month, <b>SpecialThanks and their new mini-album</b> (let's see if I can give an English song this time round) along with <b>Luck Life's new single</b> for the Anime above are due next week,&nbsp;<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new music video</b> isn't impressive at all (reminded me of a song in their latest album which I REJECTED), and <b>cinema staff's new music video</b> is awesome as usual. Tsuzuri Zukuri's new scientific music video isn't great, and if you haven't <b>voted for VELTPUNCH</b>'s new song for their again major debut album then <a href="http://moonshine-inc.net/veltpunch/" target="_blank">please help yourself</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />Wow, so many things. But that is all, actually. Hopefully with this much things to do I'll be motivated to continue what I set out to do this holiday season so my sense of fulfilment can drown out the fact that... I'm actually not finding a part-time job over these three months lol. Cya guys next week, and until next time... music is life, people. Get a life, yes?<br /><br />[P.S.: Kana-chan this week is good enough.<br /><img alt="" aria-busy="true" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13177421_10154196558332460_8680096232224289382_n.jpg?oh=893362c178e5fc883d103a32df2359a5&amp;oe=579F3E34" /><br />Next week it's Tomacchan holding a pen and dressing up like she was sixteen. Something for you guys to think about until next week haha]<br /><br />[P.P.S.: <a href="https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/1274877/en" target="_blank">Aki-chan's self-drawn LINE stickers</a> are too cute. Not so much for the <a href="https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/1265575/en" target="_blank">other</a> <a href="https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/1265597/en" target="_blank">two</a> I know of lol. Makes me want to open a LINE account after I (supposedly) scraped one last year.]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
