I'm disappointed. From music deprivation. More below. I hope you had a great week, listening to music you've given like, two years ago lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Assassination Classroom S2: </b>Following the announcement of the new Call of Duty game, I'm naming this latest episode "Assassination Classroom: Infinite Assassinations"!! LOL<br />Anyways, the episode. It's not far-fetched to call the space trip ridiculous, but then it is. Okay, that aside, they did manage to get the relevant data, and for once Ritsu is happy. The process is as preposterous as it sounds, but yes many thing are factual. For example, if you don't know how many things get destroyed just from one space liftoff? Yeah, that's a budget that will suck. Then again the astronauts are surprised at Karma and Nagisa's abilities (man, they know nothing about them at all lol), and they had a blast when they are up there, somehow. The result? Somehow the class has seen this substance that can be used to cure the octopus before, and thus is easy to make. That's it. Now what? From the class, to Nagisa, he says that the assassination will still continue, and even then, the teacher has 1% of explosion, which is as good as it gets. That is good news, but we have like, a lot more episodes left, so I wonder what's going to fill up the blanks. The principal? The rest of the world? Only next episode will tell us then. I'm hyped.<br /><b>Bungou Stray Dogs: </b>What an interesting episode. I'll be glad if this isn't Manga material, but still.<br />This episode, it links up. I know many people including me will not be removing the fact that the lady who is with Dazai has nothing to do with this crime, and it turns out (spoiler alert) it does. She was the beloved of the Azure King, disguised as a "Messenger", to threaten the Agency for their doings, and somehow, it's directed at Kunikida-kun. Surprisingly, many people are tied in as well, including Port Mafia to guard the location to not let the Agency defuse the bomb. Little did the woman know that the partner team is excellent (all they needed to do was to switch opponents, even I know that), and there were more than one person who wanted to know the truth. Rokuzou, didn't expect you to still have the breath to pull the trigger. Nonetheless, another mystery is solved, but it still makes us wonder about some things. How Dazai knew about contacting the Azure Messenger, why Port Mafia didn't send more to guard the key, and many more.<br />P.S. Kunikida-kun's notebook is ideally awesome. And yes, as I've read the Wiki it's finally revealed clearly that he can recreate anything he has seen, and thus, can recreate the broken key that is needed to defuse the bomb. The numbers guy, on the other hand, is not cool. Which explains how the interrogated can just die without much effort. Man, remote actions are sly. Too sly.<br />P.P.S. I have a feeling this is Anime filler content, as I've seen the Manga. You have been informed.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Nagasarete Airantou: </b>From like what seems like forever, the latest (scanned) chapter is out. And... I forgot what happened last time. In general, it's solving one of Beniyasha's mysteries in the island again (cleverly disguised by some mother), and with a bunch of scrolls they apparently are out to test the vocabulary of the villagers... and make Ikuto's nose bleed. Otherwise, we're not even close to capturing that evil-doer, as (what's her name) someone else is peeking behind the bushes to be backup...?<br /><b>A Channel: </b>Oh yeah, the dating thing. If you guys recalled, Kitou-sensei and Satou-sensei are out dating. Well, sort of. But then the rumour has spread well in the school, and other than that they get closer together, where Kitou-sensei got asked to stay to kill flies lol. Anyways, she is getting ever close to him, and yeah, cooking for everyone is NOT a solution. No, people will just notice you giving to Satou-sensei, Kitou-sensei.<br />P.S. Run-chan's forehead likely scored 100 points, and she slept in the closet keeping the futon again lol<br /><b>BLEACH: </b>Well that's a whole lot of text. About fighting, about finding oneself. Well, because Kubo doesn't want to kill the main guy yet, and because Ishida has to deal with all this fighting that he cannot even settle down in his life. Lol, references and jokes aside, Renji and Rukia are likely to join the fight sometime soon (maybe to save Ishida first though), but more interesting characters appear. Cue Ishida and Kurosaki. Yes, the fathers. And they have entered the fray, somewhat form that grandfather. Remember? Uryu's grandfather? Brings back good times. But still, this is interesting, as we can finally know of secrets and techniques we have NEVER seen in this series thus far. They both have a lot to teach their kids BTW<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Nothing. Zilch. Literally. But then again I've been listening. I've not seen <b>cinema staff's new album</b> yet (is it that bad??) (and don't ask me why, on both reasons), and I've not given new songs from last week. I've forgotten to give <b>Cocoro Auction's new mini-album</b> too, but then again it's also tough to just get a listen of it. But oh well, at least I got enough of Anime and Manga to be happy about. And I'm trying to find new songs. Just, not now. Now is not a good time, apparently.<br /><br />Next week finally brings a couple of new releases including <b>TrySail's 1st album</b> and finally I can give a listen to <b>Miyawaki Shion's new mini-album</b> after a long wait for the Anime's ending theme song. I'm still considering for Aimer and TrySail from last week it seems, and I think I may not even give them at all. Fingers crossed. Almost every week.<br /><br /><br />That's it then. Until next time... I have that desperation to write APoL the moment I think of stories of real life in general (including reading the news), so it may come to me soon. I'm still far from finishing that Android Studio lesson I forked out money for, so that'll take some time. And maybe after this I'll go the one provided by Android Developers to see if they are any different. Besides, it's free. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week.<br /><br />[P.S.: Kana-chan. And not her selfie, because someone took it for her. Whoever that asshole is.. thanks.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="true" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-hkg3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13233004_10154224289902460_2263784866754483730_n.jpg?oh=beb8b3d4d3ac495a3a2628ff3a6a28da&amp;oe=57D57171" /></div>Next week? I'm quite addicted to Aki-chan's new photobook cover right now, but then it's likely in order. Tomacchan will be next.]<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Entertainment News</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
