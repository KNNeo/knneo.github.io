Bad news, everyone. If you've been enjoying whatever is at the bottom of these posts every week, I'm sad to say that I've found out the reason, and yes, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30477877/facebook-image-url-gets-expired" target="_blank">Facebook URLs to images will expire</a>, and supposedly request another URL every time, which also means keeping it alive will be tough. Concisdering I don't want to store it in this blog too, this means I'm abolishing this for good.<br /><br />The good news? I'll only stop by the end of the month, which coincidentally means you get to see girls from my phone for two more weeks, including this week. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>To more problems this Art Club can handle, with three members we are introduced its fourth, and it's Colette-chan, as we've seen her quite a couple of times if your eyes are good. Known to be hiding in corners (closet, behind the sofa) she's also younger than all of them, having a background story that is different from many because she's a foreigner, and surprisingly high-pitched. Well, I say Uesaka Sumire, you've outdone yourself on this episode. We end up a round trip thanks to Colette not checking her pockets (I mean, she has to wash them someday, right?), Usami helping Uchimaki thinking of ideas for a new hair for that 2D wife he wants to draw (describing might be tough, but giving examples is worse), and I love friends who want to help you and your crush get together. Hey, you can't stop a maiden falling in love with a blockhead, but then again they kind of kissed thanks to a bunch of less-than-smart friends, and even got them on the school newspaper lol. I'm enjoying this show, honestly. Next episode we welcome a new advisor it seems, and to a further extent than Usami, shyness seems to cover all over this female teacher.<br /><b>Time Travel Shoujo: </b>Hey! This episode comes faster than a lightning strike, so you should definitely know we're talking about that guy who learnt of the truth of that natural electrical source from the clouds, dear Mr. Benjamin Franklin. Honestly saying, ignoring the facts about the times in the 18th century which people in the past are surprisingly understanding of Mari's situation, this show teaches us a lot of other stuff. For example, slavery in the past, people's lack of education and their supposed gratitude to be able to, heavy religion problems as usual about God vs Science, and many more. But I must say, I actually can enjoy this show. This may be little short in animation, but it compensates in knowledge, content, and everything in between. So sure, for Aki-chan and Mina-chan this episode, I'll watch it, whatever. (Audience: So in the end it's still them?) Haha I guess so. The theme songs are going to be a problem to give though. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Kuroshitsuji: </b>Well, guess what? Ciel was right! The way to deal with a prospering business, is another business!<br />The chapter elaborates well and leads up to what might cause Elizabeth to leave, but then again if it's only due to the charm of the music hall Bravat was hosting then I guess this may be over soon. However, the guys emphasised on her fortune-telling beliefs, so that may be a problem. On the other hand, the prince has given Ciel an idea, and that as a Phantomhive running a line of business, that the best way to deal with something popular is just to make it better and send it back at them. Nice one, Yana-chan-sensei, nicely played.<br /><b>Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>Yes, the Anime's manga. I only read it's first release of three chapters (because it said so), and yes it follows close to the show. Well, close enough. Some jokes are covered (the introduction of the President is totally different, and he actually wants to draw!!) and others are expanded (when Usami falls there is not fortune-telling flashback which, in my opinion, that asking-for-a-kiss scene is straight hilarious), typical of Anime production. That's why I only watch one first before giving the other medium a chance. But then both made me laugh, so that's good news for this show. To avoid spoiling myself off content I'll hold off until the Anime ends, but I believe I'll get to see most of the jokes in the show too.<br /><b>Saito-kun wa Chounouryokusha (Esper) Rashii: </b>Hmm... that Art Club Anime lead me to the Manga and led me to the author's other work, which is this. Major differences between this and that are... everything is different. A snob for the main guy who can(not) bend spoons, esper-powered girls, high school setting, ecchi elements all around (like, they don't cover panties and more), but the jokes are also heavier. I laughed hard at a couple of chapters, but then this story fell short. Not like, four floors down a school building short (spoiler), but more like, 4 volumes short. Yes, it has already ended before I knew it. But then it was a great hour and a half as I'm reading it, and I sure missed SCANDAL's live stream. Oh well, nonetheless quite a read, and it belongs to one of those underrated indie works that should &nbsp;be praised. Well, thanks to a certain Anime adaptation... this guy had outdone himself, this author.<br /><b>BLEACH: </b>I mean, the last time they did this successful the bad guy came back alive again, so... don't put your bets on this conclusion yet, yes? Besides, the usual way is what's after it, and that might be something simple. Recall Aizen's defeat is not by Ichigo's final blow, but his inability to take control again of the Hogyoku's powers. (Those were the days haha) But then again, this time it has a lot to do with predicting the future, so as long as he can still change it (even without his own bare hands), I see no reason to rejoice. Yet. Fingers crossed, guys. Kubo's promised us the end and he needs time to wrap things up, so... we're not far away.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Okay, quite a bunch this week, so let's talk about it. <b>TWEEDEES' new album</b> came in fast, and I'm quite happy about it, despite being less than impressed on first hearing. But then again Okii Reiji has only such a style, so I shouldn't complain. Surprising "ikkubaru" came within the list of songs as a feature, but then again I didn't give that song now and back then anyway, so meh, just for knowledge for this one. <b>VELTPUNCH's long awaited re-debut album</b> came in too, and I must say I am impressed by it. The topic song music video should have been the first song though, and yes, if you have participated on the song creation voting you'd remember a familiar tune within the release.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">I knew I had a hunch, and I almost rejected it yesterday.<br /><br />That new song VELTPUNCH let us participate? It was the album's second last song.</div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/756669430122307584" target="_blank">July 23, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br /><b>Primary's new album</b> also got in my magnifying glass over the weekend, and I must say this is her most palatable release yet. Damn, it's too easy to give songs recently. And that is good, actually.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">I guess with this, yuikonu, I've officially caught up to your songs.<br /><br />Your songs are hard to reject BTW <a href="https://t.co/ZSPCdsoye2" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ZSPCdsoye2</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/757043850410012672" target="_blank">July 24, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />In other news, I'm most likely rejecting <b>Gotch's 2nd album</b> because I find nothing in association with him and the band <b>Ajikan's new single</b> for for some reason, and I'm still questioning myself about it. <b>SCANDAL's new single</b> appears next week, and hearing the music video... if you haven't heard it yet, it's different. Very different. Not in style, just in general. And if that karate girl doesn't remind you of Kuso Iinkai I don't know what will. <b>Ayachi has announced her new 3rd album</b> is coming by the end of the year, so that's good news. Quite a couple of stuff coming out next week, but not like I can remember them though lol<br /><br /><br />This is it, then. My nose is acting up with the erratic weather once again, so I've not gotten into APoL much. The next school semester is drawing near, so I better get to it sooner or later, as I remind myself every day, I assure you. Until then, stay happy (because I'm not so much now), and stay healthy. My teeth are not very good the last time I saw it at the mirror...<br /><br />[P.S.: Here you go, Tomacchan goodness. As close as you can get her. Mina-chan too. That one is also scanned by yours truly.<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13781692_10154386230292460_2870670340620500635_n.jpg?oh=0e60036110e389cabdd13ee33e682027&amp;oe=5824E414" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13690825_10154389060472460_3734669737595520159_n.jpg?oh=d9e1984efa13ef93c5fd3815ab798ef7&amp;oe=581BDCF4" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13659087_10154392062672460_6237877379404230098_n.jpg?oh=3c8c2ced57e6acaab44f87a43856b522&amp;oe=5825A87E" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13754207_10154394955047460_3952697222066968300_n.jpg?oh=04732b87157d15a69277a3402bf461bb&amp;oe=581D67F5" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13731454_10154397676127460_8799667322598029392_n.jpg?oh=00b3393ec96e25620080a4804df37616&amp;oe=57EAF70D" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13718695_10154400549702460_1297989488839796074_n.jpg?oh=58dd7fe555626a845bf530faf29c488c&amp;oe=5831E842" /><br />Next week is Kana-chan I suppose, provided it looks good (I refer to the image quality) on my phone of course.]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
