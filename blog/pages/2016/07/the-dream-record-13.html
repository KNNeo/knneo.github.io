<h2 class="title">The Dream Record #13</h2>
<div id="hashtags"></div>
<div class="page-header"></div>
<div dir="ltr">You know what's the best kind of feeling? When someone you know is in the same class with you. Sound familiar? Don't be surprised.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I was in school registering my new semester subjects. Apparently we have to manually go to a place to put our own names on attendance lists in order for it to count. I went over to the last two specialisation courses (will explain this later) and when I reach the last course guess who's on the list. Besides some friends from the past that I know of a familiar name also surfaced: Komatsu Mikako."</blockquote><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Now if you think this is unlikely and how the heck it can even happen, yes new on my line of dreams is the dearest and loveliest Mikakoshi. Yes, finally.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Not long after, we're all in class. The teacher briefed us about various things as I see her across the room, seemingly unaware of my presence. I felt somewhat too happy to be in it, and as active I seem to be in class she didn't seem to notice me."</blockquote><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Man, I've forgotten a good portion of this part of the dream. Moving on...</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I was at my cousin's house. It had several rooms all on the same level which apparently housed myself, my sis and mom, some of my cousins, and her. Again, within a smaller group, she still didn't seem to notice me at all. It was also afternoon, so the sun outside is shining bright. Running out of things to do many of us (not including my mom here) have decided to take afternoon naps. A voice echoed from the hallway to draw in the curtains so people could sleep in the room, in an rude manner too. Seeing that only my sis is on the mat on the floor dozing off and many others are not, I walked into another room with a karaoke set. My mom plugged it in and started to play familiar oldies of which I know of but I was singing half-assed and soon enough, I gave up singing those songs.</blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">When I returned to that very room, I saw my sis missing as she appeared to stand beside me. We peeked in to notice her cuddling herself with the very translucent curtain that we used to shade out the sun. And with the room lights on and the sunlight seemingly disappearing, we decided to leave her alone. I went for another karaoke session with my mom again, but this time the reluctance came in quick I left the room just singing a phrase."</blockquote><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Wise choice, huh, leaving the room. Stupid me. Still, Mikakoshi wrapped in curtain.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">"A while later, my sis and I returned and saw her missing. We then decided to lie on the only bed not on the floor for a quick snooze. My sis those to lie down perpendicular to the bed and me with a pillow is resting next to her lap. Before we can even sleep, someone walked in to the room, seemingly searching for something. After searching the whole room she then decided to search the bed. It was her. She apparently was playing some have with the others. I guess it's hide and seek with an item or not, who knows. She lightly touches around me on the bed to avoid waking me up as I was facing against her. She then starts mounting on me, finding crevices between me and the bed. Just when she was about to reach my sis, she took out the mystery item from behind my right ear and left the room. A quick glance shows that it was a keychain of a chicken. My sis was awake too, apparently, and I commented "I mean, if she can carry me out she would've said she found it too anyway" and we both laughed."</blockquote><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Several things to note here. (1) I'm in university which means you do things online, and people have printed out attendance lists so we can't fill in the names ourselves anyway, (2) the last part refers to be being called by one of my cousins as a chicken supposedly due to the zodiac animal of my year, and (3) I have thoughts to make this interesting by not stating her name first but due to lack of details like how she behaves a little boyish and quiet as such, I decided not to do so. Also, Mikakoshi wrapped in curtain is probably because of this:</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_g63u9LT4lM/V3cWpjOxuQI/AAAAAAAAYkU/ctwIkwUKPucPUWOKx8S5qygb4iMYpkLZQCLcB/s200/0064r4qbgw1f18zwgvws6j30vi1cz443.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">xD</td></tr></tbody></table><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Okay, references. The university party should be easy to explain since I screwed up course registration a couple of days ago, the cousins meeting wasn't a thing but relatives meeting up is, and Mikakoshi-san? I guess it may be due to the recent purchase of that clear file, but otherwise, she's just to fulfil my earnest desire to touch her and be with her for the rest of my life. Seriously, can she be my waifu now??</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">P.S. Seriously next time idol events should not involve shaking hands only. They should have face licking or something. (Audience: What??) I guess the current dosage has weakened haha (Audience: What have you become, seriously...)</div><hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Dreams</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
