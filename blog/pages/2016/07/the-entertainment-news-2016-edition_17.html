Hey, everyone. Phew, that was a week. My end may be nearer than I thought, I desire more alone free time, and I'm not ready for the next 12 months yet. I'm screwed. Wish me luck. Wish Klassic Note luck too; I'm worried I may not keep up with it after ten years. Talking about ten years...<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Taboo Tattoo: </b>Okay, now to continue the long paragraphs last week.<br />You see, this show has its flaws. And they are standing out. Firstly, the weird jokes. Some of them are just not funny. I can't laugh at it, even if it's an action show. Seriously, throwing the guy down who was recently given a note in his shirt pocket down like, four floors and climbing up like within 30 seconds doesn't make any sense. Anyways, and we are now also introduced the antagonist, which is like some independent trying to take over the world. Hey, I can take world domination, but this is something else. Then, there is the irregular sense that is in this show. They, at this point, are not forming new questions that I want to find out down the road. Also, the main guy is a bloodthirsty freak. And now, he has to (maybe) kill his childhood friend because she is possessed by another tattoo user. This is real stupid, seriously. Sorry Mikakoshi, the show wasn't good. Maybe next time.<br />P.S. The only thing that I remembered of the show is that cute note from Izzy lol<br /><b>Kono Bijitsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>Hmm, I'm liking this show. A good example would be the first part I guess. Easily, the President would just fake a death, Uchimaki would just play along wrongly, and once again they talk about panties. Hey, at least they didn't show it. On the other hand, there are a lot more jokes I can understand compared to other shows (<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span>), and it looks like the confession to Uchimaki is going to pose a threat to Usami, who apparently cannot cover her feelings about this junior. Then again, the girl who confessed looks like she's part of the cast? This could get interesting. (I don't know; my eyes are bad at identifying similar characters lol) We're moving on to a new character next episode, and I don't even need three episodes to &nbsp;say I'm watching it. Seriously. This show is it.<br />P.S. Mikakoshi, you had A KID?!! Lol I found that out in the ending credits. She was the mother. Also, Uchimaki can just say no to whether he likes anyone in the school, because it's 2D haha<br /><b>Time Travel Shoujo: </b>Man, I keep forgetting this show is educational haha<br />The episode. Mari managed to come back, but not without learning a lesson. (See what I mean?) Gilbert managed to get the facts right, but needed a way to prove to the masses. Cue Mari and her soccer ball cake in process, and gives him an inspiration to show that Earth is indeed a gigantic magnet. Oh well, that is awesome and all, and the bad guys doesn't seem to have taken action yet (because not even we know of where that big grandfather's clock-like thing is anyway), we received a long lesson on magnetism and people getting killed in the name of science in the face of religion, and many more. Hey, this show maybe educational, but I can't help think the animation is less than good and the science is a little too much. But hey, at least it's a viable story. I want to find out what happens to Mari-chan's father anyway. I'll decide by next week.<br />P.S. Now I want to be named Fuuta so I can have Aki-chan and Mina-chan make a soccer cake on my birthday haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>BLEACH: </b>For a long while I have not known where that Quincy leader is coming from. After checking with the Bleach Wiki I found out he was in the Soul King Palace. Oh yeah, I really forgot. The battle, man...<br /><br />Well firstly, Aizen. Thanks to also him (I was anxious) we know he was in Soul Society waiting for that guy to come, and Ichigo and Renji came soon after. Unfortunately, we know everything about their interests in engaging in fight (yes, also Renji), and Ichigo just broke his blade again. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span><br /><br />Also, we have news that BLEACH will officially end in the next four months, not even reaching 700 chapters. Oh well, not that that's the point, but I want to see a reasonable ending. And that Kubo, I think you can still do. You've done sh*t and all, but I want to see something good this time round. Aizen popping out of his chair is most impressive BTW<br /><br /><b>Tonari no Kashiwagi-san: </b>Spoilers - Yuuto forgot about his presents LOL<br />Anyways, the chapter. He's worried about the Christmas meet, and I guess he wants to get a present for Kotone, and can't decide on it. Cue her sister and manager for where he has worked before, and instead of asking what his female friend would like, they talked about uneasiness springing out of advancing the relationship. Well, not a bad idea to talk about it, but then again it's part of the story. And I like. It's hard not to worry about these things, huh. But Yuuto x Kotone is a sure thing, so he really can go for it. And that itself will be interesting.<br /><br />FYI again if I did some time before this manga is ending Chapter 85, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/kinusa/status/746336960910753792" target="_blank">the author's Tweet</a>. That is about the next volume when it ends. This better be a good ending (Ge it? Because I read a manga of that title before) man; I liked this story. Unfortunately at its prime it's only getting a partial Anime. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well since it's that week, I didn't have much time to listen to new songs. I'll review <b>Gotch's new album next week</b> instead of this week, or I should have done it last week, but oh well. Because of a certain Anime, I'm giving <b>Mizuki Nana's new single</b> a listen, and yes, I have a feeling the single is mostly written by old men lol. Anyways, I've given a couple of familiar names a listen to, to my disappointment of course. <b>SPYAIR's new song</b> is so like their past songs with the lyrics being real irritating, <b>YUKI's new single</b> is quite good but not good enough I guess (hey, back in 2012 that one was great IMHO) and <b>Kimura Kaela's new single</b>(s)... I guess I wouldn't even want to finish listening to them. It's okay; I'll give songs next week.<br /><br />Talking about next week, we have finally waited long enough for <b>VELTPUNCH's new album</b>, and many other things I don't remember after that. Hey, this one's pretty important.<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I'm renewing the Klassic Note websites if you didn't notice, and I'm thinking of other ways to simplify my processing during the tenth year which is next year, if no one knows of it yet. Also, I'll be continuing APoL Chapter 16 (man, how many times have I mentioned this already) before school opens, so be sure to watch out for that, I guess. Cya guys then, and until next time... I don't know. My mind is in a daze. I think I can write a novel because I have most of the stuff drafted already, I think. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />[P.S.: We're close to knowing the truth, but I may just stop putting images of Aki-chan here soon. I'm sorry.<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13606639_10154365736137460_3894837970759023323_n.jpg?oh=169c4672b3185101caa63ae138c6799f&amp;oe=582C1E5E" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13619861_10154377851287460_7099313414094521503_n.jpg?oh=ec3ecaa920f5c44883e0284986ec3e2e&amp;oe=581E1D1E" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13709877_10154380446957460_2141872174896396971_n.jpg?oh=d1e597a87f1c1b6d135d0fe73d7fc0c5&amp;oe=57F41D42" /><br />Enjoy it while it lasts. Especially the last two, they are scanned by yours truly. Tomacchan next week. There's cleavage, for goodness sake. *salivating*]<br /><br />[P.P.S.: Strikingly is a reliable web hosting service, and I'm not saying this for ad revenue. Because if you put in images sources from the Internet they will let you put in the link to the image and reupload it to show in your webpages. Blogger doesn't. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>]<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Entertainment News</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
