Because I was worried doing a review yesterday was a joke, and I did mention somewhere about holding on to one of the package of two new albums I collected yesterday. Then again, maybe it's my mood. I mean, exams and presentations are tense, people. Luckily there's Aki-chan here to make me happier. Well, just. Let's talk about it.<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Toyosaki Aki - all time Lovin' [Album]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70005000/70005852/images/alltimeLovin/toyosaki_syokai_SMCL421_forHP.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70005000/70005852/images/alltimeLovin/toyosaki_tsujo_SMCL423_forHP.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Obviously closer-ups are better, but then when you have the alternative jacket it doesn't matter haha)<br />(And if that's some cleavage you see in the Limited Edition jacket then you should totally buy it xD)<br /><br />Origin: Third time's the charm, as they say, and we finally reached Aki-chan's long awaited third album, after about nine months since her previous single and nearly two years since her previous album. For one, I missed her album twice in review already, first being not within the timing of 2012 where I can buy CDs right after I listen to them (which means now) and the second when I was overseas and have practically no access to ordering the album at any point. Goddammit, as they say, but this time it's different. I finally did it. This is for you, Aki-chan. And with her third album comes a few more surprises, even though I must say if you listen to her style of music you'll be sure to like it especially following her this long.<br /><br />[Note: Over here I shall make reference to various single reviews due to my own dedication since the year 2014 where she starts her new album plus adding my own, so opinions back then and today can be compared. <b>First impressions and ratings only count for the new album songs itself.]</b><br /><br />(1) Ginga Station [Galaxy Station]<br />(Not in Klassic Note, so let's not talk about it.)<br />Wait, shouldn't I? Okay, or maybe I should. This is the only song in the list of new songs which got rejected. Back in preview stages this was promising, but then the second half of the song proved disappointing to me even till now, so no. Not this one.<br /><br />(2) Clover<br />Also the topic song for the album, this song talks a lot about Aki-chan and her box of "treasures". She refers to the (few) things she has along her (29) years of life, and she also displays (apparently, in the music video) the many things that she has experienced as she travels along the path of a solo singer. And yes, this song is good. Good for you, aokado-sensei; this is indeed a nice song. Not only it's typical and befitting of her style, it's also soothing to hear. If you have heard songs in the past like "Shirotsumekusa" then this song will totally appeal to you. At least, it did for me. And when you don't have much opinions of the song, means it's good. At least, I acknowledge that it is.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Slightly Above Average)<br /><br />(3) Uh-LaLa<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"[From <a href="../../2015/06/the-klassic-note-review-201506-issue-1.html" >The Klassic Note Review 2015.06 Issue 1</a>] Just that the song now is different in mood, and with plenty more English lyrics which we know that Aki-chan can't really sing in. Well this is not much of an issue anyway, not after you see that music video of her literally being like what Anime "K-ON!" Hirasawa Yui does on a summer day. Really. (whisper) It's awesome...!!!"</i></blockquote>Considering this (and possibly many in this album) to be segmented in track sorting compared to many independently released albums which is more common in mainstream then seiyuu solo career music releases (I don't know how you say this), this one just jumps in after a soothing song to make you feel in the summer. As always, it's a welcome change, even though this is definitely not your awesome song, but I'll take the fanservice. This and along with another I'll mention below soon.<br /><br />(4) Koisuru Love Letter [Fall-in-Love Love Letter]<br />This one obviously falls along the once-in-a-blue-moon wacky moments in Aki-chan's music career which will no doubt cause some form of hype amongst fans, and here in Klassic Note it's no exception either. The melody itself can be a little dettering at the start when I heard the preview from her radio show and that the tempo of the song if overall slower than what you might expect for this kind of song, but then it's pretty well done. Of course I have things to say for this one, and the most disturbing part of the song - at least, in this studio version - is the background chorus of guys who sound like they are more desperate and in my opinion, do not blend in well with the song. Yes, the composer ROLLY-sensei is in it, which makes it even funnier in some sense. Nonetheless, like how Mina-chan told her as she writes in her blog (yes I read them regularly) it'll have its effect when Aki-chan starts singing this in her live performances, which will no doubt sound better than in this album. I'll be looking forward to making a shame of myself doing the "heys" and "oh yeahs" to her lives later this year or something. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span><br />Rating: 4 stars &nbsp;(Slightly Less Than Average)<br /><br />(5) Houzuki [Ground Cherry]<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"<i>[From&nbsp;<a href="../../2015/06/the-klassic-note-review-201506-issue-1.html" >The Klassic Note Review 2015.06 Issue 1</a>]&nbsp;...this song is actually pretty well done. The melody is rather nostalgic, and&nbsp;relaxed are its lyrics as it tries to represent the season.</i>"</blockquote>This song lies in the outsides of Aki-chan's singing career, but then it's very reminiscent of season change, so despite it being long it's nice to hear. I still remember the flute solo when I reminisce upon her songs today, mind you.<br /><br />(6) Delight<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"[From <a href="http://knwebreports2012.blogspot.com/2014/03/monday-night-report-latest-from-shelf.html" target="_blank">The Klassic Note Review 2014.03.24</a>] ...initial impressions are alright, but kinda deterred by the lyrics, like ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù sounds weird to me, and the unusually high pitched notes in some parts of the song. But then listening to the lyrics make you understand that this is a wonderful song about farewell, to welcome spring..."</i></blockquote>I think not many of us remember this song about a journey Aki-chan took half a year after her second album, and this one isn't much say impressive compared to what the previous release has to offer, but hey, it deserves a spot for being a good soothing song. I still love the chorus, but yes, Tamurapan-sensei was still better writing "Patapa" back in her second album. We must move on to new songs though, as nostalgic as I am.<br /><br />(7) Tomato<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"[From <a href="../../2014/07/the-klassic-note-review-201407-issue-2.html" >The Klassic Note Review 2014.07 Issue 2</a>] I was worried about it being a 5-minute song but this happy song, as mentioned by Aki-neechan is really a great one, and the lyrics make a lot of sense in terms of love, like the English at the introduction is actually ‚ÄúWalking through life together‚Äù...Overall, the song makes of a happy, nice love song. And I like it. Actually I love it. And her, too."</i></blockquote>This song. That ultimate love song of the year, at least, in 2014. If I could feel Aki-chan expressing herself in all honesty to me, it's this song. That being together thing still sticks with me till today, really. So much so I want to tell my grandparents about it. Serious. Too bad for age gap, Aki-chan. Maybe too late for the both of us. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span><br /><br />(8) Portrait<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"[From <a href="../../2014/11/the-klassic-note-review-201411-issue-1.html" >The Klassic Note Review 2014.11 Issue 1</a>] How should I say it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs emotional. It‚Äôs winter and we make a promise with her under the sky. Listening to the lyrics makes me know that the lyricist is a pro, however the composition is not that its best...It‚Äôs heartfelt feeling from Aki-chan, and I feel it too, but... not too much. So it‚Äôs just be that average song I‚Äôll come to love, yes? I'm being so frank over here..."</i></blockquote>Still ranked as one of the most touching songs Aki-chan has ever sung (ignoring how much I can criticise all of them) thus far, this one makes me not want to listen to it because I don't want to feel sad. But when I do, and I listen, this song grows in me. And hugs me from behind. A real healing song for the weak. Really, Aki-chan's singing voice does have healing properties.<br /><br />(9) Kanae Tamae [Wish Come True]<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"[From&nbsp;<a href="../../2014/07/the-klassic-note-review-201407-issue-2.html" >The Klassic Note Review 2014.07 Issue 2</a>]&nbsp;This song proves to be promise from the start I heard it, because of its rock style in nature, back then when I heard the preview on her radio show. Until only recently then I got to hear from the PV and noticed the song was overall pretty good. No overly decorated parts, and a solid rock tune, arranged by the infamous Theatre Brook, as mentioned by her again. It‚Äôs really not bad, in my opinion."</i></blockquote>Remember when Aki-chan really loved you? Well, here's a song that would literally fill your heart up with love. Whoever suggested this song for her is a genius and will bring her fanservice to a whole new level. This song truly is, a "wish come true". I'm satisfied already, about a year ago. Man, it's literally a love confession at this point.<br /><br />(10) Shamrock<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"[From&nbsp;<a href="../../2014/11/the-klassic-note-review-201411-issue-1.html" >The Klassic Note Review 2014.11 Issue 1</a>]&nbsp;Somehow music composition in music companies but spoil the song with the bridge part of the song (between second and last chorus), which makes of very bad reveal once you hear the whole song, because the original preview sounds great. And lively, and relaxed. But just that part of the song. I know. But it‚Äôs forgiveable, for the lyrics and overall suggest a light-hearted song and a happy mood."</i></blockquote>It's forgotten by me already. Okay, at least within this album. There are many songs which Aki-chan has sang, but this one falls in the forgettable category already, Quickly enough, this song gets brushed away as fast as I can remember it. Aki-chan sings happy songs, and this one still is one till today. Don't get me wrong. I just... listen to 200+ songs a year. Sorry to whoever wrote this song again.<br /><br />(11) Tower Light<br />This one, is something. Remember the days Aki-chan has modelled other artist styles in hopes of creating a more mysterious and even sexy voice for her image? Compared to songs like "LiLi A LiLi" from previous album and many more, this album once again has a less than quirky song style, and this one is far from that, at least. Still, this song has it's own roots, a simple acoustic style, and a short song. I say "own roots" because as rumoured from a fan I encountered online stated that Aki-chan does play guitar in this song. And yes, she does. The booklet has proven that now that I had a look at it. Which also means she gets to perform this in live, which will no doubt be a sight when it happens. Aki-chan has proven her contributions in her own music career, and this time she is rightfully involved in it. Good job Aki-chan, and this song too, because it is a suitable tune for her once again. Not your usual pop song, but very memorable in terms of style.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Impressively Average)<br /><br />(12) Issennen no Sanpo Chuu [During A Thousand-Year Walk]<br />This being the last song in the list is no surprise even to Aki-chan, because she also agreed this emotional song should take this spot in the album, and I can see why. Written by the infamous Andou Yuuko-sensei - and I tell you she's good - we get another simple yet touching melody, and even with the preview, first impressions are already good. With the full song, the impression gets even more imprinted in me as I tear up the many more times I hear this melody. It might be lesser than anything from her previous releases whether singles or albums, but still. It's a song to not forget.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: What a journey I've been, and I hope for you guys too. Because the only reason I have to give these songs so much credit even till today about five years of her solo music career is primarily driven by her attractive, cute voice. I don't know. Maybe it's just me. I can forgive a cute voice singing mostly thankful songs with soothing melodies. And this is in all honestly, an album about love. About her love and thanks to us, and for the third time. It could've been better and the journey could've been smoother, but then it was great. Thanks Aki-chan, in return for all the showering of love in your songs. For anyone who isn't a fan of her? I can give you reasons, but you'll say I'm biased. But for good songs? Consider the songs about some "Love Letter" and "Tower Light" and you'll not be disappointed. That is what makes her different.<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />FINALLY we're here. That took some time. And a whole lot more the moment I'm thinking about Ikimonogakari's best album. But that I'll explain this weekend on Enetertainment News if you guys are still wondering if it came with this why I didn't review it yet. Oh well, this first then. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="295" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ny7dEyMnV8I/Vv-tUNgwT_I/AAAAAAAAWI4/WJUEBZF3zRsgMk8Yuf82aVgfvwrMExIDA/s400/IMG_20160402_142329.jpg" width="400" /></div>For me, this was also a journey. I went for waiting for a confirmation to not getting it to eventually not missing the train of First Press Editions, which if you do recall, comes with special gifts. Contrary to gifts from her previous albums (which I do not have the privilege to receive) this one does not come with signed photos, but another jacket (which is just a card with her signing) which I guess is equivalent to that, and a special photo again. The problem is this decision could have been made a week before the album release and I dragged it until last weekend to give the album a listen instead of pre-ordering it. In consequence, I went from missing Animate (8 days before release, one day before she reveals the last song of her album on her radio show) to missing Tower Records (1 day before release, and before I had any chance to review her album before making a decision) to eventually hitting on HMV Japan's special exclusive photo. <span class="emoji" title="üò¢">*sob*</span> It was a tough journey, this one.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70005000/70005852/images/alltimeLovin/ANIMATE_2190.JPG" height="200" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70005000/70005852/images/alltimeLovin/TOWER_2109.JPG" height="200" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70005000/70005852/images/alltimeLovin/HMV_3590.JPG" height="200" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Animate Online Shop=&gt; Tower Records =&gt; HMV Japan<br />(For me who loves close-ups I hope you can see why I cry over this)</td></tr></tbody></table>But still, I did it. I got the album for you, Aki-chan. I was just less compulsive than who I would have been years ago because I have a budget. And it's Klassic Note. That, I'm sorry to myself and to you. And yes, I'm not showing how much love she placed in her booklet, just because I can. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br />Thanks for your efforts, Aki-chan. You may not have been perfect, but you are honest. And loving. And lovely. And I thank you for all of that. I look forward to more of you in any way possible (even if she is going to reach 30 in half a year's time), and that... I... I can't say it. I can only say thanks like you do. So thank you, Aki-chan. Love you for life. <span class="emoji" title="ü§≠">*giggles*</span><br />[P.S.: For even more love, I refer you guys to that another jacket. And Aki-chan, you will always be a treasure to me. Many loves.]<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Klassic Note</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
