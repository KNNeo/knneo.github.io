You gotta tell your evil elder sister that you are- Wrong show that's <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/55129/Oroka_na_Tenshi_wa_Akuma_to_Odoru target=_blank>Anime "KanaTen"</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, let's talk about what happened. Firstly, about Shiu-chan. She cute. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> That's all I can say or maybe about her forehead lmao, because if I describe this little brat of an angel any further this site might get flagged for... something. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, she's here to see how Towa-chan is doing, only to realize she is hanging out with some human male that is out to get her? Yo Shiu-chan, that is IF Shintarou didn't save her from that fat dude, okay? You gotta give him some credit for saving her all this time. And that's also their argument while explaining to the kid (while baiting her with milk lol), that as much as she is in good hands, it's also only in these good hands, which then made them realize maybe, just maybe, Towa-chan should start going around and helping out humans in general. Well, maybe we start from the observations so we know that those fruit sandwiches are actually real and a train stop away. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You know, don't believe what they say on TV or something blah blah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I would argue the smartphone is even worse and maybe Shintarou might want to get Towa here a phone too for communication... but I guess that's another episode in itself. This isn't just a slice-of-life anyways, though I would argue in the second half of this episode, it basically turned into a romance series (as it should be), where the two hang out a bit while Shintarou explains to her everything in the human world we live in. From trains to crepes to don't cycle on the swan boat so fast while wearing a dress lmao <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span>, it looks like this couple (hehe) is having a great time either way, so I guess it's a win for them. Which one? Yes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I know we had to get to the point of whether to consider Towa-chan's exposure to humans rather limited in her case so far seeing that she should start appealing to the masses, but maybe the turning point is just late. It's just how the story goes and I get that. Shiu-chan is a terrible relationship lightbulb <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>, and we're just glad the others aren't here to complicate the heck out of things. I know right, Shiu-chan mind blown of a snow woman? Or maybe she already knew, who knows what's going through this brat's mind. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Once again, Towa-chan's... little heaven in the human world is likely coming in to a close as long we Shintarou don't just lock her (lmao) in his apartment (I'm calling the cops haha), and maybe then, she can just go around helping others soon. The guy may not remember her mission coming into the human world, but I still do. Not like this harem series is going to help fulfil that within this season but I don't know so... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I miss Noel-chan already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJgvdByKvrjV_eXKe5FMU2bKx6KLV34cAR0lb6L1b-fY5cW9j-h779UWtlFbnjb5f98BmNj8b0nv7-0ciy-98H-9iBO_OYLhrpKdeeqwLoxXHBn8b-ARwrcFweNvJJw6Th0jfROOgjtgOraljrUWD7hIXZvWi5HQb4b0n5jXQHjd0OlE3BIaCNhGOMwzE/s320/tenshitsuki06_emblem2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You see, that emblem is to detect paedophiles like you-<br>(Haha)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNYjavOZTeSTwSAM1JCg-2c3crpAX-P1cdXnzd-qS2XZPphX-uoFCgZAngyJY3FiEsG4g3xmjHJrmNJJuVBn2EliV5ANKgVEraWF6dEK1SaTcuOxm_AUGTstrZy-iqJuKIJGgIHmpS1CNE_rclGIBV_on-mCPlyScG7aCPCPQRp4KFGWc05HPYOoiU4ik/s320/tenshitsuki06_shiu1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is NOT the same as episode 1 haha we don't have milk ready<br><span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfvNap3t7qlxmIalzdtVWKUIlHLw_H0iW394bmhlcv9qF0qFQgUJOXMAjTolfJ1BmWYdJV3YvmNvF4qaRMG0jwuGz5fft4QPo46tDGGv5rhT97miGzVtcVFYSLk2ugX1_PRwk4vKyEmYVlk0dpNcnz3dWv12aE_kNUEKhzZ5zSp49v3-o6ULpxEBPM5MU/s320/tenshitsuki06_heaven.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is the worst lightbulb situation I've seen EVER<br>(lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S. "She can't take the bus or train yet!" LMAO Shintarou you her father or something? Well I guess he is her daddy and-</div><div>P.P.S. Yes Shintarou, put your shame in and do not teach her about human etiquette first, we need more of the mishaps to justify this as an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> series lmao</div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=ShinigamiBocchan29><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"According to this (book), I need a mermaid's scale to become human." Hey Amelia, you want to join Daleth so you can reunite with the circus owner? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div></blockquote><div>I also do not like <a href=https://jisho.org/search/takoyaki target=_blank>takoyaki</a> does that mean I'm an ocean preservationist? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I'll preserver Ueda Reina as much as I am able too lmao, but yeah Amelia is back in the new episode (#ShinigamiBocchan29), but also, Daleth's journey to getting laid. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Hey, it's all connected, you will get it in a bit. For starters, this pair is together mainly because Daleth is in search of a mermaid's scale, part of what her spell book dictates in order for her to become human, to, in case you forgot, be with Walter forever and ever making out- She's married by the way, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Youko_Hikasa target=_blank>the voice actress</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, not going to stop her to win an arm wrestling match to get it lol it's complicated, and in exchange, I guess we do have a short conclusion to the relationship between the circus owner and his... wife. Yeah, I mean, they are married, the guy and Amelia. The only true love that's still holding up in this series, by the way. Cuff and Zain don't count. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking of couples, we are not intending to ruin one but we are likely going to in this dance party that's happening in the main mansion, where <strike>Gerbera</strike> Bocchan's mom (lol sorry) was preparing to meet with guests, Walter is introducing himself to girls so I'm pretty sure Daleth is crying on the rooftops right now haha poor thing, and Viola is practicing her violin performance as expected of her name...? Well, it's more than that. In it are many emotions we forgot existed, from Philips appearing in front of Bocchan and how we could have cleared up the misunderstandings like, years ago in telling of this story so go watch episode 1 again I think for the lore drop, to like, Viola-chan's incredible personality changes and impersonations haha it's just too good to hear <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase target=_blank>Minase Inori</a> voice this much in an episode she is the real MVP, so looks like this dance party is a mess even without Bocchan and Alice dropping by. Like, from a sofa flying in the sky because Cuff-san brought them here. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's interesting to see Daleth have an image change while keeping her usual nun outfit as given by the father we don't want to know who he is anyways, Flea is apparently a legend of its time no wonder he doesn't look much human compared to everyone else, and I also wished I had more kisses than what Sharon did to her daughter. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, lovely episode to set up for next week still on the dance party but I already wonder what is up next considering most stuff has been covered and had some conclusion unless Daleth and/or Walter wants to pick up their courage to meet each other again lol, or else this is likely a perfectly normal dance floor waiting for disaster to happen. Hey, Sade might be dead but her magic is not, who knows how much magic she has casted before she got rid off by the gang of witches. But yeah more Evelyn please we need to know how the progress of Nico and Ichi's training are coming up on so we can proceed with clearing Bocchan's curse. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "The poor helpless maid does whatever her master desires..."

YEAH NO SHIT DUDE</div></blockquote><div>Yeah, marriage as in shotgun wedding or whatever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, that is in the dictionary or something. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We better not find out which weirdo wanted to marry Yukari-chan here in the new episode (#Bartender06), because we got new stories to tell. Yes, Yukari-chan included. Before we start opening the champagnes on her wedding though, let's talk about Hayase. He's a guy. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Nice guy even, great manager even though it doesn't show on his face so even if he is covering for his subordinates, they will never know. Ironically in contrary of my situation at work haha ah hey, but these bosses are hard to find. Sadly, not like Hayase knows to deal with this contradiction where hey in case you don't know how this works, he is sandwiched between workers and their superiors and that's how this is anyways, has to end up bearing the utmost of pressure, considering he just quit smoking and has no new way to relive his stress no more. Until he saw Eden Hall. Hey, let's say it's a saviour to all people in this series so he's welcome too, but maybe until you stop dunking on people who smoke right beside you, or just maybe moving away from the seat will resolve the issue. Also it's a woman why argue with her anyways? And in case you think I'm rather short-sighted in view for thinking like this, I will always remember how easy it is to hate someone just so you walked into their life thinking they did wrong. What if I told you she was suffering from something and this was the way to relive stress, just like what you did walking into a bar? So yeah, not surprising, Kimishima here (hey yo Kayanon it hsa been a while, such a lovely voice acting isn't it?) long story short just lost a kid she was trying to save and being a doctor, not being able to do that after six months down the road, is such a pain no one can feel other than her. The reward was for the also recently non-smoker a pack of cigars if it can be saved, ended up on the opposite side of the line, and that's why she is just leaving it up instead of toking it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, obviously it's rude for Hayase to ruin her night as to a lesser extent she has ruined his for sounding hostile too, and the guy wanted to apologize. Well, he got the opportunity, and I'm glad he did it right. And everything else is history. Yeah so is Yukari-chan's marriage, which apparently with much of a fuss ended up being a ruse just because, and she also knew Sasakura saw through her already preparing a drink which has a double meaning behind it, it's made up so that the grandmother will die happy. I mean, what a terrible white lie to do anyways, not like I'll lie to anyone of my marital status I'm a weirdo too maybe Yukari we can get married LMAO, but yeah, not good to lie ironically the opposite of the previous story, and I'm just glad she got around her own emotions. Overall, it's all mellow or even sad stories which is titular of this series haha if you want a happy story look somewhere else thanks, and yeah, the God of Glass is handling them quite well. What worse can we make of this series? No you can't, this series is perfect I really need some time to cry every week and this fits the bill. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijpViM5vJMEBICeOJykMuREUfU34_Nbp2oe6n3IzMztZuR24uyWaInXuNbDeCrXM3qjz1fS81AGPs1JiJMLuGjZyds66ZXgywbe0GukcRJT1Rhi_ajvwwnjnIvVAae2Zoh1xdtmQltLrv9gprBdcDA8THgkoWWMQgYID-dSE0bjUCbhrwpFjlqR5mWYn4/s320/kaminoglass06_bar.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is awkward in many ways I can't even haha<br>(Yeah also Anime without context)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_doGPRiL52S3JbbxvLltr3GBZMu1kJ1QXlCVWjCCzKTIRoYsORbN7YuXKG2w-tmwKnKyJjQ5INNZuXhl-qMeH7WHbT1nIn4F65ViMZw-pOHvQntpJ05qsHXuq0uCCsz55wAKKH2vmkYg8E0HSKbPQXQnoKauEpr4YWfR5WSeJ6gfBOIRaCmArK3oNQXQ/s320/kaminoglass06_yukari4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yeah, didn't expect they got the liveliest girl in the series to cry but here we are</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Ciel didn't do it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And surprise surprise, in the new episode where we commit arson IN ANIME haha gotta state that first (#KuroshitsujiSchool05), Derrick isn't in there. I mean, if he's in there this would've been too simple of a mystery, isn't it? Hehe, gotta build some tension for this story arc. Yeah, also in the Purple House building but heck, we better not build up fire in there <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> it's already quite burnt up. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Sorry for the puns we can move on now, because next up, we got the cricket tournament to deal with. Well, this isn't exactly it we did deal with the investigations we were supposed to do, we just didn't find any Derrick and the other victims in the Purple House we just set up on fire. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> For a recap, we know that to get into the Headmaster's mind we have to see them first, and the easiest way to do that is to kill Clayton and take his place- Nope, not doing that because Weston is rather sensitive to changes in the ranks so that is just more than risky, and the next way, according to McMillian, was to perform outstandingly in front of the Headmaster in the tournament. Okay, that sounds easier to do, just that we have no idea what their idea of MVP is. Yep, defending a ball from the audience is one thing, and next it can be who did the best. So you see, it isn't as simple as you would think. For starters, getting Ciel in as a player in tournament will be NUTS- Not unless you pull some string, he did that before. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Upon Michealis-sensei's recommendation lmao, Clayton put Ciel on the cricket team of Blue House, in case you forget, isn't a team with brawl or elegance, nor do they play unpredictable tricks up their sleeve to squeeze a win unlike the other houses haha ah hey, but instead, rely on strategy to win. Rather important and vital in the playing of sports, I would say, even rather gentlemanly to pit their wits instead of guts, so yeah, it's not that hard to put Ciel in after all. The cricket training can wait for later we have a demon on our team anyways LMAO, but hey, allow me to talk about the party before the festivities. We are met with a lot of people on the ground which is lovely, but several people would catch our attention, or reversely, the appearance of these main two of the series will hint on something from everyone else attending the dance party but we will put that aside for now. For the former, I'm just glad to see Elizabeth getting happy for Ciel to be in the cricket team and super jealous to whatever Bluewer's sister is pushing their sister to Ciel haha don't even try dear lady Lizzy will eliminate all competition even if it means disappointing the brother LMAO, Bluewer's family of sisters is already a sight to watch oh I haven't seen the credits yet but I don't think I know any of their voices (Edit: Aizawa Saya was in them? BUT WHO THOUGH?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>), and uh oh looks like we have been found out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh heck, it's an eventuality the other guys didn't know better lol even Lizzy's brother too? Haha but hey, we aren't here for chit-chat. We are here to know when's the first and hopefully not last time Blue House won the cricket tournament- Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yup, and as one of the other Lords have spoken about that glorious year, we are also introduced with a character we might know too well of - the Lord Phantomhive at the time. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, what an uproar of events I can't even haha, but that also means the excitement is coming soon, not until we take a trip down memory lane and talk about- Yeah, his dad has a story though! I almost forgot haha but yeah, looks like we might be delaying the tournament win present day for a bit, so stay along for the lore, yes?</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgFwPEgE0IXNe7LDpuWf5OFzRtjbwLK3JMQ-clpRzRXL2duXA3vikKiXUcCIO4RNInIDa8aAO_FoZzmPPpI4No6wPbYpfdy4unERWak5yeQImvMuJlwx0ksi_g2JGJlS0DJmX1t9F0dItNVIK5cfWkxnLKh6j-GvtHOPFwL-AHYjrbAPmtMaPoH75Q2rZs/s320/kuroshitsujischool06_genius.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When you're one of the only students in school who nailed the hardest math question haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhz7Q4dRk5nxGCk3o6JU23pfQeASrKBLK2AoEDz835AVGDCNSTUzP4f8fmoIieeCAe6qNI533UaHDbW6Qb6piA0L6lwRNUuIBcCZAhIl9t8jcj0gMrtjcbzfIxIButfiYyAf5NAjpgU47TNRIt1cfEe6eQg4wP0IeSP2OAhyTEqvKZF5Le0SL5cExhxucM/s320/kuroshitsujischool06_violet2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me and my bros eating outside the nearby convenience store lmao</table></div></div><div>P.S.

What though? I wonder. We know about Himari-chan's story on what she is trying to accept and change for/to right now, but heck, we barely scratched the surface between Yori and Aki's relationship. Well, for starters, they are friends. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright we need more than this, but not like we need to know more than just to show how much they are a great pair to Himari-chan I guess. But in case you did not notice, this is more of a one-way train, and as much as Yori is very accepting of Aki's existence just in general, the other way around is apparently more... romantic, I would say. We know that, but also due to Aki's aggression towards Yori's new lover (hehe), it sounds off as a "hey b*tch showdown" kind of feel, which if it doesn't sound intimidating to you, it is to Himari. Momoko-senpai didn't give much solid advice at this point though I would argue apart from not worrying too much which won't work on both sides of this non-relationship lol, but heck, maybe we should start thinking of a better resolution to this so we don't hurt too many people down the line. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Thinking about this though, heck just be like Himari's mom and reject the heck out of the guy until he pushes her to like him. That'll work in this case particularly if you think about it. Ironically, with a deadline being the next performance that Yori-senpai will be in, we might not be too far off that idea. So yeah, meanwhile though, we are still enjoying the times the girls are together in a band, Himari-chan being cute hehe and don't even tell me about her friend Miki-chan LMAO oh that's just me with Koga Aoi, and we did kind of round up on whatever awkwardness which may have spurred out of what innocently looks like girls romance. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Turns out though, Himari-chan is just enjoying(?) the feeling that Aki-chan might be suffering from too, also known as the <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>j-j-j-jealousy</a>. *hears music playing* Haha alright I better stop here. All in all... yeah Yori-senpai your Himari-chan is trying so hard, isn't it? It's like maxing out using stuff before the trial period's over. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also our trial period for not getting dunked on as a band is soon going to be over soon, as the aggression might be coming soon from the other band who hates us for some reason. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, we can both guess what is happening, but maybe let's make the lore show for itself, yes? If I'm expecting a slap this season it's on the face, I tell ya. Not going to say who though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Meanwhile, let's hope the new song will actually be a song that Yori-senpai sings (unlike the opening theme song for this series), and I'll look forward to that. Oh, a good love song's going to win whatever the other band has on their sleeve, FOR SURE.
