I mean, how can you NOT know her at this point and how adorable this married woman is? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I should just stop lol I mean I didn't even write Fanfiction of her this week-</div><div><br></div><div>Also, it's as if "Majo to Yajuu" realized that the new "GREAT PRETENDER" series is dropping by and knew to skip a week of airing their new episode, we shall see them next month I guess. Meanwhile, maybe let's get back to that Confidence Man lore picking up where we left off. Yeah, pick up as in that old couple picked up Dorothy washed up on to <strike>Chinese</strike> Taiwanese shores or something instead of pronounced dead. But who knows, I only watched the trailer. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Another week of Anime and music, folks! The new package is coming soon, I promise. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanaTen07><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Not that it's my problem either way, I guess" Me at work after hearing gossip lol</div></blockquote><div>Yeah, gotta show off that action scene again, that's all we got. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Because in this new episode though we will NOT be talking about action what is that weeb trash anyways haha (#KanaTen07), instead we are talking about what happened afterwards. Hell yeah ANGEL DEMON S*X LETS GO- Hold on a minute, guys, it's not what you think. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Story goes that because I might as well do a quick summary here, we just defeated whatever possessed that avatar which lives inside Akutsu's seal which is super obvious it's preventing him from going into the public baths (lol), was not supposed to go berserk until we found out it was controlled by a certain someone. Putting that aside at this rate we might as well find out who that is a few more weeks later, but heck, both of them were kinda injured and tired after all this so... I like Akutsu made the right choice(?) of bringing Lily-chan to her place instead of his just in case that purple-haired nut head decided to appear again lmao. Still, he probably didn't have a way to enter in through the door so I assumed he destroyed the lock on the balcony to get her in using some of his demon powers. Be thankful for that I guess, Lily-chan, who told you to live in a private apartment. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Speaking of, that's also how it's possible for them to do... whatever they were doing haha, namely Lily-chan asking Akutsu to stay so he did and started fantasizing on everything even the sensei and his alternate self started to challenge him into whether he understood women, but turns out all of them don't anyways it's all him, because Lily was definitely saying that on impulse since which <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsundere target=_blank>tsundere</a> will ever do something and admit they did it? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways haha, she did recall upon a lot of things though, though even we can't prove a lot of them since Akutsu could have done a piggyback on her back to her place (instead of a prince hug lol), dreamt about whatever he was dreaming of which included the word "hug" (I know right, on the sensei too?? Yeah he is totally gay btw) and led Lily-chan to assume he really had to repay the favour to her servant for helping her out this time? And then he still told her to hurry to do it as Lily-chan was just sitting in front of him under pressure out of someone else's dream? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This can only happen in Anime- Or my own literary work, I do those sometimes. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, hugs are great, Lily-chan. No one's going to give that to me though, not even my parents. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyhow, this is a fun episode to watch despite it's slower and totally unrelated to the action pace, and well I was thinking when these two (not a couple btw) will get caught by the other classmates so I guess we won't have to wait until next episode to get that at least. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Though at this point I'm not too sure what the romance antics here are hinting towards, it's definitely great to realize that after so long, that this series really isn't about the war against angels and demons screw that shit haha, and I'll be glad to see the end of this. Maybe we will get some action at the end considering who we are going against, likely the antagonist of the season.

Thank goodness we didn't have a four-parter I was kind of worried when I saw the episode numbers on their social media posts. Still, rather excited to watch this sequel of an original Anime series considering they changed from being exclusive on Netflix to DMM don't worry about it, because in this new story (#GREATPRETENDERRazbliuto) hey Dorothy is back!! Well, sorta. Oh, I'm going to refer to her as Dorothy from here on though, not doing that Xiang-Xiang thing this is not "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/50590/Koukyuu_no_Karasu target=_blank>Koukyuu no Karasu</a>" anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Just be reminded that this new version of Dorothy does not know of her scammer genius past, but she is still genius in that part. Story goes that someone was trying to get her adopted mom to sign a travel package, you know, to keep her company since the old man is gone RIP, but then realized this man (ah) didn't have enough confidence (ah hey) (haha) to pull this off properly, and got questioned by Dorothy real hard, he ended up apologizing for what he did, she even took a photo of his ID just in case he tries something funny to someone else again. This, however, did get the attention of higher authorities considering he may or may not be a lackey for the local mafia (still Chinese mafia, but now based in Taiwan) (it will make sense later while I figure this out, I promise) involving his buddy Jay who is enjoying his life because, wink wink, he is the adopted son of the Chinese mafia's head, Wang. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Ring a bell yet? Don't though if you know what's up, keep that gong away. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Jay here decided to cover for his buddy who just got his ID snapped by some black... woman... lol I'm sorry girl, then ended up enjoying an afternoon with her and EVEN A NIGHT?? BRO WHY YOU SLAYING PUSS- I know right, compared to his friend he's got all the <em>other</em> big stuff. His build, his- Head, the one thing which included his brain, he slipped and hit it on the bath, ooh that must have hurt. More than s*x- ANYHOW haha, somehow this lack of communication with the dad and the mafia got him into more trouble, leading the mafia to think that Dorothy might have done something to him just because he isn't contactable. Worst off, since Jay got his memory kicked back in in no time (unlike Dorothy *OOF*), he did try to keep his memory loss a secret while still trying to avoid getting spotted by the people who are hunting him down? Yeah, they are going to think it's all Dorothy's fault but it's actually Jay doing his 200 IQ moves which honestly is valid, just that the others ALL thought this woman abducted him or something for him to be uncontactable. Get it?

Which isn't wrong in his perspective (because I will for now not talk about how Dorothy is still fully protected all this time) as he learns to take down the people trying to hunt him down while still being able to hold his helm and get his acquaintances to help him out like Bingyan who likely is on his side even though she is the one talking to the bosses around here, and Lin who did bail him out on several occasions while still listening to his boss Tsai who seriously does not give a damn unless it's about drugs. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Though he is still caught by his dad in the end, Jay did play along good enough even with a GPS tracker on his possession which he could've thrown away. (Dorothy, problem is if you throw it away they will hunt you down, but keeping it and then going the wrong way will buy you time)</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinHyUqwZrI-V8BzqnTeTgYnYb8M9OSnRaKJknB35ta6JgHMyeI6eh-P0NaBN6TZi4kbCrzlwe3OXGHoDUzKxepcY30Zf1Utuz0gUG7jwybvqs5h4JZc7yRLYm9PcTitFkXSeTT05ahjalXJL1APT1ZrFrt_QLFHyrrxfK4rGfiviqc4VH1Ukco9SRDgBg/s320/greatpretenderRazbiuto_bingyan1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This Bingyan is kinda hot, I'll date her<br>(Hehe ah hey)</table><div class=separator style=clear:both></div></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8XlgAKrps85lTlftubPAqaeZUsKkaIpMlwHCAnODrXyi8L7ZzsXnN5JbEhS26Q0yS6BVJNA7k6p_o93WeQE_WChjAIPAk8cd5H5VjnAr6wmz5Q463bBL3Rv8L9N4YM5mWQ1QzMXTHyK1PF4W8GbB-VvYSN-XdJNxZ06SQuMTcVXWs9vsyXy73RTXhMQk/s320/greatpretenderRazbiuto_li9.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This guy Li has fear in his eyes I can't even<br>(Haha)</table><div class=separator style=clear:both></div></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjInay79aWl1ktJC08yUzpGtQs6vcSSK1suOUfJRZFbApR94FdgBfq1kNbc-OAbgd0OH12chx9-Zz1lpZpL3pgiKu5NJkz7UK_clEMQmFPkuz6z_CpuWbrUqrRS6d4bqEBn2Eu5SIoySNnibD3x-Y4E9wVMM-eqap01KuYbzjNad0AIeIFvefUb0VY5YRk/s320/greatpretenderRazbiuto_tsai3.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Is this guy Tsai just smoking lines of joint??<br>(lol)</table><div class=separator style=clear:both></div></div></div><div>Last but not least, let's talk about the unveiling of this scam and the betrayal. In case you have been following closely on Wang's side as much as Bingyan had <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, you would know that he is due to do somewhat of a representative investment (I don't know what you call that, I don't dabble in investments tbh) in Singapore (I don't know what you call that, I don't-) (JOKES!! Haha) which I assume isn't small amount or else why would Laurent give a damn. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, don't let the story fool you too fast, but it did take some time before Wang did manage to snatch a broker who would do this deal in place of Cynthia- Oops. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But it wasn't until Wang realized that the people around him can't be trusted including old ones who are probably wiser than him especially when Tsai being candid about the investment being suspicious and all. Too bad the boss made a special visit to his place, and now Tsai is dead in a sea of white powder. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I mean, kill people you don't trust, right? Like, does Wang know he has been duped before to try to trust his underlings on their instincts? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Turns out he was mighty and in control even so, as Jay surrenders himself to his dad by nightfall because he didn't manage to get Dorothy back just because he couldn't contact his buddy (because their phone was stolen <em>constantly</em> lmao) (which led them to that African café which I'm sure Laurent knows it's Dorothy's favourite <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> ah hey) but also, that Jay didn't intend to surrender himself anyways. Ironically, Dorothy did appear though to drag some time in, but what?? SHE GOT SHOT?? Haha I know right, Edamura got shot with the same bullets so many times too. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, and this is where Wang fell short, where (1) his son Jay will never concede to whatever his dad does of course also knowing this empire might be in better hands that isn't Wang and his only hand lol gottem, and (2) Bingyan was also a traitor which I almost thought it was Abby or Cynthia in disguise haha that would've be funnier ngl, and (3) Wang's empire is probably all wiped clean by now considering he put all his money to invest in our <em>glorious</em> nation so that we can continue to be in headlines and in Japanese animation (specifically this series) for years to come. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmzQnrcKg1pqynBbpWiU7O1cQQNkoTYxpOnhFWMRxiXqAwYmZgfAOg__MrNAaoU85S6TJxj2ieSIthHPWJv9K3f6rMpH1yjSuvQeoEOaeXSlbss599qLuOt6ERi1Y7fgw1YYG3diydaxLhlDdNUM0RNFP-kp9Yg4h4uddV8omOsk_4ic7PQeEFF8cqw-g/s320/greatpretenderRazbiuto_market.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Obligatory Taiwan tribute!!

I can't cover all the script unlike Laurent and his gang can <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but I am once reminded of the fantastic overall production value to the storytelling, especially the animation and music, all those years ago. (Is there new soundtrack? I don't know, honestly) (Edit: It's new, can't find names from the credits in the soundtrack) Maybe there isn't enough lore explanation to talk about, like say, how everything is tied together but at least we know now that fat dude's name is Ayi (haha ikr) and as he has explained briefly at the end, you just have to remember who are the real victims who have never seen the script before, and you are good. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, hints for people who have not seen the original and don't want to be spoiled. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again coming back to this, I don't think we will ever know about Jay's life now that he likely just gave away his adopted father's empire? And we might not know of the fates of some of them considering Dorothy may have enough deja vu from all of this to remember that all of this that ex-lover did was to protect her, and NOW you are going off with another man maybe?? I don't know Laurent, maybe in the sequel we actually kill Dorothy. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, great little sequel that doesn't outstay its welcome, it's no love story or scam drama or <strike>Edamame</strike> Edamura actually getting duped (lmao) but this is good enough, even for Laurent's standards. I don't have this much confidence (ah) as a man (ah hey) to say this is for everyone, but damn, this gets into me as much as Tsai overdosing on... whatever he is smoking I don't do drugs don't ask me. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Haha</div><div>[TL:DR; Since I didn't do this in the actual 4 story arcs, I will tell you honestly that, the point where I realized something was wrong ie. it's Laurent's gang's writing the script, when I heard "Where's Cynthia?" and someone's filling her in LMAO YOU GOTTA REALIZE THIS IS A SCAM OLD MAN]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8kM1dz_IQUX4oyAfGWzxIY03EbN3f3rPcHj-8X2gBOezG7knwUJjq04HJ3RtMeK6O7SPXsP0du5EvpNZ8nwsd_5o7LE0RshfuzyzWd3T6xymKDA2yyljBitAZZ8UilPTaDHtCKfDrnCR8Q9cm7AUMJ9N-cNDtgJK6wunalVOAUF8bjdm43AGMyXjcmic/s320/greatpretenderRazbiuto_edamura2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You *might* find some of these guys familiar:<br>Our star of the show- I almost thought he was here to be duped again LMAO</table><div class=separator style=clear:both></div></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCxFg6oBi7-2iV2HI8lE61Oc8CWWy6TAhnaqFhqGNx1JXlgwLdDSQ3bktP6UJmJx1JruK4aNnNvBsapd1ZOQ0MDaS8mIeRSUuzdjrBrK1CGjMDP-1vi2fIkx3JJR8i5zjohC2xUF9hfoYc8JFe7tM_UhTgOTFzX5_5iivqavpKFj69PYBJZw7vqVucjq8/s320/greatpretenderRazbiuto_laurent.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You *might* find some of these guys familiar:<br>Our French associate <strike>Trump</strike> Laurent<br>(Can't believe they got me to write that idiot's name)</table><div class=separator style=clear:both></div></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_wWxfWMozpPEqiPgWo8jmaxb-hWNHLJZ7hdIcUWvliU6ejdoOQj4Urb701YdcOoP0YXFKBi9bf114tgKUliNCP_swG-OlvxJ79j6SnV2IGMOZKi3r_kiTMZN5I21wZiGxO2np8CbWFfa4vDhK3en7E3etHLghaUz8I1PVmvIhF1eY14MkXlDvD8SWMtg/s320/greatpretenderRazbiuto_plane2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You *might* find some of these guys familiar:<br>Isn't that just Oz sleeping on the left??</table></div></div><div>P.S.

She is also revamping her YouTube channel so let's hope that means we can get more music videos on the docket. <b><a href="https://x.com/The_FirstTake/status/1760227865625288791?s=20" target=_blank>SPYAIR's new video on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> YouTube channel seems to be the new hot sensation right now, garnering views for their new song which has been plenty good I have mentioned that last week, so hopefully they get to ride this high a little longer. Looks like <b><a href="https://x.com/lounge666/status/1760620453079757050?s=20" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE is releasing a new EP in a month</a></b> (along with live Blu-Ray but who cares about that lol) and that's kind hype considering they released an album just last year, hopefully we get to hear more good stuff from them. <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1760665760391905464?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</a></b> is a meh but man much of them this past year is that too but they are getting credit from Anime so I shall not complain much, we shall see this when their new single appears in 2 weeks. <b><a href="https://x.com/lucklife_info/status/1760953647129932174?s=20" target=_blank>LUCK LIFE's new teaser video</a></b> is a sneak peek into their new song releasing next week, and it sounds fine even though it's not much, we shall see about that next week then.
