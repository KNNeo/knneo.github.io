I missed half of that instead) and yeah, she is cute. I'm going to say it again tomorrow Yui-chan if you want to hear something else other than "you look like an elementary student" LMAO I didn't say that the fans did</div><div><br></div><div>She did reveal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R35sDQ3q53I" target=_blank>her new song for Anime</a> though, and that wasn't bad so I <em>might</em> take a listen if I give the Anime by then. Speaking of Anime, the ones I'm watching this season are so on the heat of battle. I know right, why are these two shows so aligned? Last week we have them transitioning to new arcs, and then this week with new characters? Bruh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ok ok let's get a move on, shall we? I still gotta plan what wallpapers I want to put on my birthday week <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanaTen06><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"... I didn't get a moment's sleep last night. All because of what happened yesterday." Oooooh boy haha</div></blockquote><div>Trust me Lily-chan, Akutsu is also somehow sleep-deprived too. *yawns* Haha why me too though? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where love transcends all the action that is in this series so far (#KanaTen06) haha ah hey, at least we have some infighting going on. Well, sort of. Let's talk about why. Firstly, infighting with herself, this Amane Lily. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yep, we are still stuck on that previous episode of glory (lmao) where we got that typical on-top-of-you romance scenario that got this angel flustered for some reason, she is even daydreaming about him in class in a bugged dating simulation- I mean, I know the latter is for the female demographic but heck, technical issues? BRUH. Somehow glad the sensei isn't here to stop her dream, but damn did that samurai still appear in her dream. Don't tell me...? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright jokes over this is not funny the teacher almost died IRL we cannot let that happen, can we? Speaking of which, he almost got into trouble for interfering with whatever that is going on with Akutsu's seal, which just means that this avatar hidden in the seal if when he betrays her (which is unlikely after last night lmao <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>) will just kill him so hard he's better off being cleansed? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, it's not because this demon can't fight this avatar of Lily's off, but more like they might be too strong for some reason to be hidden in a demon, one would wonder how anyone pulled that off. Get it? She pulled that thing off the avatar's back? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> It was quite an action scene though, Lily then realizing something is off as in the avatar isn't dumb enough lol (but seriously though imagine if Akutsu did the betrayal just here and now, this thing will emerge to rip him apart? <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span>), quickly brought them out into the open so she can stop them with her own two hands. Well, almost, she knows what's up unlike Akutsu who thought it was another of her master's slave doing the betrayal which he could've otherwise done? *taps brain* Haha don't think too much into that we know that is possible no more. What is possible though, is that we know who's behind all this so far, and it looks like it's our angel friend who is likely more powerful than Lily over here thus her fear of removing that seal on her avatar, is now very concerned on whether their identity has been revealed, so she sends her underling to investigate. Oh boy, we are continuing this with infighting first, huh. Not even talking about the war here? Alright. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know right, this series is all about angels and devils but we are talking about NONE of those things somehow, treating the main couple as humans (hehe) and just hitting on the problems on each side of the split words. I mean, I didn't sign up for this but sure, I'll take it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I might need to research on how to get into Lily-chan's dreams though, I need to have more rizz or something on me? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhw6vFFihVGoDVtwNu_mUmSZLofsrOH3JkpWe7BkmeUibNSF1a6KwVcaY2HP5aIeh3dyE8AdXYRZrP2SjWfUHIAmT9MnV_VGwIlSS4IIVH-fi9tcn3QK0g3uYYAtV0ctuipB68spvmO14EhhwotqmXYuuKVUi5xUi-WLVtZeK2_5yB563IPzVLi0PrO8QM/s320/kanaten06_akutsu7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>RIP Akutsu you will be missed<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSn_INWz7Tx-KhQ603_n2QU4HWzr1eSfnSBGls3wRQJPK8YrCXSzFjGGSLqpr0QOfQ5v3wDeVLR0R-osowFKDltXJnATbWPZWg5w1GTrmOIdFl10NGEpLmfJ1t6qM1Cy_25tjfh7dEB29TAVXVkyKb-UsV5DUm_SycD1Gw0hQUXrIYp8LncumY7W7Gi_s/s320/kanaten06_tied2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is so wrong I can't even <br>(Hey yo that butt though??)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5tJUSIUm06BgEVcoMpkgYOljj5HptWjQHJs6YqIV5vR2bQUopIbo4f64J9X8FbbbjXTuqe1Wfeg_ldy0xpjKTObT9YhH01fM_VM6O2VNdEB_YC3_tF8wvLKfNOQ5Pjhuws7u-G6HwzIKygAmdAFwKfMJRhyybG-aejeWVczJ6Dp4SCgZNlRn2s3FUDBk/s320/kanaten06_slash.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>LMAO I like the appearance of this samurai again<br>(If you recall previously, he slashed Yuuko's waist away? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Alright, time to erase those <strike>b*tches</strike> witches out there doing naughty stuff. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or actually any stuff that is bad, we don't know if they are doing things right. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> In this new episode where yay new characters (#MajoToYajuu06), so it looks like we have to fight the Corps to get the <strike>b*tch</strike> witch now- Why, are they even worth fighting for? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I would like to imagine news leaked out to the Corps and they are taking action into their own hands? Remember last time, even the town mayor will be hesitant in calling the military to deal with their own issues, even getting the Order will be a better trade-off. Why though? Well, read on to find out. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Story goes that Ashaf has received instruction pretty much the same as the Corps for some reason, we are here to capture a witch who killed some people in the city. Well, not sure if it's her doing and I'm pretty sure it's not once we know her identity, but surely this mage here who is in the castle with all the Corps commanders is more sus than any video game character so far, yes? *taps brain* But hey, can't stop him from revealing to us more, as Ashaf and Guideau find their way into the city to search for the witch too. And looks like they are faster on the hand mostly because they are less aggressive than the Seekers, I assume lowest level soldiers who use alter egos to run their hunts, who are just literally tying to kill dear Helga here on sight, not realizing the reason they can't deal with them is that, and here you go that mage is talking now, she is a descendant of a powerful witch which, wink wink, possess a Demon Sword which is basically a good reminder for me to bring out "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/355/Shakugan_no_Shana target=_blank>Shakugan no Shana</a>" because just like what Shana has as <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/1934/Alastor target=_blank>her buddy</a>, this Sword has a mind of its own. Also likely as they have mentioned, the Sword is likely on Helga's side which explains how they are out here in the first place. Yeah dude, swords talk, you never heard of <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/911/Zangetsu target=_blank>Zangetsu</a>? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sorry another "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach target=_blank>BLEACH</a>" joke, I just can't help. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Helga here though... we aren't sure what her objective is, though we know what the Sword wants. He wants some help? Haha maybe he just wants some friends because THIS LONER dude <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> alright Helga-san I'm sure you have friends just back at home or else I can be your friend too <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> because this girl just refuses to seek help (lol) even if likely so as Ashaf has pointed out (get it?) with his hands free of weapons, is that Helga is unlikely the cause of all the killings in this city. So she is just raging around because she can't defend herself against the Corps who are now hunting her down. Yeah, I guess her only option is to fight, huh. Well, that is, if you don't want to be friends with those two from the Order. I mean, why wouldn't you? They seem friendly, and I meant Ashaf. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, it's not bad so far, the story's got me hooked. I can still hear the crappy guns shooting down on us by the Corps (lol), and I still haven't gotten around to giving the ending theme song I am so sorry Yoshino Nanjou, and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/39149/Miyu_Tomita target=_blank>Miyu-chan</a> voicing Helga is just icing on this cake that just got cold because of that one Corps commander (lmao) (typically that's because someone's late to the party but this one is because the guy arrived), so yeah, I'm in to see what's up. Expect a lot of betrayal right here though, since good chances Helga here is the innocent party. Hey, what easier way to <strike>erase</strike> capture some legendary's descendant witch than by getting the Corps to deal with her instead of themselves? *taps brain* I'll see myself out haha see if I'm right next week then looks like the Sword is captured from next episode preview that doesn't sound fun</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEig3gWvT4qI_CbJ825yyvFJFeprsnXmVu5GJNLY2zyFVNGhqgh-06XwafUaiI-uLj4g2DcMk_8_H7nM-BQO_pQl8KzqTcZ9idCOErIs26z4Gvt7Jy5lz5hRtOhwdMOTdc62DIh1nZHk05kdstAZGu592xA-HbpteZwoBIyl5uS9mvKiJEsKkRI_6o0XiyQ/s320/majoutoyajuu06_cugat1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Not even joking because I'm a long-time fan, "BLEACH" in a nutshell haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4Rixdjo5hoLSiPZAPgdOfNSMY6zteiE5vojz4aAdRJEdQbsO7FW6PVgtWbJZz0L9BHKEsqabEPWBda6CdiiH5TyJvXrgxtx5p2ciSfxRNyvLPm2TeAKIpfS_Fyi0O4Dokr2A79ukVyEvUagHQrkg2pEoR8knyhnl0iVTWY8Vh1UGNxWBa6PtZFtUpp8Y/s320/majoutoyajuu06_barrier1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Come on Soul Society, these guys can make better barriers than you guys can EVER<br>(lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I think I started with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E7%9B%B8%E8%81%9E%E8%A9%A9-ep/1726297869?l=en-US" target=_blank>Soko ni Naru's new single</a></b> for Anime "Majou to Yajuu" and despite my initial disappointment of the title song because nit-picking music if my passion <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, I ended up liking the B-side quite a lot for me to give this, so yeah, first review of the year coming up! Also joining them is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sweet-essence-ep/1726169856?l=en-US" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new single</a></b> which fell under the same journey just that it's the reverse, where I'm in for the title song and ended up giving the B-side because it's just great to listen and chill to despite its flaws. We will talk about more of them in depth so let's move on. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8/1728595881?l=en-US" target=_blank>SPYAIR's new single</a></b> I thought I will get through it quickly but turns out I like the new title song a lot compared to the many other new version songs re-sung for the Anime credit it was on for this release. I did not give enough to do a review, mind you, but yeah it was a nostalgic trip indeed. Just... not the same again I still applaud YOSUKE-san for keeping this up though. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tegami/1728406412?l=en-US" target=_blank>Earphones' new album</a></b> isn't much to talk about after I heard of the two above so yeah, I just ended up giving the one song which I thought was different enough to stand out, with reluctance. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/beatrice/1727967942?l=en-US" target=_blank>Cocco's new album</a></b> isn't disappointing at all though, as I recall liking the whole album in general like I'm some generous music fan listening to J-Pop for the first time, remember those days 15 years ago? It's not now, so I had to pick my choices. I still missed her singing certain styles sometimes just being a rock star for no reason (lol), but I think I found its equivalent so maybe this isn't too bad after all. The songs I selected did stick after a while so I'm giving it a pass. Also along the same lines was <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/faith-crisis-pt-1/1711376306?l=en-US" target=_blank>Middle Kids' new album</a></b> it has been years since I heard of them seriously, and yeah, not going to expect epic classics that we got years ago, so this one is just a chill ride, as much as some of the title songs did hit me last year with digital singles. We shall see if there ever is a Part 2, that it will be better, who knows.</div><div><br></div><div>I should write shorter music reviews haha no way dude I like music I can talk about even the new stuff all day</div><div><br></div><div>Because TWITTER is still the best place on the Internet to convey information, let's see what I have seen and picked up to talk about here. That's... what pretty much this paragraph is about lol. <b><a href="https://x.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1757419358152962050?s=20" target=_blank>Aimer's new song</a></b> (and if you are a visual person there's <a href="https://x.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1758461233492054297?s=20" target=_blank>the lyric video</a>) isn't too bad at all, her new single is coming by soon so I'll wait to give by then as I always do. <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1757419363546923186?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's tribute album released this week</a></b> and is not on digital by the way, featuring more artists than I expect to know, singing their classics and don't ask me how many are not written by Mizuno-san. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (We still on that huh, me) <b><a href="https://x.com/honkidance/status/1757419456119357636?s=20" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance's new music video</a></b> is cool and it's from their recent album release but ironically this song did not get me it just sounds noisy in general, so I'm giving the skip even now. Through <b><a href="https://x.com/CoccoOfficialT/status/1757340629636677951?s=20" target=_blank>Cocco's new music video</a></b> did I know her new album released this week (I mentioned above already), and somehow this title song hit me more than a lot of the songs in her album. Good to know, but damn, I missed those days where she sang weird stuff- More weird stuff, it's a little more tame now somehow. <b><a href="https://x.com/inoriminase/status/1757706497717653856?s=20" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new live video</a></b> is an adequate Valentine's Day gift but not to me, so I didn't think otherwise about the song. *welp* Haha alright me, you like the girl don't say that. <b><a href="https://x.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1757419361248358460?s=20" target=_blank>Earphones' new music video</a></b> did not convince me to give the title song in their new album, maybe it's too many monologues, or that it did not hit me much in melody, so maybe not I guess. <b><a href="https://x.com/miyustaff/status/1758053544392085597?s=20" target=_blank>Tomita Miyu announced a new single releasing in April</a></b> and surprise it's for Anime again from the same series on her previous single so fingers crossed if it'll be good by then, not a fan of her singing action series' opening theme songs. <b><a href="https://x.com/SPYAIRSTAFF/status/1758101772688826464?s=20" target=_blank>SPYAIR's new music video</a></b> did hit me with the nostalgia while giving me hope that this new vocalist will make things right for the band moving on, so thanks in advance YOSUKE-san, thanks for reviving this for me. <b><a href="https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1758476325684478125?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi's new live session on YouTube</a></b> isn't for me I didn't give their new single, but heck, I'll just listen for the funsies. Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/neatsyui/status/1758495046314369309?s=20" target=_blank>Niitsu Yui being a guest in someone's live</a>, I now know that <b><a href="https://x.com/tainakasachi/status/1758015137653629411?s=20" target=_blank>Tainaka Sachi is releasing a new song end of the month</a></b>, new stuff since a couple of years ago so I'll be keen to see if she can get me again, Tainaka I mean. Funny I watched a <a href="https://x.com/Crunchyroll/status/1758582279218090446?s=20" target=_blank><b>short video of ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION</b></a> (subtitled in English, don't worry) about who screws up the songs during their performance, and short story shorter it's the drummer but it's because he tweaks it to make it more live-ly <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, so serious answer is Gotch the vocalist because he just forgets lyrics. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Looks like <b><a href="https://x.com/scandal_band/status/1759171185986904135?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL will be doing a livestream series starting next week fortnightly</a></b> until the album releases in a month, probably talking more about the album and how much I won't give a damn. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Haha girls, I listen to music, not even Chilli Beans. did anything to me while watching their album livestream last year, okay? </div><div><br></div><div>So next week, phew we get to take a break haha, I'll likely only listen to <b>wacci's new single</b> if that's all I care about even though the hopes on this isn't much too. Otherwise, I'll take a dip on <b>Humbreader's new album</b> once again just because not that I like their style but they fit into mine, so why not Honki Dance's rock did not do enough on me anyways. And no, not giving a damn about <b>Friends' new album</b>, not at all. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Some idols are better off without their pets. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Now THAT is a quote I should put as a post in itself. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Alright, Tomita Miyu, I have no qualms against your dog and finding some love in your life, but you are plenty attractive if you want to invite me to your place, just the two of us haha ah hey wrong place bro this is meant for Fanfiction part of this blog that no one visits. Also, the reason I have not included her in my fiction (hehe) is precisely because I never found an image adequate enough for me to- To? I don't know to what though, never thought that far. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, but Anime her is great. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys next time then, and unless you are a fan of photobook reviews, I'll be doing one tomorrow so do drop by to say happy birthday to me? Comments are disabled here though LMAO gottem</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Remember the comic magazine story where I read its Chapter 2? Yeah, I read Chapter 1 online (because all first time hits are free lol) and bro, again it's because the guy just promised the girl who confessed to him when she was young enough to get him caught by the cops (lmao), now has to honour his promise? That and also for bride training and approved by her mother? It makes sense I guess, and that's why you gotta be dumb and promise stuff to girls when we all are younger, dude. I regret not doing that... at all actually, also no one approached me on that so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> haha oh well</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
