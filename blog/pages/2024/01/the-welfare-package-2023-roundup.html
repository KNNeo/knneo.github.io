  Oh what, you think I would forget about this? I was just waiting for the
  *final* package for the year before I do this. Besides, how would I ever
  forget this? It's that time of the year where I list the mistakes I made...
  again... <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>

  People say that one needs to save money to invest, to keep for emergencies,
  and to buy necessities or prepare for marriage and kids, but WHO F**KING CARES
  about ALL of those things, daddy needs his voice actress idolism quick fix.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And as such,&nbsp; I do up this (basically) meaningless post every
  year because nowadays if I want to reflect on this I just randomly read one or
  read the ones I like so this doesn't really matter. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  exception to this) really expanded my horizons to the world of doujin art and
  illustrations. I tell you, even now, I still desire to get more even as I type
  this specifically for Comiket 103 which was held end of last year (and was
  planned to be with Douki-chan's final volume, but I abstained from that),
  somehow got me more into some of the illustrators, like, wanting more

  Runner up though, I think can be the
  <b>Kido Ibuki collaboration T-shirt</b> as I set new standards for what
  idolism trash T-shirt requirements should set me up for future purchases (or
  not, who will put themselves on the shirt <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>), I'm actually wearing this
  very often (and even outdoors) no one will ever know where this treasure
  unless, and I have not met them in person, they are a super fan of Ibuki-chan
  for some reason. No, right? I'm the only fan here? Haha I'm so proud of it for
  some reason.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Digital purchases-wise, definitely the most worth for money was when they
  discounted <b>Amamiya Sora's two photobooks for the price of one</b> even
  though they are only released about 5 months at the time of pruchase. Sure,
  they aren't originals they are based on serializations on the popular Seigura
  magazine, but heck, I don't have enough social media photos to admire this
  perfection and this was <em>very vital</em> in making sure she is burnt into my
  memory. Same year, dude, same year. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>&nbsp;

<div>LEAST WORTH ITEM BASED ON ITEM VALUE</div>
<div>
  I totally regretted visiting MusicRay'n Mall for two months straight and the
  latter was for some Valentine's Day postcards and in turn I bought some pants
  <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> haha and this isn't even of the girl, but literally nothing, NOTHING can
  make me angrier than that F**KING <b>EARPHONES 8TH ANNIVERSRY GACHA</b> IS
  SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY I CAN'T EVEN. As I would put it in a sentence, "all I
  needed to do was to wait 3 weeks and I could have saved a hundred bucks". YUP,
  those are MORE expensive than marupi-chan's gacha runs and I did that thrice
  which is half of the above purchase already <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span>, still is more than a copy
  of the actual on sale items afterwards which I actually was waiting for. If
  not for my lack of patience (which I will explain why not later I promise you)
  (the fate of timing, dude) and wanting to get something from them (not Nagaku
  Yuki, f**k you) and not fearing of the high price of the gacha itself... yeah
  whatever that printed sign was worth it lol I don't even know what to do with
  the arcylic displays. Hang them somewhere? Ugh, don't mention this to me
  again, thanks.&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And I guess runner up can be going to the auction site for bromide photos
  again haha this pales in comparison but it was for a CD single I could not buy
  off hand. I'm never doing this again too tell me to eat a thousand needles
  next time before I do it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  It was a time earlier this year when DMM still hasn't region locked (again)
  their services to domestic sales, and boy did I at least take that ride when
  there was a sale back then, and could not help but ask myself what can I pay
  tribute to from my childhood this year. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I know there's Sugihara
  Anri's photobook at the start of this year and that's rather bold of me, but
  little did I know that long time idol(?)
  <b>Shinozaki Ai is still releasing photobooks</b> so I, uh, did not buy the
  latest one mind you haha, and bought one a couple of years ago? Yeah, it's
  still good, it's still gravure it's not as bad as last year <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, but yeah
  Shinozaki, this one is for you. That's all. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, she does not have
  that much history compared to the former; Sugihara has been around for quite a
  while haha ah

  This one, I feel like I have a lot to mention about this year, if you haven't
  been following my adventures already, so here we go. Specifically two periods
  of time I missed purchasing (of course) more bromide photos which would have
  made me a happy man this year. Firstly, it was some
  <b>Kana-chan event bromide photos</b> and boy my reason for not buying it
  right off the bat was because I was waiting for Akarin? Yeah, I thought she
  will make it in so I can bundle it with this (and maybe slap in some Ayachi
  ones hehe) but DAMN did the Kana-chan ones just sell out within 2 days I can't
  even. Randomized too, likely leftover from the event too, though I assumed
  that compared to the previous time we did this, it wasn't that on demand.
  <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Should've given PONY CANYON more shipping money, which I eventually did
  actually even without Kana-chan, you can find out more in the posts I did
  respectively. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  The second time and boy I hate to mention this again let's get this done and
  over with lol, it was when that&nbsp;<b>Aizawa Saya bromide photo set</b
  >&nbsp;was sold for her yearly birthday event back in September. And no, we
  are not talking about the time I had to use CDJapan's Proxy Shopping service
  to buy the ones from last year's birthday event. (Almost missed counting that
  in tbh) This one, and now I think social media promotions are actually
  important, is that I totally skimmed over the

    target="_blank"
    >promotions of the sale of these items</a
  >
  (because they looked the same pre and post-event), and by the time I realized
  it was up (which I have been waiting for weeks) and I went to the store... it
  was sold out. My heart just dropped into the bottom of the seas when I saw
  that because, and I dare not hype you too much lest you find out about my
  fetishes, she was dressed up as a

  as some gothic gyaru with extreme makeup? I guess is the best description, and
  she is ADORABLE in that my heart sank even further into the abyss. I did not
  physically recover from that, I tell ya, much worse than when Saya-chan had
  too announce her hiatus. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I hope she's well though.

  for me this year, and one as a continuation from where I left off refreshing
  my music listening setup.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  The list above should be a decent summary of what I will credit them for just
  this year alone, if you would recall those collaboration take-for-each-other
  TomoSha series which had like Suguta Hina and Kido Ibuki <span class="emoji" title="😚">*chef's kiss*</span> haha,
  marupi-chan was because I couldn't wait 9 months for a photobook review so I
  got that on my birthday (thanks for the info, Amazon) (also so far supported
  by <a href="https://wpb.shueisha.co.jp" target="_blank">Shupure</a> lmao
  that's technically a gravure idol site) (they also did Moeshi's digital
  photobook which I didn't buy), I mentioned Ten-chan above which its discount
  is icing on the sweet cake, but specifically I want to talk about
  <b

  And then, there's the <b>modernistic CD player</b> I bought to replace my
  current boombox. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I've been using that for years, and have only been
  using those for years because Hi-Fi systems are not cheap anyways, and I could
  go for a more wireless setup that takes up less space, so my decision back
  then was to buy this... this portable CD drive from the old days if you kids
  have ever seen those before, and then wirelessly
  <b>pair them with a Bluetooth-supported bookshelf speaker set</b>. And
  eventually, instead of going for the standard (which means expensive) option
  which my cousin was rich enough to buy (he also bought a condominium so what
  else is new lol), so I went for the budget option in view of how little I do
  reviews for Klassic Note nowadays. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Maybe the next time I upgrade this
  is when I can put all the CDs up in a single room and I have an actual
  listening room to put a pair of speakers that will immerse me in. Just don't
  ask what I'm listening to some cute girl singing. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  And I'm finally done! I spend all afternoon on this I don't have to do
  anything else now. <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span> Happy birthday Futon-chan! I hope some gifted
  subs is enough for your Twitch channel to host a bath stream someday.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I can't buy your photobook from your online store anyways they don't
  like international cards so <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> but hey, I mentioned you in this, how
  about that! Yes, I covered my digital footprint last year too, there have been
  many things happening. Hopefully we can do more of that this year, but damn,
  this might be hard as Japan likes to make sure we physically buy stuff (which
  is still inevitably taking up space even if it's photos) and boy does it make
  the stockpile here grow faster than I expect. Still, don't think I'll stop
  doing this as long as I keep the first photobook rule down <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> no really
  Kido Ibuki sounds great paired with the word "swimsuit" but
  <em>maybe</em> it's time to branch out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you then haha

  P.S. I did some research ie. I just searched in Japanese lol, the difference
  between the two terms of photobooks used in Japan which are in Kanji "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/shashinshuu"
    target="_blank"
    >shashinshuu</a
  >" and in Katakana "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/fotobukku"
    target="_blank"
    >fotobukku</a
  >". The gist is that the latter is for expressing something so it typically
  comes with comments and more focused on its art, and the former is more of
  just purely showing off photos. Which will explain why Koko-chan's books are
  so far called the latter term just because- You saw

    >that cover on the 2nd photobook</a
  >
  though? That's expression, I'll give you that.

  P.P.S. In case you wonder my fetish to "Pien Girls" and the thing... don't
  read the depression part in the article but let's just say you can get picked
  up by an adult video producer to have s*x with some dude. You know, to let off
  steam. HAHA okay I'm done keep this a secret here would ya
