F**K!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, new year new mistakes, amirite??</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, fixed them all everything is right in this world now (just... don't look at the URLs thanks haha), so maybe let's start talking about Anime and music! We have been doing posts all weekend long starting with the final package of last year opened as the first of this year if you get the gist it's just more mistakes and waiting for something to happen, and rounding all them mistakes up took longer than the Song Awards for some reason lol we NEED to speed this up at some point so I don't have to dread on reflecting on my mistakes-</div><div><br></div><div>Let's! More Ayaneru I guess I'm so hooked into her in Anime for some reason those newbies need to catch up lol</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=DosaKoi02><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"In the ear? Don't sneak up to me like that?" Well, it's not biting on the ear Tsubasa wtf are you talking about lol</div></blockquote><div>Yeah, it was great sitting out on the family trip to go date, it really was. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where I get to see snow because where I live I can only see the heat from the sun lol (#DosaKoi02), we do some winter stuff this week with our newly found <strike>friend</strike> classmate! Haha jokes on you Grandma, we already did it in the igloo- ANYWAYS lol mind the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> references would ya, but this episode is just a follow-up to whatever new life Tsubasa here has been experiencing in Hokkaido and is desperate to explore more, starting with Minami's rear- Starting with the Winter Festival!! (Haha definitely a typo over there) I don't think it looks much too, maybe younger Minami-san may have liked it more and probably Tsubasa will get bored of it in a couple of years, but heck, seeing snow sculptures? Biting on sugar-coated, excuse me, Minami-san saliva coated corn dogs?? And then falling on top of her??? What an experience! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah I know, I just listed ALL the wrong things that happened between the couple, but seriously though, it may not be the Harbin Snow Exhibition, but it's still a sight to behold at least for first impressions. They ate local food, sat on top of each other (wait wait don't leave I haven't finished my sentence) to slide down the snow slopes, and took lots of photos worthy of Minami-san's social media feed lol. Hey, they had fun, why won't you? It was still a joy watching them have fun though ngl. Moving on, I think that's probably not an issue now considering we passed the Grandma barrier lol not sure about the dad though we haven't even seen him yet, is Minami-san's totally unobtrusive visit to Tsubasa's... I would call abode to be honest, this is hardly just a house at this point. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Now that Mianmi-san has that locked and loaded haha you think this is how she knew to pull Tsubasa into her life so they can do it in an igloo in front of the old woman?? I mean, misunderstandings alright <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but kids these days sure have it easy. No really, why didn't anyone do this to me. Oh, no igloos. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And unlike whatever family traditions or values there are to not talk to outgoing females on the streets, well not like the grandson had a choice but she does have rack and is nice to him so I would say grandma you have NOTHING to worry about this granddaughter-in-law will bear you descendants for DECADES lmao can we not have that on screen, please? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, still a joy to watch as predictable as it is, I would say it's good but it's also slow in pace as if I haven't complained enough about that about slice-of-life shows. So yeah, I'll still give the 3-episode rule established here for years and totally not stolen online lol, because we will get to listen to not Ueshama but Hanamori Yumiri as they introduce the new girl if I'm not wrong, this one's a gamer. Haha we may have missed that "Yamada-kun" Anime so maybe we take a look at this! Then maybe we can reject the heck out of this one lmao the animation is just not great dude also the ending song written by Ooishi Masayoshi again? Can this guy just buzz off?? Haha <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "Maybe you shouldn't get your hopes up..."

Where do I sign up? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright me you aren't evil enough to be a demon to fight against Sakura Ayane anyways lol though in this episode (#KanaTen02), maybe "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/kanzen target=_blank>complete</a> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/juujun target=_blank>obedience</a>" isn't a phrase that has been used in the R18 world in Japan... Oh well it's an Anime now so what of it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, in case you aren't caught up in the lore like I did and I must say we have finally reached the objective of this series in general, let's talk about it. For starters, that dog tag. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, it can be anything else, but it's invisible and you can completely control a demon on this so why not, right? <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/12531/Ciel_Phantomhive target=_blank>Ciel Phantomhive</a> WISHES he has such a power without losing an eye lol. Then again, this is unlike what we have here where Akutsu is essentially held captive by Lily-chan here, is now altered to do her bidding, even to the extent of her controlling his body to do whatever she wants? So she can step on me?? WHERE DO I SIGN UP- Haha you are going to hear that very often if I continue with this series. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, not that it's a bad thing Akutsu has been warned about this already before he left Hell (also why did he listen to oh hey Kugimiya Rie and her advice to wear a wig and piss the teacher off), but nonetheless he is rather powerless compared to this not so influential angel it seems? Yeah, but I like to assume they both have influences on their own, so this binding contract is just something unlikely to be utilized as this is how it works for this story so far. In compensation though, looks like Lily-chan here does feel bad for not rewarding her new servant *woof *haha sorry that's just me, and through a late night TV show THEY BOTH F**KING WATCHED IN REAL TIME APPARENTLY (lmao this Anime is dumb funny it's great) (yeah and they both know lol we have more than one TV channel in Japan, right?), they both learnt that the best way to punish/reward the other party is by seducing them. Although this results in different goals with Akutsu trying to... I don't know, release that permanent tattoo so he can go to the pool? Haha versus Lily-chan here just actually being an angel and being nice for one in her bullied life from what seems like the higher-ups she was reporting to? Yeah, backstory for later I guess. For now, we can just enjoy them flirting with each other in the boxing field of love while the sensei stakes his life as being the referee in such a dangerous environment. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Nonetheless, I must say this logic flow is exceptional yet funny at the same time, don't look too deep into their backstories too much I'm sure this isn't an Anime "Kaguya-sama" flashback in the ending animation for Lily-chan here lol, but hey, they are enjoying themselves flirting with each other so what's stopping them? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I would say this balance and I don't need I need three episodes to say yes to this, because if it's a romance comedy that knows when to put its alternate worlds in place which will likely happen just to end this season of episodes... I'm not that worried too much as of now, the things these two are doing to each other will keep me going, especially the girl. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ask me again next week to see if I have fallen in love with Amane Lily because we're not quite there yet she didn't have the collar on me after all haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; If you need to make me watch Anime nowadays just <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/186041/Saki_Saki target=_blank>make Sakura Ayane a joke</a> (shout out to Anime "KanoKano") and I'm already on my seat lol she sounds great as a joke tbh]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyCXQ-aJQZMbN7AQuTklL_TBSs1OgsF5qwubgCEZAohGXARtpkfJRmza3qqMTIaJ8FgMVGiSjyCMJscpK7pxFM3xRtP4L7O1muzp3cySQLaWy7YHbnOdYet9nf2WssBKyQ0780M_a0lnXZVFQIEzsBG83ErXtlui436_inFRbVfKwz9DJIQ55b8Kat_a8/s320/kanaten02_body.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What got me this episode:<br>Someday I will get this feel of a woman landing on my chest, someday. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsgKf6x-OskzVRUsUknoFKwRAEHQGsQDEFzFxCqG4bXeEL-Vlnss7QGQ3vRjEO9VU0X6ygZ0fDDh40DTkTBDSkGNmm_9A25AJ5azuG8ySk7s24sNpdM3DxL_zz5AJi7keBVwGmC_fXGgVklg2wPMXNBidcg-u9-3fze0Kl8uW3AsiWCPCcyIW8oFr85AA/s320/kanaten02_lolipop.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What got me this episode:<br>Heck, you might as well just lick my-</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Okay NOW this is an opening theme song! Haha maybe I watch more action series, huh. They have better songs too- You heard that Anime "MASHLE" opening theme song from Creepy Nuts too? What a coincidence. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Alright this Anime first, we can listen to songs later. This episode though continues on the story of witches and beasts lol it's in the title (#MajoToYajuu02), but about magic curses that come with sacrifice. Pretty normal for magical worlds if you ask me, which also means someone might have obtained a power that isn't within their control. Not me, I haven't gained the power to let girls fall in love with me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Old <strike>bitch</strike> witch this week sorry haha, but that is not until we have a month of... what was that, babysitting a beast? Sure is a tough job for mostly Ashaf I suppose, not like Gideau will be doing anything besides finding the witch she hates most and kills them. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So interestingly, it didn't take long for us to know what they are going that. Also why the lesson in the intro, because Gideau here is stuck with a curse. If it's looking badass and missing out on her delinquent youth being a blonde beauty I would say I'm sorry right now <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>, but you know, reasons. Reasons we don't have to know because it's not in the case, reasons that maybe can be said in a soundproof room but it's not we got jebaited by the Mage in the city they then visited, and reasons the mayor only called upon these guys to help this Mage out just because they don't want whatever Army to come in to interfere. You know, it's a terrible job but I rather pay for diplomacy than fight a war. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyhow haha politics joke by the way, that is what has been decided, I like how these two get priority over witch missions which basically means they are the main characters in this series lol, and looking at this case... we have got quite the thing going on here. I know they made sure to show you the chests of women being ripped apart and expanding and such <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span>, but hey, if this is the only ecchi stuff they can show us to you know, make us remember back the action, I'll take it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, I'm pretty sure everything else might have gotten your attention. The good food haha that is quite a good wine Gideau just spilled *licks table*, the travelling too, the drama here so far is rather palatable not like we are dealing with &lt;insert Kara no Kyoukai r*pe scene here> so... I think I am alright in seeing some kind of action going on here, which would likely conclude soon somehow with something hidden in the bushes as Ashaf kept part of the letter shown to Gideau. I would assume this is a two-parter from the episode title, and I think I shall decide if I want to continue watching by then. But seriously though, even in animation this isn't as bad as the other two even though I can just pause a frame and show you a "SHAFTed" Gideau looking back it's just weird lol, the theme songs are the best so far also even if not by my standards, and damn is the story as captivating as it's also great. The action is solid though, even if the sound effects aren't working their best. Heck, it's like Gideau, dude. She isn't working her best but she still has to work, but I'm just into this so maybe I'll work harder than Ashaf to come back and see what happens to this witch- Tell me that is a dude haha I'll be damned if it is</div><div>[TL:DR; "Why are you so fixated on the witch?"

"Mistake is another word for experience.

I don't know lol)</div><div>P.P.S. "I'll kill you later, but I can beat you up first" Haha Gideau would you please though? Just be gentle lol</div><div><br></div><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span style=font-size:large>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote><div>Well, this week is a slow week in Klassic Note, but that doesn't mean I haven't been giving songs left and right. Because I found out they put these guys' up on Apple Music this week, I ended up listening to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/where-is-the-coconuts-ha/1500736614?l=en-US" target=_blank>QUATTRO's album from 2010</a></b>, and this is so comforting I can't even, I don't even want to listen to the new songs that have appeared this week alone. Yes, talking about you, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sesame-ep/1721303274?l=en-US" target=_blank>Kroi's new single</a></b>. Not you though, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/slip-fall-sleep/1722922006?i=1722922187&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>No Buses' new song</a></b>, you were actually great. Not the music video though haha why are songs, why. Moving on though to more not new songs, I think I did do this before, but <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ily/1688962473?i=1688962474&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank><b>MaRuRi's song from last year</b></a> did get me with the love lines almost avoiding whatever jams on the melody is in there, and I took a detour to give <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hoshino-taiyou/1645981741?i=1645981742&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>her other song</a> that I have previously rejected a couple of years ago, if I'm not wrong. Yeah, the music video is still in my YouTube viewing history. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Turns out I can give subpar songs at the start of the year-</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, we got new music up the alley, and it's not because I listened to <b><a href="https://x.com/Creepy_Nuts_/status/1747969583494173088?s=20" target=_blank>Creepy Nuts' new song that has been taking over the Anime audience</a></b> this week. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Seriously addicting though, thinking of if I even care to give it tbh. Other than that, we have more news that'll pique your interest, so hear me out. <b><a href="https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1746667335250059330?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's new song is for a cooking drama</a></b> and I think this is setting her out for the new year after what she has delivered to us last year, those two EPs. <a href="https://x.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1747921773578928417?s=20" target=_blank><b>Earphones' new song</b></a> included in their upcoming album which I could wait for a month but heck I might as well listen, is a surprisingly simple and good song though? Well, the album is coming soon I'll take my chances at more surprises from here on, this is the niche stuff that'll get me sometimes and I like that. <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1747982177457819671?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai announced their new single is releasing start of March</a></b> this year so yay more of RyokuShaka I guess, which should feature their recent credits for drama. <b><a href="https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1748273099781624253?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new single covers</a></b> look so good I might as well not talk about the song itself lol we shall see again when the music video or B-side is revealed in due time. In their Budokan live tour this weekend, <b><a href="https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1748671603188384062?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi announced a new album slated for this summer</a></b> ie. wait for July at least haha, which will include their new major debut singles and it has been a while since I heard of their album 2 years ago so let's set the palette again once again, guys. <b><a href="https://x.com/scandal_band/status/1748699553262600624?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL revealed more details of their upcoming album</a></b> including track list and one of them being an ending theme song for Anime so that's rad. What is not rad though is probably them needing to align their style with me again with all those misses in recent years, I hope this will help turn it around. <b><a href="https://x.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1749024631355293891?s=20" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana announced a new album due for April</a></b> which also means it's time for me to give that one song I've neglected a year before this album will be released lol, but also give us a good time to see what else she has to offer before I cancel by fanclub subscription which will likely come first. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Don't tell me please I don't want to make her sad haha I will still listen to the album on music streaming though. Just hot off the press from the end of their live tour, <b><a href="https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1749046937267872010?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina announced a new single</a></b> which includes the spectacular collaboration with her on the lyrics and the composition from Tabuchi Tomoya (yes that bassist from UNISON SQUARE GARDEN who wrote too many off-beat Anime songs to please) so this is going to be something cool to say the least. Ah I see why now, it's releasing on 17th April, Shiina Day.</div><div><br></div><div>Okay so next week, I am in high hopes for <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new album</b> which is a good reminder to all of us they aren't dead yet they are still dancing the way I want them to hopefully, because <b>Fuchigami Mai's concept album</b> is just devoid of new songs I might just listen when I have the time. Still a rather slow start for January but it's fine I have songs to listen to. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Aw damn, am I really not feeling too well so I will finish this before I drop into my bed for the next few <strike>years</strike> days if I need to (lol) which I hear my new bolster is quite different from the previous one which was exchanged with my dad's years ago <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> haha so that'll be fun. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Otherwise, you'll be glad to be served with a slew of blog posts and even more if you have not been around for like, a year or so because you will be greatly entertained by the stuff I bought over the past year besides medicine and nutrition products. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I know, life is pain, I keep being reminded of it. See you guys then, maybe I settle in early, and until next time... Ten-chan as phone wallpaper as next week feels wasted if I'm only staring at my phone all day, don't you think? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
