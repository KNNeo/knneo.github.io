The drafts are coming in well though, a lot of <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span> moments to look forward to. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Happy new year everyone! Sorry for being a week late on this, the calendar is trying to make Monday suck less but we knew what happened to Japan just three days into the year so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> Well, let's talk about happier stuff! For this week, I technically did not have anything on the agenda, but I might as well take the time to talk about two Anime(?) I watched for the week over this weekend or basically just now with the Anime "BURN THE WITCH" prequel lmao, so that I can offset the music news which happened for the past 2 weeks- It's going to be long, by the way, I hope you are ready... to skip all of them LMAO</div><div><br></div><div>Let's keep the positive vibes and simple moods going in the new year, shall we? I mean, not you but I will try to not be sad until the arrival of the upcoming package <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=PokemonConcierge><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Pokémon Concierge</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Beautiful blue sky, beautiful blue ocean... I'm in paradise!"</div></blockquote><div>Yeah I kind of watched this a couple of days ago out of curiosity so why not, I'll talk about it. I'll be a Pokémon nerd for once, for this short series exclusive on Netflix <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (#PokemonConcierge) is just probably the easiest entry into the Pokémon universe in case you aren't even familiar with it yet along with my social circle of nerds around this pet fighting hobby which emerged two decades ago. Not going to bore you further about the lore behind this, I just am interested to watch the animation here, but I didn't expect to see more than what I expected. The story is otherwise short and sweet, enough to fill me with tears, and is I'll be glad to take the spot of Haru if you tell me to work there now. I'll be so sick of working, and would love to live a life working serving not pets whose facility management doesn't mind about breaking the budget. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, look at that Pidgeot flying into the tent and you tell me. Anyways, definitely a recommend to kids just in general, and for fans it's just joy in every corner especially if you know them mons. I, uh... barely know about most of them thank goodness they used many Gen 1 mons like MVP Psyduck lol, and you don't want to listen to Magikarp's kissing voice. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> That's all I want to say to be honest haha I'll leave the lore to you because you have to watch it yourself to feel it, it's the resort experience after all.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhE0QvMLD5XSb-h2SrIAC57OvPOILVpPQC51DPBStjSf23Dzn3Bf-NeFxXR7Q09YZGyETAvbLl8HIf0IuLqbHrFH-DFjOw9pSNvH4gg7mrpqaFpakQk1tWCBuXLO61ioOZoaKdj50zJ1FgSIT7-PuZzFt1sUVSIWfzR99a4N4IxkgHjDuEmTPZcBJ9-zBE/s320/pokemonconcierge_river.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you have seen or played the Pokemon Snap game, you will know how beautiful it is to see <strike>Magikarp</strike> Psyduck floating around haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZ2Oaz6eD7qMxdGgCPqOEC8Vm2vRwDWODcqhFaDd1O_cYU4976-RdUfHysRFCdYqjKLpK4r4yFAv0QfHCqBxvUifre7JoZmuIQTrs9uP5wI4XQTHvi62WSq9KvyKBNGOEjUhFWZ9m30s5Zqf46EgHup7sQdpU40ycu60uzaE61HyWpfOVEvGCkRAnLkoY/s320/pokemonconcierge_lift.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Graveler stronger than Metagross confirmed lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWzSt8lFgtZxi6EvUWqLPM3CSIbVVGlLIQqOZrQfXsN4gKDKtDyFHkqX9EL0kc4oy1MxQ_LRVXVfeiF_zYOCYgO_4h5LgRG7VCm1sa_1dee9zem-9sbYg9gWf7KXBrZH662QKAI8V2uZpDwz3cJ4Y3oRzAdhyphenhyphenNz4dfYjmebSIVKaOd856zxoe2U9wCE00/s320/pokemonconcierge_bento.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Even the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/bentou target=_blank>bento</a> looks so good though!!!</table></div></div><div>P.S. "Even though they (Magikarp) can't swim, they are still having fun" What people expect I look like if I were to hang out with them lol not true btw</div><div>P.P.S. "Is there anything specific you think I should be doing?" Haru-chan I think so my crotch is a little itchy... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey</div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BURNTHEWITCH08><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> BURN THE WITCH #0.8</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Their uniforms are sexy as hell! Why though? Because it's all black!" This guy has that black colour fetish on girls I hear about lol<span style=text-align:left> </span></div></blockquote><div>What was this about? Oh, the prequel. Well, considering I didn't remember much about the mini-series Anime "BLEACH" Kubo-sensei made in recent years that eerily looked like that other magic series we all know and love, this special episode (#BURNTHEWITCH08) is about slice-of-life. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Who am I joking about, but we have to lead up first, it's only the one episode. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So in summary we get to experience the life of Reverse London once again, living as one of the students in the academy I am not going to spell out the name, but I will talk about Noel-chan whose appeal point is CLEARLY not her panties (lol), and whoever her sidekick is, Ninny? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, her. I don't really recall what is the story previously, but I'm pretty sure we know the pet is some dragon in disguise that is not new, but looks like the new take is that Balgo's childhood friend Selby is one too. Well, let's talk about what is the essence of the episode instead of picking grapes off a huge dragon. This episode is about how Balgo came to be in the girls' care, and yeah, about Disguisers. Looks like simply said, it's just Dark Dragon disguised in some corpse, because maybe you do recall that Dragons in this world aren't allowed to be in contact with humans because they literally will turn evil it's how Dementors are born haha ah, but heck, the thing is that Balgo has been in contact with both of them this whole time! Yeah, problem, isn't it? And who is to say he has been hallucinating about seeing some girl's... panties per se being an evil thing lol, but he isn't wrong about seeing Noel-chan go into a phone booth and disappear? I mean, she didn't disappear she just had to beat him up so he won't see much about it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, such is a day in the work life of the girls, because they rarely get to do these extermination missions, are still climbing their way up the ladder in order to one day, maybe marry a handsome man- Oh no wait haha, like, exterminate the big guys. I mean, this Dark Dragon is pretty big already, the one inside Osushi that is also parroting perverted sentences in a loop lol, so yeah, what's wrong about it? I mean, just this episode itself is a great showcase of the wonders of the worldview behind it, how some idiot got his wish fulfilled just like I wish I had with girls IRL lmao, and now that his childhood friend is dead and he doesn't look like he has a family to go back to and not like he can since he is effectively arrested for being with Dragons for this long... You see, this setup for a romance Anime couldn't be sweeter. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Then again, I mean, if Kubo-sensei wants to make these once in a while, I'll be in to watch them. Hey it's their rendition of a magical world, I'll take it above all the damn Anime this season alone, I'd rather take faith in this to impress me more as we see more of it. How much more? We will see how far this goes. <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/prove/1720084399?i=1720084400&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>The theme song</a> is out though, in case you are keen.</div><div>[TL:DR; I'm pretty sure some Anime producer lost a bet against Kubo-sensei and had to make this episode haha yeah they thought they were done 2 years ago with the mini-series]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgU7BYqOK4A9rmci7A-a8-xJGoKXxqrsS3F-DGQ4VwW9L32ZOkY-mdK8cVjHQb8GwT2u8-UjoymHiluYxBPtIaWi3PB5glpyn1fnpDCOPY-5ijIkPrtkFSDMRDhkRCOs-C13MHL9u1PCuiC39Gg9YqTt9SvAOuAnoivi4LxTlaXMNVj1DXOlZzeT_79nVc/s320/burnthewitch0_8_noel2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Girls in shame is my thing, yes.<br><span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi85tMgxYtgufv4tfTMYYwzNdhIM2BgCEDU61D-vbM8eqWIpW0fF6-awKJH-BUU7F-EroDydBynTglgRX_3Ek3L5SXG_xrpwfYY_ddY9HprGOYkMjP-jl-76T-RWdp7KTYa1Ytb4fetUleQN5u1UWYLfPEVY9ySL2c8CUxN46F6KGSOU69ROKh-Nf01RKo/s320/burnthewitch0_8_kick.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This week in violence we have:<br>Seriously though, girls who exhibit the little violence they have?

Yes, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%8A%E3%81%B5%E3%82%8D%E3%81%AE%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F/1711365342?i=1711365343&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>DENIMS and your latest song</a></b>, that isn't an album so I'm not referring to you guys. Also not giving the song anyways I wish to listen to different songs when I am showering. Also, I don't' have a bath so this isn't relevant. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Moving on jokes' over, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/uncertain-place/1719231847?l=en-US" target=_blank>Bearwear's new album</a></b> turned out better than I thought, somehow I'm glad I didn't try to haphazard give it <a href="https://x.com/Bearwear_jp/status/1737125922510410054?s=20" target=_blank>two weeks ago when it's out</a> and give it more time, because damn, do I still love Alternative music after all these years. It's just my kick, dude. Also my kick this season is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/chilli-beans/1629402603?l=en-US" target=_blank>Chilli Beans. album from 2022</a></b> because I've been wanting to get back to their classics until they handed me a brand new album last month, so I'm back understanding how <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/you-n-me/1716068321?i=1716068660&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>the one song I got hooked to</a> and immediately got bored of it the next day, LITERALLY replicated with <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A4/1629402603?i=1629402880&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>another similar melody</a> in this very album. That's how the former song didn't get as popular as this one. Well now I know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I also started on listening to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/live-in-tokyo-2022/1663668424?l=en-US" target=_blank>w.o.d. live album from 2022</a></b> but for this I will go more in-depth in giving the various albums after I dealt with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/shiny-land/1538154552?l=en-US" target=_blank>Sakaguchi Ami's debut album back in 2020</a></b> where she is very indie and not very polished, still managed to get me with a couple of songs as the indie music connoisseur I am so I'm not that worried in giving less. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I need to be stricter though, been too generous last year already ngl</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, are you ready, kids? This is going to be a long one, you have been warned there have been many announcements since the new year dropped by and more Japanese voice actresses announced their marriage. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways not that <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> we are talking about music, so let's <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> move on. (lol) Good thing about waiting this long for news is that I can shortern some of the stuff mentioned here. This includes <b><a href="https://x.com/uesaka_official/status/1743243062179156232?s=20" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new music video</a></b> and <b><a href="https://x.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1742931393020379468?s=20" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's new music video</a></b> for their new singles and ironically both music videos are... beyond my comprehension so let's just say song-wise the latter is better. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> This still isn't enough time to reveal <b><a href="https://x.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1741655736550309947?s=20" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's new music video premiere</a></b> though since it's happening next week instead, so I guess I will wait patiently for that. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1742926084948254804?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi teasing us with live video footage</a></b> to sell us the Limited Edition of their new single is kind of unfair, but then again I look forward to <a href="https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1734867986304098639?s=20" target=_blank><b>their new song in a couple of weeks</b></a> so maybe that first, guys. Then again their whatever <b><a href="https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1739269904354984137?s=20" target=_blank>surround sound audio live footage</a></b> was awesome so I'll take that. <b><a href="https://x.com/AKG_information/status/1742157637301768567?s=20" target=_blank>Gotch is producing a song in a flood of circle's new EP</a></b> releasing in March this year and this isn't the first time I have to listen to these guys again because of a certain someone so heck, their album like, two years ago didn't hit maybe with Masafumi Gotoh we can get this old rock band going again. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/glimspanky/status/1741477661187117148?s=20" target=_blank>GLIM SPANKY is featured in a new song from THE BAWDIES</a></b> and boy did I not see that wrong but that also means I'll be giving the retro rock band a listen once again since I gave their most popular hit a couple of years ago. I know right, guess whose style is older in this case. TWELVE artists have gathered for <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1740658928302928376?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's tribute album which is releasing in February</a></b>, likely is only featuring songs written by not Hotaka-san who left lol, still probably won't make me care more than SID's tribute album so uh... Sony Music Japan we going on a tribute spree recently, eh? (lol) Speaking of the latter, <b><a href="https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1739956765452841310?s=20" target=_blank>SID's new song will release next week</a></b> so I might just give it a listen, it has been a while since they sung too. Oh oh, <b><a href="https://x.com/lounge666/status/1740359232141361362?s=20" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE's live performance with an ensemble</a></b> was good though, that you gotta check it out, they sang their most popular song. <b><a href="https://x.com/nhk_kouhaku/status/1741429121593278777?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's live performance for a national music countdown programme</a></b> sure is overkill though in case you didn't notice, but I did notice <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1740195112578375938?s=20" target=_blank>their new song is for a commercial</a></b> so I will take note when that will be out in due time. Last but not least and I rather you read the minor ones yourself this is more important than those, I did watch <b><a href="https://x.com/homcomi/status/1739210547588141182?s=20" target=_blank>Homecomings' new live video</a></b> even though it was last year but damn, seeing the band member talking about how much they love the song they created themselves is so emotional I can't even. It's a good one though, No.1 in <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1743247635505631685?s=20" target=_blank>Klassic Note 2023 Top 20</a> by the way. Okay maybe I talk about the Aniplex music event happening today where like, the <b><a href="https://x.com/aniplex_event/status/1743945831072649411?s=20" target=_blank>Anime "Lycoris Recoil" main characters sing the ClariS theme song</a></b>, for example. Just that only though, <a href="https://x.com/aniplex_event/status/1743971181026521261?s=20" target=_blank>not much else</a> worth mentioning.
