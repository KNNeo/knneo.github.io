Well, not purely intentional, but purely coincidental it was, and I'm glad I get to take my week deserved break for the month (lol), though I guess there's next week too but my mental health is already affecting my physical health like we all do so I think I shall use this excuse to live my life from now on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span></div><div><br></div><div>It's understandable if you need to rewrite this intro lol me then again maybe consider rewriting the fanfic for the week also while you're at it? Why are the stories recently of fictional me offending women? Haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, Anime and music! I just want to distract myself from whatever sadness might be happening to any of them, to be honest. Then again me, didn't you want to watch <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/53747/Kimi_no_Iro target=_blank>that Anime movie about avoiding sadness</a> if it comes out by the end of the year? Yeah haha oh well.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanaTen11><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"This room feels so big ever since Akutsu left... I wonder if he's still going at it" Yeah I'm sure he's just enjoying his time out there haha</div></blockquote><div>Yeah... I forgot what her name is- Oh Liz haha, you think your reinforcements can get by faster just a little bit more? I don't think Akutsu is in a good position right now though in the new episode (#KanaTen11) jokes on me because it looks like we are beating up Zwei's avatars like we don't respect women, even the fake ones. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Happy International Women's Month, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Real cool though, not gonna lie about that, this is the most action we have seen in this series so far, making me recall that this is still an action series despite all the love and jokes that have been going around. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay coming back, and we shall use Lilia-san's enactment as supporting statement where she witnessed all this while being trapped by Lily-chan, Akutsu beat up Zwei good time with his unlocked(?) demon powers, after dealing with his avatars. I mean, it's kind of exacting revenge on what ridicule Lily-chan got from the previous episode, but I'm sure you and I will have noticed that this - as quickly as Akutsu can move somehow - has turned into something of a bully incident, and that is really because they did the flashback of Zwei looking at Lily-chan (you sick f**k lol) as a kid, and from thus far has never really abused her. Well, not physically but you get the idea. So yeah, point is, no need to beat him up this bad just to send him back home to say the least. Lily-chan even came in to save her brother now that he is at a disadvantage, but damn did the inner demon of Akutsu not care and they just slapped away Lily-chan like she was a piece of paper. Happy International Women's Month, by the way. *yikes* Anyways joke's over it's not funny anymore, really makes you think of the emotions that have been built up so far, but we can also confirm from this that Akutsu isn't himself while being so overpowered like we have never seen before. Well, if you have never seen other Anime before lol this taking over your soul thing isn't new. I mean, Liz probably knew of this, something about their inner soul and stuff and somehow Akutsu being special which also explains why he is still alive compared to his other comrades who are already exorcised I would assume. Still, the angel siblings knew of a way to deal with them, I'm surprised though expected to see that Zwei used his own wings to counter Akutsu's, and I like how Lily-chan used the same fluke method to deal with the demon just like how they did with the possessed Lilia-san. I know right, too much deja vu I can't even. In the aftermath though I am NOT going to talk about whatever happened in Akutsu's room lmao but on the rooftops, I really thought the sister will emerge out of Lilia-san, but as the avatar has described to Akutsu later on, it looks like the ridicule was meant to be a given considering this is also quite a reality check for Lily with the appearance of the brother, but moreover, Lilia mentioned about how Akutsu technically saved her despite all of this that happened this episode? Dude, they trying to wipe the slate clean now?? They are DEFINITELY trying to conclude this series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay hear me out, you heard what Lilia-san talked about to Akutsu already, so let me say my word too. For starters, I think the worlds might have secrets behind them. As much as there is distinction between angels and the fake ones with the latter being Lily-chan working hard to even be able to fight against demons today, but also, Akutsu's own powers that he might not know of, ironically tied to the angels too? Hey, prove me wrong, but we are only one episode away from this season, and I really highly doubt this will get a sequel anytime soon so...? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, now that they have dropped more lore, I want to know more but I know we are near the end, so uh... maybe Lily's sister won't drop by anytime soon? This I will not worry about, just more on the Liz side. Or maybe not, now that things have settled down. Secrets are best kept confidential, aren't they? We shall see what will conclude this season next week then. </div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX32nO960fn2BW6zs9n3OATU58tnb_7dpdd_tem2OidYRn9-qZ8vkCLVCIwJ2qrBtA47py7zkQkR6mvG6RNciJTuRySXFqCjlYG-4Md20LAWRtU-VvVajnmhQ5TgV5x6fktf84moM7IbehVCHgvfNar3LNp13wKovjLWAbLO5wiReWjWWCy-cgWrzixY8/s320/kanaten11_demon8.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I'm going to prove Akutsu stole all his ideas from "BLEACH"<br>(Akutsu just transforming because of his inner Hollow lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWtHqiVCO3wTddqW3vwupB40Zsb6OOZAYNGUdS4WE7LOmCyoYb1NcGtckvndUTMy65Kz8bGVEQXfvi2g40Yp3eWkiJ8mvpSrUSvG6HFDL42FLMgZBeI3D3LKoYcirQil7Et_W6158qDFj2JYdIBKq94-7XtLLz4ETRnYGuzeDrZH-uJmK6UIuPSSfP8aU/s320/kanaten11_demon9.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I'm going to prove Akutsu stole all his ideas from "BLEACH"<br>(Alright, how are Yoruichi and Isshin holding Aizen down in this?)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8uxBEA0FkJNw7s4XVdgrArT_KcxEOuDTsPi9fjNWXkdbSx6jDR1T6fOS9lAqTnF0EZNmPuwQtJMmv1XRm4W36PNomhaPLQLI3aEUx-qFATXYV-9BEpQUMuxrVCSyzpcoYiXhqus_JRDrrzVMAiDJLjgi7B7qn8yztFTHzewpoFn5VYeQ5_H4oWg6YdFE/s320/kanaten11_demon5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I'm going to prove Akutsu stole all his ideas from "BLEACH"<br>(Yo Aizen, Ichigo would've felt that haha)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I'm not going to do build-up for here though so I hope you already knew what happened, but yeah, Kana-chan here will be the origin of trouble. And I mean it. She voices Angela, an evil witch she is indeed. She might have done way too many bad things to the world I would argue because you know, she is also known as the Origin Witch, but two of the things she did are worth talking about. Firstly, how she is still alive after all these years. As Helga has mentioned after what happened which we will talk about in a moment, witches can only bear the maximum human live expectancy, and if you have never heard of that before because none of us have, it's about two centuries. Considering that she is still alive for so long while having quite the youthful look, good chances she has been living off *oof* human bodies in order to keep herself alive, and we shall talk about how much "legacy" she has left behind, but before that, let's talk about the trap she has set for Gideau. Spreading rumours about a witch she will be interested in following, and having an Instrument literally similar to the one the other Executioner has in their possession and he was killed by the witch herself? Oh boy, how things have become complicated in just this one scene. Things probably did not go along with Angela's plan, but it sure is going in the right direction. And seeing how this city has been going wild about whatever is happening, it's hard to notice this Origin Witch planning something until the Order noticed and informed Ashaf about it, just as he was leaving an injured Gideau alone. Not that fully healed her will make a difference, so let's talk about what other thing we need to know about Angela. Her curses. I assume, just like all other magic Anime out there, the curse lives with the one who cursed them, and seeing that Angela is very evil and has made many contracts out there, I would assume Gideau is very literally I would say, just one of her playthings (lol) but don't quote me if I say what are the chances most of her victims who are kept alive are all female. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Happy International Women's Month, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In her confrontation to meet her past lover? Yeah I will take that seriously no doubt, Angela had a little chit-chat with Gideau who is in her very own human body?? And then she was like, licking on the curse and sh*t? Wait, why is Angela trying to make out with herself? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Say this Anime doesn't have <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yuri target=_blank>yuri</a> references. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Narcissist maybe, but despite all this and Gideau struggling to put on a fight in an alternate dimension set up by the other Executioner we didn't manage to find... unless accidentally lmao, Angela here still managed to... I don't know, arrange herself to have some pep talk with one of her past girlfriends? Haha hell yeah, this is the nicest I can put it, and she leaves once again before she gets found out by Ashaf and the others. All in all though, this is quite a creepy episode in itself, and I don't even mean the Executioner at this point that guy is just flair already, but hey, shout out to when <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/174808/Flan target=_blank>Kana-chan was voicing a nicer witch</a> a couple more years ago in Anime "MajoTabi"? This one totally freaks me out already, my instinct to erase her from existence is stronger than Gideau's at this point. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, we have a final arc to go for this season alone, and boy has it been exciting, and I doubt they will chase after Angela here (literally) in the story, so we might be ending with a short story of sorts. Flashback, maybe? Heck, all of this are short stories when you realize who we are up against. *yikes* This series is interesting, I'll give you that. <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAqjcxRnT5Q4jdryshT8Xu9fx8GG2Yct6VCTFesxYpwzw4UdduMde-IdHhi7BOL3fDwAMdAhdqz0jWcmch95ADGWbBSfk0iSPHtdFN5YisBZgGOb3Bu4I6dNb0d_lw7m_ddvwP4vWsoiYj2ADdP2M_UuvIUXpcfp-rZR9za3po0kzQWWUtzYF_Y9RxjUk/s320/majoutoyajuu10_witch1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What we think witches look like haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1zvD1Py3i3bBfZM1pZzQN0d8kqCsmzJfON-FQPkU3aNq0LpP_TXsIe2pnXVvpXZV2CwrJw9D5McIMSOZN5CFX-ZU7BU9nJvrsk8roXExRJVAzvdg0OkewTHaYe7bbLpzqYiXaaS6rH8XdCP-tx2GpPiR-l83yi0a-veoS4-l9HSaz1KEhav4sYzNPSTs/s320/majoutoyajuu10_pets1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Why I don't want to deal with pets lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi98hVvQF9oAhKBJhvDeN94UlbRTmHagqwnuiECE3W9rwrwvryvy0mSw1whXS6c0SKTY3p_9YJJfWiFZdfOwRvPbmVAP42LoJ7TZsvbVn-0Aya9dxJvgpMxZ2L7qRva-tYti2tgqDCwzCIX6aMXPFVnLU-ZiSVWd2jL6YMSG_iXhiNXjELA40qr4aA4YrE/s1600/majoutoyajuu10_reveal.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Now THIS is magic hehe this is cool ngl</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I just don't know why she will do such a thing even if Gideau and her might already be long dead, which greatly depends on her relationship with then Gideau.

I am struggling to think of whether I should give the one <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%AE%9D%E7%89%A9%E3%82%92%E6%8E%A2%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6-single/1644676084?l=en-US" target=_blank>Hashimoto Eriko song from 2022</a></b> just because I'm bummed from the releases this week lol, but hey, ask me again, we got the rest of the month. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay NOW we can talk about the disappointments for the week haha, because not only did <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/luminous/1734148312?l=en-US" target=_blank>SCANDAL's new album</a></b> sound as uninteresting as their previous album which is a trend in Klassic Note again I am not surprised at this rate if they vanish from my watchlist, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96/1734742763?l=en-US" target=_blank>yanaginagi's new album</a></b> also isn't that great mostly due to the melodies I would argue, it's still obvious which songs were 100% produced by her and I still like those and are likely the ones I gave too. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Happy International Women's Month. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I did try to give a couple of songs from both albums though, so I'll take at as conclusion if you guys don't mind, I can only be that nice.</div><div><br></div><div>Okay it's all Anime news this weekend so let's see if I can gather the pieces of music news from earlier this week to talk about. <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1769740553862680860?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song</a></b> won't make me like vegetable drinks anytime soon, and so is <b><a href="https://x.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1769922001089782233?s=20" target=_blank>SHE'S new song</a></b> but somehow the latter is better than the former stop asking me why already. I had no idea up till now that <b><a href="https://x.com/bungosd_anime/status/1770012536366309636?s=20" target=_blank>SCREEN mode sang an insert song for Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" season three</a></b> so like, in 2019. Heck, not like I missed anything anyways so welp. <b><a href="https://x.com/rythem_official/status/1770026686417121399?s=20" target=_blank>RYTHEM's new song</a></b> sure is refreshing and I think we have heard of it before during recording I think, so yeah, looking forward to giving this when <strike>their new album comes out hopefully this year</strike> <a href="https://x.com/rythem_official/status/1771864700172509574?s=20" target=_blank><b>RYTHEM's new album comes out end of June this year</b></a>! *yay* <a href="https://x.com/Scenarioart/status/1770102943003680807?s=20" target=_blank><b>Scenarioart's new song</b></a> did not hit me as well as the last time we heard of their new tunes, but that's alright, I believe they will have more to deliver when the album comes by. As promoted on her fortnightly vodcast series with Tomita Miyu, I will take a listen to <b><a href="https://x.com/YAYA_RECORDS/status/1769650366898221212?s=20" target=_blank>Yamane Aya's debut EP releasing next month</a></b> just because I think her cover songs are great so far and this might be a good reason to give her a chance of sorts, we shall see if it's worth it. <b><a href="https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1769504228098314654?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi's new song was for one of Toriyama Akira (RIP) reserved works</a></b> and not like the song got me so I shall leave this at that. Looks like we are on the bandwagon of new songs though, because <b><a href="https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1770376634375475557?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo announced a new single releasing in May</a></b> and boldly chose not to do any credits this time around. I mean, the astrological sign song title might give you a hint on what's up. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Don't think <b><a href="https://x.com/yanaginagi_info/status/1770374853516005494?s=20" target=_blank>yanaginagi's new lyric video</a></b> will get me at any point, I did not miss this style of music of hers anyways, refer to previous paragraph on what I chose instead. <b><a href="https://x.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1770737361431019791?s=20" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new song preview</a></b> is going to get me on the pops but not on the melody, but we don't have far to wait for her album coming out next month so we shall see then. <b><a href="https://x.com/miyustaff/status/1771099749246005275?s=20" target=_blank>Tomita Miyu's new song preview</a></b> for her new single's B-side is quite adorable and might get me more then her single or even heck, <b><a href="https://x.com/senna_rin/status/1771394074643419152?s=20" target=_blank>SennaRin's new song in collaboration with Anime "BLEACH"</a></b> which was revealed in the AnimeJapan event this weekend... I might just give the latter first don't mind me. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/neatsyui/status/1771510682535735585?s=20" target=_blank>Niitsu Yui's bedtime piano performance</a></b> of a song from her Neat's 3rd album in 2014 is something to behold especially considering she doesn't need to see her fingers to play the accompanying chords... I just can't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And thank goodness <b><a href="https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1771756325858590914?s=20" target=_blank>SID is singing the ending theme song for the new arc for Anime "Kuroshitsuji"</a></b> and I'm just glad they are in because damn, I rather let someone else sing the opening theme song so I can enjoy the former more and not cringe on <b><a href="https://x.com/_______0108/status/1771765724127572034?s=20" target=_blank>Otoha's new music video teaser</a></b> which sounds like the school arc is going to have a bloodbath. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> </div><div><br></div><div>So for next week haha we're back at this junction once again, we have a lot to talk about for new songs from <b>Porno Graffitti's new single</b> to <b>Amamiya Sora's new album</b> and <b>SIX LOUNGE's new mixed media EP</b> if we can see it on music streaming services fingers crossed, so this should be more than enough for me to ponder about life and whether to prefer mainstream of idolism. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Don't worry, it may be International Women's Month but that's last week. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Today was the end of the AnimeJapan weekend, so no doubt there are more announcements and/or reveals for upcoming Anime and stuff, I will like some of the posts on Twitter/X and update my own Anime list from MyAnimeList, but I will ignore them for now since we are likely going to talk about the new season of Anime next week! Yes, I know the stuff is already out and I have a good idea what I'm watching already, but my partner Random Curiosity has things planned so I will await their sub professional opinions before I confirm my own watchlist next season. What else... oh yeah, most notably and I guess they can't make the Anime's official Twitter/X account retract the post, is <a href="https://x.com/konosubaanime/status/1771798142440050904?s=20" target=_blank>how sexy Amamiya Sora looked in that group photo</a> it got my bro's boner up lol, it's now our private chat wallpaper. Yeah, how did Ten-chan kick away Sumipe's fanclub birthday photo from that throne is another mystery in itself. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright serious talk though, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C447qSCSJaQ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target=_blank>Yuuki Aoi's Instagram post</a> is probably the winner despite <a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie/status/1771832640842207683?t=U1SDx2ZWFzvCzEAExrh9lQ&amp;s=19" target=_blank>Rieri posting all of her outfits for the weeken</a>d because you know, we see less of the former anyways also <a href="https://twitter.com/aoni_official/status/1771834106260660498?t=xAHnEiL5gD6-Bjv5ChPtLQ&amp;s=19" target=_blank>Aoi-chan's talent agency</a> be <a href="https://twitter.com/aoni_official/status/1771834068465828155?t=CBgSHaMo4QAkPAUurPY35g&amp;s=19" target=_blank>posting them</a> too. I also did watch the Anime "Shinigami Bocchan" livestream event but on archive because timing issues (lol) but heck, putting Hikasa Youko there was a right choice. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Just being there is enough for her to falter in front of not real life Walter voice by Uchida Yuuma (both married, by the way), she knocked all the drinks on the floor. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh Yocchan, never change. Oh yeah, also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C45ORpeP-Q6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target=_blank>Oonishi Saori walking around after her her one event appearance and ambushing others</a> so she can take photos and catch up with all of them lol. So as you can see, I had a great weekend HAHAHAHA <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> </div><div><br></div><div>Well, at least next week is going to be short. Not short-er, this week was technically shorter than what next week is going to be HAHAHAHA until next time then.</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Wow this <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/fantasies-ep/1719381137?l=en-US" target=_blank>Bombay Bicycle Club's new single</a> recommended by Apple Music is actually kinda dope haha we will talk about them next week I guess.</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
