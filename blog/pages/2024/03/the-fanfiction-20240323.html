<div class="page-header"></div>
<div>Didn't realize once again that waiting for a week to write this is such pain, I just took an earlier break to wait longer. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, it was for something that has been bugging me for a while, so why not take a break and fix more of this blog while I'm at it, yes? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Hehe alright don't try to be cute that indie game "Haven Park" you just finished(?) playing is cuter than you</div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of cute, we have a real cutie up for the story today! I still am thinking of how to justify myself being able to own an abode in such an upscale neighbourhood though. Even if I own this, I still gotta pay for the maintenance, right? That has got to cost a lot. Yeah, fictional me is working just to pay for this. To whoever that doesn't want me to ditch this inheritance, I hate you- Oh, fictional me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Oh, and keep this from the girlfriend, would ya? I haven't told her I am cohabiting with... well technically with this it's 4 women now she doesn't know the stepsister lore just yet. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Haha oh boy we are cooking this alright.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Kanno Mai in pink pajamas, with a white toothbrush in her mouth, showing a pouting face" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=361 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl659434.jpg title="Kanno Mai" width=141></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>Due to legal reasons which I shall not explain in detail, there is a minimum occupancy period to a mansion I inherited. I had intended to stay here, if not for living with my new step family. As such, I rented out a room to Kanno Mai, who covered for me as an occupant of the premises in exchange for free use of all its facilities.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I woke up to a sunny morning. I went to the toilet and realized the room ran out of toiletries. Remembering that the stock is placed in the main bathroom, I rubbed my eyes and made my way downstairs. The main bathroom door is slightly open and unlocked. I opened it and to my surprise, I saw Kanno-san in pink pyjamas, preparing to brush her teeth by the sink. She instinctively raised her voice at me.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=なんでノックしなかったの？>"Why didn't you not knock before you enter?"</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I told her the door was unlocked, she was fully clothed, and I heard noises from the sink before entering. She pouted at me even more with a toothbrush in her mouth.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>I will never understand women these days.</em></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Yes, I just want her to get mad at me in the cutest way possible HAHA ah hey.</div><div><br></div><div>Trust me, I was thinking of how to make sense out of this until I realized <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4x7QakvImc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target=_blank>the bed scene in her photobook</a> (which I haven't seen the book yet, in two weeks from now perhaps) will look more accurate of a morning scenario with the let down hair and looser... outfit hehe this one just feels like she is preparing for the night, and the light outside is rendering my concept useless. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> It's fine, we have to keep the curtains up, the girlfriend can't see this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Am I <em>really</em> going to use this as an excuse as and when I have an argument with Koga-chan? Haha this relationship getting rocky already, huh. Well, fictional me has not yet done this, and technically she only heard of my encounter with Ajuju last summer(?) from someone else so she does not know of this place. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <em>So much lore</em>, dude. Someone pay me to write a book about this lol <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span></div><div><br></div><div>My current plan is to end this season by mid April with... a special mini-series featuring a certain someone I will not spoil here, and I will do a post of this DAILY for the week of beginning of May for Japan's Golden Week. Yes, no more waiting, baby! Well, I have to wait a month plus from now and I have to plan for all of them so that sucks but I promise all of us, the best has yet to come. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Okay, maybe I talk about the legal stuff here in detail instead since I can't put it in the main story. What you need to know is that this mansion was left as inheritance for me (likely from a deceased elder ancestor who did not want to pass this on to my divorced parents lol), and I did move in after my parents divorced, see when I sheltered Kana-chan from the rain. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But that was when new rules were imposed right after I started living with the Natsukawa household, and to prevent this place from being under legal threat, someone had to live in it permanently. Yeah I know, instead of just selling it? This must be some hot residential area (or memento, yeah) I can never afford to buy for myself haha</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. Oh, and this mansion is not unlike the one I did a floor plan in my dreams from 2 weeks ago, that one's a resort I frequently visit for my staycations and the staff there knew of my favourite room. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
