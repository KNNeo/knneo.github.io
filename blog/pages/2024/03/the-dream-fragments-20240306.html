<div>Happy birthday Ede-chan by the way. Hope you don't mind me dreaming of not you despite the close distance phone wallpapers I've been putting of you for the week so far. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> And let's not talk about Sasaki Nao even though she would be an even better as my bride which is not what is in this context hehe</div><div><br></div><div>More dreams I can recall, this one's a lot more scattered though, but damn am I ever getting closer. To women. Haha- DAD WENT ARE YOU HERE THOUGH lol</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>"I was at a wedding of Kido Ibuki asking with my dad. All I could recall was my dad was selecting photos of the bride as they were giving it out for free. My dad then said to pay for them as if he were a simp or something, which made me want to say it too but I just did not have the courage to do it.</div><div><br></div><div>Another (disconnected) part of this is when my dad was looking at a (paper printed) list of top video games. My sis was clearly interested in the best games to play so understandable, but my dad was interested in it too, considering the list was mostly role-playing games, which I found it awkward. I told him my sis will get it for him a copy if she wants to buy them afterwards."</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Wow I hate you, dad in my dreams. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Then again, what do I know about dreams- Is this a bad thing? My dad is still alive though, the morning radio is playing in the house as I'm typing this. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Let's not think too much but ponder on how beautiful <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUzAt7-B47f/?igsh=YXJmNmlibjczejBm" target=_blank>Ibuki-chan  looks like in a wedding dress</a>, yes?</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheDreams">The Dreams</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
