Yeah I'm living the life in my dream resort hotel I have no idea what I was doing there besides playing with women, what of it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Well not really, you can read the posts earlier this week for more info, but I did spend a couple more days (let's not say just weekends lmao) creating a draft floor plan of what it looked like, probably half topped up with my own imagination because we know dream retention is worse than my own memory which only makes this less convincing so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> haha</div><div><br></div><div>If that counts as playing a game lmao, then let's add music and animation into that list to show that I have a fulfilled entertainment life for the week! Hell yeah when's the last time I gave a shit about life fulfilment lol</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanaTen09><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"A lady with a nice figure wouldn't cut it (as an explanation), wouldn't it?" Yeah Akutsu, Lilia is hot isn't she lol</div></blockquote><div>I mean come on Lily-chan, at least make the avatar look <em>somewhat</em> like you. This one is just what you want to be. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where Lily-chan is taking a break from casting lmao (#KanaTen09), oh I guess we are not visiting her now? Damn, don't call this a high school Anime, just don't. We are however, in a crazy plot twist, going to call this episode an action series though haha, just because, wait for it, I think our antagonist for the season has arrived. Lilia, as we will find out soon, is not here for good intentions? Funny how her underling didn't do much about her last orders, but heck, this way of replacing Lily-chan is easier. Even getting the teacher to let her stay is easy considering his past experience being spooked by something of the same face... and body haha no one is going to talk about her bangin' body besides Akutsu? Oh well, add me in. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So turns out, I assume the sister thing is also embedded in Lily and this avatar too, but yeah we can call them Lilia here, since she bears much resemblance to the sister we will be talking about in due time. Meanwhile though, looks like she is here... for revenge? Well, not really, even tough Akutsu almost got pierced with a mechanical pencil lead (go ask ChatGPT if you are too young and don't know what that means) and spiked by a volleyball... still would not understand why Lilia here is so mad at him as if it's entirely his fault because of the previous episode. So Happy International Women's Month haha, Akutsu doesn't understand women, what else is new. Specifically Lily-chan, if ever Lilia here has to spell it out for him. She didn't, but what she did do is join the other classmates in the home visit we all should expect <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, which will be awkward considering she is just an avatar of her master who probably didn't allow her to escape so, uh... this will be weird. We have also confirmation from Lily-chan here that Lilia here is just a product of an avatar, though strongly connected in many ways than other, which also means she probably felt the times where Lily-chan wants to have the hanky-panky with her demon slave- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not a porno, by the way. I mean, it is though? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> From the sweet nothings (literally nothing lol) between the couple to whatever Lily-chan is trying to reject this guy just because Akutsu now has just figured out that he might have upset the girl who was eavesdropping on the date with Yuuka-chan, probably still doesn't have a way to appease her... besides staying by her side in case she gets another nightmare which was all because of this guy? Don't think that's how the cycle works but sure. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... you wished this world we lived in had a ceasefire. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But too bad that is not happening soon, and speaking of the... I can't say "devil" that is kind of a reserved word here, so speaking of the angels that isn't Lily-chan, looks like the real sister's underling has finally arrived, which likely will bring us to the ending of the season. I wonder if this is like an audit check on her work, or the real sister has some other evil plans. We shall see I guess. But considering this avatar looks so much like her sister, I doubt this upcoming conflict will be something dramatic. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Prove to me I'm right, Anime.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUJsO8P5nioQ0escF5Hrfrgk5pyOGU9TfAG0hP_qB5w6sal8MbCkeAgGJkLs_0jS45f3FUITrrnieg0x_2On0lzNVozbRxFyGjoJnuxES9xChOH8_rHnLiW8ps0gMPJCeKFGYGNv9SxAWnLthoQs3o1jJW-y5MPmSpkIeFgnzOs2CQi5Xi4IU7x3vq4fA/s320/kanaten09_lily8.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Shame AND tears??<br>I like hehe <span class=emoji title=😚>*chef's kiss*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEharlVigZo79xNPqPkisdRSaNcJPSacpXkWw7JOPxIZCGRGdOkHTwD6Lw3ho-4XBNfixHOurlE-B0yOpG-w7wEjUJ2Hgc3lJVebz7RaUEBfmCS3fB1NVDPdEjgfEvaEewv6dvA6D9bI4RKEMZMvcOPW3AwVrs4ZBekeFk5nJel8JlJ5B2L-FH7GUvV6Xao/s320/kanaten09_lily9.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is so cute I can't even<br>(Hehe)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Mind if you also tell me her cup size-</div></blockquote><div>Fs in chat for Helga turning to the dark side. For now, I would assume, we can't let such a cute girl be evil. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know right, what is this, some <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>isekai</a> Anime?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This isn't, so we better keep the action in check in this new episode (#MajoToYajuu08), where well... if you asked for the worst case scenario, you got it. Or that is you are part of the Executioner's army right now consisting of the Paladin Corps and Helga even haha you got that right, then I hope it's going according to their plan. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, for starters, what on Earth happened to I don't know, everything. Ashaf is still quite a chad in attempting to heal Matt and Helga shortly after they have fallen, for different reasons of course. Matt got his betrayal right up and coming with Lowell who backstabbed him so much I hardly think she is cool no more (oh damn, I should say "he" instead haha get it?), and Helga... she was the catalyst for this whole problem that is about to happen. Yep, if an Anime series were to hint to never do something, that means they will be doing it. Always worst case scenario, bro, I speak from experience. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Then, we learnt of a short flashback as to what happened to Helga's... well whole family in this case. But I assumed the mother was the biggest victim here, probably tortured or even mind controlled by the Instrument the Executioner was holding, to reveal all of the Demon Sword's secrets, including how it works, why it should <em>never</em> be unleashed, and what it takes to do just that. For the last part though, and it's probably for the better that the mom herself killed everyone in the family including herself (not even under mind control) so to not let this eventuality happen, is that unleashing it required a witch's heart. I like to think it has to be specifically from the family since they were the ones who sealed it, so <em>maaaaybe</em> letting Helga leave the burning abode alone was a mistake after all. She was the convenient final draw. And now that the Executioner has everything he needs to make it happen, we shall talk about the final piece of the puzzle, how Ashgan works. It doesn't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay not that it doesn't, but looks like Ashaf's hypothesis of them having a mind of its own will be vital to the conclusion of this arc apart from its monstrous powers, seeing as it just ruthlessly removed the controlled Paladin Corps without much hesitation. Bro, the Sword doesn't listen to no one. That's the problem. All of us will be in ashes. And you want to unleash it? BRUH. Why do you think people sealed it in the first place? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Looks like this thing might be harder to control compared to Helga who backstabbed us a while ago lol how could you, no wonder you don't deserve a kiss from a real man haha GOTTEM <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But seriously though, don't think more sacrifices of the Instrument (if you would recall, from the adopted kids arc) (lol) will make the item more effective in mind control considering we are dealing with a Demon Sword with a (very hollow) mind of its own, but hey, the Executioner's death will come soon enough I would think. Meanwhile, we may need to do a little something something to ensure that we don't die here, and I think that coffin has been left intact for a good enough time now, so... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> DAMN, this is exciting as heck!! Hey, tell me when is the next time I'm getting hyped about an action Anime series, because for now THIS IS THE SHIT!! <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Wow, now I want to see the fight go down between the Sword and the Beast next week, haha almost wrote "demon" for the latter. This is already so hype I can't even- I mean, this showdown is a win, right? The Beast is what everything in the magic world fears, so maybe the Sword will just give up and we win? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not without a fight I assume!!

Sure, dude. I'm just here for the 100% not suspiciously crafted lyrics of a song. Also new single incoming. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And if you can't go to lives because you're not in Japan like me, you can watch <b><a href="https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1765553475310830022?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's dance rehearsal video</a></b> lol this is 11 minutes of goodness isn't it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> About 3 months after their album release, <b><a href="https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1766073418775155139?s=20" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku released a new music video</a></b> for a song I have given in their latest album released last December and damn, this is something. Oh this is better <b><a href="https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1766102518482993184?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi's new live video</a></b> is in celebration of their YouTube channel reaching 100k subscribers, so congrats guys, I'm still not subbed yet by the way. HYPE!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh wtf is this though? <b><a href="https://x.com/Finlands12/status/1766796141298106478?s=20" target=_blank>FINLANDS doing a major debut</a></b>?? Aren't they only just one member- Never mind that, I'll take their shadow drop of a <a href="https://x.com/Finlands12/status/1766796665435173271?s=20" target=_blank>debut digital single releasing next week</a> I guess. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>And for next week, I will wholly focus on <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new EP</b> because damn it has been years since a proper release, so I'll be darned if there's anything good after what I've heard from the trailer. Or else maybe I'll pick up <b>FINLANDS' major debut single</b>- I can't believe I'm even saying this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Among all the news that is the yearly Seiyuu Awards with <a href="https://x.com/uesaka_official/status/1766445054468800534?s=20" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Hina_Youmiya/status/1766447125494419721?t=qgKoAMieMmafiOmH_QrWGA&amp;s=35" target=_blank>Yomiya Hina</a> coming up tops of people I know who won something (this isn't exactly an interesting year compared to last year), I'm just glad that our next photobook review is on the way because did I ask for <a href="https://x.com/moeshiphotobook/status/1766702456426361078?s=20" target=_blank>Moeshi to release a photobook</a> and she basically gave us one! Announced at her (29, by the way) birthday event today if I'm not wrong, but damn did I jinx that into it happening. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, I'll will be buying one and so will everyone else, considering what we have seen her half-naked these past couple of years. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> No really, once in a while I take a look at the digital photobook she released recently. Yes, more often than Karin-chan's. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you next week then, and until then... *ack* don't get a cough running, it takes forever to recover. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S.
