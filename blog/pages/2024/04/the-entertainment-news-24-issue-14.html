Yeah let's not talk about how I'm coughing again I rather be coughing up reviews of new shows I am interested in to see if I want to watch any of them other than the sequels which will already fuel the next three months of my weekends. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We shall see, me, we shall see. Hey, at least we have some time to give these, huh? I will try this time around- It's the new year, we gotta try somehow. </div><div><br></div><div>Anime will compensate for the lack of music this week and likely prep us for the months ahead because theme songs haha, in this new season start of stuff I talk about every week! I need a better slogan or even a better post title, really. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=MajoToYajuu12><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Majo to Yajuu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Love. I want to teach you what love is." Helga-san is so hyped right now haha</div></blockquote><div>Yeah, I also realized they skipped the part where they had to stab Ashaf, it just appeared on him- Magic, dude. What else is there to say? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> In this final episode of a series I didn't expect to get so into and I'm still loving it (#MajoToYajuu12), but now that it has ended gloriously... I think I'm good. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Let's talk about the flashback first, it's the flashback after all, more vital to the explanation of the lore we have here so far. So story goes that (and boy is the story short because they are replaying scenes lol ah hey) we found out that Craig and his dad are both Executioners (but really, this young to be such evil?) and if you need to guess again, they are going to Falvell's powers, no surprises there. Unfortunately they also knew from Orwell (RIP but not really) that she can't use her speaking-magic powers to any extent, mainly because there is a curse put on her to prevent her from even speaking, thus making her powerless as the villagers try to arrest her. The Executioners seem disinterested in dealing with a witch with a curse, so they had to kill her. I know right, what is being neighbours for half a year and drinking their tea. Should've spiked it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And since we know that Gideau will help us out in dealing with these two because did you even see how they sent Craig's father into the burning building? Haha, clearly Ashaf had to tell her how to undo her curse albeit temporarily, and this is also not a surprise, it is to kiss a witch. Falvell in this case. I know right, where do I sign up haha ah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, this kiss ended up having more effects than I would have noticed immediately, because apart from beast Gideau sending Craig's dad flying and Craig himself basically ruined just enough to say his dying words, don't forget Gideau also had a witch's body which means that (1) any damage done from the Executioners will hardly kill her off the bat and that wouldn't be true if not for us knowing that is essentially Angela's body, and (2) kissing Falvell also undid her curse, which also means she can speak for once in her life now. The latter is rather important since this makes her so absolute in power, not only did she stop the villagers from apprehending her, she just uh, wiped Craig's dad out of existence. Like, not even "kill yourself" or anything, just vanish. The only thing she didn't do right is to wipe all our memories of that dude so we won't even know he existed. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, all is well, and that's how Ashaf introduced Gideau to the Order, in order <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> to find out who did her curse. Well, we knew who it is, she has appeared to visit her several times out of her own will, but the ending teased a new arc of the story where the duo had to go hunt her down. Well, sort of. And this is where I can stop I guess the word "isekai" triggered me in more ways than over, I'm glad there isn't a sequel to the Anime. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all though, great series just this alone hehe, but heck, I did the magic has overstayed its welcome. I'm very in on the lore though, still keen on the terminologies and the stuff that has been set up to fight against each other, from the Order to the Church and Paladin Corps, to the Demon Sword and Beat Gideau... there's always something around the corner to play around and change tides whenever the author decides to, and that's actually a good thing. Better than coming up with an ultimate move and then losing to another unheard ultimate move- Yes that's every other action series, thanks for asking. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, for what is based on magic which means anything is possible, this is still a great series to watch. Storytelling definitely is its strongest factor, the audio mixes might be meh at times, but everything else, more amazing than all the kiss scenes. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Will they make another one of these so we can see the downfall of Angela fingers crossed? We can but hope. Yeah hope for the death of all Executioners or something lol</div><div>[GIF FEVER TO END THE SEASON!!

I've never tasted a cocktail for myself, not even alcohol.  <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Does medicated wine count? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this remake of a good old series that has gained my interest in fancy alcoholic drinks even though I've never drank any (#Bartender01), oh yeah we are going to start off how they also started: Dunking on new bartenders until we realized we can't hire the guy in Eden Hall. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay, and I think I know how to review this now just like how they reviewed all the bartenders for the hotel, so let me give you a super beginner's course to this series which they somehow gave the script to a kid and THEN let AI change whatever they want. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, story. This is simple, it's an intro to what Eden Hall is. Problem is, it's not the same. Differences include (and I don't have to refer back to remember) that the bartender auditions are a lot simpler than we know of, first off. We don't have that ikemen pretending of a jerk or even Higuchi as a character in the story, trying to bring in more life than the whole season of the original, actually. And I think this already breaks the illusion of what this series was supposed to be about: The mellowness of the story of alcohol. It sure is funny though, because mind you, I have read the original story before, and this much flare if I recalled, was suppressed in order to bring in the main delicacy of what this series was famed to be: its tale of cocktails. Cock-tales, if you would say- Okay maybe not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, this whole episode is basically just reminding you a lot of what the characters are in general, from happy-go-lucky Higuchi who only knows of social media as her friend and wouldn't even care about <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhI_B84K6soBJ_LbvuoZA6OAxb5TRZ7HytWrW_04f7yayr9jGjYS5ssbvj0U4B-QlDMuZevafCKI58-_vnAyR5shkqVQzNp5G93ZOHpkuRqHbtPXR45hJDm94UQJ-MmQwUqcmUN42DqjDPHHgUsBu-mDGPp6pCNMCwVlxbzWoBmwJOIFxIF7Y6MaY7F_oY/s320/bartender01_sasahara.jpg target=_blank>Sasahara Ryuu our main guy here</a> would be such a cool bartender, to <strike>miwa-san here</strike> Miwa-san here for being some manager trying to do her best for work and seeing her being left behind while the rest of the hotel rakes in the business while this bar is still stuck for a suitable candidate, to even the chairman who has been the most lively I've seen him in years which you would recall, dunked on all the candidates because he knew, HE KNEW, he hated bartenders and who is the one and only stuck in a bar by the street with the heaviest door you can imagine, and even that had a meaning. In this though, I guess they have to put in modern context which might be the issue considering this series was based on a manga from the early 2000s where Steve Jobs did not exist lol <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, so they put Eden Hall in the basement of some cheap building lmao, did not show us <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLmYacFd_-mMLfxZWql6cxgf1h6xCzsclM-tUlAULmX5V-GDgxCqh9OKD3k95qPIaYrr5PI5S71sYkS63QXedP3CGmKYr-6VAt1LGEhbwnEttMFkBqtjPuIj6qgC70dqkduCmbA_AoytLfAdI-Id_LlSdSug9A70awGf94sjpPuBxtEBLhkJgR68E1ZTA/s320/bartender01_glass.jpg target=_blank>that famous ice sculpture</a> which will no doubt have its use lol <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> not this one though because we now know he uses a fridge to store solid ice, and served Miwa-san instead of the chairman, the cocktail that will make me wake up after a hard day's work. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> All in all... I wonder why they decided to remake this if they can't deliver the same "wow" factor they did all those years ago. I think they are definitely trying to deliver the same emotional stories as much as they can I still teared up when Sasahara mentioned the meaning behind "bartender", while trying to keep it up with the times and enhancing the storytelling to give it more depth and clarity. Though in retrospect, that also means some stories will be cut off as I have seen so far not all of the characters we know and love are in the opening theme animation, they are likely going to lengthen or even change the story just because, and put in a lot of unnecessary stuff and keep hinting the lore more heavily just to get the kids interested to watch and understand this. In relation to Eden Hall, attracting such customers is not necessary, because for people who clearly understand what they are getting walking into this series, they will sure be pleased at what they will get. And that's just not how Capitalism works. I miss the ending cocktail showcases already. We will find out soon in future episodes on how that will make sense, but damn am I hesitating to even watch this if it might ruin my own impression of the original with just a <em>little</em> less alcohol. Prove me wrong, Anime. Prove me wrong.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGurOS7MH-lXUN5_I5JNy5cVqpaT6A5c4nc8MOvPECBtXqUaDL0mq40DSQVLoXDL5_swa0zNFXfVKf6BN1JuL2kojW-00yfDGvcbqhaxJC0RImdZtws_6UUy4cZzPUIW1B6_OmipnkH51vWAoUI6z9fAq85zLEVyl7_KIufyLnoYKvxXZZ6PKAXVfQhU0/s320/kaminoglass01_ikemen2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What we think this Anime is about<br>(LAME)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiV6AYbfOGUWFDGu1CWRDY5JqiM42QyY33Ev8Is28p0AwxxIEf7RkRGaj4CCk74kRWnGm5cz3t7t5gZNyEPBnZpZ-W1_7d8fUqqV4N0vyCv1pt7GDwE9eiTzeEj6e2sLcfS7Fba2umILGb0jRXHhB2gribBOGpxK6ShXkjhR9Wo81ohBiuD2wB0xWg2vsk/s320/kaminoglass01_sasahara4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What this Anime actually is<br>(So cool)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I know, they even served <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkrrsks5gdUgX8VRB8eCswLFLjA8uytWg-NA2DYyxKt8V4KnVx9xAHdPjQgyNOIwwSlCCGDr09gFDEPwy5TyEMskescAqZXLBoqE5S1CfDEvLFmarQKVfNQloGhLzWqxc9qhmNslpfTbCuKRPQCFY-ViAQte7NlcDtB0k92wM8ffHt_AoVPWWj-M0bo6M/s320/kaminoglass01_highball2.jpg target=_blank>diluted Highball</a> instead of a <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLM-XEqpxIiSRaWuX3PlUzFg0538UYs5s1FjcJkTDl-fQGqfmXLryAXotYkdm04b_Ge_xpcqSEEsrXfeH0bnDeZJ0JPG_dKBwy_rAhhAgm9wbpJmk0_VMHa8YoG36YL6q1FaA8hRIirDrA8XTvpvN__xM58dA0gR4tCRoqdj7MQ4LnMT28qFi2ePDtN54/s320/bartender01_watermix.jpg target=_blank>Water Mix</a>, dude!

SAME oh dear Hotaru-chan I wish all girls were like you haha ah</div></blockquote><div>Okay so we got an ikemen here and a girl who doesn't care about men. What else is new? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new series where I wonder if I should even be giving this because I just don't want to give the opening theme song lol (#HananoiKun01), okay put the ending theme song in also because is that a translated song from its original?? This is OBVIOUSLY targeted at normies. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, let's talk about what this is about before I reject the shit out of this just like how main girl initially did with our main guy Hananoi-kun here. So, intro is basically the guy being somewhat saved by Hotaru as she covers him with an umbrella from the snow after his breakup with his ex lol, then thought this little girl with the short hair here was his new lover LOL this is too real I can't even, immediately threw himself to her by confessing to her in front of her class, probably upsetting a lot of girls who think he's not as cool as he seems in the process just like how many other ikemen would let you think, yes even in Anime. Also yeah, this girl Hotaru's world is going to be turned upside down haha yeah all the other girls are going to be like that magic-speaking witch Falvell and demand her that she disappear. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Haha okay not that bad, but I'm sure there will be threats. Ironically that isn't the focus of the series in case you did not notice, as Hotaru explains her reasons for not seeking a dedicated relationship with a soulmate, mainly because and this is too real, that she thinks she don't get this love thing and feeling as much as others do (SAME), and she has no business falling in love because she don't get it. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> SAME haha no really, I wish someone will tell me what's up. In her case though, she has Hananoi-kun who somehow knows more than her considering he has at least had one girlfriend before her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, and don't let me talk about how he would do anything for her just to earn a smile on her face, from getting the buns that she likes that she doesn't have (BOOM GOTTEM haha), to even trying to pick up the hairpin the classmate dropped and didn't care as much as he did as he tries to find it in the snow after school without telling the girl hopefully to give her a surprise and trying not to kill himself... Oh, you f**king f**king pants on fire. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Maybe that is too much, bro. Maybe that. Or maybe he's just like Haru from Anime "Kaibutsu-kun" where he actually looks great but knows close to nothing about love. I gotta say, that's quite the deja vu I have seen so far, and I think I understand now, if the lore is about Hotaru also teaching him what it means to have the friends and family you should care about. You know, relationship is a two-way thing anyways. Not that you have to cut your hair short and take away your hairpins and lose your identity for, but still. All in all... I think the narration at the end of the episode is adequate summary for this series, where even if the couple's definition of love are different, at least they are stepping into different ground. And that's generally what love is... if you ever encounter one. *looks at self* It has been a while, about 15 years to be exact, maybe 16 years as old as Hotaru-chan now. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Also, in general, I feel like (and sorry for comparing to "Kaibutsu-kun" I would argue that's the closest thing I've watched and it's a decade ago lol) the pace of this series will be slow, but more importantly, that the guy won't be as aggressive as to suggest the "lovesickness" part of the title I would have more expected to see, for we can obviously notice that the guy has his own problems too. In case you wonder where this is going too, and unless the ending is really the guy going crazy for Hotaru-chan and not in the manner of digging in the snow to find her one hairpin... then maybe this will change my mind. But no, I don't think so, so I will put this aside. I'm honestly more keen on that one airing next week, yeah, "Sasayaku You ni Koi wo Utau" even if it's not a normal romance plot. Oh well, Kana-chan, you tried. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; I'm sorry, Anime. But the fact that Hanazawa Kana is married and in her 30s?

You're welcome. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, looks like I did not get much from the trailer apart from this is just adorable and when I mean that I meant the angel lol, so let's talk about how this all came about. Ironically, as stated above, this story started with some angel dispatched to understand humans, as human as she might look, she landed on (lol are you a crow or pigeon or what) main guy Shintarou's balcony for a perch or a nap or whatever angels do on balconies at night lmao, and a reminder that the guy was tired from work to notice, ended up waking up to a balcony that doesn't look like what his is normally even on his days off. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Don't ask me how the milk from his cup magically ended up on the worst of places on the angel may I remind you this is not a porno lmao, but yeah, consider this an accident so we can get her in to the abode to take a shower and a change of clothes or something. Around this point though, if you haven't been worried about her identity just like how Shintarou does as practical and wary as he has been taught to realize, understand that this might be some girl who accidentally got picked up on the streets and have been homeless and trying to find somewhere to stay in exchange for one night stands- Oh, wrong Anime. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Yup, that's an <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40938/Hige_wo_Soru_Soshite_Joshikousei_wo_Hirou target=_blank>Anime "HigeHiro"</a> reference without the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hige target=_blank>beard</a> so "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/hirou target=_blank>Hiro</a>" lmao) And I would still be wrong in saying that because unless Shintarou intends to let this beautiful ball of white get picked up by some old dude who invited her to a hotel to do- I'm calling the cops on him haha but maybe not because it'll be hard to verify the angel's identity, so yeah, he decides to take her in. It's like they sure are forcing you into taking in this free angel at your single room apartment, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not too surprising at this point, but with a very judging eye of Shintarou somewhat enjoying this fever dream of a honeymoon with an angel who intends to deliver happiness in many ways than other apart from spreading her angel wings... maybe we need something more monetary reward at this point. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, I wonder if I would enjoy an angel dropping my my room. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> That of course should be the least of your problems, because I SWEAR that people who have watched <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/50739/Otonari_no_Tenshi-sama_ni_Itsunomanika_Dame_Ningen_ni_Sareteita_Ken target=_blank>Anime "Tenshi-sama"</a> will have SERIOUS deja vu seeing a girl taking care of a dude in this episode, whether they liked it or not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or even if the circumstances were different, but damn does this new girl <strike>Endou</strike> <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/48506/Hikaru_Toono target=_blank>Touno Hikaru</a> she sounds too much like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/44317/Manaka_Iwami target=_blank>Iwami Manaka</a> when she voiced <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20240328/17/natsukawashiinablog/7b/17/j/o0450060015418504524.jpg target=_blank>Shiina</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Other than that, we have quite a light-hearted series if you let (not Tokiyama) Towa-sama here carry your belongings using her angel wings and would you please just overlook the opening theme animation haha what are those even, you would be relieved that this series might be more stereotypical that you think, see <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/38759/Sewayaki_Kitsune_no_Senko-san target=_blank>Anime "Senko-san"</a> for reference where that guy has more money than this dude who might have to work more part-time just to keep them going. I know right, get her to work if she wants to bring happiness to humans. Yeah, like be an idol or something. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We shall see where this takes us hopefully not what I mentioned, and yes I will be watching this. Can't let this Anime go away and into some disgusting Anime fanboy who will insult this to Kingdom Come, are we? Haha it's same same but different, and I'll take it. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div>[And just a reminder on airing times, I shall follow Japan national TV simulcast which airs the first episode this week, one week later than digital services would provide, just so you know.
