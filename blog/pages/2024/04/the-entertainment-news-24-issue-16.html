We shall see, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/54233/Sasayaku_You_ni_Koi_wo_Utau target=_blank>Anime "SasaKoi"</a> hasn't really gotten me yet even though it has gotten Himari-chan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>As such, I will be doing this season of shows throughout the weekend (sadly), and this still depends on whether I can get enough break from my new assignment at work: It'll take no time for me to get to work because the location is different, but whether that is closer to Hell or not is hard to say. Will report if I consider skipping doing this weekly post entirely if I have to. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Jokes aside, I still need motivation despite being under the weather as always lol, so yeah, maybe putting the angel to start instead of ending it might be a good idea after all haha ah hey</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki03><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style=text-align:left>"There's no way a girl would be fine with being seen changing clothes" YEAH NO SHIT unless you're a porn actress- Then again they also don't really-</span></div></blockquote><div>Yeah Towa-chan next time stitch a bunny on his- They didn't teach that on the book about Earth, huh? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode of do I look like I'm edging right now MUAHAHAHA (#TenshiTsuki03), let's talk about the new girl in town! Well, thank goodness we don't always have the transfer student story even though at some point we may have to let Towa-chan in on this just because, we are not introduced to Shintarou's part-time workplace. Towa-chan may not have learnt about how one has to work part-time to supplement where they are living in right now and how much generosity this guy has gone to let this angel stay at his place haha ah hey, maybe, maybe it's time we made more friends, Shintarou. No more angels, please no. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She is <strike><a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/238861/Noeru_Izumi target=_blank>Oonishi Saori</a></strike> Noel, and ironically the first impression is just... Yeah boss thanks for the heads up because he will be nice with this new girl... until he gets slapped haha Shintarou seems to have such affinity with women. (Edit: See? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>) (I promise you, my casual remark until it happened haha) So that is just kinda ruined, but heck, maybe that fortune-teller of an old woman on the streets was right, he DOES have his luck with women. Yes, we in the industry call these guys the "lucky <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sukebe target=_blank>pervert</a>". I know right, what's wrong with this, dear grandma? He's living the life as an Anime male protagonist in a slice-of-life series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, you look familiar are you trying to charge me 100yen and an extra 100yen with each coming episode or...? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (That's an <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/32645/Fortune_Teller target=_blank>Anime "Yojouhan"</a> joke) 10K YEN FOR A TALISMAN??? Alright, no thanks. Can't stick it on Towa-chan to- ANYWAYS lol, it was rough, but as I assume since they didn't say these two were from the same high school, so interestingly, they were observing each other, probably after that initial encounter because Shintarou wanted to know how it feels to see cherries again. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh damn, I can't stop making these jokes. AND THEY EVEN SERVED CHERRY PARFRAIT- Please, it's the Anime, I didn't do nothing. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, this got our Noel-chan rather frantic, since not only is she unable to get herself out of the situation she was in with some dude (haha ah hey) since she isn't that great to articulate herself as explained by her later, she also... froze the whole restaurant workplace they were in. Hmm... so this is interesting, looks like our first anomaly is up apart from the angel lol, we have a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yukionna target=_blank>snow woman</a> in this series too! So yeah, looks like I have to take the supernatural things here more than at surface level because I really assumed that they are only going to talk about angels and maybe devils just like what Shintarou thought, but I guess he isn't wrong about being unsurprised at all this, since, and I don't joke at you, all of them characters we know so far have gathered in the park the couple(?) was in because circumstances. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So I guess Shintarou at least doesn't have to lie now as he will be able to explain everything in place. I just hope there isn't rivalry over here, as in, the angels have hated snow women for ages and are fighting a war- Okay <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/55129/Oroka_na_Tenshi_wa_Akuma_to_Odoru target=_blank>wrong Anime</a>, so let's hope that is not the case after we try to iron things out and me having to confirm to give this series- I have already given. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all especially with respect to the previous episode... what about Tsumugi? All I remembered were cherries- Okay haha serious talk though? She's like, 16, it's okay to wear those. I'm even surprised she is wearing those. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Uh oh, forget about it, yes? We can talk about though, how this is all coming together. I would believe these anomalies will be a rarity ie. the other 2 girls we don't know of yet can't be supernatural...? I don't know, because unless there is like, something tied to this being some action series, it's likely they are just talking about somewhat normal girls living the human life. Yeah, think of <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/33988/Demi-chan_wa_Kataritai target=_blank>Anime "Demi-chan"</a>. This Noel is going to call her new friend by his first name "Shintarou" and Tsumugi is going to go bonkers HAHA I love this harem of an Anime.</div><div>[GIF FEVER!!

Zain, can you just not- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Oh come on, did they just steal from the Sleeping Beauty lore right here?? BOO WORST ADAPTATION EVER haha alright me. In this new episode where if you would remember what I said last week about Sharon being a spy for Sade (#ShinigamiBocchan26), it might look like I was right. So yeah, this fight against Sade (or not) is going to be rough. I thought this was a happy series. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Now that we have made his even scarier than Five Nights at Freddy's or even <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37525/Babylon target=_blank>Anime "Babylon"</a> lol that woman, let's talk about why Sharon is ACTUALLY here. For starters, let's talk about what her curse is. Because of a flashback and not from Sharon herself because why would she recall, we now know that Alice is healed of her childhood illness thanks to Sade, and her mom had to pay the price for it. In the most cliché scenario, she went to sleep forever, but not with just that. Some creepy eyes have been planted on her by Sade, which, if this episode isn't a better clue on this, is that I assume Sharon being alive will enable Sade to produce clones magically. Though her clones may be absolutely useless as long as that eye itself is hit, each clone(?) can (probably not simultaneously but we are not sure) fight at her capacity, from dealing with Walter to Daleth and even Cuff, it seems to hold its ground. Of course the jokes about the targets so far making the clones useless is funny for now, but eventually it might not be. In Alice's case, what if Bocchan isn't around with her and Rob? Who's going to kill Rob MCMXCIII to XXMMIV?? (Haha you can figure it out yourself, just an Easter egg about me) My point is, this is a numbers thing. And it keeps producing as long as Sharon is awake. I wouldn't assume alive or otherwise her sleeping all these years would have been a disaster by now, to be honest. Still, many are doubting and even rejecting Sharon's existence so far, from Alice who is likely still wondering if this is her real mom and if she will be with her forever after just... leaving her for so long, to Bocchan's mom who straight up just kicked her out of her room oh Sharon you poor thing... it really feels like Sharon's existence might be even more unwelcome in contrast to her extroverted character. Which is a problem, now that I think about it. It really feels like Sade is playing a game with us. What game it is, we have to figure it out. Whether it is playing with our emotions and love as seen with Walter somehow blurting that Daleth and him are a thing lol are they though? Haha, or maybe it's just Sade preparing herself to be existent in all timelines and realities which feels like the case since she found someone willing to be her clone creator and is using that against us at some point. Or maybe it's just she already predicted her eventual death and made sure she can prevent any revenge on her to undo all the curses she has made. (No this is no <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/52816/Majo_to_Yajuu target=_blank>Anime "Majo to Yajuu"</a> this witch's curses live on...?) Regardless of which it is, it really seems that Sade is playing around with us, and we have much to be wary of. And we aren't even telling this to the magical school yet?? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Real entertaining episode though, and as I said the pace of this series will keep going on like a bullet train since this is likely the final season, and let's see where this shall take us. Heartbreak mostly, I would think. I don't want to say this but what if we just kill Sharon to stop Sade- NOPE, UH UH, NO WAY haha maybe we start to think of how to NOT kill Sade again lol</div><div>[TL:DR; Really, despite all the lore of the eyes that has been coming in the aggression of Sade no matter the cause, it makes me laugh every time it's just I can't- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> ROB II NO~]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBOH_NsCQ2nECHMreT8u6b0HUQJcJ-sxUxz1PfnYkR2_tc4vU623csoKgGSOPSJCV0AP-I5PzwNNpb3KQKcsKsPFI7tUrsuPws5v5oP_GEOwARD2Djpl4M-fDaImkuxe2_pA2XqITH2xgebmNaoIg4MUmaTliwPG8A2FU0Rg0mFUn7HFExX5Fh8c2hLRA/s320/shinigamibocchan26_eavesdrop.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I saw this as a thumbnail in the official social and I can't even (lmao)<br></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihjMi6Bug3I4IJATotNgPfvVgh2OXTj6adoubNLXVPtc9B4K0ksLabAQfwC6B7tF-XHdcamPMDQJkdW3bLJ5wiJ6foNwEI21yoUBXHXrlZclmhGSw-Yx8FMtE_2cCgta7X76tE5xxuR778rk4lsnRBnWJ7xWv7S3_7sDOgQ-N3M5CEIYy_9PCJI5d6P4k/s320/shinigamibocchan26_sharon6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Really reminds me of the good ol' cartoon-like kick out of the door scenarios haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbXiMJZbWgKLiSSSw1KbO7rxLdlqTLzI0qIOb_dypvF4tVoNYT26_4p8VtYrUnboOLa43KCKPnRmf4BoZVEfm81KRSqqPWfEhnAyjdQScb9nRFlodkeiJFrOlQWRuBWlYOJZzlLli2sz7Km2eA2LEJLREb6OAPlHUkpZJ_837GE9wRPv7LKKYXdO_0i-I/s320/shinigamibocchan26_beach2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Literally me at parties haha too real dude</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Because he's the oldest person around singing opening theme songs for the <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen target=_blank>Anime "Kaguya-sama"</a> series? Well, no one cares. Not if you are at the age range of watching this cocktail series though (#Bartender03), because wait, doesn't that look like Sasakura's sensei? Yeah, the legend. Likely rival, isn't his sensei like super dead? RIP, bro, you will be missed. Moving on though, maybe we talk about our new rival here. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, he can't be a rival, he's perfect, remember? Meet Kuzuhara Ryuuichi, deemed as the best bartender in Japan, he can make drinks so perfect, you will question your imperfect existence. But before you turn into a delinquent and do drugs and stuff lol weed day was yesterday, let me tell you what the Chairman here has cooked up. For starters, he told Kuzuhara about this little boy in Eden Hall making drinks he was impressed about, even if just barely. That probably got Mister Perfect here interested and to see for himself what disappointment he will receive after being in the industry all these years. But damn, did the ego get to him, he dunked on Sasakura here real good before he left, and boy, does Mister Perfect not take a fancy to how he makes cocktails, calling him far from perfect. But I think that's what Sasakura Ryuu is all about. He keeps his honesty at bay while bringing out his professionalism to all his customers, even if they don't like him. But hey, people be people, amirite?? We need some rivalry and we are getting it, dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, this isn't much to stir up much rivalry among them and I don't think there's a thing like this in this series considering the age difference lol GOTTEM, but the Chairman then told Sasakura indirectly to close shop (because he knows the owner of his premises) just so he can invite him to Bar K to make him a drink. Yes, and against Mister Perfect Kuzuhara over here. Man, stirring the pot huh, this old f**k- I gotta say though, you don't have to bring them here to make a drink just so you can dunk on him. Also like, bro, no one is taking bets here Sasakura still wants to be a bartender you can retire all you want, old man. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> He's not a quitter. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> And unlike Kawakami which I guess Sasakura also dunked on her but I would argue he did more of encourage her to do better just because he knows she can (and I don't think the girl got it but hey maybe she will, she openly invited him over to her bar too), since we are dealing with the real perfection <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, Sasakura's catering to Miwa-san who is the test candidate here (lol) will initially win the battle, but lose at the feels once the hype settles down and you start noticing Kuzuhara has made his drink freeze in time, it can't suck as bad as sucking up to customers OOH GOTTEM GOOD haha. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> And I think that's what those old geezers are trying to do, which makes me sad just like this boi over here, and no wonder Miwa-san got worried about him. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And she is totally right: pleasing the customer is so much more of a job than to impress. What the heck is impressing the general audience when the one customer you serve is absolutely pissed at you? BRUH. Old man no get. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But it does give Sasakura some thought to change, even just a bit, to what it means to make the perfect drink. All in all though... I know right? Potential romance plot question mark?? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, I'm still in love with this series, and I think I'm growing into the storytelling here and there, so I'm definitely giving this a watch till the end. What will become of the couple- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, like, between Mister Perfect and Sasakura Ryuu? Weird couple, I gotta say, not too keen on the outcome. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, really makes you think, really makes him think, and we might see something even better. Not an employment to to the Chairman hotel's bar though, that Chairman did all this out of spite and I don't think Sasakura will forgive you anytime soon haha oh well you can find someone else I guess why drag him out and beat him anyways- And that's why society is rough lol maybe we see Sasakura help out more of his own customers again?

It's not like you get to sit down and taste both types of perfections when one of them would have sufficed, and especially, hey they didn't tell you this, both can't be attained at the same time. So what do you do? Do you achieve perfection but when the customer gets pissed at its taste you can't change the formula to meet their needs or desires? Or do you just do the business?

Ciel became a gay- Yeah he came out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>I mean, if Ciel just became the condescending pretence he was in every other story arc, that is NOT surprising, I promise you. Remember he did that "Phoenix!!" pose in order to get people talking? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode of the new arc though (#KuroshitsujiSchool02), we are already dealing with people doing underhand stuff just like us? THEY COULD NEVER. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, it's all likely true, and as Sebastian would have said, just because they are students doesn't mean they are out of ideas to screw with others. It's competition in the private school after all. They all strive to be above one another in any case, so what else is new. Effectively, we want to spoil the perfect plans of Maurice Cole, some <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a>(?) in school which isn't to me I'm afraid haha no not even without the personality, is somewhat of a jerk. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like, for real as a person, not like, he jerks- ALRIGHT HAHA this is an all-boys school, relax. What has he done? I mean, maybe how the Prefect 4 and their <strike>servants</strike> drudges stayed this way for a long while literally being a walled garden in their gazebo might help us understand this more. Because even with Ciel's name throughout the school for doing perfect jobs under Clayton who isn't that nice to him, he still did everything well enough to gain the attention of the seniors. As expected that means acceleration of their plans to understand more of what's happening behind the school, but we had to pull the brakes on this because, and yes Maurice is behind all this, he told Ciel the wrong time to appear for the afternoon tea session when he was given an opportunity to meet with the Prefects. Hmm... evil, is likely the second word I would use, but heck, Maurice is such a b*tch maybe that is a more appropriate word for them. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Well, can't be sad about this as with most plot twists in this series hehe, so might as well find a solution to expose him for his doings. And bruh, was it quite a find. Not only is he basically like Ciel and does most of his duties in reliance of someone else <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> it's still impressive Sebastian can be at his beck and call despite his own "duties" in school, Maurice also... employs a lot of people for his tasks. Like, everyone who wants to be his servant- You know, that thing, the brotherhood thing I heard so much of. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, Maurice keeps his line empty so that he can always f**k with the little boys. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's like not getting married so you can languish with the girls anytime you want. Or boys, we don't judge even if this is an all-boys school. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sadly, proving that will be hard even if Sebastian can find all its previous victims, because if there isn't much live evidence on this, they can't expose anything at all. You know, getting spotted doing such stuff that'll be enough to get Redmond to wake up. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, didn't expect Souma-kun here to appear again, that Indian prince who is in good terms with Ciel I don't even remember what he was in for, but yeah, they have been avoiding him for this very reason: He is better off not talking to because he is very annoying to deal with. But heck, it's for the investigation under orders, so whatever dude, let yourself loose. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... oh yeah I think I can recall, he is one of the early arc characters who ended up following him because we defeated his butler. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh well thank goodness that butler in the Anime's season 2 didn't stick with us, that's for sure. What we are sure though, that if this pot isn't stirred well enough, this entrance of Souma-kun will ensure total chaos, but at least, it's within our control. How will that happen though? I don't remember so let's watch next week to find out! Remember that I only remember the ending to this nonsense lmao, so I'll be entertained for now if this episode isn't a good example so far.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCQoJBWrrnhVH008z0p5p6EvWnAdJ8XwRDOacCGhiykAycG9HLx7xdOUxwcVaH1Yc4zuVQvecaAbWv4z1dAB35DEoN6HfD2HcgoIUjG5CBaSnJD-SzVCMSCMqAid7Db0XltWw1D-bPkPgbjYvlCVoygmtIApXwNC7SBnMof2UcNoPVoFpkCL-gMhNPJsg/s320/kuroshitsujischool02_sebastian5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What working moms look like these days lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkT8KlFZxOVS0I-Y7svaHjFWtGYc7p2eoI3yKMOePLmCb9mRBCuek3PSZ5WBY4eMjmWcm_hSr5UKYUYOb5eXCo6InPfVOAggcYdEdvXoNA2SoB2d6ouRp7N-8AsMnOX33zmnLDovLYdN8y7BEVx5hWdrNjgE4I0zoOoLrqWw-yzBBWVpEDroNHOsrZ8Lo/s320/kuroshitsujischool02_drowning.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What it feels like working at a toxic workplace amirite??</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXxMtmOQMMpSHejAtdL8qe7C1T2g2ziF0Rfu6h8jRRmL9tHoNAwFVSlmW23ZdWIhhPqvy_oeUPKHOxupeG3pXquFqAKhBP9Knyskwat813XhPB0SYCWWGmGrumUd5Mv14s3trA6CzmpVr9eG3sJ0eU4gNend9SqnwjCzbrxq3o8XpoVQi9Qdi0aMt30Oc/s320/kuroshitsujischool02_violet1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Not as toxic as this Violet though- What on Earth are they doing?<br>Is this Chemistry class?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div></div><div>P.S.

Take a straw from YUI here, she started singing her own compositions on the streets to gain confidence over time. Soon you will breed an army of Himari-chans. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we continue to breed the romance on our main couple hehe (#SasaKoi02), yeah Himari-chan asked her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> out on a date? Like, date date? Those between couples? Yeah. It's a date- LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOO haha I'm just expressing as Yori-senpai. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But I think in this episode we also saw a lot more than what we did not expect... until the hints were dropped which is titular of such a romance series, so let's see what they are. Firstly, I think it's rather obvious, but Asanagi here did take it to the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kouhai target=_blank>kouhai</a> to really tell her that their relationship right now is not enough to make her happy. No, not even with the cat addiction she is having. Also not with the music she is loving. Right now, Himari-chan? Asanagi here is in love with YOU- That's cheesy enough for me I'll stop here. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And it's not surprising to see someone else get affected by this affection these two are having when Himari drops by Yori-senpai's classroom when it's raining, to even going out with her on the weekends and ignoring her friends... SURELY someone will think otherwise. Which is why- WHY IS <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20240314/20/toyosakiaki-blog/ce/81/j/o0468060015413020104.jpg target=_blank>AKI-CHAN</a> SAD haha I might be reading things too much, don't mind me. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Turns out I'm not, and thanks to a quick flashback, even her friends on the table do not even know of such a past, which I swear will make of a much friendly competition we will not expect, but not as if (not Toyosaki) <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20240307/15/toyosakiaki-blog/83/13/j/o0450060015410170782.jpg target=_blank>Aki-chan</a> here (lol should I do this again?) (yeah why not name tagging is fun hehe) will rage a storm from seeing someone more desperate for the girl she likes more than her... and also seeing it being mutual love yeah that stings, but maybe we leave that for another time. Meanwhile, the main couple as I will refer to from now on, isn't that much interesting as it is more fresh to our dear Asanagi here, because apart from reading and playing and singing the music alone, she is now brought out into the world outside, the world of Kino Himari, where you know, like all other girls our dear Asanagi now hangs out at like, cat fairs on the weekends. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And she gets the real pussy too so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I can't joke on that too much lol, but yeah the focus is more seen on Asanagi here who is enjoying this date like it's her last, and could not wait to make sure she gets more of it. Cool, isn't it? She might even be deciding to join back the band she did a one-off for. And that's what it means to do things for others. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> All in all... Damn, I am as flustered and as hesitant in giving the nod as Himari-chan is in the bathroom and I didn't realize how much she is stacked (lmao), but no, really, whatever this girls love Anime is still trying to get me even after watching so far. I mean, if this is no <strike>"Orange"</strike> <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34382/Citrus target=_blank>Anime "citrus"</a> and they don't scissor each other by the final episode, I'm fine. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (If you don't get it, don't look it up, just don't) I might actually watch this even if it's along the lines of girls liking each other and doing flirty things, but hey, we have another episode to go before I give the decision, the theme songs aren't bad not even the ending theme sung by Himari-chan, so let's see where this will take us. Hey, I'm not as stuck as Himari-chan though I can accept the confession from Yori-senpai. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyJPHP24Ot0aJasbw332KYTZKFMCO8uz76qkpBCpeTBgcAjeq6gkv_6nKXUMmJnNdEMCLPia1p8N7riJGlnsSU9PDNBWFYvTRZkqNqTc7btfgy1mNJQcuFzK_vks6ze2oB9QDHgZbtLpEFau-p009jW7Zpv_8IjXJ-LIyl8Ejos2BvklQ73h7l-UMEHpw/s320/sasakoi02_lovey.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't know why I like this a lot but<br>(Haha can I have a hug on <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/43279/Konomi_Kohara target=_blank>Koko-chan</a> too?)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGRaVxHzUm90jwaiFPhkqhOcdjdAc6o-47ysWCAf8kuP9GpPRUSk3FIFBKXHUOLGySvESD-VTT9h_YlMKbB_K-eXKbUyTccauSE5WS33j8xIHay5MZ1aTu0QBZ60YpIegw-f_ZNGOFexkQaq-WK9qBg1rdZj7I2eibnIW6CfBFhGN6iY56Hw09pritfEU/s320/sasakoi02_couple5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Gotta do the girls thing by posing for a selfie with <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tapioka target=_blank>bubble tea</a>!</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjukm2EXFjDo9lK9COAtoQsYedBc_3OVAeVBHalAQ8ar0t36_Suh0fnB0pu3OLRqQVmigrP2HaTpUT5a4IQSORJ_qDuHGv9WAzYI6a3l1fii8R5-6IhRbaiMNkE854pkDyfA1JqCb6BS8FRNRqf6rpmOuqAlbii6U3PWDrG1y5wAd0mnzckn5sEllVpQ24/s320/sasakoi02_himari15.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>WOAH WOAH WOAH<br>(Haha <em>nice</em>)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Yes, I'm talking about <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%89%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9C%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC-ep/1739504714?l=en-US" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new single</a></b>, where even after so long of not listening to it, I don't think I'll ever like the title song despite having a easy-listening chorus. I'm sorry, Nan-chan, it is what it is. The B-side isn't any better too, to be frank. Also goes for <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%88%E3%82%A5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9/1739504554?i=1739504555&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>Takagaki Ayahi and Toyosaki Aki's new song</a></b> (yes they are singing in one song together) because I felt like it missed something, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/our-time-feat-miwa/1738613922?i=1738614259" target=_blank>Sakuma Minami's song written by miwa</a></b> too, both lacked the oomph apart from having to give melodies which are less than your usual catchy.

Also, <b><a href=https://x.com/specialthanks_7/status/1781837171101692277 target=_blank>SpecialThanks announced a new song during their live yesterday</a></b> which is also out now and it's not bad at all, so I'll likely add that to the list. Man, we need to be worried about shadow drops now? I feel like I should delay those if they aren't announced beforehand, right? <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> </div><div><br></div><div>Well, we got some more news about music this week, so take notes if you care about any of these. I know this isn't much but all I want to say about <b><a href=https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1780190276784656632 target=_blank>miwa's new album cover</a></b> is what the transformation though!! Haha well if the music will be any representation of this, then this release will be interesting in a month. <b><a href=https://x.com/3rdMR_staff/status/1780432244156363204 target=_blank>MusicRay'n 3rd Generation will be involved in an Anime-theme album</a></b> which is hard to describe but according to the website it's likely all originals and inspired by Anime so technically it's an Anime release? I don't know but if it's new songs and are originals, why not? It'll be out next weekend. A couple of artists I know are involved in <b>Sukima Switch's tribute album</b>, so I might as well mention them while I'm at it, namely <a href=https://x.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1780521593980277241 target=_blank>Aimer</a> and <a href=https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1780522875507867666 target=_blank>Ikimonogakari</a>. <b><a href=https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1780523236046106847 target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new single schedule reveals have been announced</a></b> including the <a href=https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1781246482466902462 target=_blank>artist photo</a> and <a href=https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1781249519562477668 target=_blank>cover art</a> a couple of days ago and the track list tomorrow so I'm not going to list them all since the music video which will be of utmost importance, will be out next month, so until then I guess. <b><a href=https://x.com/primary_yuiko/status/1780537438093676572 target=_blank>yuiko has announced a new EP</a></b> for the upcoming doujin event M3 next week and even <a href=https://x.com/primary_yuiko/status/1781264873596563772 target=_blank>a release trailer</a> has been revealed and boy did I get high from seeing Meis Clauson but heck he isn't writing the songs just doing the mastering, but still, it's great to hear her sing again, so maybe when it's out on digital we'll give chance. We finally get to hear a <b><a href=https://x.com/tuzurizukuri/status/1780909848265400637 target=_blank>preview of Tsuzuri Zukuri's new song</a></b> which has been teased for a while already, and oh boy it's a happy song? Well, I thought I was ready for the depression but guess not. <b><a href=https://x.com/glimspanky/status/1780536755084783670 target=_blank>GLIM SPANKY is releasing a new song next week</a></b> for a TV show but is also actively writing songs for other artists which is <b><a href=https://x.com/XAI_official/status/1780929494657970550 target=_blank>XAI's new song</a></b> and boy is it ever so their style, it's interesting to listen to a different singing voice though. I don't know I will be too keen on this though but <b><a href=https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1780899075228852383 target=_blank>SID's vocalist Mao is releasing a full album end of May</a></b> but they did give us a <a href=https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1780899141935378669 target=_blank>music video preview</a> and giving us <a href=https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1781253909933339112 target=_blank>song previews of its tracks for the next week</a> so... Yeah maybe I'll give a listen, I didn't care about the other members releasing their own solo tracks so maybe I'll give this an exception after all. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh yeah how can we forget about <b><a href=https://x.com/naaasuooo/status/1782012656737718478 target=_blank>nasuo's new music video</a></b> because damn it's colourful as heck but yeah, I have to give her songs again which I would say again, its biggest flaw is asking me to give her raps. Other than that, yeah when's the physical release coming so I can burn my money on her again? Haha I can't find information about it though.</div><div><br></div><div>So next week, we have a slew of releases to listen to and that's assuming I have time to listen considering my travel time is basically negligible from next week onwards, but hey I'll listen to them in the morning before I leave, including <b>Kamishiraishi Mone's new song from Anime "Bartender"</b> that doesn't sound too bad at all I will listen to it in full, <b>Ogura Yui's new single for Anime "Tenshi Tsuki"</b> and I highly doubt her 3-track single will hit my shelf but it'll be a listen since a couple of years ago, and <b>Ishihara Kaori's new album</b> which from the trailer isn't much so I will see what I can give apart from the Anime "KanaTen" ending theme song a season ago. This line-up doesn't seem like much so my plan for next week and the following week which also doesn't have much, is to give the Anime ALL the theme songs I'm watching this season since they all don't really care about physical release anymore. Yeah, singles are overrated might as well do pre-release now. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> I'll have time for them, they just have to wait.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I swear I'm like, <em>so</em> used to waiting for Anime theme songs to come in full release that I'm just annoyed that I have to start giving more than half of them the day I watch the first episode. Bro, I'm not an impressionist, stop treating Capitalism like fish bait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh yeah, the <a href=https://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv344936129 target=_blank>Ede-chan and Maria-chan event yesterday</a>. I only watched the last of the 3 of them because who needs a guest anyways <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but I think the highlight of that (just) half an hour (yep) livestream is just <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiizwk1IxodnOOJtlQlO5XlkHQKqIi8ofMfB-FHSSqrN4p2TV0viJRxCFWz7lDK-M1HxbGdGPDKjg0oJkyshLBWVajzV-naGBqo-YtSQ0X_7_MnKVXk938XYjgxDR8RNhXw0cxLECuiu6pE2BqpcnRVhvFG9tTtrwp1YjD93PQzcokYO1MsEj_7Lt1LaZQ/s320/image_2024-04-20_18-02-57.jpg target=_blank>Maria-chan just freaking out from a bug</a> on her desk. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know right, I can kill that thing for you. Oh, you mean me? Excuse me while I uh... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And I guess <a href=https://x.com/Hondo_dagaya_/status/1781689912707997830 target=_blank>Ede-chan's hairstyle show-off</a> can take second place. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay maybe first place hehe, and <a href=https://x.com/seigurachannel/status/1781680932338192475 target=_blank>they both wore glasses</a> too?? *umph* Haha it's already worth the money even though I feel it's a ripoff especially when I forgot I have a niconico subscription too (from watching the livestream archive, that one in March) and I cancelled it days before the actual event. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> It's fine, mistakes were made, I was egged by Ede-chan to pay anyways, and I may be making more of them mistakes soon if the work pressure gets to me. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> See you guys next time then haha, and let's hope my life isn't that screwed just yet. I just have an aching behind the left side of my head though... <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> AND DON'T YOU DARE TAKE AWAY MY GOLDEN WEEK WORK LEAVE haha <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
