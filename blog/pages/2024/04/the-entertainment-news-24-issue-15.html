I can't reject sequels anyways so they don't count. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh and order doesn't matter this week too because I am still figuring out what will make me want to do this every week first for or the next 3 months so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Music this week has also been great too, so we will talk about those after we deal with my weekend naps being burnt on watching animated girls and dudes...? Uh oh haha why are there so many of them though</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki02><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Wow, look at all those lights!" Eh Towa-chan? That's called light pollution lol</div></blockquote><div>Oh, so I guess we are looking through the beginning through Towa-chan's perspective now? Hey, Earth isn't that great, just so you know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode of more angel goodness (#TenshiTsuki02), OBVIOUSLY we gotta descend upon the Heavens like mythology would require you to do. Or just a fantasy genre Anime, either will work. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And in case you forgot what happened in the first episode, she ended up with blending in with the humans instead, as assisted by Shintarou. And they finally settled down after what was quite a hassle to deal with thinking that some chick (hehe) just landed on your balcony one night. Hey, at least the guy is enjoying his life being <strike>spoiled</strike> <strike>pampered</strike> fed good food (lol) by the angel who learnt everything from the book and would you mind printing those recipe pages out so we can share it with the cooking community if it was that good? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, that's good and all, thanks for ALL the fanservice happening inside the one bathroom lol bro we have those here too but I don't suddenly drop by seeing someone naked- ANYHOW lol (bro, I live with my family, I better stop elaborating on this) the antics might go on for a while as Shintarou gets used to living his life not alone anymore and hopefully no one else finds out about this angel's presence quite soon, though I would argue as of when will she be able to do something for the larger community of humans though? Still, Shintarou has a life to live don't forget he was literally living alone just to attend school which I assume is nearer than his home, so yeah, can't just take leave off school just to flirt with you, dear angel. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> And thus we are introduced to the school cast, consisting of whoever Shuuichi is who almost made him puke out his full-course breakfast and... Tsumugi here- Yo I don't know who you are, cute girl, but heck, why aren't you voiced by Kanno Mai? Haha ah hey. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, I guess <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/49683/Hana_Tamegai target=_blank>this new(?) girl</a> isn't bad too especially, ESPECIALLY when you throw in the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsundere target=_blank>tsundere</a> personality on her so much so even the childhood friend noticed he was getting sh*t on lol, probably came around this plot too well considering that Shintarou probably helped out Tsumugi when she was a little girl. And she's here to repay the favour- I don't think that counts as stalker behaviour though? You guys didn't meet for 9 years; It's a matter of if he remembered you, to be honest. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Oh well maybe he doesn't, but this doesn't stop Tsumugi here (I'm not going to make the <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/19568/Tsumugi_Kotobuki target=_blank>Anime "K-ON!" reference</a>, it has been 15 years) from, you know, slowly advancing herself into Shintarou's life, for example maybe make bento lunches for him- Oh he does have an angel taking care of his meals now and delivers them to him during lunchtime so... I guess you're not needed anymore?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I hope Shintarou has a great excuse for this I would say Towa is like, the apartment manager or something. Yeah, like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/153353/Shion_Kyouzuka target=_blank>from Anime "Slow Start"</a>. They are all stacked, that's how you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all- Oh wow, it's over already? When's the last time I haven't been watching shows and looking at the timestamps? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This might be it for me, guys. I meant, watching this on the regular. If I wasn't into this last week I should be by now, not gonna lie here. Even if it means the female cast will carry me to Heaven, I wouldn't even mind. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, the story is simple yet real (or not) as of now, and I think that's a good thing, so let's enjoy the honeymoon period before like, Towa-chan's angel friends come for her. Meanwhile, looks like we can enjoy the company of the other girls in school hanging out with Towa-chan as seen from the ending theme animation, so let's go for more of this blessed series! Uh maybe not that blessed and I maaaay have to change the "tsun" in front of the "dere" for Tsuki into something else soon so uh... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuOOBI-bTF6zz5olDs5pP3Bfufy_0gpevOuTiIPTRwyJgjJaOwEEpF0vKxwrjZszKQ4IVlYUOWj_97keLxGpvPijydvI6TL18iby717nOg8l6ZWUa4bABDgmcAifdl2_RtLAa4GMvmLKnJxv3iUlUCUO1r7ULFU9UgCUxG6cZ_ayWhfji1ZsONV8GBC2s/s320/tenshitsuki02_food2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The food drawings in this series might be too good ngl</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdRIHwJU4QMgV1RAqA7UYk8K9eUiIpdbIrH6NPLFQCUNou9pkIUui6od0HiRrftBekgC9N5tHI_5c8mQNLCNLXNdHLrrPtS4Xd0Jq6unRr90jCmqIOD4U457fVfR3RcWnqGcUS2XkhkiTWKFXquNeitrEO2H74RA-TPzt4I97LApauxtfoojJOQ8O5vd8/s320/tenshitsuki02_sheets.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Someday I will be like Towa-chan and sink into my girl's-</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgH-heHoCOeFNNmt7Bt6mH-Hjfl21bRkmx8BbYgc2IEwwYUJippQU_IcyAZBolFQ7wfzSs94QGLo9Wxmmpuzwq3Fwi6Y5UCOpDgfWIhvi1zaaPXqKBJFvYiaKi7gsAcRk-rB5cd0ulVCWNnL1AMYtErrbSGvG0M_plrVbdKROITi_ZAktbNpsDDbHe_6ZU/s320/tenshitsuki02_couple3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Just a peek- Ah.<br><span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6sjDjQ-RRV7mjGcc4Wr0a3wgoqcFoy6WAQdjXajOUyuhx1O1XyOPVn071_CXbTdXdgLbxKh79L9l3sXJGqv4ot_wOwSFTWCbXKH-FhyOaxOzQScwXjFtIzlOOJhLOAIJMPQMPTIqouJArM6WRH_iDPUGhSrlPats4HA0zQInyJIWTmRiTMOeGP4qfk5g/s1600/tenshitsuki02_punching.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I liked Shintarou's imaginations of Towa-chan naked lol</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Oh, that's Hollywood. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this first episode of a final season of what is supposed to come to us as a conclusion arc to this curse at least (#ShinigamiBocchan25), wtf is that children's bible- Is that the school anthem?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, also boobs. Haha HELL YEAH Mr. Zain would be pleased. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also also, if you wonder why I can never grab a great thumbnail for that chick who needs subtitles... it's just because. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, the story so far in general and we might as well recap too because why not. Story goes and I'm being very generic here because I guess we will touch on stuff here and there as we go on this rollercoaster ride of an episode, Bocchan has a curse and so is Nico and we are here in this magic school to eventually undo them. By killing Sade- Alright let me rephrase that again. By confronting Sade once again and if all negotiations fail THEN maybe we will erase her. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I mean, what we really need at this point of the story is choice. From Daleth being on our side, to all the people who are learning magic that isn't part of the magical school and don't have to sing whatever that school anthem is LMAO, to Zain ensuring their success with the time travel magic, and how Sharon is awake right now... Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, as much as it's a point to know what Alice's mother has been doing all this while in a coffin protected by Daleth in the Underworld of all people, it's interesting to see Sharon just walking about and interacting with everyone- Her voice actress is TOTALLY getting underpaid at this point she talks too much. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Living up to her name, we see her initially confronting Rob (who is quietly rolling his joints lol in case you wonder how those work) and <em>then</em> seeing her daughter come back from magic school along with Bocchan who has promised to be her lover from here on... I mean, even I shed tears of joy when I saw Alice get reunited with Sharon even though I already knew this was coming. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> And yeah, even the mom got emotionally excited after hearing what Bocchan had to say. I mean, all this love talk is not new, but in the eyes of someone we have not seen before... for a while, yeah. She's 25, by the way. *oof* Haha anyways, in terms of lore though, we now know a lot more than we knew before, with a recollection of someone effectively coming in from the past. So, for starters, we know Bocchan's grandfather is Bocchan's life saviour. I mean, without Victor, the two women wouldn't have a chance to work at the mansion considering how ill Alice has been back then and Sharon trying to take care of her unable to get a steady income, and all of this would not have happened at all. Well, we might as well not have let all this happen since it still did not change the plot of Sade's arrival, but that's also all she could recall. Yeah, as to why Sade chose to make use(?) of Sharon, if even, we still have no idea. And Daleth is also right in thinking that them going back in time may have consequences on things in the present considering Sade may have manipulated everything even then including exactly when Sharon is to be awake so to get in the way of their confrontation to Sade? Hmm interesting... lest to say is that I still have NO IDEA what is going on so far, so I'm just in for the ride. I sure hope there's something interesting at the other end of the tunnel, whatever it is. All in all... it's rather content heavy as with all conclusive arcs (see <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/6773/Shakugan_no_Shana_III_Final target=_blank>Anime "Shakugan no Shana"</a>), but heck, it's moving fast as heck! Yeah, maybe even faster than Free(?) is with his magical horse transformation, and I don't really mind it was just a lot to absorb. I wonder what is up next, and unless we are saying that Sharon in this state is already quickly becoming a liability, I don't know what's in store. Oh yeah, maybe Sharon going back to the main house and seeing Bocchan's mom and how much of an old hag she is, dude?? I know right, all the age jokes I can think of lol Nico-san you are not going to win me here haha</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyr5tRAKschtDKyylCQR0UczqT06KjBwblWIEn1pIff8Gs7uDu6p6zuL9iNnvUtvhkRERulzQ83R5Vr0POC5u2N4yISEIvFU39zA-8Ye-1yKODolokZLv4ZnywdRizBCANLWZ9eB-8sXqy4t4Zh7eF56fzRtzvgh9wIxyrgmqlXBzEqqySMgKAXU1mlLk/s320/shinigamibocchan25_cuff2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Haha those drawn on eyes from the lesson she was dozing off from I can't even</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGp1AXAJCavyI-QqiUAFk_5Huf2qu13iVVQ2Uurr-QetGAmXnqtu9t-ncrCjdLFZwAM3ylsp7ndn71xcGjdsoR9wrT4KsRnx6Q8gUF5uf4nnLploz6hF3YXQUoSs2-UOmugAiLn3YdQpsPWuCvYJD_BzcBnvYpeULBWPALHNRnqkp7OaAaVjGwivzknlI/s320/shinigamibocchan25_joint.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yo Rob you ROLLING THOSE JOINTS, DUDE??<br>(Haha)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip92zmz35GPtExG4TChcwFzbnWnCYJ66l1Olqh-_HftOtSEAG-_DYd-xpw0_lojX5BRTXa8qFopvxw6bpBaEFVPD9ZVz7Oj-eehy7NkEe1KMg7SA-xxoAcMzRNucdAyS-IobrM0wk0jWsXBdtwruD4msOM0TrHtJ2LffFLsYZ3_wTqK3D5RNCPmfn6J9Q/s320/shinigamibocchan25_nico3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>#NotMyBocchan lol<br>(Come on, let's get this trending on social)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoIayKlcIGt8dSairypLmEtiGf9EYIdbzgqaEG7w6DOW0X1thQW0LMgkq82nTULdERpLOZFmbWpiRdRhVO5fARQKSXdAgps1vNjZswGgRZD8ptmTTkHhPJ8rFRAHjRR402wp1UW94ew21PjEDtZuPwWk2qedfo6CZM3dXB8dysQgTqVX02BL3Q4VjPEb4/s320/shinigamibocchan25_rob2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I found my new profile picture hehe<br>(Viola-chan <em>wished</em> she saw this spectacle)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha and I don't mean anything by this I just want to reminisce on the OG Anime-</div></blockquote><div>I like how they think getting Sasakura Ryuu here to work for the hotel IS a thing. Bro, it isn't, stop daydreaming, he has his own place to run. So yeah, cleanse that pallet here, sir, we aren't talking about the original Anime series anymore, wake up. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where even the bartender has his own problems (#Bartender02), but before those come in, let's talk about others' first! I mean, his only problem is these two ladies just pestering him into joining their hotel bar. Count me in. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, we are presented still with more stories to cry about lol, and the first on the line is an old pal- Oops, spoiler alert. It's the Chairman from the hotel that he wanted to hire but he can't recall the girls who came to him recently so yeah that's what happens when you are an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> (lol) AND you have the power to make them drunk? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Despite likely knowing of whatever new hotel that is coming after his job skills if you would even call that, Sasakura here still did a wonder even if it's dealing with an old man who just complains about every single drink he was presented. It's as if he doesn't like the drinks of today no more- Yup. I hope you got the hint, and also why they blurred out the photo in the old bar specifically his deceased master (RIP) who worked in here and Sasakura had to help out once in a while, because this man is reminiscing the times where Japan had bars like, what is now 70 years ago (OOF), where ice isn't a ready thing let alone say freezers haha yeah people had to carry ice on the streets and prevent them from melting still, and as he said it himself, anything cold would be considered a drink. And that's what essentially he has missed. And then we have a hypocrite. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, calling her a bastard may be an understatement and I'm surprised Sasakura dealt with it so peacefully like a gentleman he is instead of kicking her out lmao, but let's just say we have another customer here who is tired from work, running away from the rain into this bar, and hopes to not drink alcohol to warm up. WHAT? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ironically, and I think this was also in the original series, that Sasakura had to ask for some soup from the restaurant within his block to make what is Bull Shot, a soup-like drink (man, I wish I can recall which website I referenced when I watched the original series) which also had vodka in it, so yeah, win-win. You get the warmth and the crunk you have always wanted, a**hole. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And I think I will leave the lawyer's complaints in the show for you to realize how old you are too which unless if you are 12 and don't get these then why are you even watching this? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... even with the remake taking its place, I still CANNOT BELIEVE I am touched by this new series. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> As I wipe my tears after I watched it and took a toilet break I'm not lying here I am an a-hole I promise you <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, the impact might not be the same anymore, but the emotions are. And I suppose watching this as an adult only makes it infinitely more relatable, from old tastes to dealing with work stuff... it all makes sense once you step into that one bar. Also, you think he will eventually work in the hotel? That Sasakura? Unlikely so I would believe, but hey, we got 10 more episodes at least to go, so keep it up, ladies. Even the Chairman is keen on this guy and wants to ruin his life by giving him more money and less life- You think people in a bar at a hotel won't be any worse than the Chairman? I highly doubt so HAHA come witness me cry again next week will ya</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6757nEWES9jSl458BEMZTGdKynzprfGNWCmaqZtVT6Ojia10uxSAQ_KXxcFmzg6ISLRGE8lRUqzQE23IZoCakPOn9vbtUGOzMKLp71TZRxMU4B88qO0YVIlq9HCbU-TIbDeA9cDhhmH-HWeYyAD4FZ8d0plUGxkJJkE0Y3U_0eitS2gIA0Qp94L1TEco/s320/kaminoglass02_keiko4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Guess what, THIS is the only way to warm up my poor, weak heart right now</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhonsH6t_almvDnZknxqVdBEJ5frhADCrCTGRJJvWn72srTG0HcuQ_8VG3ynLsuReaNSvJG0fzRYWHPQRrNU9-wQZyRS9LAHDsXVU9-GWic78fp2H00bx2TEKnsluqjeZT8sGRP5Gh_wzxV0C3niTm9bYUSrglxUFVlRFwK96HadcNnHprvMsE9uH6fZ0/s320/kaminoglass02_bullshot.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Dude, this just looks like corn soup.<br><span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div></div><div>P.S.

Two voice actresses in the same class by pure coincidence!" Dude, you don't have to keep emphasizing on that lol it's like they intentionally made it happen</div></blockquote><div>Wow, how should I start to talk about this even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this first episode of what should make me nerdier than that Watanabe talking about her mechs and robots (#SeiyuuRadioNoUraomote01), eh... it's an industry story, alright. Despite much of it being too real, this one has a twist: We don't see the same person in front and behind camera. Is that a problem though? For Yasumi-chan here who is more extroverted than her image, and for Yuuhi-chan who is way more introverted than her image, yeah totally. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But after just watching this so far... I don't think I will be giving more of this, to be frank. And no, my love for Japanese voice actresses since I was a middle schooler won't carry me through this. Let's talk about the reasons why. Firstly, the storytelling is... to be as real as possible, rather bland. I know that we are showing the contrast between characters in real life and in front of the camera, and there is somewhat impact as you have seen so far in the public recording, but the drama isn't as strong as I would have hoped. Say, for example, Yuuhi-chan she just spouted and left after someone spilled a mess on her where I guess because it's also what a quiet emo person would do, did not voice out to such an incident in front of her considering she is also rather crude in talk, and bro, I would've just lashed it out on the girl if I had to. Maybe I'm being too dramatic on this, but hey, at least Yasumi-chan is playing her part right since it's also easier to do so for her anyways. Yeah, and the mannerism to professionalism thing. As a Japanese student though? I highly doubt you need any. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Also, the idea of this talk about voice actresses and their private lives is not so much encompassed into the story as if passing talking, but this is more of like a case study. They definitely tried to squeeze everything possible and real about what being in the voice acting industry is like, and then talking about what's different for this series. It's the difference between watching science shows and reading research papers. The latter is more boring. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Next, the animation. BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know I like to give chance to voice actresses here and there, but you can't make the characters look worse than their real life counterparts, that's at least a lowest assumption from me. Also that's why people like people in 2D more than in 3D anyways, just so you know. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (I know right, amateurs) (Haha I sound like that dude in class now) So yeah, even the best moments of showing Yasumi and Yuuhi here are just... not that great, and I'm genuinely disappointed even from the start when I saw the covers for this. I know this would come to play in my rejection of this series, if I would even make those GIFs I thought of whilst watching it. Lastly, and sadly I will say that's why Miku is more popular than Moeshi lol, it's Toyota Moe's voicing of her character. To put this nicely, it's off-putting. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know when I watched the trailer that this will be a deal breaker, and the storytelling ironically did help in making her emotions show as emotionless the character's real side is lacking thereof, still did not make me like... well any of her voicing on this. If this is a matter of preference, then I'm not taking it. As such, I will not write a conclusion to this because the above is as conclusive as I will give it. I sound like a critic on those Anime sites now so I'm sorry, but from the get-go I already am prepared to not give this much credit unless it can impress me, and not with my watchlist this season. I know I also watched <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/29163/Sore_ga_Seiyuu target=_blank>Anime "Sore ga Seiyuu!"</a> that many years ago, but that's more generic and didn't have storytelling done this way that will... make you think about how <a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1776172937873338719?t=4MZLviLahbpDV7gonwkbaw&amp;s=19" target=_blank>Minase Inori's Twitter/X account got hacked</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, we're cancelling this radio show, we ran out of budget. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> The theme songs are great though, but that is not helping much already at this point.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0BI0y60efOWthL0njnyUD-Oa2_ijsMZko3xyjBiMN8HjQuGscx7jP9AfbHO97kowdcXmN_tJhlfYRCsQ1s3MdOUJR47233i3jZ6eauO3hqzPGjQ-JMRpE28xVfbSzowcIj4ftYR15k6ZTqL36ErUtOIK-_Vk1uSQrr5PjlSndDl8C_fDk_wpA6ABOD1Y/s320/seiyuuradio01_yasumi3.jpg width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMB32U_VJvG7dpheZt422KbN6k9eFSq9qZW1t5hcO6a-Np1Y7Uy8X9rQQpPC5XA9nb0WqaO74Gz_juJnBcASnz7kDuhxDBeRKS9Yg3OQ3MbFHHv1wAmvdLw9r1d8TT1BO1CB2knNhUE3Kfr8m_hUUmj_9yUr0FNDNRq01fR2SDdUBOB4601qSerkVJH5g/s320/seiyuuradio01_yuuhi4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption colspan=2 style=text-align:center><a href=https://jisho.org/search/omote target=_blank>ON THE SURFACE</a><br>(Heck, I'll have s*x with any of them haha)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5C6tYVUUd8pFp0CY4irTmfP2igCy_QKQ0xk1D4ml3iF7xZlTh5nydkq2ybmOoaSMS3S-2zaTDKGV2nZKilqwc_v64VSI03cr1vqEoIFoq1Nlb6sIM2YdFqUesX6SnY1rJnA4imbohI9LppZU7VoCRU6_Pc6YbAyVTrRKIHxAi6Kks3NmfEBk38q8KN3w/s320/seiyuuradio01_yumiko3.jpg width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_1tQAQMDpStF8667wQQYK1-OObSz1mV-qP0P-Xah8vdVudVb1iZ6c57XiHh0Cd9d4WGtCkauMAbXscDBmsdecTUkh2bH7Eb_0JqmY4eOKd3A5aPxIw5DOyE4sL4fgilAyyKaue6B0YWyQXU26nY539dKKQOfWI2BKMWfkZhMuJrikx0dpGMqI_BVCFAI/s320/seiyuuradio01_chika1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption colspan=2 style=text-align:center><a href=https://jisho.org/search/ura target=_blank>UNDERSIDE</a><br>(I would much prefer <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gyaru target=_blank>gal</a> to a brute emo loner which is also me IRL)<br>(Also the drawings here are OMG <span class=emoji title=🤮>*pukes*</span>)<br></table></div></div><div>P.S.

Not too surprising as I chanced upon their Wikipedia page and learnt they are under Sony already so yeah, what else is new. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What is new though are the theme songs, because in the first episode in the returning series without Kalafina making us sad lol (#KuroshitsujiSchool01), I'm just glad this series so long-running gets its own new story arcs, despite not following the naming convention of the Anime series. Yeah, it's like telling me to touch some grass after being cooped up at home for so long- Oh you can't touch those grass, the prefects will be on you. So, before we break the illusion, let's talk about what all this is. Essentially, we are following the adventures of Ciel-chan on his colourful, awe-inspiring adventures in a private all-boys school where he lives his prestige life aiming to be the best he ever was- What the heck is this? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like seriously, with all the tradition to follow, it's as if England has something wrong with them... in the 1900s. So yes, in a world where women's rights are as little as the dust after Sebastian cleaned up the dining hall in Blue House? Yeah, not too surprising, really. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> From the prefects to Ciel's buddy in school, to Aizen being school principal again (lmao hey Hayami Show it's great to see you again since <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/24833/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu target=_blank>Anime "Assassination Classroom"</a>) and whatever Sebastian is head of the Blue House now... it certainly shows how much guise you would need to take on in order to blend in to this school's premises. And now that the pretence is over, let us talk about the case in hand. For what this mystery-based series is about, this time around, the guys were basically infiltrating the school on the orders of the Queen (Victoria) RIP (who really sounded weird did they change out the voice actress?) to investigate on the disappearance of students within. Yeah, one would wonder, how would students disappear and no one in the school not know anything about it? Even sent into the Purple House where they don't look suspicious and it doesn't look like the Headmaster will throw some dudes in as punishment just because they looked the grass the wrong way? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, we have no idea what is happening even on the surface as Ciel just waltz into the Purple House's premises which is asking for death, looks like this is a lot more harder to deal with compared to the many other things this Lord-demon duo has done in the past. For now though, we know that some dude is missing, he hasn't been writing back to his family, and likely the only people who Ciel can suck up to are the prefects, so he had to start from there. What entails in front of us though? Your guess is as good as mine. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay I know the story, just vaguely. So we are the same for now. So maybe exaggerating a good job well done on the dining hall isn't as ridiculous as Sebastian made it out to be yeah, Ciel? Gotta give him credit sometimes for saving your rear. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... this is very impressive so far. For what we have known about the series and the Anime adaptation's kinda rough journey? It's so good it's no wonder it was on social media trending last night when it aired. <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span> I mean, I have my grimes about this, like how Sebastian definitely didn't look as good in drawing as everyone else and he just took so long to reply the master at the end but I guess he did eventually say the thing so whatever <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>, but overall this is quite up to the standard that even the Weston College will be proud of. I have nothing much to say besides looking forward to the story as I recall almost 7 years ago already, and since I only remember "blood transfusion" as the end goal of this story arc haha yikes indeed, we shall look forward to that from here on. I can go on to say about the animation and how the opening theme song did dip on the disappointing side a bit with the chorus, but personally I'm just happy SID is singing the ending theme song. The only relevancy in the history of this series we can still hold on to, honestly. </div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1anAOBNuIO20-Ucxs79a8fFpRdnzVrjUMYZQjKGSDzm65YahwXvjkTNTBGV-Mj8RiWBWUUeLZU-4BZ3dHK1o7f9aRdzvY0BPc2G94sJ9puqqx7sdxWkTaJrImS47-ZkeVIKQM03l0XbU9ii6ueJNq-G5gcfQ6VcF_SsT5V6zCHIF2qbLvis36xUb-UNI/s320/kuroshitsujischool01_prefects3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Which House would you be in?

The WHAT?? Haha don't know of them. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div></blockquote><div>SSGIRLS, more like SSRGIRLS- Haha I don't want to lose to them. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Now that we got the wind instruments club out of the way, let's give a hand for the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/keion target=_blank>light music</a> club!! On this new Anime series I thought of taking a listen just because I said it in the season preview (#SasaKoi01), if this has good songs I'll give it some chance, I say, even if it's about love... between girls. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I mean, what else is new with a little girlish romance here and there. Healthy relationships I hope, but most of all it's about the music. Then again though, I really wonder how far this will take us, which will explain why I haven't really gotten into this that much even at this point. Still, doesn't change the fact that the story is quite a good premise to even talk about, as new high schooler Himari got mesmerized by the band performance in her new academic residence (lol), is making quite the waves even on her childhood friend, let alone Yori-senpai which she liked... her music of. Yes, in case you didn't get it from the trailer, this is love but not quite exactly. As the people outside of the picture has described, this is basically a fan idolizing... of what exactly? All we know so far is that Yori-senpai here is more of a shy person when it comes to singing, instead more of a singing person especially in front of a crowd. I can already imagine if we can get more fans in we will have to start charging for fees for access to the roof after school, but this is all speculation we might be reaching the endgame too fast. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, we are greeted with a fantastic voice cast till date I pretty much know everyone in this episode so far, from Koga Aoi voicing the childhood friend and I can tell you she is <strike>one of</strike> my <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hitomebore target=_blank>love at first sight</a> hehe (also not true fan I took too long to figure her voice out ngl), to the band members featuring Komatsu Mikako (not sounding like the usual her but heck this is great too) and Kohara Konomi (stop giving me <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/179343/Chitose_Kaginoji target=_blank>Anime "ToniKawa" Chitose</a> vibes, thanks) and many more who have yet to appear and seeing the opening theme song animation is an original (along with everything you heard so far) with potentially another (competing?) band in place... this is amalgamating into quite the series in itself. I would say though, and especially if this blows up into whatever franchise I will hate for it to be ruined by large corporations (lol it already looks like it), I will say it first, that at least if this is what it feels like to see how well things kick off from the start despite all the other romance antics and stuff going around Yori-senpai's mind until she realized it was just fandom... maybe, just maybe, this can be the dark horse this season. Damn, this Himari has so much <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/19565/Yui_Hirasawa target=_blank>Hirasawa Yui</a> vibes I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay okay coming back to this, overall I think I might try to give this the three episode rule, if it's going in the direction I am thinking of. I mean, it doesn't have to be the next <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On target=_blank>Anime" K-ON!"</a> series, but it just has to be close. I was really expecting more than one chorus or like, song drops where emotionally appropriate, and so far it was alright it wasn't ground-breaking by any means, and that's why I've come to this conclusion, watching a couple more episodes to see how it unfolds. This will also be my first time listening to <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11787/Asami_Seto target=_blank>Seto Asami</a> (hi again <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/186362/Nano_Eiai target=_blank>from Anime "Hyakkano"</a>) singing songs so that'll be interesting if I pick this up eventually, and the voice acting for the characters are kinda off place despite being super aware of the voices behind... Yeah, I'll give this a chance. Just like how Yori-senpai will give herself a chance to make Himari-chan here fall in love with her. Not just with the music. But heck, who are we lying to? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I do hope they continue to build up on the characters and not play too much on the songs especially if they really intend to slap us with the lyrics to compliment the story that'll be much harder to grasp and more of a disappointment if expectations of these songs fail to keep up considering I watched Anime a decade and a half already, so yeah, we shall see where this takes us. I know, gotta start decorating the school roof so we can insert more fan seating. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[Oh are they really going to force me to go to music streaming services to listen to the opening theme song because they didn't post a preview on social?

(Haha yes I have an account there, same handle as Twitter/X FYI) <b><a href=https://x.com/OY_A_Official/status/1777713081885315317 target=_blank>Ogura Yui's new music video</a></b> let it be known will be my idolism crack for the season (haha) just because if you haven't seen the angel that is Yui-chan you need to stop what you are doing right now and love this woman. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> I was genuinely not impressed by <b><a href=https://x.com/_______0108/status/1779117352308949345 target=_blank>Otoha's new music video for Anime "Kuroshitsuji" series</a></b> even listening it in the show again, the verse transition to the chorus was not great, it really was a bummer considering it had a catchy chorus. <b><a href=https://x.com/neatsyui/status/1778033347203330353 target=_blank>Niitsu Yui's new music video</a></b> sadly is of the title song of her new album released on music streaming services recently which isn't great but can't be as sad as <a href=https://x.com/neatsyui/status/1778257073144496537 target=_blank>her marriage announcement</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Don't worry, I wasn't sad, <a href=https://x.com/aozakish/status/1778365822890901874 target=_blank>I wished her all happiness</a> since she isn't idol to me in the first place. Tell me when like, miwa or Tsuji Shion is married. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking of miwa-san, <b><a href=https://x.com/NexTone_Inc_DDG/status/1778018672864547197 target=_blank>TV announcer Sakuma Minami sang a song written by miwa</a></b> which should be the case it's for a TV program series and she doesn't sound like a music person I suppose which also isn't bad for what looked like a first attempt? I'm quite impressed, not gonna lie. <b><a href=https://x.com/miyustaff/status/1778075475232895197 target=_blank>Tomita Miyu's new music video</a></b> is probably my best impression of her thus far since she sang for lots of Anime just because I may never get used to any of her current styles other than her journey till her first album, so I will give this a listen when the single is out next week. <b><a href=https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1778739851254239334 target=_blank>SID's new single is announced to release end of May</a></b>, and if you are impatient the song is out on music streaming services and <a href=https://x.com/visunavi/status/1779117337855336893 target=_blank>the music video</a> is rather classic and even nostalgic, I'm so glad this is what I have asked for for years. Really, we just need the right Anime credit for it. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> I like how <b><a href=https://x.com/3_phantasia/status/1778784002503295370 target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia is recruiting ideas for the demo of their new song</a></b> like they ran out of idea which I assume is for the melody because damn I don't know where Mia-san and her creativity work is going right now anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> Interestingly in a livestream this week, <b><a href=https://x.com/sphere_PS/status/1778986465244188884 target=_blank>Takagaki Ayahi and Toyosaki Aki announced a new song releasing next week</a></b>, which is quite interesting as we might even see more of MusicRay'n first generation members get their own collaboration songs and such in the future? That'll be an interesting change in pace compared to their solo music careers. <b><a href=https://x.com/POLKA_fukuoka/status/1779464707558240465 target=_blank>Polkadot Singray's new song is also releasing next week</a></b> (how many of them for next week are there?) which is for an Anime series on YouTube?
