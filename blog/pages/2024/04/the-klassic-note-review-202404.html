Ah hey, what can I say, I have not been generous but then again the good releases have been appearing, so screw RyokuShaka and Creepy Nuts for not making it into the shelf (lol), and let's talk about some veteran who really deserves some talking about like, years in! It's such a wild turn, I'm pretty sure I was still rejecting her a month ago haha</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=miwaSoredemoTada><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span class=head-title>The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>miwa - Soredemo Tada [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=3 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=800 data-original-width=596 height=320 src=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/adm_image/common/artist_image/70005000/70005933/jacket_image/306197__800_800_0.jpg width=238><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=706 data-original-width=712 height=320 src=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/adm_image/common/artist_image/70005000/70005933/jacket_image/306198__800_800_0.jpg width=322><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table><div>(Eh, no images of her on the cover but rather adequate as you will listen from the music this time around, I suppose)</div><div><br></div><div>Origin: You and I should not be unfamiliar with miwa, the singer-songwriter who made waves a decade ago, as a rising new star. So many years later and I dare myself to say this, that she is still impressive among all the other active artists who have had such a long run, did not even keep up with the times and/or I just lost touch with them. Not for her though, she has been great even these past few years. The new single came in as a mention for a drama theme song, an emotional tune, but it quickly made waves due to both the popularity of the credit and the artist, which I must say did catch my attention even more as I gave this the formal review. Maybe we talk about what is in this that got me.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(1) Soredemo Tada [Still, Just(...)]</div><div>From last chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>Still, just being so loved</div><div style=text-align:center>Just being so loved</div><div style=text-align:center>Even for a second longer (I) want to laugh together</div><div style=text-align:center>Still, just (wanting) to convey</div><div style=text-align:center>Just (wanting) to convey</div><div style=text-align:center>Those feelings are no long enough to express</div><div style=text-align:center>Ah (those) thoughts are overflowing</div></blockquote><div></div><div>The title clearly references an incomplete sentence, but you won't have too far to seek if you listen. If I am not wrong, the drama references a lot about love, in passion and in cooking, and I don't think the lyrics were that far off. Jointly presented by a music composer and miwa-san herself, this song is an emotional tune to make sure the drama is a tearjerker. The melody is rather simple and I would argue a very short chorus till date until you get to the end where the focus would be on, and I really appreciate a simple melody is what this is all about. Emotional is still an underestimate of what this aims to portray, as the lyrics talk about being together, the unexplainable feelings that just can't be expressed... that just is love, isn't it?</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ie7A6wGzLPE?si=NOQeDDNlmMaD9SH8" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Lovingly Average</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Mahalo [Thank You]</div><div>From first chorus (from Hawaiian, where applicable):</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>Thank You, Thank You, Thank You</div><div style=text-align:center>Blooming smiles (all over), (biding) goodbye</div><div style=text-align:center>Thank You, Thank You, Thank You</div><div style=text-align:center>Everybody let's all flee together</div></blockquote><div>Accompanying an emotional song comes in a light-hearted, happy song, no surprises there. What is surprising is how this all came around, as I did not prefer the Hawaiian themed melody and music production here. Nonetheless, I did give it a second chance, and I think light-hearted is the easiest description I can give for what is the carefree miwa-san and her mind when she wrote this song. There isn't much to look at in the lyrics apart from her describing the weather and things to do there in the tropical island far away, and it really feels more tribal and celebratory of a song than just a happy song, in my opinion. Maybe adding in her cute singing did help in making this a joy to listen.</div><div>Rating: Joyfully Average</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: This is a very average, off the mill single. And I think that is a good thing. For starters, the melodies are simple even to the point of plain, yet powerful in itself. Going through this again formally, I have never doubted on how great an overall package this sounds, and I think that is what's important these days. Cut the flair, and bring in the emotions like we wanted, even in the change of era and time. With this, I present to you possibly one of the most emotive singles for the year.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3072 data-original-width=4080 height=241 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDwINBklMLfciTsqe9WL9gc3Is3n_Xmxq3F0mnIxiQfgjxh_NZdRE7t6oAVfFFkGv9OTHhpdYgNy_SgKUTe61tscUg7jgEs_AI0V8K8wBbg02mKloIoo4jsqqWdbyHG-382TqD3ZKtBmEv0W4qH-yUTiOzCZfct7AkoGppImlBHHMZuPjJX4ZdJ0idnc8/s320/PXL_20240411_073828586.jpg width=320></div><div>Well, there really isn't much going on with this release, package wise. I assume with miwa's own handwriting (and drawings?) she should have done us a wonder by showing how childish she is (lmao), but of course, I did choose the special gift that came with it. Instead of going for the free (local) shipping option through Amazon Japan which will give us another one of these coveted covers (haha), I ended up going for minimal local shipping through TOWER RECORDS which, like CDJapan which I did think of doing international shipping only to realize it'll burn through my money like water, will feature a live photo of miwa-san. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well, as you can see, I might have missed it, and yeah, this online store here won't inform us if they ran out of stock for those. Welp, I can't get anything else, I guess. Not even the handwritten lyrics by miwa-san, by the way; The title text you see on the cover and in the booklet are  totally different, as the character "so" was written differently. Haha why though</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3072 data-original-width=4080 height=241 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCBYmf3fVUItlIWPStuG_ljrNwmx1ZxqLMxdg41wadQoIAogXJ3Rx8UVyijo6gNF1aDjhVKiAQHz6EGHBFXvqbA9-MFUKiXc_v094d7pmbI0PIbxmWibRXsuHX9Ty269fgBQs9a88_F2gduocomZkbHCDjjgaDyabTaslEFL_0Lh8RfVKPKx41Mi6vL6Q/s320/PXL_20240411_114215995.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't want to mark out this embarrassment lol, but notice the first character on the large title, and first track.
