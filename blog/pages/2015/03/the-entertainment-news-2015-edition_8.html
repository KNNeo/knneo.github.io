<p>Hello. Iâ€™m bored, but schoolâ€™s near, soâ€¦ I have to suck it up, do I? I know. Fun things next week, and more next month, but exams are nearer. I have to suck it up, right? *sighs*</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><strong>KimiUso:</strong> I know. Iâ€™m feeling sad right now. This is the time where we start crying over Kaori-chanâ€¦ ok maybe not. As things are turning for the worse, letâ€™s wish Kaori-chan the best of recovery, and hopefully Kousei canâ€¦ sort his relations out. Really feels like Toradora! again, in my opinion. Just, thereâ€™s a less assertive Kushieda-san. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br><strong>Assassins:</strong> Their field trip continues and ends in this episode, and Koro-sensei must be the one who is enjoying himself the most. Poking into private group conversations, playing around in the trip and chatting with potential-now-diminished assassins who are after himâ€¦ he really is the happiest being right now. Hope he doesnâ€™t die. But then that means it needs a different conclusion? Well the original story hasnâ€™t ended yet so we donâ€™t knowâ€¦<br><strong>Koufuku Graffiti:</strong> Really as always, one is not recommended to watch this on an empty stomach. Even watching this after lunch today is such a pain, as we see Kirin enjoy new year food with Ryou. Personally loved the Shiina-talks-to-your-ear part. I wished Mikakoshi would do that to me. Problem maybe I may not understand what she is saying, whether itâ€™s Japanese or her English. Oops. Anyways, nice episode, and much of cooking knowledge to me. Definitely coming to an end soon, but Iâ€™m enjoying this show the most this season, apparently.</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><strong>BLEACH:</strong> Aizen knows that Soul Society is preventing him from escaping even if he can kill Kyoraku on the spot, but then thatâ€™s not the point. Given the circumstances, will Aizen make the decision to help save the world? Will the unlikely hero help to eliminate the new villain? I guess weâ€™ll just have to watch to find out. It really is getting more exciting by the chapterâ€¦<br><strong>A Channel:</strong> Plenty of Yutaka and Miho fanservice (just look at the first colour page), and Tooru getting in the way, apparently. They sit down to show how bad their cooking is, and Tooru exceeds beyond the both of them. Wow Tooru is one good kid. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span></p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well, the main focus for this week is not much, but we can talk about it. <strong>negotoâ€™s album</strong> isâ€¦ pretty much like the previous one, where I only take one song, soâ€¦ kind of aligns with my impression of their style anyway. Somewhat being kind to their electronic pop style already, so giving one song may be the most I can give. And more interestingly, itâ€™s not a topic song nor a song from any unheard single. Oh well. <strong>Chatmonchyâ€™s single</strong> isnâ€™t very impressionable too, as I give the second A-side a miss, so that changes the story completely of me wanting to get it on my shelf already. Overall, quite a dull week, but it can get worse. Next week there are no reviews of artists I know, soâ€¦ I may have to find new songs. Started from <strong>indie artists</strong> I know from Audioleaf and it has not been fruitful.</p> <p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>Indie artists overview: MINAMI NiNE summer song got heavy halfway through the video. room free fall new song sounds interesting. Superstar!</p>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/574062719491403777" target="_blank">March 7, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-cards="hidden"> <p>Indies (cont'd): tic tac case disbanding next week, so...

Or maybe not. On other news,<strong> last monthâ€™s amount of songs</strong> align with last year of the same period. Wow why do I sound like a statisticianâ€¦ Not like I have the passion for it though, REAL data can be a b*tchâ€¦</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I guess thatâ€™s all then. Another week has passed, and so is my lifetime of studying. Better treasure it before it goes away, although for me itâ€™ll only just get worse until the time comes closer. Hope I donâ€™t get distracted by Cities: Skylines next week and GTA V for PC next month, and I can finish watching my video lectures. Haha. Cya guys next week then, and until next time I have enjoyed my short break. Back to studying, I guess.</p> <p>[P.S.: Omachikane- Whatever. Just take it all in.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10850253_10153156090637460_4096091259150467258_n.jpg?oh=1050a109d3fade37a6fce2da95b5a59b&amp;oe=557084CF&amp;__gda__=1438416554_fdc6de63175d235e4946e0e41adf2340" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11034313_10153159826477460_2326177249649678118_n.jpg?oh=665fb012e0289683e7da34fdc8b23715&amp;oe=558E4965&amp;__gda__=1434818074_130f05f061f9d68730fc3e61f6b63360" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10929161_10153161667472460_327220620926256057_n.jpg?oh=152b64bd2a588f1bf276555920f2cfbe&amp;oe=558C4758" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10353033_10153163941932460_912955950931222359_n.jpg?oh=8a2f9f5df71ed39e5548609cf5e1632d&amp;oe=55BDAC67&amp;__gda__=1438471512_838f9ca3e707e734de79ecbe65312511" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/11046840_10153166238917460_6403279341621938694_n.jpg?oh=aff1a2061003f9d55a297979a02d42c1&amp;oe=5587D572&amp;__gda__=1433579303_0dfb96e67c9721655a0b2b2528ed1849" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11034188_10153169074232460_1267245887372333625_n.jpg?oh=7683e27d7d8e1aadd87c89844aacd7f6&amp;oe=557E3FDC" width="135" height="240"></p> <p>So sorry for the scan quality, the first two ones. (Yes I scanned them myself from sphereâ€™s best album) Maybe I need to pay people to do this for me. Or I should take a lesson on it.
