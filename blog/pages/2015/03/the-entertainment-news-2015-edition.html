Hi guys. * yawn* Oh well, let’s get started; I got tired for today for some reason.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><strong>KimiUso:</strong> It has ended, and unfortunately so is Kaori-chan. Cross-checking with the manga it somehow is abrupt in the end, as in people aren’t applauding for the performance and things aren't obvious to her being dead. Nonetheless, now we know what the meaning of the manga title is (that I’m after your friend but I actually want to be with you), and it all ends well, despite the sad ending.<br /><strong>Assassination Tentacles: </strong>Yeah looks like Koro-sensei’s brother came by, which makes him a later man-made being after the teacher, comes in to challenge him to a fight so unlike an assassination supervised by a guardian who should be the MVP for this episode, haha. Anyways, now we know a little more about Koro-sensei (or the fact that he is embarrassed after a serious situation LOL), and we’re halfway through, I guess I can look forward to a decent ending. Sadly it may not be conclusive as the manga hasn’t ended yet, so… oh well.<br /><strong>Koufuku Graffiti:</strong> Also last episode, and what a nice ending. The girls graduate, Kirin moves over to stay with Ryou for real, and the rest of the cast come in to help move the stuff. Perhaps the best lesson to learn from her is that happiness and presence of people makes your own cooked food nicer. Good for Ryou, as she at least found back her happiness ever since her grandmother’s passing. This should’ve been the best show I’ve watched in a while, right?<br />On other news, the soundtrack is awesome. Especially the one that is in the YouTube videos of Ookame Asuka (Kirin’s seiyuu) failing in cooking. The vocals are done by the composer herself, kotringo, and I probably will dig into her own solo music career too. I shall see about that.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><strong>BLEACH: </strong>Oh yeah Aizen came into the fight. Meaning he can just walk around tied up on a chair just using reiatsu to kill bad guys. Oh well that is so Aizen level powers already, but that kind of shows more about what this story’s development will depend on him. So… we shall see. It’s getting exciting for a while already.<br /><strong>Evergreen:</strong> Well the truth is clarified, but then that also means both parties are suffering, isn’t it? Problem is it may not be just their own business because I concerns TWO FAMILIES. Now we’re talking. Somehow this may turn back very quickly, and I don’t feel like looking forward to it. Oh well, bad stuff must pass, yes?<br /><strong>Tonari no Kashiwagi-san:</strong> After a long time not scanning for translation, I finally get to read another chapter. Apparently Kazuki seems to be in a problem, and no one knows about it. Kashiwagi-san is worried and so should Yuuto. And even Sayaka-chan is getting onto him, so… yes, talk to your friend, bro. In other news, I liked the lovey-dovey scenes. Kazuki is so bold…<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-8R-gtHiVUds/VRfpL5zX6eI/AAAAAAAAMB8/5vbwliGADB4/kashiwagisan65_19-20%25255B6%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="480" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="380" /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Not much this week, so… I’ll leave this section empty. Also for next week. I’m getting lazy already, huh. Well with respect to the one above, I’ll look into the girl who did Koufuku Graffiti soundtrack next week I guess, and <strong>cinema staff finally got their MV out</strong> on YouTube, and… it’s nostalgic. Very their style. Probably not as good as their previous one. But I’ll still give a listen anyway. It’s just… one month way.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en">3rd album in, and cinema staff still standing strong. Maybe not the hardcore rock style, but man the melody is great. <a href="http://t.co/Q2u8YurPRG" target="_blank">http://t.co/Q2u8YurPRG</a><br />— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/581118006903754752" target="_blank">March 26, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> In other news, Mina-chan’s music video is going to look AWESOME!!! Now if I could even get my hands on Tomacchan’s music video from last week first…<br /> <div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tg99NvfxugM?rel=0" ></iframe></div><br /> <br /> Well that’s all then. See you guys next week, as I continue to sort out the many information that is in APoL. Or even take charge of my education. Or both. We shall see. Goodbye. *yawn*<br /> [P.S.: Yes more seiyuu porn! Not like them naked, but… well they don’t have to be anyway. xD<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10982359_10153207133652460_3106610258363334193_n.jpg?oh=a584985c06385445e3c294154fff4b8f&amp;oe=57A34839" width="112" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10152491_10153209388332460_9162937686788340211_n.jpg?oh=a9ee39c993cb667df2fbd2b4608a8b9e&amp;oe=579EC45B" width="112" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xlt1/v/t1.0-9/11083661_10153213713252460_4355503261200420027_n.jpg?oh=f18e13e884740aca44a8c866793c0297&amp;oe=579EB4C3" width="112" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/11081397_10153215872467460_1238959722084127386_n.jpg?oh=4f7e75f642ab89b019d2f4b1b4ef8937&amp;oe=57BD4CD7" width="112" /><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/11071527_10153218328647460_2389524785072570319_n.jpg?oh=15f3eaf78c760f1396b8d36dd3773b0e&amp;oe=57BA639B" width="112" /><br />Ten-chan’s great. In other news, Kana-chan finally got her Twitter account. STAFF account, I mean. Well, better than nothing.]<br />  <hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Entertainment News</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
