<h2 class="title">The Entertainment News 2015 Edition Week #3</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
<p>Hey everyone‚Ä¶ Been not well recently, but all is well in this segment of my life. So let's carry on, shall we?</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><strong>KimiUso:</strong> Well Kousei does his solo, and to the end of the episode we finally have an answer to Kaori-chan, who is in the hospital. Well that may sound anticlimactic from the point we see the cliffhanger from last week, but hey, glad she‚Äôs fine and not like, betray him for any other reason. The mother‚Äôs friend is still feeling bad for some reason (and I think she should), and the elementary school champion is being such a snob. Haha, just saying.<br><strong>Koufuku Graffiiti:</strong> Going to be called ‚Äú<a href="http://randomc.net/2015/01/16/koufuku-graffiti-02/" target="_blank">Yuri</a> Graffiti‚Äù soon for some reason by me, as we see plenty of body contact between the girls, more like, an old girl to the young one. Akira makes her appearance to join the girls in a picnic, coincidentally meeting with the third main girl in the show, Shiina. Funny she draws random people at her spare time and is actually quite a good friend of Ryou in school and we know so little of her up till now‚Ä¶ Yeah you get what I mean. If I don‚Äôt mind the body contact, I guess‚Ä¶ I can still watch this? Food-gasm is rather never-ending though, even for the working lady‚Ä¶<br><strong>Assassination Classroom: </strong>Still talking about the fundamentals and generic viewpoint of the class in a prestigious school (I recognise the principal‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶), Koro-sensei plays around with his assassination hunters and reveals a little more about himself to the class. Not much yet though, but of course if I‚Äôm expecting an ending now I might as well go read the book. Anyways, nice comedy now and then, and less serious (just a little) than last episode, and definitely still worth watching. I mean, guns aren‚Äôt the only thing in this show, right? I wonder what‚Äôs next. RPGs?</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>Êº´Áîª</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>I don‚Äôt know why, but <strong>no BLEACH for two weeks</strong> seems to make me miss it already. Great. Keep it going, I guess?</p> <p>SHOWS<br><strong>MythBusters </strong>had another nice episode again, this time starring the infamous adventurer Indiana Jones, or Indiana Savage in this case as Adam shows us how to make a whip and create a temple scene in miniature. Well, felt that content may be lacking, but I guess I should get used to it, huh. Just want more to feed my interest, and probably some interest for the study ahead of me. In university.</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>As I mentioned, it has been a dull week, and yeah, it happens to Klassic Note too, apparently. Like, my mood greatly affects me finding new songs for the year anyway. Well, it‚Äôs been a rough start since the start of the year anyway, for I lack desire for new songs. I guess it‚Äôll take some time. Even<strong> miwa‚Äôs single</strong> this week isn‚Äôt for my review. I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm also missing bands like QUATTRO and VELTPUNCH already‚Ä¶</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I guess this week has been short, or maybe not, whatever. Anyways, a long way ahead of us this year, and I should probably get to finding new songs and doing my new assignments already, so if you would excuse me. Cya guys next time, and until then‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll have an early night. *snores* (Audience: WTF?)</p> <p>[P.S.: Mostly Kayanon again. I‚Äôm not complaining. I probably won‚Äôt see another photobook from her soon. Well if Kana-chan‚Äôs one would come by or Mikakoshi‚Äôs scheduled in March, then I‚Äôll see. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span></p> <p><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/1510350_10153045356532460_3822007602306861077_n.jpg?oh=c84417f80197b9e315354eb45d6b9102&amp;oe=5565A3A0&amp;__gda__=1432320202_39d340e3aefc8cd0988a47cc30894b44" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10906518_10153047628542460_5183071961984414867_n.jpg?oh=f44421373eb4467e60be372ffad47f18&amp;oe=5569A347&amp;__gda__=1428348178_0547b680a44da214b519643e88ffad78" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10906055_10153050576577460_5303330482435414335_n.jpg?oh=240803856fcee8f13fcd77ac556876ea&amp;oe=5535ED7B&amp;__gda__=1429185838_8f4d6a9651967c406b986a2cdab1b76e" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://scontent-a-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10922689_10153053601897460_5674584808053465378_n.jpg?oh=c52e30bc4362c5e28bc46e7b245064a9&amp;oe=55220658" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10917843_10153058376957460_4719855526882822084_n.jpg?oh=b6c142db6eda3b19cc08d6e72354f9b8&amp;oe=55260857&amp;__gda__=1429477562_d30fbed875c7d12f3e6bf3d2de8fe7ae" width="135" height="240"></p> <p>Looks like I might want to limit the amount of fetish I receive (in the form of homescreen wallpapers) every week, huh.]</p>  <hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
