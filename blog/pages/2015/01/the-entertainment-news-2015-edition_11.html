<h2 class="title">The Entertainment News 2015 Edition Week #2</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
<p>Hey guys, welcome back to this weekly post. Yeah makes you wonder what happens if I don‚Äôt do this post every week, huh.</p> <p>Anyways, I‚Äôm not feeling well recently, I‚Äôve watched an awesome new season of MythBusters, and school is starting tomorrow, so‚Ä¶&nbsp; let‚Äôs get this weird feeling done and over with.</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><strong>KimiUso:</strong> Yep this will be the first Anime of the new season now, in contrast to being the last viewed the previous season. The story continues where Kaori and Kousei prepare for the Gaia performance which does not involve judging but somehow the judges are there, don‚Äôt ask me why. Anyways, Kaori misses in action and Kousei intends to do a solo performance? Well well, I swear no one paid to watch a piano performance‚Ä¶ unlike that elementary school brat that got the mother‚Äôs friend worked up. Haha, oh well.<br><strong>Koufuku Graffiti:</strong> As mentioned this will be one of the two I‚Äôll be watching this season, and yeah apparently I see no reason to reject them at all. We start with this show talking lesser of food that its brand suggests but more on its effects on happiness. With this, it‚Äôll make a huge difference to many other cooking-related Anime out there (I know about Shougeki no Souma, I know. I just don‚Äôt watch/read it), and I think I can watch this. Some cousin comes to stay with a loner who just lost her grandma a year ago, and is unsatisfied with her cooking mainly, as hinted by the guest, that she doesn‚Äôt have anyone to eat with. We‚Äôll be seeing more food porn, food-gasm (eating of the food) and plenty of cute girls in the future episodes, and yeah Mikakoshi‚Äôs role Shiina hasn‚Äôt made her appearance apart from a mere few seconds. Nice show I probably will have the mood to watch every week.<br><strong>Ansatsu Kyoushitsu:</strong> I know years ago I definitely have seen or even heard of this show and its OVA years ago, but only has now got around to it. Its unique circumstances make of a strange yet strong premise for an action and assassination Anime. The cast has changed ever since the OVA, but seeing both versions I see why production made the transition. Everything else is pretty damn good on first impression, from first explaining the background, that main guy student with a seemingly girly appearance (maybe it‚Äôs just me) to the teacher travelling up to Mach 20 in order to spend the lunch break in China. Seriously. Anyways, nice show to watch, it‚Äôs 2-cour (ie. until July) like KimiUso and I think I can watch a couple more episodes. Or even more.</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>Êº´Áîª</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>Well I think I watched quite a few, but no BLEACH though. Meh.<br><strong>Isshuukan Friends.:</strong> Well the trip is over, and Hase-kun seriously is worried. Very seriously worried. Of course he questions his relations with Fujimiya-san at almost every point ever since that Hajime came by, and it‚Äôs about time he thought about it seriously.</p> <p><span title="*silence*">üòê</span></p> <p>You know how desperate I want to see this turn into a romance story once Hase-kun decides to date the girl? Really, just saying.<br><strong>Seitokai Yakuindomo:</strong> I missed the Christmas special by the scanlators, and I‚Äôve caught up to it. Much are already in the second season of Anime, but many are still funny to laugh at. Really, I wonder when the author wants to stop this story. I guess not anytime soon? Good. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span></p> <p>SHOWS<br><strong>MythBusters:</strong> Hell yeah. Been a while since I ever got this excited as the date draws near and as I watched it just now. With this new season they focus more on the process which they do at the start of this whole series, and bought a bunch of cinematic cameras to make them (and the show) look fascinating in the process. .I guess that‚Äôs good, but what‚Äôs important is new myths. The Simpsons myths may vary from stupid to ridiculous, but still great to watch the guys do the work. The premise looks fresher than any other season premier I‚Äôve gone through with them, and the new episodes will continue to look better. Really, like Indiana Jones and Transformers will be interesting to watch.</p> <p>Also, whoever b**ched about that they shouldn‚Äôt do The Simpsons should recall the comedy show myths they‚Äôve done (gunpower chasing to its barrel) and that 80% of Hollywood is unrealistic. Well, *quote from Jamie* I‚Äôm just saying.</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well this year‚Äôs gone to a slow start <strong>as I bring down my mood to listen to new songs, </strong>and maybe because of this my style of listening and reviewing may change this year, considering the huge competition from the sheer amount of songs last year. Nonetheless, I supposedly am starting the new year with five songs which I vaguely recall maybe lesser than last year‚Äôs, but things will pick up soon anyway, isn‚Äôt it? I anticipate that in time to come.</p> <p>Talk about new songs this week, I reviewed an album and a single. <strong>Hocchan‚Äôs new album</strong> is nothing but foreign to me the first time I touched it or actually reviewed one, and I tried my best to give at least one song already by the time this is out. (I now know where all the sh**ty songs go to liao) <strong>ClariS new single</strong> is nothing but standard with respect to their previous singles where I probably won‚Äôt take the B-sides (I guess it needs an overpowering reason to do so huh), and I‚Äôm still trying to get used to the new duo, now that the two literally sound like one. (I swear I‚Äôll be out once Clara gets replaced) Also coming up is their first best single with the obvious point stated in the title (which means the previous bracket might just happen), and we shall see if I can even get it on my shelf. Also under review recently are <strong>yucat‚Äôs 3rd album</strong> from like months ago, and I decided to give chance (I know, it was hard considering the previous paragraph) to two songs to start the hype for the year, and <strong>KANA-BOON‚Äôs theme song with Anime Naruto</strong> because I watched them perform in a live performance video over the new year and that-</p> <p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>I gave a theme song last year. This will definitely be the second and last Naruto theme song I'll give. Listening to KANA-BOON - Silhouette</p>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/552495008809746432" target="_blank">January 6, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>(As always, go to <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote" target="_blank">my Twitter page</a> for more insider and possibly <strike>offensive</strike> honest opinions of my list of music. And probably upcoming songs I will/might/might not be giving.)</p> <p>Also, before I forget about theme songs for this season‚Äôs Anime‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs kind of a hit-and-many-misses‚Ä¶</p> <p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>Well watched two new Anime and the stories are very promising. Not so much to say for their theme songs. Other than the one I mentioned.</p>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/553949038450454528" target="_blank">January 10, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>I think I'm on to a good start this year. First single of the year. That is scheduled to be on my shelf? <a href="http://t.co/GHs5ybJO3p" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/GHs5ybJO3p</a></p>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/553728563094904832" target="_blank">January 10, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>That‚Äôs all, folks. My headache is giving me problems to type more already. Seriously, I can type more. And also I have to prepare for lessons tomorrow, so if you would excuse me. With this much happening above me, I guess I‚Äôm braced for the things in the new year, yes?</p> <p>[P.S.: I hope so‚Ä¶ Also, don‚Äôt ask about APoL. I just am not in the mood to finalise my unsatisfactory work.]</p> <p>[P.P.S.: On a higher note, Kayanon is enjoying being on my phone? I guess‚Ä¶ not?</p> <p><img loading="lazy"  alt="" src="https://scontent-a-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10922775_10153027333392460_5448844113141250649_n.jpg?oh=846e7058d08cbcd20465e5b6a9f929d3&amp;oe=552E9067" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy"  alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10906392_10153029812132460_4535814461867133929_n.jpg?oh=ad3c2f57d0126a3bc9e491e9a0ed8c4c&amp;oe=553660F2&amp;__gda__=1429158311_3b20308c2e199094237fc76793d5998a" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy"  alt="" src="https://scontent-b-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10612751_10153032021802460_4108456216033220821_n.jpg?oh=f2bcf31efa3ee20e13331696c059d9ca&amp;oe=55237E82" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy"  alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10806388_10153034970717460_7071546691816385488_n.jpg?oh=49831e0016b7aac28797b9435ed84b75&amp;oe=553C8253&amp;__gda__=1433231148_001484eaffb482ed4deda6eb82a4ccc8" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy"  alt="" src="https://scontent-a-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10896894_10153039163817460_989777023636082368_n.jpg?oh=0df462cc4f208a0240c59d236ca1b501&amp;oe=5525B57B" width="135" height="240"><img loading="lazy"  alt="" src="https://scontent-b-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10906305_10153041932672460_5760226992508989668_n.jpg?oh=ab334a084a2bc4b73bceb3e8eac5080b&amp;oe=552CF39F" width="135" height="240">(Don‚Äôt ask me why)</p> <p>More to come, especially when I heard about Mikakoshi is also having a new photobook.
