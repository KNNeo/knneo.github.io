<h2 class="title">The Cost-Effective Plan Part 2: Where Digital Isn't Everything</h2>
<div id="hashtags"></div>
<div class="header"></div>
Yes, it isn't everything.<br /><br />I would like you guys to refer to a post I made over a year and a half ago, <a href="http://knwebreports2012.blogspot.com/2014/01/sunday-night-report-cost-effective-plan.html" target="_blank">over at my previous blog.</a>&nbsp;(Please remember to come back after you're done with reading over there) I did mention that only buying CDs of complete collections would be cost-effective for Klassic Note for now than just getting every single song digitally online, ie.<b> legally purchasing all songs </b>instead of <b>directly purchasing some of the many songs</b> I listen over these 8 or so years.<br /><br />Now there is more reason to choose the latter over the former, meaning I'm better off with CDs. Because...<br /><br />DIGITAL DOWNLOADING IS BIG<br />Because it's <b>troublesome</b>. It takes a lot to get songs nowadays. Even music streaming becomes a better option today, and digital downloads is becoming weak. Even Apple has acknowledged that digital streaming is everything now. (Go Google it, I did not say that) But that is not all. It takes a lot to download all the songs I have today. Not that it is about 1300+ songs now, but that it's not as easy as buying CDs for all of the songs, where even more will not be included in the list. So let's talk about the process for the digital option.<br /><br />Firstly, I don't live in Japan. Meaning getting most of the songs will be a problem. It is very true, for I entered my country's local iTunes store (if you don't know where I live it's not my problem) and... it was quite disappointing. Even Ikimonogakari's newest single is nowhere to be found, with only albums in the rack. However it is possible to purchase from iTunes in Japan. Today there are websites that specialise in selling codes for <b>iTunes Japan</b> gift cards, which can then be used to download songs from iTunes Japan using a new account created in their servers, therefore splitting the accounts for me to keep everything in one place. Troublesome, isn't it? But then if I'm an enthusiast of music ("Klassic Note"), this shouldn't be a problem, yes? No, there's more. Remember that every few times in a year I go to indie websites like Audioleaf to get new songs from artists that haven't even released a proper single online? (Really, some only release live exclusive CDs) These <b>indie Japanese songs</b> are not available in iTunes. And that is not all.<br /><br />Then there's the <b>English songs</b>. Good thing most of them can be found in iTunes too, within iTunes Japan too, which is fine, but some are not available, so that will be a problem. And then there's the <b>Chinese songs</b>. This is very big of a problem, as searching using an iTunes client and checking most of the Chinese songs I have, some of them are not even available in iTunes Taiwan, where they originate from. Because Taiwan, like Japan, have their own place for digital downloads. For example, Japan has Rechoku and mora, and Taiwan has KKBOX and many more. For that, it already seems obvious things aren't as unified as in the US, where most if not all songs (even indies I believe) are available in one of the biggest platforms of all, iTunes USA. As with most problems, the indie songs are a real big problem. I want to support them but they aren't associated with a larger music download service.<br /><br />And then there is <b>sync problems</b>. Although they have everything tagged in the AAC songs that can be downloaded for safe-keeping, you guys should know I do not own any Apple products. (Probably with this I just may, but for now, no) Which means it'll be hard to take the songs I have downloaded to the devices I want, and to play it seamlessly on my... which music player are we talking about again? (iTunes, KKBOX has its own player...) <b>Playback compatibility</b> can also become an issue, if you know audio encoding to a certain extent you'll know this will be a b*tch. The fact that I'm keeping all my tracks at a pathetic 128kbps MP3 is to cover the fact that some songs do not come at the best of quality, ever since I started listening.<br /><br />BUYING CD IS THE WAY (FOR ALL MY SONGS)<br />Then maybe directly supporting the artists may be a better option. Not only I don't have to go through the many middlemen in the process, <b>I can also choose where to buy</b>, thus deciding on the best option available for delivery, considering that it takes a lot to bring them to me anyway. (Of course there's also pre-order gifts too, but that's secondary) Furthermore, <b>I get a chance to brainwash myself</b> with more songs. This is a clear example, especially where buying releases means (especially albums) is to give a chance for the whole package, meaning all of the songs have to count. From Neat's last year to Tainaka Sachi recently, they all have shown to exhibit a certain style for the whole album of songs, meaning accepting all their compositions may just become easier. Even more, artists like Murder by Death use crowd-funding methods like Kickstarter so they truly know who their fans are, though it's not really me. But then, what would I do if I get a disc that I don't totally like? Back then when I was sitting on other people's cars, listening to them having original discs playing the whole album without any comments, without any opinion of the songs they listen. And we all know that is so unlike me, <b>so unlike Klassic Note</b>. Isn't recognising the music the whole point of appreciation? Not just listening to songs as they come in order? Furthermore, in Japan they like to take <b>albums as a form of compilation</b> (from Anime song singles) instead a form of exhibition of style.Should I then allow myself to succumb to such ambiguity and give songs due to the fact that I spent money on the bigger release? Maybe not. That is why I thought of digital downloads. But even then isn't the best option.<br /><br />MUSIC STREAMING?<br />Then what about music streaming? At the start of this post I did mention about iTunes, and even Apple Music, that streaming service that aims to fight against the likes of Spotify and SoundHound, experienced companies in the field who<b> buy music from the originals to play them for the masses, without having the need to buy and download them</b>. That, is music streaming. If you know one of the names above, you're like in one of them, listening with a signed account, FOR FREE. (I can feel whoever who has read till here is getting a shock of his/her life now) (Surely you should feel the remorse now) Of course it comes with advertisements, but is this the best option for supporting the artists? Even with subscription services that allow you to play without ads and also contribute a bit to the journey to the source, do you think this is legit? I do know the things behind this. It's like going to a shop, giving the money for someone to buy the item while he only gives part of the money you give to the cashier. Seriously. Anyways, I think it's real bad, and you're better off leeching the Internet for songs.<br /><br />So in the end it still boils down to <b>whether I have the money or not</b>. I can like many artists, but I can only support that many. That is also the reason why I set requirements in Klassic Note before I click the order button for the discs, isn't it? So for my circumstances for now, I think this is the best option after all. I shall continue to observe the industry for a better option, but it looks like I don't have a better choice but to... still illegally yet partial legally support them in the most balanced way possible. Please, if you're richer, don't be like me. Also, don't be like everyone else who don't know they maybe committing a bigger crime just to listen to their favourite tunes. It's serious.<br /><br />[P.S.: Not because I'm bored waiting for my two latest orders, but then I really took some time for research. And this isn't the best of what I expected from back then. Things certainly are different, and I'm looking for an option. Even if it means holding more accounts and compiling my stuff from a dozen of sources.]<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
