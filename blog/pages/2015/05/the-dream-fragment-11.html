<p dir="ltr"><u>I</u> feel reluctant to write this down, mainly because I don't remember much, and man there's plenty of content. As you know my tiny brain memory cannot handle this much, even if it's a vivid dream, so I'll cut it in perspective. I'll surround it on one location and talk from there, yes?</p><p dir="ltr">THE HOSPITAL<br>Don't take the word for itself. Imagine that, but a run down one, like those with tall walls and only one floor, with long hallways leading to very small rooms and departments, akin to a clinic in scale.</p><p dir="ltr">THE SHOOTOUT<br>Probably the only thing I remembered from is when I was in a shootout with a bunch of friends (I know it's not the military because I'm holding a pistol) and we're clearing the opponent waves up from one direction. (I know a band called One Direction lol nothing to do with this dream) And in one round they decided not to fire, so I was just blindly firing and missed almost every bullet. I then stopped to see the enemy taking weapons from our side from my teammates and walking away with it, with no resistance from my friends too.</p><p dir="ltr">I mean, can he just get it away like that?</p><p dir="ltr">So this links to the visit to that hospital. One of them was seriously injured so we brought him her for surgery.</p><p dir="ltr">THE FISHBONE<br>Because it was in a primary role instead of a secondary one. I don't remember the beginning already, but suffice it to say my sis and I are choked from fish bones, and I think my sis died from it? (Touch wood) I brought a part of her (somehow she split herself into pieces lol) in a tin box to see one of the nurses and asked "Is it possible to retrieve something from a dead body? Like, the body is still intact."</p><p dir="ltr">The nurse gave me the disgusted face and replied me kindly, "No, and there is no point to do it anymore."</p><p dir="ltr">The doctor nearby noded in agreement and I walked away. As I walk out through the long hallways I threw the box away (sorry sis) and sputter the last fish bone from my throat before I left the facility. As I smile in joy of myself liberated from the choking, I sang myself a song. It was "Shadow" by cinema staff. You can listen to them online here.<br>&lt;insert embed video here&gt;<br>(if you see this come back later)</p><p dir="ltr">I guess that's all I remember. If it's weird to you it's even more to me when I woke up with such timing, synced with my alarm. Well, I must go prepare for my morning swim now. Bye.</p><hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Dreams</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
