Okay so apparently I didn’t do another review on Mina-chan’s single. I guess for the sake of the compilation I shall do it separately later. Meanwhile, we have a couple of singles in out hands. Let’s get started.<br /><br />(Man why do I feel so unused to writing this? Oh yeah it’s been three months… oops)<br /><br />As usual, I’ll talk about the releases first, then the package in general. And as usual, I only own the Regular Edition, but I am very aware of what the other editions differ in, so you can count on that in the review.<br /><br /><div>THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />TrySail – Youthful Dreamer [Single]<br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/35/SVWC-70068.jpg?v=1" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/29/SVWC-70070.jpg?v=2" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/31/SVWC-70072.jpg?v=1" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Anime Edition</td></tr></tbody></table></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: left;">(Close-ups are great, but they don’t get the full picture. And just ignore the Anime Edition, yes?)</div><br />Origin: If you don’t know them, it’s fine. If you do know any of them, you’ll know that their group formation is a matter of time. If you know all of them, you’ll know they all come from the same company who is also taking care of sphere, probably the most popular voice actor singer group of all time (lol), and that this is a second attempt from itself to create another legend, I guess. Cue most popular female voice actor last year Amamiya Sora (also Ten-chan, in blue), combined with quirky (?) Natsukawa Shiina (in yellow) who voiced – if you watched Sora no Method – Nonoka last year, along with blur queen Asakura Momo (in pink) and you get the new trio of my generation. Yes,&nbsp; they are all younger than me. Like, Ten-chan is months after me. Anyways, their debut is much anticipated, and along with the new season of Anime this year brings them a good opportunity to get started. Let’s get into the songs.<br /><br />(1) Youthful Dreamer<br />You should know by now this song is also the opening theme song of Anime Denpa Kyoushi (which I DO NOT WATCH, sorry), and that this definitely isn’t the trio’s first song. But then the format for this group generally is under pop with stronger beats, which lessened my impressions the first time I listened to it through the Anime. (as I mention again I DO NOT WATCH THE SHOW) But along the way I hear the completeness of this song under the review and decided to give it alongside the B-side. Maybe this is a good time for me to give chance to them, but also a good time for me to even give them, before the trend of good melodies go away in the next single, which apparently is not far away. Kudos to a good song this time round, and I hope they can keep it up. I really like how Ten-chan’s voice outstands the other two, but I must say their voices aren’t unrecognisable, so that’s a consolation to many trios out there already. *pointing fingers everywhere*<br />Rating: 4 stars (your-everyday-Anison Average)<br /><br />(2) Sail Out<br />Of course this must be it, their first song, if the A-side isn’t, yes? Bearing a similar style with the first song, this brings out much of the meaning to the name of their group, sailing to a new adventure. The melody is smooth, the style is okay, and there is not middle portion I don’t like, so that is a perfect 4-star song I must give, yes? So motivating a chorus, it makes me want to go on a journey. Maybe?<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average, I guess?)<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall that 4-star single I cannot not give, especially with that nice B-side song, so that is pretty much it. It’s a new start for all three of them (don’t even talk about solo music careers for the other two for now), and I’m probably be listening to them until… things change. Well, it happened for sphere anyway, so I guess this may not be very far behind, I hope. Good single for those wanting a decent pop melody, but don’t expect too much especially when they are under an Anime first time round. The B-side is great, so go give it a listen. I like simple melodies; tongue twisters aren’t my thing.<br /><br />ALSO! AFTER HALF A YEAR!<br /><br /><div>THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />fumika – Kesenai Yakusoku [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/10/16/YRCN-90238.jpg?v=1" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/10/15/YRCN-90237.jpg?v=1" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">One Coin Special Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(No fumika as cover. Disappointing. Mind you it’s a single-song release, so that means there’s a movie attached to this song. Good thing I gave it on her album, so the cover on my list is fine. Read on to find out more.)<br /><br /></div>Origin: We’re not unfamiliar with fumika, that powerful voice you can get from every female singer in USA. But who cares about that, we want Japan voice. That is where fumika comes in, that power of a voice (which is coincidentally the title of her 2nd album) makes for a special in emotional and epic songs, and ever since her departure from mother company Sony Music Japan she was been doing well. Early this year she releases her 2nd full album, which gives me another chance to give her latest single, which is out like August last year. So why the long wait? Purely because I forgot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But whatever, now that it’s finally here, let’s talk about how much this song brings her and us (possible you) to another level.<br /><br />(1) Kesenai Yakusoku [Unforgettable Promise]<br />(well I can’t come up with a better translation, so just accept it) fumika brings another epic song after that Endless Road single last year (which I also reviewed), also a movie theme song. Ignoring that, this song is plenty of romance, and a supposed promise that is yet to be fulfilled. Man I think I had that time too. (I shall stop here) Anyways, it’s touching, it’s epic, it’s romantic… If you want to take this to apologise/confess to someone I guess you could. The lyrics didn’t come as instantly to me because of the melody throughout the song was my reason back then, but I think it’s fine. fumika did contribute to this song too in lyrics, and that brings out the meaning, along with her many songs in the past few years. A song to listen, and if you tear up, it means you like this song. Like me. The music video itself also brings a strong cast of models to write down their biggest promises, and I guess that deepens the meaning of this song.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="189" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSA3VKaTK7I" width="336"></iframe><br /></div>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)  <br /><br />(2) Endless Road (acoustic version)<br />I have not reviewed this song until recently, so I was pretty thrown off by the vocals (yes it’s still her) and the acoustic style for that five-star song I gave last year. Nonetheless, it reminds me of the great song I gave #4 in the rankings last year, and that is also nostalgic and lighter in the mood for this style, which is fine. I don’t think the acoustic version is a good representation of the original song, especially when it’s not done perfectly (especially when you listen to YUI and miwa and SPECIAL OTHERS), but it’s a listen.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average; for the melody, not for this version)<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall a pretty good single, considering it technically has only a single track if you haven’t listened to Endless Road, but man if you didn’t it’s time to listen to that first before appreciating this version, yes? Go, she can be found on YouTube.<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" border="0" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3aWrtORHF5Y/VWQd45pFqFI/AAAAAAAAMsA/T9Rzv3B2I-o/IMG_20150526_134321%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="262" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="350" /><br />Well as I said I missed it by one day, but then it’s… okay let’s not talk about that yes? I had to wait longer because I ordered TrySail’s single after review which is after release date, and I ordered these two singles from two different shops, so yeah. But it’s here, and I’m very glad it’s here.<br /><br />That special gift (if you’ve been following on Twitter) is online shop Toranoana’s way of protecting their gifts, using a cheap paper envelope. Really, one drop of water and I’m going to start crying. So I take care of it well. Besides, it’s the fact that I end up with them after I see the special gifts of Animate gone, Gamers gone, and that I can never order something from Sofmap. So I ended up with this, which is still a great representation of the trio.<br /><img loading="lazy" alt="" height="240" src="https://pf.skiyaki.net/s3/skiyaki/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/7995/%E3%81%A8%E3%82%89%E3%81%AE%E3%81%82%E3%81%AA.jpg" style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="168" /><br /><br /><br />I guess that’s it then. I’ve done enoguh to promote the trio, and I’ve forgotten much of what I like about fumika after three months I gave it already, so yeah, this is the best I can do. Tune in later where I dig up my memories of Mina-chan’s single and tell you what I like about her. Cya guys soon.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- Blogger automated replacement: "https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdjapan.co.jp%2Fpictures%2Fl%2F05%2F29%2FSVWC-70070.jpg%3Fv%3D2&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" with "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/YIPR6yh5RV1Y0Crr0DIfSaK1g613H9VsRfxh_7SRWtkOZvAfsS08AkSx9B7GN_F5Q9h8LFAd-g1FQrft8C32WLjQNOJW431V4aRIXqp6POA" --><!-- Blogger automated replacement: "https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdjapan.co.jp%2Fpictures%2Fl%2F05%2F35%2FSVWC-70068.jpg%3Fv%3D1&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" with "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/NoWzkqU0XnGYO_Uem92nTJRyuzkl-3SGjaKA4NKTgTYilECvnH6g8R3VHDnGYAqh3qOFvP1QGzFb14JTFTHMNBENU2r43QMtlfGWke61CB4" --><!-- Blogger automated replacement: "https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdjapan.co.jp%2Fpictures%2Fl%2F10%2F15%2FYRCN-90237.jpg%3Fv%3D1&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" with "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/QPudjjfftfcXqeMRmDQzcNvjoWqsLyhLLghKFBhUvB75nVNZRL5Y1FI1Dw5ANpymj6Nipxb1xpY4aZ-gifOve-xr6SxrhBfrzJVP_w1tjFc" --><!-- Blogger automated replacement: "https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdjapan.co.jp%2Fpictures%2Fl%2F05%2F31%2FSVWC-70072.jpg%3Fv%3D1&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" with "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Ma51vFTrHY1NvB0GbHlO9qPuEzUmLh5DH_lKcFS7wStcwv7aG4U0XK-afY8dITPGS8XM4xxWltV8o7T3BV22SM8bcdIz9dM2wvMTXhbVxWE" --><!-- Blogger automated replacement: "https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdjapan.co.jp%2Fpictures%2Fl%2F10%2F16%2FYRCN-90238.jpg%3Fv%3D1&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" with "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Op_u3brBKgGsdbsXfcRmMAJuWS7hD-8M-UEGSYr1l46iNg9N0iYvekHxLjsblLWezQyquVEZ-K6D44tqUmNnagoW0jIGvAo9w9cDTeKRyQE" --><hr><h4 class="post-tags"><div> Reported in </div><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
