Hey, as promised, the package arrived just in time before I could take a nap. Or more importantly, to end the month.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang=en><p dir=ltr lang=en> Looks like the package is coming tomorrow. One review at the start and the end of the month. This is great. Good night.</p>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/626794517975293952 target=_blank>July 30, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset=utf-8 src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script>It's great and all, so let's do this.<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=EarphonesMimiNaka><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Earphones - Mimi no Naka e [Single]</div></blockquote><img loading=lazy alt="【マキシシングル】TV それが声優! 「耳の中へ」/イヤホンズ" class=picture height=318 name=main_image src="https://www.animate-onlineshop.jp/resize_image.php?image=05201039_555be5d879ad8.jpg" style="display:block;margin:10px auto;max-width:698px" width=320>(Looks like a simple cover, but wait till you open the package up. More after the review.)<br><br>Origin: You probably don't know this group. And I probably won't, if not for a certain Anime I was watching this season, "Sore ga Seiyuu!", where they get three newbies, power them as an idol group with the same name as their main characters, and send them to fandom, potentially. Not like I remember any of them, but as of now I can name two of the three that forms the real life group (let's not talk about the Anime one for now). Nagaku Yuki is the one in pink and has the cutest voice amongst the three, Takahashi Rie is in yellow, and has the most common voice amongst them (to my fancy, for now), and there's Kouno Marika, who unfortunately I can only remember by her role in the show, not the youngest in the group. Overall, they make a great chorus I must say (producers are good at doing this), and this kicking of their first single a month ago signals the start of their music career. Their second single though... is the theme song for the show. This one, it's just the introduction. But it's great for a reason.<br><br>(1) Mimi no Naka e [Inside (Your) Ears]<br>This may sound like your typical Anime character song, and it is, resembling many elements of cutesy lyrics and a simple pop melody. The lyrics are very like their group name and symbolise many of what earphones do to your ears. Overall, I think it's quite a nice song, and am attracted to it upon first impression from the Anime trailers promoting this song, even though it's not involved in the show in any way. Nonetheless, if you like a simple song, and you listen to Anime songs more often than me (that is about one per season), then this is definitely worth a listen.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br><br>Conclusion: This is only a single track release, so I doubt anyone would think this is worth a buy, even though worth a listen. But maybe it's a good way of supporting their debut, and I certainly did. Hope the girls do well in the future, singing songs I would want to listen after their second single which I prefer not to talk so much about. Still, this one song? This one is good. Give the new girls some support, and give it a listen. It's a nice cute song. And I can have that once in a while.<br><br>(Please note that the word "cute" used in this review is only meant as a friendly manner, because that they are.)<br><br>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br><br>THE PACKAGE<div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1516 data-original-width=2048 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgs8VooMSzvObhx8ZJgNfQWHlk6o0GSzpm3Vt_g1hlvPU12_DLn8KbpI2mj6WAYLjiBcDLMIDw7k7cXS7zKKWci78EPs_Y_PrTWDwnvf7y_HIj4Kp1T4ScMPdLG59xcsJssPpC8pu9_tfg/s320/IMG_20150731_125715.jpg width=320></div><div>The first thing you should observe is this cover is big. More than just big, it's like a one-piece dress. That is all that inside the CD. One piece of paper and a sponge seemingly holding on to the disc. Creativity has taken to a new level, well so is the budget, but then this is only a single track release, and they aren't worth doing that much now, so this much effort is already appreciated. There are also seemingly two holes (Don't mind the magazine; I'm covering up my ugly table surface) that are intended to show the disc when it is folded, so that's not anything wrong. But just when you open it and I was singing to the lyrics and reading the... cover, it's kind of difficult. So in practicality... not so much. In design though, this one breaks the records in Klassic Note.</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=2368 data-original-width=3200 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKzy5YsvVrTYNb0bYGXYBwrIJ0QX3kmaB5ukUPuOKt7hTBwrmuS7IAu0iKJdChvPJrdXsPjSWKyH1T4oJnJ1xO3MhYPjkvEBlRnZCGViYESpMf2c-0XpkK2CQ_GTGi__t1VBhT_TP-rbM/s320/IMG_20150731_125728.jpg width=320></div><div>Looking close, I see more than what appears to be background for the cover art, but is actually an array of images from the Anime and themselves in reality, so much I don't think I can show them all, Nonetheless, it's only a piece of paper, but very well done. Kudos to the Japanese for always making things look this nice. Now I'm recalling the days I got my first batch of releases at my doorstep...</div><div><br><br>That's it I guess, for the last post this month. See you guys next month, where I hope I can get my computer fixed or replaced, whichever is applicable and/or suits my budget, lol. Until next time... hope I can do the Entertainment News this weekend on my new com. Bye!</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
