Hey it's another week. And I'm not done with that yet. In fact, I think I'm going for a contract for the next three months. So good luck to me there. I'm even stopping my friend meetings because of it. F**king S**. Anyways, let's get back. I censor things for a purpose. Also, for my own understanding, haha.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Sore ga Seiyuu!: </b>Yep, the only show that will make you think their job as a voice actor is tough. And yep, I teared up. Because what was in the first episode of recording showcase may not be the worse case yet. As we know, Japanese take their work seriously so they do not take time to joke around or criticise people, especially within production. But then this is a pretty good episode. At least, without the theme songs. I know. To give this show I have to give a song. That will be tough, at least for me. To give real-life new seiyuus a chance or not; that's the question.<br /><b>WORKING!!!: </b>Yeah, plenty of things to laugh about (I swear I laughed a lot, silently), and plenty of things to look forward to. We're introduced with a new character this second episode, and coincidentally is the guardian of the Takanashi household and surprisingly also, the ex-husband of the older sister Kazue. Looks like there is nothing much to report (because it's Souta that is going; cannot imagine if the drunkard sister were to go), and the guy is a masochist (seriously?), or not I guess everything's going well as usual, haha. Takanashi is great without his glasses (they should've done this part earlier already), and Souma and me are pissed that Satou-kun is not asking the girl out. Seriously. Like, when? We don't have much episodes left, Satou-kun! More next week, I guess, and I'm enjoying more of the show than say, the theme songs. (I may have to close one eye for this again)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>A Channel: </b>Run-chan got a mirror which is supposedly cursed and causes her bottom half to fall off, even though it's unlikely the case. And they got a bunch of cats as a reward of tracing the source where she found it. Yuuko is freaked out as usual, and cue the ending part where Kitou-sensei is in a ponytail. (Yesh!)<br /><b>BLEACH: </b>Well.<br /><br />That was a short fight. NEXT!<br /><br />Just joking. If you want me to comment, I can only say Kubo is saving more for later. Because clearly this fight is short, and full reveals of any character that potentially is going to die means he (what's his name) has to fight with someone else again, which means there will be more, to the truth. That's all, I guess. Didn't know I have to say this this early. I'm not yet done with this post, by the way.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week is a rather unsatisfied week. Why? <b>I haven't gotten hold of Kuso Iinkai's new mini-album</b> yet. Yeah. Very sad now. Besides that, there's <b>SpecialThanks and their 2nd full album</b>. Even though they say it's "full", the 15-track album is mostly short melodies which I - if you know only listen to songs more than 2 minutes - don't give most of the songs already. And yeah, they are a English-based punk rock band, which already is deterring me about 70% in their style. I'm trying hard to give them another song or two besides the music video I received on the start of the month. I bet you did watch it. For Misaki-chan, yes? lol Also I'm giving another indie song which does not really have a source (live-only release singles are rather popular these days), and then there is the unexpected (really man, where's Kuso Iinkai??) <b>new single from Yoru no Honki Dance</b> (no really that's their band name) with their generic rock style music, and I guess even after listening to the single that (it may not be well done, and) they are not my type. Even if they sound like a genre I should be diving into. Apparently I like girls who sing garage rock but not this. <span class="emoji" title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> My bad, guys. I was trying to give a song or two. Maybe I'll extend these releases to next week. Because next week there's... nothing. So good, yet so bad.<br /><br />Okay, there's something next week. That song I've been brainwashing the preview in my head for half a month already, <b>sphere's new single is due next week</b>. Hopefully the full song(s) sound(s) good (lol) and I can put another of their release on my shelf. Really, the free gift comes later. Besides, it's not close-ups. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Reviews come first. Free gifts come second. This has always been the order of priority.  I guess I may have to switch it around. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/620082023227457536" target="_blank">July 12, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>Oh yeah, there's also an Anime theme song from Tokyo Karan Koron's new single that I decided to give because I remembered it. Or maybe because they deserve a chance. But only this one, I guess. I'm "running out of lives to give" already, seriously. Note the difference between the times of my tweets.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Stuck between giving one song and giving another song. They are independent of each other, of course. Been thinking whole day.  Good night.</div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/618091731871903744" target="_blank">July 6, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">I give up. Brainwashing thrives yet again.  Here's some seasoning for your night ahead. Listening to Tokyo Karan Koron - Spice</div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/618099617469632512" target="_blank">July 6, 2015</a></blockquote><br /><br />I guess that's it then. Until I sort things out, I'm a "carefree and relaxed person" (in contrast to "stressed and tense") where the days count and I need to do more learning. Cya guys then, and until next time... I just don't know. Even Tomacchan is stripping down to her undies. What should I do? (More below)<br />[P.S.: This is just the intro, and it's enough to get anyone a nosebleed. And I know if you don't that you watch porn. So just... keep your distance away from me.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11695969_10153508260502460_1621532775283967336_n.jpg?oh=98a27e8f0f41a2e9de0748c7cd12bc07&amp;oe=56176045" /></div>The photobook is out, so this should be fun. But until school starts next month I'm holding daily releases of... *whatever your dirty mind can think of* until then. Go look the other way, and remember to be back next month. lol]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
