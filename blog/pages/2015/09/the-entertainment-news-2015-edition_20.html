Eh... I'd rather do another post on this, but then... Happy Birthday, LX. Yeah. it's today. Her birthday wish from me? I'd like to see her replace everyone on my phone homescreen background. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Sore ga Seiyuu!: </b>Another episode of nothing but voice acting, well almost. Futaba was down from work, and not as bad as this episode's guest Shiraishi Ryouko described. Their first live concert is near, and it's still pretty empty and now Ichigo-chan has sprained her ankle. Oh well. Looks like they're going to end this season with a live performance. Hopefully there'll be enough people to fill up the place. Will Ichigo-chan be able to recover from her injury? We don't know. It'll be interesting to see how they end this show. (Funny that not all the stuff from the manga is mentioned in this show, but oh well what the heck)<br /><b>Ranpo Kitan: </b>Yes we're at the last episode, and seriously, it's worth thinking. Of course not many would watch this, or we'll have plenty of sympathisers all around the Twenty Faces criminal, but then again doing evil in the name of justice against societal norm is not an everyday topic in Anime. Nonetheless, I think this is worth thinking about, and you bet I've been thinking about it. Supposedly it's known that both Kobayashi and Namikoshi can be saved, but then the latter doesn't have much of a will to live, so yeah, the continuation of whatever formula he's talking about as a creator will still live on. Fact is, and if you don't feel like one of them because you lead a good life or something that you can be happy in, than let me tell you: It's not real. Doing up something like that as a formula is very impractical (if you Google the word "Laplace" you'll know what I mean) in society, and the worst case scenario is as of the terrorist situation of today, that you will be stopped and most of us will not give a damn about it. Besides, it's your goddamn life. If you want to throw it away instead of thinking how to break through that which you don't like, don't call yourself weak and force it upon the people who have harmed you. Period. I better stop here. Any more and my mask will slip, lol. Anyways, nice show, and didn't regret picking it up halfway through the show. Takahashi Rie too, thanks to you this was a nice show to pick up. *Kobayashi voice* Yeah!<br /><b>WORKING!!!: </b>Wow, that's plenty of development to absorb for this episode. In the latest episode, we see a final conclusion to start on Takanashi's feelings on Inami-chan (the mother's reaction at the end really is freaking me out), and the biggest thing that is going to happen in the restaurant, which is Yachiyo stopping her work in Wagnaria. Hmm... I won't say that is bad, but then now that Popura-chan is joining in the fun with her own problem, can't wait to see how they're going to conclude this one. I may not have read the manga, but if this is what the story shall end with it might just be the most interesting thing I'm expecting ever since I watched this like, 5 years ago. Man, next week has to come. We need another Episode 3 very badly right now. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (BTW Yamada-kun is a dick, seriously)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Kuroshitsuji:</b> I'll thank that kind guy for translating this chapter of manga (I'm at 107 here) (and no, I don't read Chinese translations), and it's great. We manage to see a big misunderstanding amongst the kids (really romance in this story doesn't stack up), finally that Green Witch we know of is out of her hell, but into another, where Sebastian apparently is indirectly raping them. What's with the mouth cuffs anyway? Oops. (no I don't watch porn) Anyways, this is a great chapter, and can't wait to see what happens at her audience to the Queen. But damn, I hope someone translate this regularly.<br /><b>BLEACH: </b>Well most of the stuff is expected this chapter. Nemu has to die and the bad guy is definitely and surely going to accompany her death somehow. Somehow didn't notice Kubo likes to pick on the good guy again, and this time it's Szayel's soul (because really, he's dead and stopped in time and who knows if he's gotten out of it yet or not) that is mocking him. Nonetheless, loss of a long-term attachment is undeniably sad even if for a mad scientist, but as he seizes his next victory hopefully he can find some real person to be his assistant in the future. Or not. Whatever. He's a jerk anyway.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Yeah, you remember from last week? I was talking about <b>Kalafina and VELTPUNCH</b>. And yeah, those I chose ended up in the list eventually. Not to say they are 5-stars, but then again I've not given 5-stars since February. Also on the list is <b>Mina-chan's new single</b>, and yes again it's going to be my shelf next week, probably, if I time it right. Along with that is another release pending two weeks from now, <b>Tomacchan's new single</b>, and from the recent PV preview it looks great, I must say. I'll elaborate more on how pissed I am at missing special gifts yet again (I'll bitch about it in the review instead) when the stuff arrives, but you'll probably have to wait till next month to get it done. Meanwhile, I'm waiting for <b>cozy diary's first full album</b> (and knowing of the fact that they are also under famous people years ago), and probably I'll get a few more songs next week by going another round of song-searching. At this rate... I think it's okay. Surprising to be seeing total number of songs drop this year round. Probably. We'll see.<br /><br /><br />That's it I guess. I'm probably going to have a conversation with her tonight (oohh), which will just undermine me as a human even further, seeing her grow up like that. Anyways, I'll see you guys next week, as we have more Anime to conclude (and start for next season), as my entertainment life continues to get better. Cya.<br />[P.S.: (Audience: You look happy.) You can say so... *hehe* I wasn't yesterday though. Freaking weekend quiz.]<br />[P.P.S.: Yeah I bet some are almost disappointed in the first postscript. lol But here it is.

But not over the shower scene. That one makes Tomacchan on the same level as a gravure model, so that no one can top it, as far as I know. lol]<br /><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Wait, do I have to censor that one?
