One at the start and one at the end of the month? I swear I didn't arrange this.<br /><br />Okay, I did somehow. I dragged it for a day. But then, this definitely is the last of the month, so... Happy Halloween. I don't listen to scary singles, so here's a happy one.<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />sphere - DREAMS, Count down! [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.sonymusicshop.jp/img/1/item/LAS/M00/003/LASM000034176__640_640_102400_jpg.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.sonymusicshop.jp/img/1/item/LAS/M00/003/LASM000034178__640_640_102400_jpg.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.sonymusicshop.jp/img/1/item/LAS/M00/000/LASM000004176__640_640_102400_jpg.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition A</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition B</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Clearly there's a bias. But then a bunch of shots is also pretty cool. Besides, the songs are better.)<br /><br />Origin: I don't want to express bias at this point, but since we're talking about the most popular voice actor-based music group then this is it. Having being to Budokan (probably the biggest and most popular area to host concerts) and even overseas, they definitely received local popularity and a touch of international fame at some point already. At the start of the year they released a best album according to fan votes, and though I didn't participate in the voting the audience clearly knows what's good. That again, this is their third single of the year (having already missed two, one closer than the other), and I'm finally getting one on the shelf. Great. Now that is got through what the other two singles of the year didn't, let us talk about why this single comes so good just upon first impression.<br /><br />(1) DREAMS, Count down!<br />Written by the same guy who probably wrote lyrics with dangerously wrong English lyrics for the group ever since they started, this song definitely hit the point for music instead of lyrics when I first heard it. Lively, familiar tune (somehow) featuring a music video promoting a dance schematic (called "Dansphere") hoping to turn up the crank for the audience to learn and also dance with them in future lives, which I agree will work on all of us. Even I want to dance to the song. Having not seen the full music video yet, I won't say much about them as OLs, but the song itself is easy-listening, even though they suffer from the usual bridge mistake which I explained for many times already. Other than that, it must be a good song, yes?<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) CHANCE!<br />As usual, it's the B-side which probably caught me off guard. With respect to the previous single which I missed due to how slightly unacceptable the other song in the release is, this one hit the spot the moment I listened to it, which explains how much easy-listening songs should be with these releases. As for the lyrics, we are met with the motivating and happy style of producers... we've probably heard of but not remembered in our lives. Nonetheless, the meaning generally follows the first song, which advocates crowd movement (singing instead of dancing, as with above) and gives us a face of positivity, and for that, I say this song presents itself well. Better than the A-side, really. That's how it gets attention.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: I must say I'm pleased with the single this time round, even though I suppose there can be more to them. But considering their 6 years into this, and they can still come up with ways to promote themselves and also write songs I like a lot, I must say they still have their charm despite already considered an idol group within Klassic Note. If you're not a fan and need a reason to listen to the single, I'll say the B-side because it sounds great overall. And if you can dance to the girls, then this whole release can be for you. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />You know I waited for another week just to meet a time when I'm at home to get this, right? Nah, you guys don't know...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="236" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WkNgcc971Wc/VjShBixWWQI/AAAAAAAAR9E/0yTY4a-PhMM/s320/IMG_20151031_174842.jpg" width="320" /></div>Coming to the special gifts for the release, we're met with postcards, and not just postcards like Hocchan, oh no. This one is not even a fraction of the CD itself, which proves rather disappointing already since I got it from Sony Music Shop itself to (1) ensure I get a special gift, and (2) that the focus of the image gets even smaller without the close-ups. Serious. If you like them either stay in Japan and pre-order, or get Animate and Gamers before everyone else in this world.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">What, it's THIS small??  Really, if the special gifts are going to get smaller... So will my confidence to buy them. <a href="https://t.co/ws1OjmkvFo" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ws1OjmkvFo</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/659984919158894592" target="_blank">October 30, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br /><br />Other than that, it meets the basic (plain) requirements of a good release, and I'm not really complaining about it. For the Regular Edition I'm greeted with a photo collage of the cover as shown above, and I must say it's great. Just... very funny. Like, Tomacchan taking selfie with the others when obviously there's a third person taking the shot lol<br /><br /><br />That's it, I guess. I need to catch up on shows and stuff, so this one is going to take some time. I still have to conisder the fact that I still have schoolwork to do (GODDAMMIT) so I'm really not in the mood to do anything. Until now. I'm pulling myself up for now. Let's see how long this can last. Cya tomorrow for the Entertainment News, and the new month. I hear this is a common topic amongst celebrities. Well in Japan they refer to as "personalities", which I think sounds much cooler in retrospect.<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
