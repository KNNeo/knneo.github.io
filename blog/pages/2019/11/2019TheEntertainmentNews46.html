It's called Mineral Town orsomething. What? It's not in English yet? Well, I bought the Japanese versionbecause Nan-chan is playing it on YouTube and I'm tempted to buy it since lastweek and it's also to prepare myself for the upcoming Animal Crossing gamecoming next year. Thanks Stardew Valley; you made me like these games nowhaha<br /><br />Proof:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img loading="lazy"    border="0"    data-original-height="1200"    data-original-width="1600"    height="240"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FpvKhqA1ZIw/XdFK_tbGQNI/AAAAAAAA19E/3a0oc_ayecos6TXJ5SRxGq-e-WqeYqODACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_20191116_223104.jpg"    width="320"  /></div>(Sorry for shitty stock controller because this is the only game I've played inthe past half a year since my sis somehow abandoned her birthday gift from lastyear so it's mine now lmao)<br /><br />Okay, I got to stop for now because we got stuff to talk about! Sorry if myattention span is low because of this farming game lol I literally played it allSunday haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SaikoroClub07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Now we line up (these dice) to create insults to hurl at each other." Eh    Maki-chan? I don't care about Miki-chan but can you be concerned about the    TV ratings here? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>If you had to scare the sh*t out of Miki-chan for me to say she is cute eventhough we don't get to see the other two... sure, whatever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this newepisode (#SaikoroClub07) we almost got away without playing another board gameor two lol. Wow, somehow it feels longer than usual, this episode. Okay, let'stalk about it. Firstly, about Maki-chan being bored during summer holidays. Iknow, we could totally get a Miki-chan exclusive with just her hanging out inthe cafe and doing nothing but no, this woman just dragged her out to the hillsto play with water. Well, in return Miki-chan brought a game with her, and yes,it's not in case she has anyone to play with she just bought it she just didn'texpect to play with whoever just saved her life as a kid. Anyways, since thereare many ways to play "Monjirou", Maki-chan chose one with the insults (why),and of course Miki-chan lost badly. And as she said, she can't do insultsbecause she's kind and compassionate enough to not be a d**k. It takes somelevel of instinct to win at a shouting game, mind you. Maki-chan be a goodexample lol. Flip that around, and Miki-chan can't stop praising how lovelyMaki-chan is (I agree) (haha) because I can't help but see Miki-chan hanging outwith a beautiful woman because in this part I think I've been blessed more thanjust cute girls in this series haha. That accent though, I guess I'll never getused to it tbh. Second half, it's student council vice chairperson flexing time,as Shibusawa since we saw her last time after failing to be convinced ofMidori-chan's current situation instead of helping her to plan for the upcomingschool festival because the chairperson is hospitalised, insisted on therejection of their class proposal to host a board game cafe in school. Again,and I think the chairperson who came back in a limp also knows, it's whatever ittakes to make the festival a good one. Shibusawa be too stuck on her emotions,seriously. Anyways, the chairperson (I really don't remember your name, senpai)(lol) probably read the proposal, somehow knew how to go to Saikoro Club byhimself (don't ask me why), and decided to ask for the girls to show him a goodtime. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, as in playing a board game. It's like a proposalpresentation, but the easiest way to present board games is to play them, asMidori-chan mentioned. They played a game of rescue, where strategies are ofutmost importance, and luck is not proportional to risk when you aren't holdingthe tile to game over lmao. All in all, a fun game, and obviously Shibusawa willlive in agony knowing her nice senpai approved of the cafe haha. So yeah, morewill get to know about board games, I guess. Midori-chan's creation though...she wants to be humble, and I doubt it should be subject to mass criticism (orpraise), but hey, you do you, girl. We shall see if this holds up then. Nextepisode, we finally get to introduce the fourth girl? I like how in the previewAya-chan says she saw a cute girl there- isn't that you? Haha we shall see forourselves if she can top any of the three main next time. I highly doubt it willbut (haha) (AYA-CHAN MVP ALWAYS lol)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j07vJjdCS2c/XdEOdfNg9aI/AAAAAAAA18M/4iq1TYgUFY4zBfQIi4kgE6hbkIOcpG2QQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub07_maki2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is an Anime and I'm not even aroused-          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LvgxYBuu36w/XdEOed7mH8I/AAAAAAAA18Q/zPSdlQT8h2QL_1f5jv9t8P4j_4MtHdw-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub07_maki3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I AM BONER<br />            (<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Yeah, Nomaru? Even your kids?    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay sorry for word pun  </div></blockquote>Wow Seizaki, didn't realise you can get into illegal territory, you naughty man.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> What is it though? We can talk about it here. Just... don't involvethat witch lol. The new episode (#Babylon06) is at its pivotal point, I wouldargue, in this whole suicide law fiasco. And boy, what a plot twist we havehere. Excitement (to not commit suicide) aside, let's talk about what happened.It's 2 days before election, 1 day before the public debate on TV. Problem is,no lead to arrest Itsuki. So how? Seizaki did the most wild decision I've seenin Anime forever, which is straight out go illegal. Because normally in dramayou will go quietly to do evil, but this motherf***er just straight up disbandedthe investigation group and decides to arrest, excuse me, kidnap the mayorhimself. Brave move, dude. Sadly, as the one guy Kuji'in mentioned, since all ofthem heard it making them all accomplices, Seizaki is not going alone. Whichbrings us to the second half, the debate. Ugh, I didn't want to review on thispart to be honest, but only putting a one-liner here might be too much of acompromise, so we will talk about it for once. For you, Anime. Four oppositionagainst Itsuki on TV. Firstly, on socio-economical aspect. I would argue thatthe guy is fairly valid on worrying about suicide only increasing with the lawin effect and it will gradually if not greatly impact society flow in general (Imean, can you predict who the next guy's occupation will be to commit suicide?),and Itsuki brought up examples to talk about how society behaviour might changein reverse if implemented (correctly or not we'll leave it for opposition number4). As much as I think Itsuki is correct, it will be wrong immediatelyconsidering it is Japan. Best part is he mentioned drugs and legislating themcompared to others who don't. And that's why you don't, bro, uh, I mean, dearauthor. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In context, Japan has a fairly traditional societal view onthings and not as open as Western nations (don't quote me here), but suffice itto say that such a law will not allow people to think much rationally even ifgiven the choice. The best related example I know of which is kind of valid foropposition number 3 (now you can quote me here) is that given a human orhuman-trained algorithm we have the tendency to do evil (search "twitter racistbot"), and for this case then people can be influenced to die without muchbarriers anymore, considering law isn't even a thing if it's allowed. Secondly,it's about ethics and accountability. Same as above, but now it will disruptsociety as a group. If tomorrow I tell you someone won't be around for work youthink that SME boss wouldn't go crazy and die too? (Don't worry boss I won'tlol) Yeah, propagation is the biggest problem. Itsuki's argument here is totallyshallow here, as he argues this with laws that do not exist being possible buthave been allowed, for example homosexual marriage. Again, the opposition isright, that is not a law, and it has been spent a lot of time to analyze and tobe allowed, and moreover it's not a crime, so he kind of brushed through thathaha. Suicide isn't a crime too, just so you know. Itsuki decided to ignoreopposition number 3 (to be honest I freaked out when the guy slammed the tableduring the debate haha wtf dude) in his argument since it's rather extremetalking about incitement being a law and he may have influenced 64 people tojump off the building (unlikely, as we mentioned) (which is why theinvestigation is going nowhere) by arguing that the legislation of suicide lawwill let people think about the act seriously. I mean, which brings us back toopposition 1 where people will tend to do evil. I mean<span style="font-size: xx-small;"  >(don't quote me on this, but) if I had a choice as a kid thinking  irrationally I would die even at 26</span>OKAY MOVING ON Haha last but not least, Nomaru being the last opposition, tapson emotions. I mean, I'm an emo kid so he lost lmao (I'm the 2k+ people whoalready died in Shiniki during this period lol) but assuming I don't exist inShiniki (haha) he argues that people's tendency to save people from suicide ishigh such that a law should not need to be legislated, and if need be only incontrolled circumstances. The second point he didn't argue much because we'llcome back to the other in a moment, but Itsuki can never argue that laws likethis need time for planning and not immediate permission to be put into law.Even if he says it now his new parliament will hardly get any momentum going tofixate this into something people will accept, for starters. (Looking at you,Brexit) Going back, Nomaru then argues that if we are around someone who wantsto commit suicide whether it be family or friend, then things like counsellingand assistance will be given to those who think otherwise in society. Yes, thatis a bind. Yes, that is kind of a rule that is the invisible societal contractwe have signed since we were born, but emotionally he says we will not seepeople die if without good reason or things like "I don't want to live anymore".People, with or without a choice, have to live. That's, because there isn't away to allow you to escape. And eventually, a meaning can be found. What if Itold you you can die even long before you found meaning in life? Then that's itI guess? Not like Itsuki can argue that. To support his point, and I think thisis the bad part, Nomaru brings out the kid who posted the video about his dadwanting to commit suicide. Man, and he allowed the kid to be elected intoparliament? Yep, using Itsuki's election rules against himself. Haha more onthat soon, but Nomaru promises the government will still be led by politicians,even if the kid isn't old enough yet. And here's the plot twist: the father ofthe kid is in the studio. Guess who it is yourself, please. So yeah, this showhas turned into... kid versus dad in parliamentary elections? Well well, Anime,look what you have done. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> This is a new territory in storytelling,that's for sure. So yeah, we shall see what happens next week then. I'll put aone-liner to end this later, but suffice it to say, it's pretty f**ked up as ofnow. Also, Itsuki still has Magase Ai along with him who can technically incitepeople to commit suicide. Soon it'll be a haven where she will be the forefatherof teaching people the beauty of incitement to death (on whoever they wanteliminated) and Itsuki will rule the new Japanese district haha yah rightremember to write down "fictional Tokyo" for reference please haha I'm tired cyaguys next week to see if Itsuki gets kidnapped or not (my guess is only Hiasaand Seizaki will be left out of the 23 people) (yes, left alive)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6WlTXdGyIBw/XdEgaWTKHZI/AAAAAAAA18g/f99hKO3M-UMYPjfx6Ton3jnv8-yPJljJgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon06_kujiin2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Smoking never looked this cool haha second behind            <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/5266/Touko_Aozaki" target="_blank"              >Aozaki Touko</a            >            lol<br />            (Also, this is technically suicide too, so...

WE GOT HER haha don't tell the wife lmao<br /><strike  >[TL:DR; People will most definitely die if the law is allowed, Itsuki. Many  people want to escape the world because of the many small things that can be  exaggerated into a decision to leave society and give up on life. This will  not work, I promise you go watch some Anime "Fractale" to learn more haha but  seriously]</strike><br />[TL:DR; Itsuki became a politician and proposed a suicide law so he can killhimself. Well played, bro. Well played.]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay, I don't have much time left this week so let's be quick as there's many tocover this week which I didn't notice again, if Google didn't remind me of musicreleases so thank you robot lol. <b>Tomita Miyu's debut single</b> is... fine, Iguess, but I still don't get why they would choose her to do a solo music debutshe's young. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, the B-side isn't that great so I skipped it.Yeah, sphere's new single too, because I thought I can give another chance andthen realised that I can't. Moving on,<b>yanaginagi's B-side compilation</b> is... pretty fresh considering I don'treally listen to her singles yet along B-sides so this is quite a listen. I maygive a couple of songs if all goes well.<b> seven oops' new album</b> alsoreleases this week which I listened over the weekend (before Harvest Moon tookover me lol) and... I still think they excel in emotional songs. The topic songwhich was lively and light-hearted wasn't impressive as some of the emo songs inthe list, to be honest.<br /><br />Next week brings <b>Tomacchan's new single</b> for Anime "Sword Art Online" andI PROMISE there aren't any new ones already so I may take some time to reviewsome of the songs which released earlier OMG three releases are out on Christmasthis year. Klassic Note needs a different schedule for awards now OMFG I haven'tthought of who to give awards to yet!! I should stop playing games haha<br /><br />On news on Twitter since I have spent some time to update which singles andalbums are releasing within the year and beyond, for some reason I gave webshort animation "Shiohi Girls" a watch (the actual content is less than 30seconds long btw) but I totally dig the ending theme which will be out next weekearly (I assume a <b>new single by OMIGAWARA</b>, the artist, is on the way)(why is cinema staff's name in there),<b>SCANDAL announced their new album</b> due February next year in which I havegiven their latest song already,<b>vivid undress is releasing an album in December</b> following major debut(yep) so congrats, and I hope the album other than the topic songs are goodhaha, and <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> is for Anime "RikeiKoi". Oooh boy forthe last one because she be a lovesick girl in that Anime and I want to be theguy and listen to her sing an opening theme hopefully one up Tomacchan's or atleast any of the Mocho songs we've heard this year hehe please make it happen<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm done I need to brush up for work tomorrow. Oh, and about the<b>"Shiohi Girls"</b> thing, I figured it's too short to talk about it becauselegit it's meant to display one-liners with romantic impact, so... my reviewsinvolve about 6 on average haha. But I'll talk about it when it ends in 24 weekssince they air twice online every week. With Koko-chan, Kana-chan and Kayanon inthe cast amongst many others, this is Tsurezure Children but way, WAY shorterlol. I'll give it a watch every week I technically follow Kana-chan and sheretweets this stuff haha also subscribed on YouTube just in case I missed ithehe. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... you can moonwalk in theHarvest Moon game.Haha yeah. I'll attach a GIF here to show you guys if I canconnect that Switch to my PC haha bye<br /><br />P.S. How to moonwalk: move the stick in the wrong direction while holding therun button<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img loading="lazy"    border="0"    src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lcvUzkK71Kg/XdFWQQaTJpI/AAAAAAAA19Q/qM0hLKiKAcgRLnFy4U6X1RW9fHoBxiswACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/mineraltown_moonwalk.gif"    width="320"    height="180"    data-original-width="568"    data-original-height="320"  /></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
