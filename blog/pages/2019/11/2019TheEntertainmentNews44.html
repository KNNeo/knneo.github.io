Haha yeah, it's thatpart of my job again.<br /><br />Welcome back, I guess. I had a wonderful week. But I doubt you'll have a betterone than me because I'm on work leave haha. However, you will probably have abetter one than me because I still can't hear much out of my left ear andbecause I half-assed planning for the week I think I only did productive "work"for like 2 out of the 5 weekdays lol what a way to waste time staying at home.Okay, this time around it might be not for own benefit and I might get away withopen sourcing this system if I complete it someday so...<br /><br />But seriously, going to work taught me to be more disciplined and prepared fortime during breaks so that I can actually do the stuff I don't get to do in theface of money. Oh well, can't wait to screw up planning again for end of theyear haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SaikoroClub05">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "We're so lucky that Miki's aunt runs an inn!" I don't want to say this,    Aya-chan, but yeah, this happens in Anime quite often lol  </div></blockquote>Sorry for spoiling this, but yeah, someone's relative probably had a place forthem to stay so they don't have to stay in a hotel lol I wonder how rich peoplein other Anime are when they don't have to do this. In this total fanserviceepisode (#SaikoroClub05) where everyone around Miki is just happy she hasfriends now lmao, she brings her friends to the beach. Yeah, what did I tellyou? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, they went to the beach. By solving the hardest problemwhich is accomodation apparently, the girls had a chance to go to Kanazawa, goshopping, take a ofuro in the inn courtesy of Miki's aunt (it felt like she wasblackmailed by the mother tbh), and... it rained. Oh well, let's go home.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Of course not, because besides Aya-chan being so sad and crying aboutit raining on the day they want to go to the beach, so is Takashi, the other kidin this inn who also desperately wants the same thing Aya-chan wants. The beach,guys, the beach. So, to offset that sadness, the girls play a board game withthe kid until the rain stops because this is a board game Anime or else we'llhave a full on bath scene haha. Introduce Kanazawa's unique shogi alternative,Goita. I don't think I want to explain the rules here since Midori-chan - excuseme, Professor Midori-chan - is being MVP already explaining games every episodeprobably knowing that she would chase the audience away if she also did it thefirst time playing it with the aunt (fourth wall explanations over here, so theycan explain it to the kid), but seriously, how is the kid not even aroused atthese onee-chan wearing their bikini under those thin shirts lmao. I'll betotally distracted by that and lose more times than Aya-chan btw lol. (I felt astrange awkwardness when they did not mention quite enough of chest size becauseMidori, she bares them all haha) (okay creep moment over let's move on) So forthis episode, the idea is teamwork, or to say, play smartly according to whatyour partner is doing on the other side of the table since it's alternate turnsand you don't play one after the other or together. Board game intinuition, theycall it. This episode also brought upon Miki's flashback on how she didn'tremember this game because once again, she got a bad impression of it when shewas a kid. Man, why everyone is bullying Miki-chan those people deserve to go tohell lol. And to wrap this game up, and just as an advice for any game? Don'ttell people "why you don't get it" without explaining why, especially onexceptions in game strategies. The victim will just either hate you or hate thisgame for life because they think it's too difficult for them. So yeah, teachthem. Games are supposed to be fun. If you lost interest then that's it.That's... what I know from experience anyway since I'm a boring man. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Anyways, the episode is fun, we did get to see the girls in the beach as much asit is rather lacking (not for Midori-chan it's not) (BOOM haha), but we now knowthis was all a plan for the aunt to spy on the niece in place of the mother toassess whether she has made good friends or not. Well, I can't think ofotherwise because this show isn't evil (well last episode maybe lol), butsuffice it to say "there is nothing to worry about it mom" because Miki-chan gotlucky, just like how she plays board games. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> What, you want me to talkmore about the girls half naked? *looks at them* Nah. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And next weeklooks like an episode I can really relate to, so I guess we can talk aboutbeta-testing of new games next time.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7XmclrWnfDI/XbunIp10ZMI/AAAAAAAA1oE/_7jfYB6PK1g8CIronCVV7mdilloEBfAPQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub05_aunt2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is basically all of us when we saw how wonderful this episode            was lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ENHAb-CD28Q/XbunJZyovkI/AAAAAAAA1oI/dHb9Ro_5coMeTYcIfjPJTkvCoJQ4NoQygCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub05_bath.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Miki-chan, who is that to your right? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />            (Ah, it's Midori-chan)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Well, if you don't care about everyone else    around you, then it isn't? Think about it.  </div></blockquote>But seriously, Itsuki. You did not create a solution; you just created moresociety problems. In this new episode (#Babylon04) of the new arc apparently, wetry to stop all this from happening. You know, at least, reverse the declarationor something since he's the mayor and can do whatever he wants now likelegalising suicide for whatever reason. So, before we go to the storytelling,and TL:DR; (why put it here though lol me) this episode is about the discussionabout general approach to stopping Itsuki in his actions in preparation for theparliamentary elections. Now to the noob politics talk which I promise I'll keepit to this episode. Firstly, Seizaki's team. He has been given rights toinvestigate the incident and to arrest Itsuki... but according to current laws,and it's the same in Shiniki. So traditional Japan laws, and not that we canpass a new law to arrest him now, current ones. Those that can't do much, thatis. So yeah, might as well learn new vocabulary since abetment is the focushere. Seizaki now had to gather as many investigators as he can to get to thetruth. Next, we have a new a character to introduce. She... she's a robot.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But Seizaki is right: she is any number of times more useful than Fumiohaha burning him even after he died lmao. She's Hiasa (so, so glad I can callyou by your first name because I'm not Seizaki lol), relative of the VicePresident of Justice, and an absolute genius in law, so this will make Seizaki'sjob easy since she's a walking encyclopedia. (Refer to postscript for personalopinions lmao) So yeah, he gathered the guys we've seen thus far, introduced usto... okay there are other new guys around but who cares haha (oh<a  href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DuG4-NdDCoc/Xbu1Kx9ddII/AAAAAAAA1o8/MpRwizBmpHcuAilHgmpYY7yeN0zZoN7oQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon04_torao.jpg"  target="_blank"  >this guy</a>, he looks like<a  href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ORnqvCdj07s/Xbu1op-O_AI/AAAAAAAA1pE/UdSimjSsvakhU0idh8FOWyrqFFkcWnaEgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/bleach220_68.jpg"  target="_blank"  >some Arrancar from BLEACH</a>for some reason lol) (I SWEAR HE'S AN ACCOMPLICE TO EVIL lmao), and with only 10days into the election and with Itsuki putting down election rules which willmake him win especially when he explicitly stated that candidates must talkabout the new suicide law (to be), this is going to get a lot of attention, butnot a lot of likes as of now, so at least the society has some level ofsalvation. Still, this needs to be stopped, and we might have less leads than wecan find. All 64 who jumped off the building can't be traced on motive, camerafootage of the city doesn't reveal much, and Itsuki is still missing as hedisseminates his announcements through online videos. To the end of the episode,the one special order of an undercover investigator who Seizaki hired has goodleads on Itsuki himself which will probably be discussed a lot next episode: thefact that he still can't be found, and he has a history he can't tell when hewas a student. That, and Magase Ai, it seems. So we shall find out. I mean, ifinfluence isn't the thing that ties everything up, I don't know what will. Soyeah, all in all this is turning out to be a fun investigation to watch, as muchas it might be fast-paced because Seizaki be like "let's go" and he got resultsimmediately shows how much power still is in his and Nomaru's hands, sohopefully things will continue to go well. Well, not until we realise Magasemight be some evil witch who can cast spells or something lol I mean isn't shenow? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Well technically there's that fall asleep forever brew lol) Weshall see for it ourselves. Be warned: his family and people around him might besacrificed at any moment's notice, so don't get attached to them too much.Itsuki does seem to take the psychological path though, but that doesn't mean itcan't lead to violence, so I'll be looking forward to that haha. Other thanthat, well... prove to me that this is a good story, Anime. I want to ensureItsuki's survival to the extent that he can't kill himself and lives foreverhaha he might be God now to those people though. Ahem, excuse me, those"idiots". <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> What, I can't insult them now? Come for me, dead people hahaokay that's quite enough I may be drugged or seduced soon lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d1irQngRnwQ/Xbu0x5hc6yI/AAAAAAAA1os/Vzy-UEog4do4pp-FEAM6Ua9T9bde8uN9gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon04_video.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When you make a <strike>shitty</strike> racist YouTube video lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q0IKsToLFtw/Xbu0yusUwyI/AAAAAAAA1ow/bPXc0fcP_MIaVXzwyeOdRfgbNMZHLcvBwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon04_meeting.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I'm that guy right there when the lecturer talks about the next            semester test lol<br />            (Yes, the one with the mouth open haha)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. *looks at Hiasa* Instead of working can we have s*x first?

So yeah, fumika this is as much as I willgive for now. <b>a flood of circle's 2011 album</b> came from listening to themon a live video, so... I haven't really decided whether to give other songs inthe album besides the one, so... maybe not I guess? I also got a listen to the<b>new theme songs from Anime "Babylon"</b> which were done by Q-MHz - the musicproducers group which is all the craze in Klassic Note like, 3 years ago lol -and... I liked the first one. The second one which was sung by Komatsu Mikako(yep, Mikakoshi) wasn't that great to be honest.<br /><br />Next week brings us <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> which... I mean, you heardthe music video preview, right? I guess I don't like her when she sings impactsongs haha. On the other hand,<b>Tomatsu Haruka's new music video preview</b> is really awesome consideringher having experience in singing Anime "Sword Art Online" opening theme songs isgiving her an edge, and I think I'll like the song when it comes out in a coupleof weeks. Other things on Twitter include<b>Yogee New Waves' new music video</b> for their EP due end of the year (meh)(haha), I like that<b>The Floor's indie releases are available on streaming</b> now because that'swhere I started to like them, <b>Ikimonogakari released a new song</b> which Ididn't like, and <b>miwa's new song</b> and probably single is going to be thenext Anime "BORUTO" opening theme song. And oh yeah, as a side note,<b  >I talked about indie rock band "iki" earlier and what happened to them on  Twitter</b>after I've not heard any news from them, and...<a  href="https://twitter.com/kohshiMNF/status/1190903265493311488"  target="_blank"  >you can look at the reply</a>from the vocalist yourself haha. I mean, you won't get famous just from metweeting your music video bro I'm just a nobody on social media<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay, I'm done. Also, I'm done with the Wanted List page by now so you guys cantake a look at that, I suppose. I think I also have a couple of drafted posts Ican catch up on so I'll see how that goes. Also, if anyone else is reading this,I'm doing an open appeal on people who know computer hardware to assist me in mynext upgrade for my PC. As you all might know, I'm still on Windows 7. Yeah,that antique of a treasure that's going to end support next year. So yeah, I'mjumping ship not because the new ship is good, but the old one is sinking. But Imay just end up changing out the system SSD and upgrade to Windows 10 and bedone with it but I'll see about it. I'm not free in time and in cash to do thisanyways. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... I wish I have somethingto bundle with that sphere- *ahem* new calendar I'm going to get for the newyear. Yeah, I gave it away, didn't I? Haha come back next week, would you?<br /><br />P.S. I... think we'll talk about things like Gekidan Sphere and the new "Sora noMethod" episode next week if I don't get subtitles for these by the nextissue.<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
