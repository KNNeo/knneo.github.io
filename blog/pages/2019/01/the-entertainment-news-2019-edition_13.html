Wow now that I look at the Anime reviews below I have real good impressions for
the first episodes apparently it's been a long time since I wrote this long of a
paragraph Kaguya-sama haha<br /><br /><a

  >OH LOVE ME MISTER~ OH MISTER~</a
>
haha okay I better stop<br /><br />And yeah not revamping this place just yet I
can't think of anything new because I've been reading up on CSS design styles
and seeing what I like. No, not Blogger themes. I can do coding myself. I don't
need no template haha the stock ones will do<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Okay in Natsuo's defense it really just kinda happened because he really had NO
IDEA until he like what, reached the girl's room? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> The first episode
(#DomeKano01) of this series which would require some background from my side
before you think why not watch "Koi to Uso" or "Kuzu no Honkai", is so good I
have to shelf half the quotes I want to comment on this episode alone. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>
Okay, background first. It's author Sasuga Kei's latest work which got famous
real quick (21 volumes of manga to date, Jesus) and turned into an Anime,
probably thanks to her first work "GE - Good Ending", which I would probably
compare to at this point as both stories are rather similar but the
circumstances for this one is a little different, and probably more accepting to
more as a drama plot. So, let's talk about it. The story mainly revolves around
three (I'm excluding Natsuo's friend lol) people: Natsuo is the main guy, Rui is
the girl he had it with, and Hina is the woman Natsuo likes. Hey, liking a
teacher isn't abnormal, people. It happens to every other Anime lol. Too bad
Hina is not interested in little boys yet haha. Hey, give him 5 years and he'll
be an adult, I assure you. Problem is, he is technically
<strike>in a relationship</strike> done it with her sister already, because she
was just curious the one time and now cannot get the man to forget about it. I
mean, if when they did it she was like dead meat it probably wouldn't have left
too much of an impression, but still. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> (She did say she doesn't know
anything, and the guy's a virgin, so...) (And that's why you find those who at
least did it once but not like, once every week lmao) Okay I'm drawing AV
references here already but as you can see, the show has many premises to make
jokes on lol, but more importantly, to talk about plot development. The only
thing I can foresee which would turn me off this series is the flashback of the
probably full sex scene that I'll have to watch to understand why it was
bothering Natsuo that much. (I mean, it's just <i>sex</i>) And that, I'm not
really looking forward to. (Again, for Anime I would like to watch content that
is as pure as possible) Besides that, the show is light-hearted, there are many
more characters alive besides these three (you know you suck when your dad can
pick up a woman better than you lol), and I'll be ready for more. This type of
shows are uncommon for my tastes, but I'll give this ten times over "Koi to
Uso", just so you know. Because I just feel this one was more palatable, and I'm
not referring to someone's pu**y lol okay but seriously I need to stop with the
sex jokes<br />

P.S. "I'm going to your room to search for dirty things!" And then she finds her

stating the obvious well then again it can ONLY happen in Anime, right?
<span title="*silence*">üòê</span><br />[On a final note, I would argue that this show has its charm in
terms of plot and cast (I'll take Yocchan AND Mayachi any time of the day) and
I'll be staying to watch whatever drama happens]<br />

But seriously if you thought this was a brain war between geniuses it's not. All
of them are idiots, the two of them. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And I'll be darned if this isn't a
romantic comedy series because without that narrator and because I saw the first
chapter of the manga I would argue that this show's momentun might be hard to
follow. Well, this is more like from the first part to be honest, but after that
I can get the drift. Maybe it does take a genius to understand this series lol I
wonder how people got into this school. Chika-chan MVP this whole series btw; I
said it here first. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay let's talk about what happened. In this first
episode (#KaguyaSama01) in the more than slice-of-life student council room
setting, we sit three people: Kaguya who is the main girl, Miyuki who is the
main guy, and Chika-chan <strike>the bi*ch</strike> the middleman who will make
or break this potential couple. I say "potential" because these two just have so
much pride that they will never confess to each other. I know, start another
series but let all the lovey-dovey stuff happen and we'll have a better series
than "Tada-kun" lol. Of course, this is not going to happen to any extent for
now as the two battle their wits on each other (which we'll talk about how
effective that will be) to see who can get the other to do it first. Heck, if
you do this strategising openly who the hell will confess? Just so you know, by
the way. Now, the real story. First up was Chika-chan who happens to have a
couple of tickets to a movie screening which according to her will get a couple
close together so she can't watch it (let's go, Chika-chan hehe). Miyuki starts
serving first, but both end up getting hit by the referee who left with the
ball. Manjuu, I mean. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> The exaggeration in the animations of thoughts on
both sides are seriously extended this part I assume for effect, but as first
time round watching and of course being spoiled on the manga it does feel slow.
So yeah, don't read the original work is my warning to you. Moving on to the
next one (I'll talk about the origin of the tickets later), Kaguya-sama got a
love letter from an anonymous person. Of course that is going to piss Miyuki
off, so he tries to stop her. Heck, even bringing out the "I'm going to tell
teacher" card (nice elementary school flashback btw lol) (totally necessary imo
haha) right here, but the girl doesn't care. She is going to make sure the guy
will give her that stereotypical call which she so desires but which he will
never deliver (Hint: It's called "Don't go") (oh yeah they animated that haha),
but ended up not getting any because Chika-chan chipped in. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Now you
know why this girl will be MVP? You know the show is good when you can predict
the outcome lmao. Lastly, it's the lunch, and it's #NotKoufukuGraffitti lol.
Okay now I can talk less about pride but more on the legit differences between
the two. Namely that Kaguya-sama eats the food
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/32798/Aria_Shichijou" target="_blank"
  >that one Seitokai Yakuindomo racked girl</a
>
eats too, and the other two in the room are commoners who happen to be smart and
come to this school, bringing in their own lunches. Hey, for this one I disagree
with the verdict tbh because Miyuki guessed the girl's thoughts totally wrong
and if Chika-chan did not offer her friend (I don't think they are now she's
just downright insulting her) (okay maybe lol) (NOT THE CHILDHOOD FLASHBACKS
haha) that one octopus weiner (*looks at own crotch*) Kaguya-sama may end up
crying in her bedroom lol. As I said, we're NOT going to get all the happy
endings in this series because the characters themselves hate it. Besides
Chika-chan, she wants it bad. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, great show to stick around if
the opening theme song wasn't the weirdest match I've heard in years (sorry to
the guy who sang it and Ikimono's Mizuno for writing this I forgot you write
these kinds of songs too didn't expect it to be in this show though) (please
halca-san may the ending theme be good next week lol), and I hope now that we
have first episode to warmup the pace of the show in terms of brain battle can
speed up just a bit. Or just make them smoke out of their heads that's fine too
haha. As a final note, it would seem to imply that Kaguya-sama will be the loser
in most cases since she is technically weaker in heart and will have to arrange
stuff (the tickets) as a rich family's girl (the food) in order to bring herself
down to get someone else to confess to her? It's going to be hard, Kaguya-sama.
I hope you're ready because I am haha<br />

P.S. "We are talking about Shinomiya who usually passes her time looking at me"
I had to listen to the VA to confirm the subtitles weren't wrong lol #Narcissism
(I think I did the confirmation thing multiple times this episode to see if the
fansubs are joshing me lmao)<br />P.P.S. This may be a very seiyuu technical
question, but wouldn't Ten-chan (Amamiya Sora) based on her real character in
front of the camera, be the perfect person to act Kaguya-sama? I don't know if

"So she eats meat and stuff" lol they thought Hotaru-chan has a pure sweets
diet. I mean how else can you raise that rack- Okay in the new chapter (136) the
guys are trying to organise a sleepover in view of the winter holidays starting,
and... Hotaru-chan decided to invite them to her place. Yeah. Well, her place in
ths countryside because she doesn't live here, but still. It's larger than your
average farm plot, which says something. Problem is everyone is expecting her to
come up with some dagashi thing in the hot pot session to start their stay,
and... it didn't happen. Well, it didn't happen till the end, of course. But
yeah, even then it's all normal. She eats meat in hotpot, she serves Hajime-san
beer left on her place since she doesn't drink (good girl, this one haha) and
even brings out more meat since she's the one eating them all lol. But of
course, as everyone thought of ending the session with noodles, Hotaru brought
out - you guessed it - a dagashi. Hey, it's normal her again! What did I tell
you, eh? Although I would argue her passion of dagashi is still there but hey,
it's not the only food in the world haha *looks at Hotaru*<br />

This was quite a week in Klassic Note, but I admit I didn't review the releases
soonoer so my opinion might still be biased since I haven't given any second
chances, but still. <b>Kotobuki Minako's new single</b> is fine, but nope it's
not going to be on my shelf because of a disappointing B-side. And I had to
ignore that dance pop tune (like, seriously) in order to give the topic song.
Melody's what important, people. <b>Aimer's new triple A-side single</b> must be
most overrated single in Japan right now since it's popular out there and not
over here. Oh well, see you next time, Aimer-san. You're getting nothing this
time round. I also concluded on a couple of releases I listened last week, so
<b>SHE's latest album</b> got some songs on the list which are interestingly not
topic songs, and yeah <b>fhana's best album</b> gets their latest song on my
list. *sigh<span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br /><br />Next week brings us
<b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> which I haven't anything yet, and since this is
the only release I've taken some initiative also since it's the start of the
year to update myself on new songs, and I have found quite a few. Though
Audioleaf brought me no new indie artists, I did get some familiar names back
with <b>vivid undress, Hata Motohiro</b>, and... well it's mainly these two, and
<b>The Floor's new mini-album</b> (and that's why I say must ignore music style
because this rock band also gone pop ugh) and they are pretty good so I'll be
sure to check those out. You may have seen me update my Twitter on these stuff
earlier today.<br /><br />On Twitter news, I found a lot to share, so let's see
how much I've remembered to like so I can talk about it here lol.
<b>Anime "Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai" opening theme</b> must be the most normal
retro song I can give without remembering the reference lol, miwa is apparently
overseas busking just like YUI for some reason,
<b>Kuso Iinkai is disbanding</b> and ending it with a best album in two weeks
(WHY??) (well I can guess why they aren't popular enough tbh), it is confirmed
now that <b>SCANDAL's new shift towards a private music label</b> is actually
under Victor Entertainment as they join the major label's rock festival (So they
left Sony Music Japan liao? Very confusing now tbh), and in a direct comparison
of <b>Taketatsu Ayana's new music video</b> versus
<b>Minase Inori's new music video</b> I might just only review the latter.
Sorry, Ayachi. It's the song.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I guess this is it
then. If I forgot anything I'll blame it on my brain's constant thought of that
stupid work I just received to end the week. I know, right? My superior must
hate me lol haha not really lah my office is an amicable environment and is way
better than many others already to be honest. Cya guys next week then, and until
next time... God if I can skip every week to watch Anime now BUT DAMMIT WHY GOT
COMPANY TRIP NEXT WEEK!!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Well, guess I'll have to watch Anime in Batam
then haha
