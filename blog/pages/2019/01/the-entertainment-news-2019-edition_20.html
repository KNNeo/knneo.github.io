I assure you. And I thought ofwatching the shows below at some point in the trip. I really did. It did nothappen because I was too tired all the time lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DomeKano02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;"> Domestic na Kanojo</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "What are you going to do about that?" I mean, the step sibling thing or the    sex? BOOM GOT HIM  </div></blockquote>So that means if I just sat there long enough I'll get kissed? Then why therush? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay on the super dramatic cliffhanger that left us literallyhanging, in this new episode (#DomeKano02) we got a new transfer student?Really?? In the most stereotypical twist to any Anime storyline, Rui joins theschool Natsuo is in because it's nearby their common accomodation. That's it.And... she kind of got some friends thanks to him too, so... yeah, forget aboutthe sex, yes? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Seriously, I thought there was going to be a secondround in the bathroom but that was Natsuo's imagination lol) More importantly,we got some more insight into Hina-nee's affairs, namely whatever is going onwith her boyfriend. I mean, if it's not obvious enough to you, it's not goingwell. And yes, we are likely going to reach the point of Natsuo being thesubstitute real soon (I'm not saying that it's impossible), but for now Hina-neeis keeping it mum. Whether that is good news or not, I'll leave you to thinkabout it. Suffice it to say, it has to reach a conclusion at some point, whichwe will see soon I guess. All in all, Hina-nee sucks at cooking (how you gonnabe good waifu?), Rui may become best girl by the end of this season lol (I mean,you saw how great she looks from above? lol) (I never thought I'll say this, butfor once I wanna sex an Anime character haha), and we kind of have enoughpremise for this to be a harem. Hey, we need more accidents in this series sothat we can get to the level of relationship between Natsuo with Rui that is ofher to the sister too hehe WHAT, I CAN'T BE IN THE SAME BATHROOM WITH ANY OF THETWO?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NqXwQvchsmc/XERvBheiOYI/AAAAAAAAtVU/67FDA-gvhs4l8CEc8uVNxABtDl6R-J_5ACLcBGAs/s320/domekano02_rui1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is the most suspecting face you're gonna see Rui in this series            lol<br />(If Diomedia is doing one every episode I'll do this every            episode I promise)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Sgkw2ZlDqDI/XERvFw21NTI/AAAAAAAAtVY/3Q-MPWhpRlUP29azUg-_uRrsqSzvqFUsQCLcBGAs/s320/domekano02_smile.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW I didn't catch the conversation, I'm not interested in it AND I            don't want to reveal myself to others          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "If I cause more trouble again, I'm sorry" Natsuo be like "I'll be in yourhands" haha (Edit: I WAS RIGHT LMAO I LOVE THIS SERIES)<br />P.P.S. I know it'sonly me, but man is it irritating that Hina-nee keeps reminding me of<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/28/Yui_Horie" target="_blank"  >Horie Yui</a>instead of her actual voice actress<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Yoko_Hikasa" target="_blank"  >Hikasa Youko</a>. I mean, their nicknames are close, but still.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KaguyaSama02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;"> Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "This past half year was wasted because he wasn't using LINE" This past half    year was wasted because he's a fucking pu-  </div></blockquote>"I'll change my profile picture in three minutes" Wow I didn't believe thiswould have much impact as fast as me cooking a cup of instant noodles but man,Shirogane, you just blew my mind haha. In the new episode (#KaguyaSama02) ofthis narrator-heavy series (I know, I'm forgiving it and you should too it's forcomedic effect anyways), Chika-chan continues to remind all of us - especiallythe two of them - how fast time flies when you don't do anything about it. Itbeing that confession. Or well, driving a confession out of each other, butstill. We start of the episode strong with Miyuki getting a smartphone? Justremind me again but WHAT YEAR IS IT?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Again, another wonderful schemefrom Kaguya-sama to make sure he gets it, but again it's the problem about howthey can get each other's number, or<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ãƒ¡ãƒ¼ãƒ«ã‚¢ãƒ‰ãƒ¬ã‚¹" target="_blank"  >mail address</a>as they call it in Japan. I know, it's hard, right? I mean, as fellow clubmembers it's as easy as opening a WhatsApp group (ask the kids today so see ifI'm right), but for these two it HAS to be tough. Well, mainly because someonehasn't changed her phone yet lol. Then, there's the summer trip plan. I knowthis is supposed to be the work of the Anime production itself and not thoughtout by the 2D characters themselves (lol breaking the fourth wall here, me), butyeah we're stuck between going to the mountains or the beach. I'll skip myargument for the mountains because someone's so weak he can't swim AND he'sscared of bugs (I mean, I'm more worried about bears lol), and instead go to theargument of having a potential beach episode in the future. I know about what arich girl can stack onto that poor guy to make sure he has no way to escape thatchoice as she can get everything covered (lol the manual) (you're reaching avery high creepiness level, Kaguya-san). Yeah, it's going to be the beach afterall. I mean, beach as in b**ch because Kaguya forgot the wildcard. The jokerfrom the opening animation. The only other female in the student council who hasa larger rack than she has. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yes, you know who I'm talking about. Soyeah, and suddenly their decsions changed. Like, copying each other's reasonschanged. It got changed even more when they noticed just how Chika-chan isinterested in the paranormal. Like really, what do you normally do outside ofschool? I feel like it's that one<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/7/Orihime_Inoue" target="_blank"  >Inoue Orihime</a>but not on food and worse haha. (Can we get a Chika-chan focused episode,please?) (And no we don't need a beach episode for that haha) Lastly, there'sthe love advice. As much as Shirogane Miyuki can't keep his ego up as much ashis appearance of being experienced in the love field (#Genius #<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/baka"  target="_blank"  >Baka</a>btw), this guy literally lied through a session of someone asking him about aconfession. Yeah, that situation to which he hasn't done it at all yet. (Dejavu, anyone?) (Just another reminder half a year has passed and NOTHING hashappened to those two btw) As much as Shirogane is totally mistaken about loveantics and observations (Kaguya was most likely right about that Kashiwagi girlon that guy) (Kashiwagi MVP this episode btw<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/152051/Nagisa_Kashiwagi"  target="_blank"  >real cute girl there</a>haha) (yes, voiced by Mocho), he was somewhat honest in front of others eventhough we all know someone was eavesdropping behind his back. About that,Shirogane you didn't notice Kaguya behind the door quick enough. I'll take thatas a confession two episodes in, guys. We did it. It's over. Kaguya is happy nowwith that one kabedon. Just the one. We're never going to get another one asclose as this. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (How can he not hear her scream though? Or was that forour ears only? Haha thanks anyway) All in all, still funny, please cut down onthe narrator stuff unless where necessary (The "Umi versus Yama" bit was prettygood, I'll give you that, but otherwise the intro was really long), and I reallyneed more Kaguya-sama moments. I feel that she (Koga Aoi specifically hehe) canmake me like her more before I accidentally make a Chika-chan GIF every episodebtw ONE GIF COMING RIGHT UP lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yzQXmZJ5Ego/XER7aKsGDUI/AAAAAAAAtVw/a9y79ka8xsoGNrMhCkq_4INf9_0G1CC9gCLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama02_mountains.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I know we're getting the beach episode, so... can we have a mountain            one too? hehe          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="180"              data-original-width="320"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qS4jMHHMBIE/XER-9K-NV0I/AAAAAAAAtV8/tfXVY_tsutwXFb0RLGKAKw9ZJz4J6utSgCLcBGAs/s1600/kaguyasama02_confused.gif"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Didn't expect to see confusion to be perfected, but here we are.            <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. REALLY?? THIS IS GOING TO BE THE F**KING INTRO EVERY WEEK??? Ugh Aniplexyou disgust me (Edit: DID I DOWNLOAD THE WRONG EPISODE??? Oh I didn't so wtf)<br />P.P.S.I would like to emphasise to you, Kaguya-sama, that you can just collude withChika-chan and you'll get everything. Bento, phone number, a confession...everything.<br />["You want to be my what?" &lt;= Me when someone talks loveusing astronomy lol]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;"> This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>I'm going to be really quick here since I didn't spend much time listening tosongs over the weekend. There's<b>that theme song for some local drama</b> (which is in Chinese) that I'minterested in which will get into the list once I can find out which album itbelongs to or not lol, I finally got to review<b>yanaginagi's best album</b> and I ended up keeping the one who almost gotaccepted because I thought the song was weak in general. I'll probably give itmaybe haha. <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> is a major disappointment as Iliterally took it to compare with her previous single back in 2017, and it's farcry. So yeah, next time Ten-chan; it's not your fault, by the way.<br /><br />Nextweek brings us that cat music video song which is<b>the mini-album from Fuchigami Mai</b> which will also be my first releasereviewing from her and hopefully I'll get something out of it besides that catsong maybe, and <b>Minase Inori's new single</b> which for once doesn't sound asbad as her past three singles and beyond lol. Ugh, I really need more mainstreamartists to give me new songs. Nope, I'm not looking at you THE ORAL CIGARETTESyou already disappointed me with that Anime tie-up.<br /><br />On Twitter whichI'll leave you to click the links from my profile page (actually I may just dothat Moments thing and it'll be easier for you guys),<b  >Hanazawa Kana's upcoming album next month has got like half of Sony Music  Japan's artists writing for her</b>including Chatmonchy, we're getting<b>another single in March from KANA-BOON</b>,<b>Numakura Manami's 2nd album topic song</b> from the preview isn't all thatbad, I suddenly jumped into <b>vivid undress</b> a couple of days ago whichreminds me to listen to their new mini-album which should appear next week (oopsshould've listed it above) and I still can't stop listening to that AnimeKaguya-sama opening theme song. The ending song wasn't that great, by the way.But halca-san, I may just give you this time around. Second time's the charm,they say.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I've rope burn on two of my fingersand typing now is quite a pain so I'll wrap up for now. Cya guys next week and Ipromise I'll write more next time. Until then... don't travel. It's boring asheck and you can't do the things you like mostly. I mean, even sleeping until Ican skip hotel breakfast? I JUST WANNA SLEEP!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> *yawn* Have a good nightI had a good one though hehe the resort's only 4-star and it's Batam so not thatgood tbh<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
