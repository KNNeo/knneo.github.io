Okay this week is going to be the most boring week here ever so I'll make a
short post on this one. Also, I've not planned to revamp this column just yet
until maybe next week so we shall see about that lol<br /><br /><br /><br />

The new (translated) chapter (135) things got real serious. Yeah, like asking
about your past serious lol. Kokonotsu didn't understand the meaning of
"mother's taste" and... I guess You-san is trying to avoid the conversation
because the kid didn't have a mother now. She left the family, apparently. So is
Hajime-san, who was instructed to not talk about it with him. Hotaru, however,
has other opinions. Well, she kind of nicely mentioned about what it is even
though I don't think that is it (imo mother's taste refers to her cooking if I'm
not wrong) and also jogged Kokonotsu's memory a bit. Is the next arc about the
mother? Wow now you're getting me hooked. Also, new season Anime material right
there haha<br />

I didn't do much this opening week in Klassic Note. Well, the opening week is
next week so now I'm just finding songs to put in the new list for now to start
with an initial set of songs, and
<b>SHE'S seems to be quite a candidate</b> from the couple of artists I listened
to just today haha. <b>fhana's best album</b> wasn't that interesting as usual
so I might just give their newest song a chance if I'm in the mood. SHE'S and
their previous album was okay, so I might want to give a couple. Some of them
have the vibes from their latest single which made quite a scene in Klassic Note
last year.<br /><br />Next week brings us a couple of singles to start the year
and Klassic Note, namely <b>Aimer's new single</b>,
<b>Kotobuki Minako's new single</b>, and <b>yanaginagi's best albums</b> which I
hope I'll be able to hear it firsthand on Apple Music. We shall see. Otherwise I
may just rummage the Internet to make a cheap compilation myself without the new
songs maybe lol. Or I can just listen to some indie artists while I wait. Been
some time since I visited Audioleaf, to be honest.<br /><br />On Twitter over
the new year, many news were announced.
<b>Ikimonogakari announced their return</b> with a new digital single to start
the year, the
<b>Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" got their theme songs confirmed</b> (more concerned
about the awesome new season) (happening next season though),
<b>NEGOTO announced their disbandment</b> as mentioned in the Artists Evaluation
post if you didn't notice and I hope they'll end with a release of sorts please,
and
<b >many artists are included for review on their releases for upcoming months</b
>
including SHE'S, FINLANDS, Hanazawa Kana, Natsukawa Shiina and so on.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That
shall be it then. If you want to read more text or help me proof read lol you
can head to the Artists Evaluation post to see how the artists in Klassic Note
2018 fared. Mostly not good haha. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully then I
can ask Kaguya-sama out on a date haha you idiot if you don't I'll do it hehe
bye
