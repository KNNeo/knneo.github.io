I only got that long of a cooldown time solet's be quick haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DomeKano10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Domestic na Kanojo</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I assume that teachers don't have a lot of absences..." I mean Miu-chan,    sensei are also human, you know. They gotta take a break and f**k sometimes    lmao  </div></blockquote>Wait so Natsuo broke his leg?? How is he going to s*x the teacher now?? Oh, it'snot his third leg? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> The new episode (#DomeKano10) of this... they stillgoing on huh, with the lies. Wait till you notice that knowing the truth aboutall the feelings around these people that'll probably make us jump as wecontinue to enjoy the honeymoon period of love that is between Natsuo and Hina.Okay, it didn't last that long anyways haha. But firstly, about Kiriya-sensei.Yep, he was a novelist. So in the days after the school festival (maid cafe? lolAl) where he took absence from school, he was actually working. He got thisother job covered from the school though (like someone else's relationship lol<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span>) but yeah, he was most definitely not feeling well. Well, from lack ofsleep to finish the novel, to say the least haha. And then, we move on to thereal topic this week - Natsuo breaking a leg. Not going to keep drawingreferences to his d*ck (lol) or the phrase "break a leg" (lol x2), but sufficeit to say it was Miu-chan who nudged him down the stairs. Yeah Miu-chan, don'tpromise that you'll do anything in return, please. The medical fees are enoughlol. *looks at Natsuo's classmates* (He can't deal with that many women anywaylmao) Anyways, this will kind of put a hold to his frequent trips to Hina'splace if you recall she moved to live alone and would like some company haha,but yeah, he's been lying even before then. Well, at least, to Rui-chan. I betthe parents also don't know, but technically the stepsister is of concern here.(Okay I'm not going to play with your brain by saying he's lying to hisstepsister to be with his stepsister haha) On the many occsions that Natsuo"went to (his friend) Furuya's place" he did not even cover his own tracks, andthat Rui-chan already found out the moment he went to the cafe the friend worksin and chatted with him for like a minute. So yeah, like every guy who is in asecret relationship, he came up with another terrible lie. Sorry Momo-chan hewill NEVER go to your place ever again haha. Surprisingly, Rui-chan believed inall that. Not that she'll be downright furious to do nasty things to ruin hislife as she found out the truth, mainly also because that they are family andshe likes him too, so... It was kind of complicated. But yeah, he did get foundout. Turns out fiction imitates life as you continue to write about your lovelife on paper and people can go to your room to read it lol. Still, brings us toa good stalemate as to what will happen next. Will Rui forgive Natsuo foreverything up till now considering he also didn't mention about his first love(infatuation, as of back then) to her? What will Hina-chan do then? I'm stillassuming the parents do not know about all this, by the way. As Furuya hasmentioned, it's going to be hard covering the truth, as Natsuo confidentlystated otherwise since a couple of episodes ago. The story is about to get someform of conclusion, I don't think all the girls will be involved in it (Miu-chanis already busy with Kiriya-sensei and Momo is busy studying lmao), but at leastamong the main three... this is going to end up in a 3P I'm sure they are justSELLING the s*x to us at this point lol *looks away*<br />[Just to end, thisshow was animated by DMM pictures, and if you need more help understand what DMMis up to in the adult movie industry please research at your own risk haha]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1z682-JYXBM/XI32K62r6yI/AAAAAAAAvA4/JFwt-AJ2-pgOR5IyvtVfiuZhS5Fh_nBXQCLcBGAs/s320/domekano10_knobbed.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The animation team when they hire a 3-year-old as intern for a week            lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n97cbu8OBJ4/XI32K8krNtI/AAAAAAAAvA0/8uUkbwoe12IU2VX6h1vOS4kXruQAZCh0QCLcBGAs/s320/domekano10_wallpaper.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Hina-chan please be my waifu haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. TIL it's Akamori High School lmao I have no idea about the school name atall tbh <strike>too distracted by all the SEX</strike> haha<br />P.P.S. "Withthat leg, you probably can't <u>satisfyingly</u> clean your body, right?" Yep,that was the REAL translation from Japanese, by the way. Emphasis on the adverbhaha (the English translation isn't wrong though)<br />[God, this is so wrong Ihave to hide<a  href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gQlCp1c4UUA/XI4Cx6c4xOI/AAAAAAAAvBc/SpdS2TQ-wLAGZ_dJgACspDfchmKifjPUwCLcBGAs/s1600/domekano10_rub.gif"  target="_blank"  >all this sin that I've created</a>]<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KaguyaSama10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "If he didn't do anything to her, that'll piss her off too" You know,    #TsundereProblems haha WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL CONTACT HERE PEOPLE lol  </div></blockquote>Uh oh who let out such a scoop to the school about Shirogane visiting Kaguya ather place?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, too many things to talk about in this new episode(#KaguyaSama10) so let's try to touch on all of them. Firstly, the conflict.Well, if you guys remembered the best episode of this series (lol) from lastweek the two got into bed. And nothing happened. But it became news in theschool for some reason (I doubt so, the Shinomiya family should have enoughmoney to seal mouths haha) so that's kind of a problem. Then, there's the giftfrom the headmaster. Well, technically Ishigami you're right in letting thePresident eat his share since he said there were only two in the room (doingwhat, I wonder) so there are only that many pieces of cake, but heck did thecourtesy turn into conflict really fast. And it lasted an hour too. As Ishigamiwent to get help which was probably the worst decision ever, the two almost wentfrom fighting to kissing by feeding each other a bite haha I love this show. Butyeah, expected that wildcard from that far away from the corridor already lmao.Then, there's advice. I don't know about you guys, but hey, all's well endswell, I guess. And don't ask about what the definition of "well" is, becausethere isn't much. Kashiwagi was right about everything until it hit Kaguya sobad that she doesn't know she's a tsundere lmao, and Ishigami just read too manyromantic comedy novels to know anything about romance haha. So yeah, Shiroganekind of apologised by noticing he did kind of take advantae of Kaguya (you jerk)(lol) by touching her lips? Give me a minute. *watches episode 9*<strike>And so he did.</strike> Nope he didn't. And I'm not going to check themanga for it but he didn't. But yeah, we don't know what happened in between,that's for sure. So yeah, Kaguya gave him a return so they are even so...Lastly, summer vacation. I know it's a little late to play this like, towardsthe end of the series maybe, but hey, time to think of whether to go to themountains or the beach again- Oh we not doing that anymore? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And amongstall things, Chika-chan has her own plans for travelling overseas so that sucksthey don't have a wildcard middle person to link those two together, but still.(I hate how right the author and the narrator are about going on trips togetheras mixed or else it'll be boys team and girls team all summer) Ishigami decidedto hang out with the guys since he's a first year and probably won't see themsoon unless they want to fail and get retained like him too lol, but yeah,thanks for allowing some meetup to happen. So yeah, next week is about summerfestival? (FIREWORKS!!! lol KAGUYA TRIGGERED haha) I much want a theme park onebut hey, beggars can't be choosers. In such a show where even (arranging to)hanging out is scarce, I'm going to take anything even if it's just licking apinky's worth of cream off that shortcake lmao<br />[Note: Kashiwagi is MVP ofthis episode, by the way. And every episode she appears in amirite Mocho??<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ry481rQMn3U/XI4BGIQWdPI/AAAAAAAAvBI/s5U2MlNRwNwstUBdwn-1vv-rDFyWv247wCLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama10_news.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            You think local media in Japan will do something like this too?

TuesdayI declared <b>Indie Week</b> in Klassic Note even though it's just that one daywhich I went back to<a href="http://www.audioleaf.com" target="_blank">Audioleaf</a> to listen tosome indie artists to be honest, haha. So yeah, picked up a couple of notableones including <b>synchre</b> which might go in my alley for instrumental tunesalbeit the electronic or techno theme present, <b>Ghost Sense</b> is bestcontender for best artist I've heard all week AND they are on YouTube, and<b>PastelQuartet</b> is... a more boring version of fhana probably haha. Thelast one I'll probably give it a miss, I suppose.<br /><br />Wednesday wasdeclared <b>Takigawa Alisa Day</b> in Klassic Note (lol) after<a  href="../../2019/03/the-klassic-note-review-201903-issue-1.html"  >that single review</a>I did the night before, so I went ahead and listened to two releases, namely herfirst major album and her mini-album after that. I have a feeling I just gotduped into following her 2nd album with the new single which might release soonwithin the year, but nonetheless, I tried to give her chance. Mostly due to theother releases for the week that I listened, this might be on hold for now asher compositions did not hit me as much as the single did, to be frank.<br /><br />ThursdayI went ahead and listened to <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES new single</b> and<b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new album</b> and obviously, the latter got way moreattention. It feels like a joy going back to listen to Mia-san sing again. Thesongs which was inspired from novels she wrote (which I could not findunfortunately) were immediately in my list, as explained from that one Tweet asI gave both of them a listen on YouTube and said "see you next year" and wow didit come back quick haha. Friday was just a revision trip haha but I did alsolisten to <b>Shinkuu Hollow</b> on Koga Aoi's recommendation (well she retweetedthe band, so...) and it wasn't bad. Not going to be considered for this weekthough. I also went ahead to give more of a listen to the indie artists which Ihear the playlist from Audioleaf only which is limited, and I probably gaveanother song from Ghost Sense.<br /><br />My weekend was spending trying to giveTakigawa Alisa songs but to not much progress. Next week then, Alisa-san.<br /><br />Nextweek brings us long awaited <b>Yogee New Waves new album</b> even though I didnot give much attention on their new topic song just yet. I think I'll have themood to listen to them soon, thanks to a recent (well last month) listen totheir live performance on some of the new and old tunes which I did not give.I'll also probably listen to <b>Rie's new album</b> which will technically beher first English album in UK, so I better not keep my hopes too high I wantJapanese songs you know lol<br /><br />On Twitter,<b>Ikimonogakari released a new song</b> to celebrate their major debutanniversary which got myself some attention from this other guy who didn't knowyet (lol not like I know too it just appears on my feed and I just click lmao),I will hold back on listening to <b>LuckLife's new single</b> preview for theAnime impression, and <b>Uesaka Sumire's new music video</b>... I think theintro and outro for this post will speak for itself haha also below *fap fapfap* Haven't done it though to be honest, fapping to her.
