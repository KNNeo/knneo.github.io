Hey... Did you see my latest post before this? Yeah it took a Saturday afternoon
to post all those images of three photobooks haha<br /><br />Anyways, welcome
back. And if you really need some love from the TrySail girls, either see my
previous post or go watch their new music video. Either of them is sure to make
me happy (song title pun not intended), and I've seen both of them haha<br /><br />On
a side note since I'm not reviewing manga here now, embarrassed Sayashi giving
Kokonotsu his Christmas gift is the best. I want that scene to happen in Anime
so I can love Numakura Manami again hehe<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Must be the father who stole her underwear lmao I mean who else you gonna
suspect? Haha in the new episode (#DomeKano08) we finally got to some form of
conclusion, and yes it has been a long time coming, and I'm happy with that.
Finally, we get to hear Hina-chan's feelings. But firstly, let's talk about that
underwear thief. This part of the story introduces us to Al, some foreign
transfer student who apparently breaks school rules in the weekends by cycling
along the building alleys lol, can catch a thief (with some help from Natsuo)
and... likes Rui-chan on first sight. Hey, it would prove to be some competition
here from here on but more importantly, again emphasizing the feelings between
Natsuo and Rui. I mean, we kind of know about Rui but what about Natsuo? He
can't keep saying he's kissing and stuff to forget about other things. (We'll
draw that parallel with Hina-chan later haha) So yeah, Al got rejected real fast
albeit how indirect that query was passed to Natsuo instead of asking the girl
himself. I'm expecting some follow-up here because this is a harem and Natsuo is
in it, so... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> On the other hand, we come back to Hina-chan and her
relationship with Natsuo now, I guess? Again, without locked doors, it's sooner
or later Hina will have to witness the two other siblings kissing each other,
and Rui of course did explain of her infatuation towards the boy ("let me talk
about what happened BEFORE our families were connected" lol I don't think she
mentioned that) and Natsuo? Let's just say Hina-chan had enough of whatever
potential incest is happening in this house and decided to move out. Well, or so
we think that's the reason. Then again, it was not at all wrong, just... she's
lying to herself once again. So blah blah last family outing to summer festival
and Hina dropped her phone into the water (okay I give this plot twist a 9/10 in
accuracy but 1/10 in originality haha) and then decided to cling on to Natsuo
only finding out that the boy wants the real answer from her about why she
decided to leave the family abode. And of course, it took quite a while to get
everything together especially Hina, and finally she spoke her mind out. Good
thing to know, the love between Hina and Natsuo is mutual. If you need
speculation ever since they moved in together, here's your answer confirmed.
That, and now that Rui is backing off on the kissing lol, we may get a change of
pace. Hey, I'm not suggesting otherwise, but isn't it about time we get that
full flashback onto Rui's first experience with Natsuo? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay let's not
press on too much
<strike>on Natsuo's di</strike> about this initial clickbait of a plot because
we may have more other things to deal with, like you know, enjoying so much
mutual love (Natsuo =&gt; Rui?) under one roof haha. To end this week, Rui-chan
is right: they aren't blood-related. And since the parents probably f**ked (I
guess not at their age, but still) why not their kids? Hey, no restrictions I
suppose, right? Someone check the legislation in Japan for me please lol (Also,

Just a reminder to all out there: Kaguya just needs to confess to Miyuki and
they go out and it'll be done. All of them. All will return to her, whatever
happiness and relationships she desires. I'm sorry Chika-chan haha on this new
episode (#KaguyaSama08) we shall talk about people's sisters because... why
not?? Haha specifically, we talk about Shirogane's sister Kei, and hey did it
get the attention of prospective sister-in-law Shinomiya Kaguya quickly lol, as
Kaguya tries real hard to think of ways to be called sister in some way. You
know, if she ever <strike>gets married</strike> marries the family lol. So yeah,
but however it all came in vain once she notices how far she is from the goal,
as Kei has already a social circle around her surrounded by, you guessed it,
that rack of a friend Chika-chan haha. So yeah, it may be hard, but as I
mentioned above, all she has to do is start with a confession. Well, I mean,
drawing out a confession from the brother is also one way to deal with it, but
the former takes less time. You know, it's just this *flicks finger* fast.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And yes I thank the production for the introduction to Kei, and yes we
finally get some feel of what it is like to talk about your sister's affairs
haha (flashback to episode 6 I think?). And yes, we got a glimpse of the
Fujiwara family of sisters. Hey, three times the charm, guys. Okay now I want a
side series of those ladies lol. Moving on, we talk about final exams. Since
none of those geniuses in the student council room can afford to be bad at their
studies, the two both had to kinda lie to each other on how to take their exams
less than seriously which they do, in which Chika-chan is the only victim on
this since Ishigami doesn't give A F**K haha more on that later. Still, it's
pretty obvious that Shirogane, who relies heavily on hard work to achieve his
top student results, that keeping his reputation at that level whilst likely
only fighting against Kaguya who might study less than him since she's a genius
will be really tiring, to be honest. Hey, don't say it's not a challenge
especially when you like the girl too hehe. For Kaguya though, I would say it's
hard, but if you want to insert another comment here about the feminism required
to be included in this Japan-based work you've got another thing coming.
Although I would argue for this story it's written to make sure work-hard
Shirogane can stand a chance of you know, being with nobles or rich people like
Kaguya. So yeah, I would say otherwise there. Lastly, we do a flashback of the
stuff we just saw? Okay, sure. As the exam system in Shuchi'in Academy is kind
of normal maybe, getting repeated in school is as fast as failing twice in
succession, so yeah, Kaguya's not going to let that happen to Ishigami even
though he doesn't care. Well, I assume it's for Shirogane who probably can't do
accounting somehow lol, but hey, be grateful, peasant. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I mean, that's
all I got from the whatever torture scene we get from Kaguya that Ishigami is
not grateful for (<a

haha) so... No romantic references whatsoever, by the way. We're totally clean
here lol Kaguya needs to learn to play video games it's good for bonding with
Chika and Kei by the way haha.<br />

Since I've watched all three of them now, I shall talk about them here. (Well if
I find more I'll watch, but for now) The first of them (#AsobiAsobaseSP01) is
about
<strike>Hina</strike> Hanako-chan's brother (lol thinking about the voice
actress) who likely because he's a genius of a student, doesn't spend some
playing around at all. Sad life as a kid I would say, and I can argue it's
because of the sister lol (yeah the family is depending on you, sir), but still,
once in a while hanging out with your sibling ain't bad. That's... my
relationship with my sister, but yeah, mine doesn't ruin everything unlike this
sister haha. Next up (SP2), they play a round of arm wrestling, the club
members. Of course the teacher lost first even though she suggested it lmao, but
the other two out of three matches were worth mentioning. (Yeah Hanako was the
weakest haha) Olivia vs Hanako was basically a free win to Hanako (lol) because
of a certain reference that I swear I've not heard of so I probably shouldn't
ask I'm not into yaoi anyway hahahaha and Olivia vs Kasumi was supplemented by
Aozora's appearance and Olivia used her to her own advantage. You know, those
things you shouldn't get aroused to as a middle school girl lol (I was slightly
aroused by Kohara Konomi's voice tbh SHE DID THAT VOICE?? haha). In the end?
They probably all lost to Aozora I assume.<br />

Last but not least was the OAV which just means if you buy our disced releases
you'll get to see this, and it's about cosplay and computers, it seems. Cosplay
isn't actually cosplay, but they got to dress up for the school festival after
somehow submitting their production, and the three each came up with very
different stuff. Hanako wanted to be in the 90s lol, Olivia wanted to dress as a
traditional maid, and Kasumi wanted to dress in a sailor outfit, those
schoolgirls one. And so they did, but apparently in acquiring those accessories
Maeda may have done a little too much. With no time to worry about legal issues
lol, the girls try them out, and as cute as they go Hanako probably needs to go
to the hospital with all those leg scars lmao. Computers is actually about using
a time capsule, where the teacher and two other friends who were in the school
(one of them bearing that abomination of a kid, if you recall) had just seen
technology pop up in the 90s, and decide to write a letter to their future self,
15 years from then. I mean, if you need to guess what the teacher wrote even
though you forgot I'm not letting you second guess because she still wants to
get married today anyways. Remember "KEKKON SITAI"? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And yeah the
computer was removed, no surprise, if you didn't guess the ending right as I did
lol<br />

This week was quite a busy week as a follow up to last week of course, but I did
get a new artist into my list, so that's interesting for now.
<b>Hanazawa Kana's new album</b> came to a conclusion as I give like 3 songs,
quite a lot since that one album back in 2015 so that's good considering it's
all written by different artists, I guess.
<b>Numakura Manami's new album</b> was a hard give, so I gave most of the hype
songs as much as I can since that's her strong point, so she gets a 3 songs
insertion into my list too. New songs this week include
<b>Suzuki Masayuki's latest single</b> which was for Anime "Kaguya-sama" and...
I'm not giving the B-side of Ikimonogakari cover since I've given before, and
this one is not on tune mainly to accomodate his lower male pitch. Hey,
Kiyoe-san did it better, so... no? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I've also chanced upon
<b>MaRuRi to Ryuga's major debut mini-album</b> after a promotion video from
that one livestream I watched, and man is this good. The closest resemblance I
can give in terms of style is fumika, and this one's a duo in vocalist. So yeah,
that's where I'm starting from, I guess. <b>TrySail's new album</b> didn't come
exactly on time, and I shall wedge this between the first album and the second.
Even then, I have only given the topic song so that's not good news so far. I'll
try to give another song if I can get over how terrible the composition is
lol<br /><br />Next week brings us a couple of releases which I should pay
attention to after this week. <b>FINLAND's new EP</b> was good for the topic
song and I can't wait to hear more to be honest,
<b>Takigawa Alisa's new single</b> for Anime "DomeKano" has proven to me this
week that I should also consider the B-side as insert songs for the show, and I
shall for next week. We shall see if it can get on my shelf. I think it can.
First review this year, people; I said it here first.
<b>Coalamode's new single</b> may be the least interesting among the others, but
heck, I'll try to give it because I literally threw away their 2nd album and I
feel bad about it. Besides, I've not heard anything so clean slate? Best part
about this week is, all of them will be available (I hope) on Apple Music on day
of release! Yay!! My utopia has been created! Well, probably only this week
haha<br /><br />On the latest news in Twitter,
<b>mol-74 is releasing their 1st full album</b>&nbsp;following their major debut
announcement with SME Records (why) so that'll be fun,
<b>negoto announced a best album</b> to conclude their journey as a band with a
last new song (I hope it's good I need a memory to live by) (and don't be like
LILI LIMIT lol), <b>Niitsu Yui's new song</b> for her three-month single release
is out and is... not great, and <b>Scenarioart has announced a new song</b> with
a trailer? I don't know man, I need a more solid announcement than that. I bet
you guys didn't watch their anniverary livestream on Periscope on Monday, right?
I kind of didn't either (I was just walking in and out) there was the other
mobile game livestream haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I guess this is it.
Man, I still feel so much for manga I feel bad to not talk about them here. Then
again, it's only that much of a handful which is why I decided to not continue
discussing them here. Really, I should move on to reading Japanese instead of
translated manga, I guess. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully by then I can
decide which video editing software I want to use to edit that Top 20 preview
video. I know, I have delayed that real long because of work or just I need more
time to rest haha good night everyone<i></i>
