Which is kinda good I guess.Then again I did spend less nights after work this week alone, so... maybe itfelt shorter? Oh well I don't want to type on this shit new keyboard for long solet's get to this lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DomeKano11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Domestic na Kanojo</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "From my side I kept pushing in on her, and she kind of gave in to it"    Sounds normal right there Natsuo HAHAHAHA&nbsp;  </div></blockquote>Talk about real genius right here it's gotta be Rui-chan amirite, Natsuo?Natsuo? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> On this whatever turnover of an episode (#DomeKano11) I have toturn my head over again? Okay, thank goodness this wasn't a porno lol. Let'stalk about the things that ARE great haha. Firstly, the school trip. Hey, wegotta. So yeah, the guys had a wonderful time, we saw pretty much everyone inswimsuit especially the females (yep Hina-chan included), wasn't that much hype,but still. Everyone had a wonderful time in Okinawa, they played at the beach,had great time shopping, and saw the fireworks. It was a wonderful time. But youknow who are having an even more wonderful time? No second guesses, haha.Anyways, let's talk about Rui. She got sad over what happened last episodeobviously, and yeah, she knows Natsuo can only have one lover and it's not her(I don't want to cue any songs to describe her situaiton now tbh), so shedecided to hate him for it. Well, Rui is right about why people do that to theirexes lol. #RealityCheck right there, and of course she just settled things outwith her sister who thinks it's her goddamn fault again for being the bi*ch (seethe pattern now? I'm not even joking when I referred to Natsuo as the next guyto Shuu, but Hina-chan, man) and think she can revert things back to normal sothey can- Okay Hina-chan, you try reverting the c** that flows through your w***and then you tell me can revert back or not. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Serious things though,Natsuo got more serious in many things than other. I'm not going to re-emphasisehow Miu-chan and the Kiriya-sensei were both right as Natsuo did not win theprize from submitting entries with the Literature Club but Rui won, is that hehas the passion to do it. If he wants to be more than in name, then he has towork hard writing until you know, publishers can like your work haha. No really,that or you just post short stories online and get a fanbase. It's rather easywith social media if you don't write terribly haha. (I don't speak fromexperience btw I haven't done that yet) Also in his seriousness is to furtherhis relationship with Hina, who now is still probably thinking on how to breakup with him so she can get the family together- Okay Hina-chan the family isfine, okay?? Stop worrying about the sister and get together with the real manin the family, ok? (Sorry dad haha) All in all, quite a lot to think about asthis episode reaches its climax (it probably did haha) and we're ending with aproblem. Of course, it'll be sooner or later that this will happen as mentionedby Hina, but hey, how is this teacher going to stop people taking pictures ofthem kissing in the neighbourhood? To be honest? I'm glad it's not the bed scenephoto because that'll be quite an issue to both of them haha may this series endwell. I'm not going to say "with a bang" because I think I've got enough s*x fora series I just want some dramatic conclusion. To end this, if you haven'tthought of doing<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Yoko_Hikasa" target="_blank"  >Yocchan</a>at any point... remember, she's married in real life. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AmkaT_UQZS0/XJcr4rtoFnI/AAAAAAAAvaA/5xM2aUT1fxgok7Jca-4YNN4AcZIVuP8TwCLcBGAs/s320/domekano11_bikini.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Again, I would be lying if my face isn't like Al's at the beach            scene this episode hehe          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uh3mAjQzWd4/XJcr4si1EBI/AAAAAAAAvZ8/8zmpbSqpGEskcaILY1TuVolD3JaWiijWQCLcBGAs/s320/domekano11_topless.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Again, I would be lying if my face isn't like Al's at the beach            scene this episode hehe          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. It's going to be like "I'm going to start disliking you from now on" andthen later she noticed she can't keep her hands off that man!! Hey, been theredone that before, am I right, Hina-chan?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. Miu-chan? I thinkI thought of something you can do in return at the school trip haha okay yahit's bikini okay??? She's got the figure I can see that lmao<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KaguyaSama11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "If either would be open about their feelings, they'll be happy" Oh shit    that hit Hayasaka real hard. Too bad she doesn't have someone to fall in    love with? Poor thing, isn't it?  </div></blockquote>That is THE SADDEST SIGH I've ever heard a female voice actress do one haha goodjob Koga Aoi you've broken my personal record lol. And yeah, Shirogane, I knowit's your first love but still. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this saddest episode (#KaguyaSama11)of this series ever, thank goodness we have Hayasaka as MVP, right??? HELL YEAHF**K YOU BEACH EPISODE <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, let's talk about everything that happened.Oh, another sentimental episode? I really like those though tbh. Firstly,Twitter. Besides the obvious change of logo in that social media platform withinthis Anime world (lol it even<a  href="https://twitter.com/anime_kaguya/status/1109479883434934273"  target="_blank"  >became the official Twitter account's icon</a>, no joke) we now know that Kaguya doesn't know of social media, and hasapparently never left the browser homepage when using the PC to surf theinternet. Really? Okay, we'll get to why later, but still. Hayasaka tries toteach her while taking over the staff used bathroom to take a bath alone (man,like a boss) (well she kind of is and I LOVE IT haha) but anyways, it stillboiled down to Kaguya and her own ego for not clicking on that Follow button tosend a request to see content on a protected account, to summarise. (If youdon't understand go read an encyclopedia or something haha) You think it'll workif we teach Kaguya to impersonate someone else in a Twitter account? You know,to do the anonymous identity thing. It's not her ego by then, so she can bewhatever she wants? No? It still won't work? Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next up,Chika-chan misses Japan so much because of ramen. I know I shouldn't drawreferences to another Anime in title because "Koizumi-san who likes Ramen" isindeed an Anime which gets mocked on this joke real often (ie. "Fujiwara-san wholikes Ramen"), so I'll just stop here haha. However, she has proven herself anexpert in tasting ramen here, but then again maybe it's because she has beentaught by her parents how to enjoy such a delicacy, and that itself might beimpressive considering that even one of the four masters of Ramen tasting (loldebatable) bow down to her including the chef. Maybe I should really try thatsome time over here. What should I order again, Shoyu Ramen? Extra-thicknoodles? Gotcha haha. Last but not least, a sentimental story that might be tooreal, but however will never happen in real life. Trust me, no one will do that.Not even me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I'm also not going to reference lyrics from my decade ofexperience in J-Pop for this scene (see RSP's "Sakura"), but suffice it to saythey want to meet. ("Sakura sakura aitai yo~haha" ) They want to meet so bad,they aren't connected on social media, and they technically have no officialreason to message each other because ego issues lmao. Anyways, they thoughtthey'll see each other in school in that very room but... the timing wasn'tright. See? Just message on the phone and this wouldn't be an issue. You evencame up with an excuse to leave the house too, Shirogane. (Kei-chan how did youjust make the summer hotter than it should've been *icecream melts* haha) Soyeah, there's that, I guess. I have a feeling I say that every episode but hey,it's kind of the reality of this series, to say the least. And that, I thank theauthor and/or production for making sure it hits us. Last but not least, theending part. I know it's harsh to talk about the Shinomiya family, butconsidering she's the only and female child it spells problems to understandingJapanese family culture as a whole for discriminating female descendants. ButI'll not touch on that, because as always, Hayasaka nailed that right in thecoffin. That piece of sh*t of a father, really. Just go in a coffin. Hopefullyby then your daughter will be truly happy. Maybe. Hey, we've got the fireworksfestival coming up, and assuming the father ruined her shopping trip with thegirls I just hope he doesn't step in on this one. We need a solid episode to endthis really sad episode tbh imo I just... can't... please don't spoil it dadplease I beg you<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8J-scZaw77Y/XJc5jJW0GMI/AAAAAAAAvaQ/awRz9q_a0bUMMdzHy9V0ScWooJeNoa5sACLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama11_door.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Abuse of staff rights is totally acceptable as long as you're            personal assistant to the owner's daughter lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iV6GKLcu6wk/XJc5jP-Ab-I/AAAAAAAAvaU/EiXXqTlBhtg18oYW4XA3OaV_PsvCQ6cMACLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama11_hayasaka2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I've never seen Hayasaka so content before.<br />I knew from here            it'll be a good episode maybe haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I wonder if it's an oldie but I didn't find itonline. Maybe it's going to be in the soundtrack? Oh please tell me it's goingto have even a short version of it (Edit: It's likely a new song from<a href="https://twitter.com/kayoko225" target="_blank">Kusano Kayoko</a> whohas very recently - just one month ago recently - announced her artist rename toher full name from her old alias "KAYOKO") (As confirmed by<a  href="https://twitter.com/keikinishida/status/1109483885623009281"  target="_blank"  >composer</a>'s tweet)]<br />[OMAKE!!!

I really didn't listento anything much besides <b>Rie fu's new album</b> and... well it was folk musicso I can't see to give anything off the bat just yet, but I did want to give acouple so we shall see. I also gave a listen to that one single from that gameI'm still playing, and... <b>Yogee New Waves</b> did not appear. Oh well, nextweek perhaps? I'm so ready for them and they did not appear. Sadded.<br /><br />Nextweek bring us... nothing. Uh oh. (Okay, there's <b>SCANDAL new single</b> but Idon't care lol) Well, maybe I should go find new artists to listen to again?Man, the leaving of many Collection Artists are really making some weeks inKlassic Note this year a bare desert tbh<br /><br />On Twitter, that<b>Yoru no Honki Dance appearance on a flood of circle live</b> was pretty great(thanks), <b>Minase Inori's new album</b> got a new promotional video teasingthe topic song which I don't think will hold up just yet, and...<b>cinema staff confirmed their new single</b> for Anime "Attack on Titan" whichwill release in May. That last time is such a good piece of news, I was worriedof their inactivity over the past year besides that collaboration single.AnimeJapan 2019 is also around this week, but in terms of songs I think I'llcover my ears along with Anime announcements so I can actually give a properreview in the near future.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be sure to check outanother photobook review I've done for my friend's birthday on our trip to thelocal bookstore (yep), and... I didn't plan for anything this weekend haha.Plenty of sleep is good for the week ahead, even though I haven't been doingthat today lol. You know, DOAXVV problems, am I right? (Suffice it to say I onlyhave time to run that free-to-play game in the weekend ie. grind to get allevent rewards) Cya guys next week. I've been thinking of maintenance in KlassicNote and my PC <i>and</i> my deck of external hard disks, so you should at leastbe able to see the Klassic Note site changes rolling out gradually. Until nextweek, I guess.<br /><br />P.S. I'll try to do more posts in "The Everyday Life"like trying to convince my sister to get me a photobook for my birthday sinceshe didn't get me anything yet. Wish me luck haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
