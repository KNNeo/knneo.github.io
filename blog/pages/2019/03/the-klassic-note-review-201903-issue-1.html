Hey, new year new reviews, I guess!<br><br>Ah damn every time I ask myself whether there will be multiple issues for the month and I notice I'm just not giving enough. Well then again most of them aren't all the way good. Not until this girl came in. I love female singer songwriters haha<br><br>Edit: I got tired after a day of posting that Tweet to do this review, so let's finish this quick I need to sleep more while listening to this hehe<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=TakigawaAlisaWagamama><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Takigawa Alisa - Wagamama [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/31/SECL-2390.jpg width=320 height=320 style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/32/SECL-2391.jpg width=320 height=320 style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Anime Limited Edition</table>(I know, she can totally sell by just lying around on the ground lol "don't look at that side" haha I meant the Anime cover)<br><br>Origin: Hmm... it was just your usual Anime meets solo music artist collaboration for pretty much every other show, and this one was for Anime "Domestic na Kanojo". I say collaboration because the two songs in the single are both features in the show itself! Which I'm about to say, is also my main reason for getting this single for review. Talk about two weeks ago on an episode where the B-side started playing in the background and I thought it was an Anime character song, but no, it was her. Takigawa Alisa seems to be new in the industry but has kind of served well to be a great singer-songwriter, and if you hear this review you'll feel so too. I'm here to like this single, and I hope you will feel her songs too.<br><br>(1) Wagamama [Willful]<br><blockquote class=tr_bq><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"If (I) become an adult</div><div style=text-align:center>(I) won't have to worry about these things</div><div style=text-align:center>Can (I) live through (my) life smoothly?"</div></blockquote></blockquote>As you know, this was the Anime theme song. I have no much opinion about the melody of this song as I know it's a real good one, removing all the minor stuff that I actually hate about any song out there - no awkwardly long bridge parts, great chorus, adequate verses, nice composition and production... I can't even criticise on this song. And when the Anime aired its first episode, I knew this song will be the best I'll be hearing in this Anime season. And I wasn't wrong when I heard the song in full, and even the lyrics say something quite close to one of the female characters Rui-chan (if you don't watch it's fine) and it's about being jealous, and thus being willful and selfish about the love for that someone. Really speaks a lot for the Anime, but man is she good at writing the main points of the show into this wonderful melody. I wouldn't say Alisa-san is great in writing lyrics as heard from some parts of the song which kind of didn't make sense in my opinion, but man, when she does it makes impact.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br><br>(2) always<br><blockquote class=tr_bq><blockquote class=tr_bq style=text-align:center> "I'm Always here for you<br>Even if (the) light disappears<br>We will hold hands and move on"</blockquote></blockquote>Again, this is the reason I bought this single to review. And yes, besides the above reason this turned out to be a really good song too. It's your more typical Anime pop song though, so maybe it has some flaws that I would rather blame production for because she didn't produce the song, but otherwise the melody is fine, and the lyrics say even more about the other track in this release. Man, she is really trying to sell this single to me haha. Jokes aside, this is a song about approaching love directly, and maybe also because we may be far apart, as I would reference from the Anime, the forbidden relationship now in separate homes of the step siblings. It really says things, this song, and if you can overlook the little details this is a nice song.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br><br>Conclusion: This may be just one good Anime related single, but for me this is an invitation letter to like more of her music. Takigawa Alisa, you've officially come under the Klassic Note microscope, and I believe like many others before you, you can deliver some great J-Pop tunes in the futre. There, I said it. You guys better go give her a chance on her easy-listening new single, and it'll make you fall in love. It need not be her but that will be a future thing, yes? Keep up the good work, Alisa-san.<br><br><br>- Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br><br><br>THE PACKAGE<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1200 data-original-width=1600 height=150 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJ3AF4bS4yBWlrvBnDn5TLLex3t4y0_DeHPJH1A_XoYR7L2DVlzhZZhZVkWb3Ruxv9C8VA-QkRGPMlwDGi19Xvg7ItG-MnwbxZJIogQ3HyO8UNyA9SEafj89nmOQQq-08zdXJGQju1K7LS/s200/IMG_20190312_213609.jpg width=200></div>Yeah okay, you are kinda cute, I'll give you that. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><br><br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1200 data-original-width=1600 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgL-RKMzdd8WP5TijzzKnTkn2zcfZgV0LYKvTYuZm028M8RLF9SvyNI6Oxaq387CmayDwVqGJZ4yImRqcHS-k9RsSU4d9duSp9Zp2e4TTKpnKaMs8GJMZGbW7wPq4asr9EV0GetEic-GjrN/s320/IMG_20190312_212500.jpg width=320></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><br></div>Hey, it's another CD unboxing in Klassic Note!

But that doesn't stop them from making more pages out of the typical 4-page booklet, so yeah, they know she's likable. More images? I'll take it.<br><br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1200 data-original-width=1600 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjR257FM2c95GW4hpgC5oQ-9aiwUWx8itDJW8fBHYyWO8qgNUFAUDUHu9gBRzGPB58wX5GQkRK5bGcj4oaKnsUEDgOhzemKNo2IyZPfjCmPEjvDTH9Qcl3eE5poTWsAMvtjDF9ie8frNrFI/s320/IMG_20190312_212113.jpg width=320></div><br>The order (though not pre-order until you notice it's called <u>First Press</u> Edition and they made a lot of these) also comes with a promotional poster which probably costed more on shipping but hey, they shipping this woman? Sure!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> She'll never know she can't read my English tweets haha BURN<br><br>P.S. Alisa-san you look like a very generic beautiful singer with a tinge of Komatsu Mikako cute face in it. I can't explain why though. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span><br><br>P.P.S. Google Photos says you look like Kana-chan lmao (And Sumipe? Haha)<br><br><br><br><br>This is it then. I gotta sleep early because work. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> I should work out more. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time then, and hopefully we can give more singles? It's going to be hard but I'll try. Ikimonogakari is making a comeback this year so that may help in driving up the CD ordering over here haha<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
