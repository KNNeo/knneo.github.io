It has been a week.<br /><br />Well, you know it has been a week whenyou have to work overtime on Saturdays lmao okay let's talk about Anime andJapanese music everything else is boring anyways haha<br /><br />Really, peopleare still playing PUBG, gamers. Okay, PUBG mobile which is full of AI so notgaming standards anymore but still<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DomeKano09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Domestic na Kanojo</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It's not like I'm (moving) that far away" Yeah it's just next door? Haha    Natsuo YOU WISH lol  </div></blockquote>If there is ever an episode of Anime that make me want to f**k Hikasa Youkolike, in person (mind you she's married in real life) this should be it. Really.Can we? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay serious things on this new episode (#DomeKano09) include adisappointed... well everybody haha that's us fans here waiting for something tohappen you idiots lmao. You know it's a good episode when there's lots ofkissing and I'm looking away from the monitor half the time haha ugh I need togrow up. Talking about growing up, Natsuo is technically dating with Hina-chanie. his sensei and step elder sister? Sure, really expected that already withthat kind of ending last episode, but yeah, they won't move on that fastapparently. Hey, Hina and Shuu's relationship did take like a couple of decadesbefore it was torn apart lol. Then again, it's making Rui really confused,coming back to our topic on Hina leaving the house. Rui keeps thinking it's herfault but it's not (it's actually just that your sis just want some f**k timewith the brother and it can't happen at home haha), and I guess along withShuu's appearance which was totally a coincidence, sat down and listened to hertalk about <strike>how they can't kiss because the sister's around</strike> hahaokay not that. (Man, all these romance and sex jokes) She, like Natsuo, wasfeeling insecure for different reasons. For Rui, it's likely the blame sheasserted on herself, along with unknown if it's romantic feelings towards Natsuoand that she can't express it since she did got found out. But I guess it's hardon her too, so this one she may have to compromise and give the sister some"freedom". We are not going to iterate what the freedom is though I've madeenough sex jokes this one episode haha. Talking about those though, Hina didleave a note to only Natsuo which contained a key?? Yep, idiots, if you haven'twatched enough romance shows before that's an open invitation for a guy to go toher place to f- okay not really, but yes Natsuo is right it's for him to makethe decision. But hey again, if you remove the environment factor (ie. thefamily members under the same roof) then of course we can be together, right?Kinda, but that is until someone finds out then. You know, Japanese traditionproblems or whatever lol. So yeah, they have to play the hiding game again. Imean, what's the difference between this and Hina-chan sandwiched between Shuuand his wife? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah this show is just ridiculously dramatic in every waypossible. But I'll give plus points to the story: The imagination it led tothough I cannot forgive haha I wrote so much cra-<br /><div class="popup">  <span class="initial"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r9iv1lzj1i8/XISwx6hO-RI/AAAAAAAAuv4/sA0saHlHUDUP-IMseacJ0TQnf-3phQ74QCLcBGAs/s320/domekano09_al1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me inside when I see a girl I like haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WctVgh9_wjo/XISwxxWvoGI/AAAAAAAAuv0/csMBwYVRxygsYmhP8ohMqlyCxbxU8L2pgCLcBGAs/s320/domekano09_hina5.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Yeah, sensei isn't exactly a happy person, you know.

Then again personal opinion but, which do you think happened first: theaffair or the road to divorce without it? If it's the latter then I don't seewhy Hina-chan can't get to love a man. Shuu did mention it was due toincompatibility issues. Oh well, Natsuo is better I guess haha I mean SHE GAVEHIM THE KEYS WTF haha suck it Shuu lol<br />P.P.S. "I came here prepared" andthen Natsuo brings out a bag of condoms <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KaguyaSama09">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I wish you are normally this adorable" I KNOW RIGHT?? Thanks Koga Aoi, uh I    mean, sick Kaguya haha  </div></blockquote>LOL WTF KAGUYA SHOW SOME GENEROSITY AND JUST SEND HIM HOME ALREADY IF CANNOT INSAME CAR THEN CALL IN TWO CARS haha you f**king idiot and we still say this is ashow about geniuses? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay I'm sorry though, Kaguya. I sincerely am. Inthis new episode (#KaguyaSama09) we finally, FINALLY, can pack up and leave thisseries. They have done it. THEY, have done it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay waaaay too easy tocall it so, but as Hasayaka has checked, it indeed was nothing much lol. And Ilike how this episode has a full on development of story, so we get to hear itfrom the start. Firstly, there's a typhoon. Besides Chika-chan obtaining firstplace in the cutest Anime characters in this season of shows yet again by beingscared of thunder lol, Miyuki can't get home. Well in Japan, erratic weatherhappens the further you live away from the equator, and if it's bad it's<u>advised</u> (I've emphasised that so take notice) you do not go outdoorswithout any protection from the harsh weather outside. So yeah, some rack gotherself a taxi (lmao) and Shirogane won't have the luxury to sit on it becauseKaguya, as she wants him to sit on <i>her</i> car. Okay... nice try butultimately I would assume Shirogane has no idea about that option, as in,availability of hitching a ride from Kaguya to his place. But hey, what'sstopping Kaguya from doing it though? Because of her ego. We'll get to that in abit on the second half, but suffice it to say it did not happen. As I expecedMiyuki chose to rush to his workplace and heck, being as strong of a man as heis from the countryside weathering this shouldn't be a problem. So yeah,compared to the frail, usually protected rich girl that is Kaguya who has beenpatiently waiting to actually do whatever she planned... I would say Kaguya thatwasn't smart of you. You underestimated that country bumpkin haha. Someoneplease give her a smartphone so she can understand some social stuff too,please. Also, don't destroy other people's phones he got that second-hand toolmao. So yeah, which bring us to THE highlight of the episode: Kaguya fallingsick. She caught a cold, but you must be wondering what is so crazy about hersick in bed she won't be moving around anyway... Or would she? But first, wegotta decide who to deliver the printouts (becuase it's still 2019 and theydon't send you PDFs to print or have online portals for assignments lol) to her.Ishigami isn't that interested of course because he can't afford to die evenwith Kaguya sick haha, so it's technically a Concentration game betweenChika-chan and the Prez in which SHE TOTALLY CHEATS YOU SHAMELESS GIRL!!! Hahajust thought that I should join in on the Ishigami insult train lol. So yeah,works on her probably dumb af sisters, but not on that one genius, dearChika-chan. Then again, Shirogane found out from Ishigami that he was at fault(yeah technically he is; it was almost a hit-and-run lol) so yeah by right heshould go, to which he got nervous all of a sudden also after winning the game.Hey, you got us nervous too hehe. Lastly, the visit. Yep, he went to her place.Again, kudos to Hayasaka or whatever her new maid name is to disguise her namefrom the school lol, but if it wasn't her it'll look exactly like as if someonewas delivering fast food to your doorstep. That was not it though, so thanksagain, butler. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We also got to learn about how Kaguya behaves when she'sin a cold fever, and as perfectly described by the <strike>maid</strike><strike>butler</strike> maid, it's literally a fever dream for her as if she wasdrunk. (Ok for comparison now I want to see <strike>Koga</strike> Kaguya drunkhaha she not legal age yet? Dammit) "Three hours man, how can I ever thank youenough??" <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We wished we were having fun though, not until the<strike>baby</strike> girl asks the boy to get into bed wtf this is not DomeKanoright?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As much as Kaguya is SHAMELESS HAHA *laughs like Kaguya* butman it's too real because Shirogane kinda needs some sleep from the part timework and hard work he puts in at school. So... all is well? Well, Shiroganeprobably had to go see the doctor for a bit which would've costed MORE money ifhe would've just let Chika-chan win, but the gains from this visit man... it'spriceless. And of course, at least for Shirogane, it'll be memorable. Noseriously, can we end the series now? I feel like I've watched two seasons ofAnime to lead up to this scene already haha<br /><div class="popup">  <span class="initial"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rDsUOEwYVcw/XIS-Tse0MAI/AAAAAAAAuwI/YbLPWX1cQyoDPxnSneqhAF6yS5e5bS7wgCLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama09_naked1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            EXPECTATION<br />(Shirogane wtf are you thinking about)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"    ><table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eRS4HbHGxj0/XIS-UOVIjjI/AAAAAAAAuwM/tDx-s4zp0rQrhoglPiiFhXpUQDOzIIsAwCLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama09_sleep.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            REALITY??<br />(As much as this is AWESOME the eyes are creepy tbh)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></span  ></div>P.S. "What is<a href="https://jisho.org/search/normally" target="_blank">normal</a> again?"

"It won't be a problem if he asks me togive him a ride home" Yeah right as if he knows if you have the capacity tofetch him to his home <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, you can fetch him to your place haha<br />[Iforgot to mention this above, but yeah turns out if it's still a surprise toyou, Kaguya is that poor rich girl who was rich because of her family backgroundbut poor as she doesn't know of freedom. Freedom to do things like everyoneelse. So every time she tries to do it it is discouraged. I mean, how you gonnalearn to love at this rate? Then again, now that Shirogane knows a lot moreabout this girl maybe he'll do some advances so that Kaguya won't feelrestricted by her own behaviour again? Hey, there's a Part 2 for that particularscene (and it's in the manga I read to see how accurate it was) so I wonder ifit'll ever <strike>be explained here</strike> be in a season 2 haha]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;"      >This Week on <strike>Klassic Note</strike> Apple Music</span    >  </div></blockquote>Hey, it's a good week in Apple Music, so let's use that Twitter Moment to talkabout it!

Yeah, they kinda cemented it when they placed the B-side as one of theepisode's insert songs, so... they win, I guess. On the other hand, long time noreview, yes?

Oh well, next time, guys.<br /><br />Maybenext time I'll do a Moments with cover art on it. But then I may have to stealfrom Apple Music so... maybe not?

So... that's not good news. Erm... I might justgo find some indie artists, I guess. It has been some time though, so myopinions for less than awesome music may be swayed. But then again there'sKiriku to Majou and I'm still listening to them today so... wish me luck nextweek? Well, if I have the time to listen, that is. I'll try.<br /><br />OnTwitter news, uh... wait. Let's start with the freshest news of all!! Yoru noHonki Dance is releasing a new album coming June hell yeah, Uesama Sumire's newsingle is actually theme song to next season Anime in which... teachers datestudents so yeah DomeKano references there? (actually it feels more likeTsurezure Children but one of them in each couple is a teacher) Actually, that'spretty much it. Dull week on Twitter, I guess. Hey, but there's that TwitterMoment above, amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span><br /><br />Well, dammit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'msorry if this is short. But yeah, that's what happens if you put a bunch ofTweets instead of a bunch of never-ending paragraphs lol. Okay, maybe we shoulddo it this way next time. Or I should just do the hover thing which I swear I'venot done it for the past at least three months haha. Cya guys next time then,and until then... I'm trying to make this place beautiful. Or responsivewebsite. Or maybe the gallery is too hard to scroll down on to find stuff so Imay want to move to a new place again. We shall see. We haven't reached our 5thanniversay yet in July. We shall see... Ok bye<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
