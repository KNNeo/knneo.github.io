Ah, what a Sunday, doing overtime because I have to haha<br />
<br />Okay, managed to clear Anime also just now and considering it's end of
season, I've got plenty to say so be sure to check it out below. Also, since
this is all the time I had to do this, I updated plenty of Klassic Note stuff
and the website. That's it.<br />
<br />Well, read on already would you I can't type my life here forever it's
more boring than Kaguya's summer vacation lol<br />

"Nice dumbfounded look!" lmao ah I felt better already. In the final episode
(#DomeKano12) of this really, really sad to end way of a series, we end at a
part that... is conclusive of what happened mainly in this arc, which is
Hina-chan and her relationship with men. Well, mostly Natsuo but I have to
include the others into the equation so if you'll excuse me. Because of those
strong feelings and Hina's character and the student board choosing the older
person to approach first, things changed real fast after it was discovered that
Hina-chan was having a relationship with Natsuo, ie. student-teacher
relationship. You know, those that aren't acceptable by society. Again, to hell
with society but still, it was an issue. So since the choice landed on Hina's
hands, she took it to leave the school and Natsuo in order to not ruin his
future. And in that, even Natsuo, I think everyone handled her passing real
well. It's those "I know it's for my own good but" and then Natsuo just can't
stop crying and screaming and not forget about the times they were together...
understandable for a typical breakup plot without looking at the face for some
reason (well I can't imagine if there is physical contact, so...) so I'm not
going to complain about the plot line. At the very least the author and
production handled it well. Moving on, Natsuo had to pour out all his
overwhelming feelings of sorrow and pain into a novel, and in doing so got him
what he didn't expect: a winning prize in a literary award. Hey, congrats, bro.
Now is to remember that feeling and write stories with it. What is great about
life is that on remembering things you have done, and if it was remembered well
and vividly, can be motivation for you to conitnue living. That, I couldn't have
experienced it better myself, and you probably did too even without love.
Hina-chan chose one of the right paths to not tarnish any of their reputations
in public, and in embracing that sacrificed what would be important in keeping
Natsuo's dream safe, so he should thanks her for that. Lastly, it's Rui.
Probably the most heartbroken because he did it once with Natsuo and has been
till now only suppressed her feelings for the only true man in the story (lol
sorry Marie and your half body tattoo), is now free. Free of suppression, for
starters. Whether Natsuo will take that in like he does in substitution to
another like he always does, is up to him. And of course up to whether we'll get
a second season of Anime because it stops there. Yep, that's it, folks. Overall,
I enjoyed the series. I know about the obvious sex and physical contact scenes
they gotta put in to justify the adaptation, but even so they have done it
enough to not make me walk away (well it'll be more than this before I do
anyway) or engrossed that I want to j**k off to it. Okay, not that really, but I
enjoyed the drama the most. They may not have enough character development
outside of the main character scope (for example the parents questioning their
marriage again, Miu-chan on Kiriya etc.), but otherwise it was a good show. And
to be honest? I can't take any more cheesy sorrows or cry-outs besides this more
understanding approach of like venting it out and moving on, making this the
most matured ending to a sad romance story I've seen so far in my life in Anime.
And for that, Sasuga-sensei, thanks for this. And Good Ending. That may not have
been a hit, but this did. And I'm glad to have remembered your pen name. Hey,
look Natsuo's more well-known than you now haha jkjk<br />

P.S. "I'm sorry, I am a weak person." You are, Hina-chan. All the more then to
not keep it to yourself. Well, to the three of you. And that cameraman lol<br />P.P.S.
Not that I'm being a d**k (I still am lol) but man, what a great time to be
doing nothing as the winter holidays come and reality drops real fast as your
face that you cannot be fated to be with that special someone. Sorry, Natsuo, I
gotta.<br />

You not going to outwit the people around you to go see fireworks? Shame on you.
<span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> In the final episode (#KaguyaSama12) of this love rollercoaster because
why not, Kaguya gets to go see fireworks with her friends. Not until someone
stops her from doing it. "<i>Dammit dad</i>, I just want to go see fireworks!"
(lol I just want to make a joke here) Anyways, I was expecting that to happen,
so what are you going to do about it? The bodyguards are home, and even without
an agenda one in a noble family can't just walk out to the streets to enjoy life
like the rest of them. Well, not if you sneak out of the place. Kudos to the
rope for the assist, but suffice it to say Kaguya managed to leave with help
from the only personal assitant she can trust. Hey, who says there aren't people
around her who wil help her? And that doesn't end there. Next up, she gotta make
her way there. And since taking a taxi all the way wasn't a good option due to
the traffic jam, she has to walk the distance. Until the fireworks are over. You
know, despair at its finest. So yeah, this was probably where Kaguya gave up.
This ingenious mind of hers who can battle anyone in school. This girl broke,
into tears. Hey, if you wanted something so bad but eventually can't even reach
it, wouldn't you be sad? However, this is where Shirogane stepped in haha. Hey,
can't say this time round he didn't prepare as much as Kaguya did normally (no
really normally it's the other way around where Shirogane just wants to school
and he gets toyed around by Kaguya) since Kaguya probably thought she can just
waltz out of the house to see fireworks with her schoolmates, so... what are you
going to do now? Without disappointment, Shirogane appears at the right time
("YOU'RE LATE!!" haha) to make sure Kaguya doesn't feel like trash that the
announcer kindly reminded the audience of the fireworks festival to pick up
(wow, that link), and picked her up literally to bring her to see fireworks, for
real. Obviously the world doesn't celebrate with fireworks at the same time
(unless you're China because... of... time zones) (sorry China don't ban me) so
Shirogane devised an adequate plan (and a bunch of lies lol) ("white lies", I
call them haha) to bring her and the lot of them to see fireworks together in
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Chiba%20Prefecture" target="_blank"
  >Chiba</a
>, and just as proven, was about 20 minutes away from the heart of Tokyo. (Okay,
not true but still) (According to Google Maps it's an hour FYI, and the "Aqua
Line" is a thing) Anyways, they made it: All of them got to see fireworks albeit
inside a taxi (not going to talk about that driver who likes ramen too) and...
Kaguya isn't looking at the lights. Spoiler alert: She was looking at how cool
Shirogane was. You did it, bro. I'm proud of you. Never in my life have I ever
went out of my way that much for a girl, but you did it, man. Respect. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span>
Ah, what a story, isn't it? If you need a hint even if I didn't read the manga,
the last part was probably Anime filler intended to end the series, so don't
take that content too seriously besides the fact that the two still can't face
each other after the incident. Well, they don't have to if they manage to bump
onto each other, after much dogfighting in the office taking down two other
innocent parties in the process of cleaning the room for some reason. I really
liked that bump part at the end. You made me satisfied, Anime. And I thank you.
Can we end the series now? I know I want more sequels talking about the conflict
between the two, but then again you will have to deal with the Shinomiya family
problems too. Can we just make her leave home now? Sucks to not be able to like
the son of a farmer, you know. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (I guess the love isn't that deep yet,
so maybe not) I'm done. My heart is filled with happiness now that I see Kaguya
found hers. It's no dream Kaguya; you finally get to
<strike>see fireworks in real life up close</strike>
<strike>know what it feels to like someone</strike> okay nvm I can't bring
myself to say that either lmao but I'll say this - I've fallen in love with you,
Koga Aoi. May we meet in another Anime again hehe (Can I bump into you in real
life?)<br />

As usual, I'll talk about the things I saw while reading down the list, ignoring
most of the stuff I'll never watch these days and mention on those that I do.
And those that I am already intending on watching.<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    I thought Asakura Momo will be perfect to be in "<b>Senryuu Shoujo</b>"
    because of her frequent live behind-the-scenes elevator pitches ie. she does
    5-7-5s in the lift before it reaches another floor and normally screws it up
    haha. 100% not watching now lol
  </li>
  <li>
    Thanks to Waki Azumi who voices the main girl, I'll be looking at "<b
      >Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</b
    >" [airs April 5th] mainly because she acts the main girl and I can mock her
    since she doesn't have a chest- okay jokes aside, but this will have a lot
    of perverted jokes as she tries to avoid getting distracted by her perverted
    father (how did she survive for this long) and her possible development in
    relationship to the school's best guy. I'm here for the romance tbh HAHAHA
    no but seriously though I am. No one's going to take me serious on this
  </li>
  <li>
    How did this and "<b>Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</b>" not discuss on
    when they get Anime adaptations? Only one will prevail at this rate lol
    (both feature a title which makes people "unable to study" so...)
  </li>

    I thought "<b>Shoumetsu Toushi</b>" would be a nice mystery show in modern
    day (and has Kana-chan) until I saw robots. Next!
  </li>
  <li>
    I'll most definitely not be watching "<b>Nande Koko ni Sensei ga!?</b>" even
    though the plots sound like Tsurezure Children but with teachers and their
    students (I mean, I got DomeKano already) and Uesaka Sumire sings the
    fabulous opening theme song just weeks ago which I... will not further
    promote here lol just no
  </li>

    If it's just a deity screwing up someone's life I don't mind

    haha okay I might just give "<b>Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san</b>" an
    episode tbh
  </li>
  <li>
    Yes, I'm watching the sequels of "<b>Bungou Stray Dogs</b>" [airs April
    12th] because it's cooler than "<b>Attack on Titan</b>" [airs April 28th].
    Somehow I think the latter will be a disappointment. Thank goodness for
    cinema staff, amirite? Also, why you want to air in Japan on Sunday nights?
    <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span>

  <li>
    The only show I didn't think I'll be interested in outside of expectations
    is "<b>7 Seeds</b>", which I hope is nothing but a mystery show- oh it's
    sci-fi? Never mind then haha
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
  That's it. Titles with air dates symbolise my current schedule agenda, but
  otherwise just let me comment it's the Internet goddammit haha<br />
  <br />On a side note, I want a mystery show, modern day. Not CSI, but like
  "Subete ga F ni Naru". That show brings back memories the first time I watched
  it. I want that suspense. "ERASED" was good too. They just don't have it in
  recent years.

This was quite a fast week, so technically it was short, but not short on
reviews. <b>Rie fu's new album</b> got to a conclusion as I only gave two of the
English-song based album. <b>Ikimonogakari's latest song</b> for 15th
anniversary got me hooked especially over the weekend so I'm giving it. I'm
skipping talk about that game character song single since I mentioned this last
week (or did I?). <b>sunday morning bell's album</b> after years of hiatus since
I heard of them in 2012 and also last year was... actually great. Maybe too much
on the mainstream side in composition lacking of their usual awkward style, but
I'll take it. I seriously want to hear more of them tbh. Yogee New Waves is
still not around, and <b>Suchmos' new album</b> is... I can't find something I
like. Okay, maybe only the one because I like the instrumentals. But that's it.
I guess I just have the mood to listen to this stuff every once in a while. A
long while haha. Next week brings us <b>mol-74's first album</b> in major debut
only so... that'll be great. I liked them from last year so this will get me
more Twitter likes and retweets lol<br />
<br />On Twitter, plenty happened the moment I posted last week's issue, to be
honest. <b>Asakura Momo announced her new single</b> to be an Anime theme song
(wow production you did it), <b>Sphere</b> - the girls who got me into those
girls in MusicRay'n in the first place - hosted their 10th anniversary
livestream announcing another new single after the new album AND streaming media
unlocking (YES!), <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION announced a new single</b> for
Anime, FLOWER FLOWER with a new song,
<b>Yuuki Aoi announced her new album</b> due June since her change of music
label from Flying Dog to Columbia Japan, Niitsu Yui with another new song,
Ikimonogakari with a new song tomorrow (not a joke), I watched
<b>Minase Inori's new music video preview</b> and I think it's going to be a
good topic song going into the new album soon BUT (haha sorry Inorin)
<b>Natsukawa Shiina's new music video preview</b> for her 1st album is even
better (YES! x2), and Scenarioart with a new song. Wow, that was quite a
mouthful did you guys catch all that? Thank goodness for bolded text, yes?
No?<br />
<br />Lastly, I'll quickly talk about what happened over at Klassic Note, and
more on the surface than in the back end. I
<b>revamped all Klassic Note playlists on Apple Music Japan</b> under my profile
(@klassicnote if you wonder) (yes Apple Music has accounts which allow sharing
of public playlists) and then added them to the
<b>new Klassic Note Collection website</b> because we don't do CD compilationa
anymore. Welcome to the digital age, everyone. Again, just click on the link,
hit the preview button and enjoy glimpses of music just how I felt years ago
where I have to give a listen just based on that length.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay, I'm finally done. I thought of updating my song list tonight too but
I think I've had enough. Just staring at the work PC waiting for things to
happen and making phone calls is enough to make me not want to go to work
tomorrow haha. Cya guys tomorrow, and if there are jokes to share from Twitter
I'll make sure to share them here next week. Because I don't use the Klassic
Note account for non-official purposes. Do you guys not know I have like a list
of lists I use to "follow" people I like? Haha until next week everyone<br />
