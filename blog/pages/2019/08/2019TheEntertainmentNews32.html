Shouldn't have promised one post a dayfor my super long weekend haha heads up btw I'm skipping tomorrow's since I'mgoing to be out<br /><br />So blah blah blah Happy National Day Singapore but that's not the point!! Well,it's a good, long break after that break I had in which I lied down in bed allweek (why does that sound like it's a good thing) (talking about my fever btw)so... why not finish some of the stuff I set out to do in this blog? So yeah, Idid that, and also now that I'm (somehow) done let's talk about entertainmentthis week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS205">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Dandy is completely tease-proof!" Well going from his name I doubt so but    haha  </div></blockquote>Well that was quite a fail isn't it? I think I mentioned this many times forNishikata to not care thus will not be teased, but turns out he needs to watchstuff other than local drama haha. In this new episode (#TakagiSanS205)apparently there is other drama in drama besides 100% Kataomoi, it seems.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay now I want an episode on Dandy lmao. Firstly, the drama in drama.Nishikata thought he could pull it off by mimicking another drama character onlyto notice Takagi-san's place also has national cable and can probably watch thesame show as him anyways. That aside, they played their drama roles real wellfor some reason but of course, pertaining to the topic of being embarrassed, andNishikata should just stop with that already, learning from drama lol. Anyways,still pretty entertaining just like the previous reference on this though, soyeah, Nishikata I think we have deduced it's not you who is dumb it's Takagithat is smart haha. Next up, it's someone's birthday. I doubt Takagi has plannedto give him a birthday present with this much of precision, because unless sheknows that her boy will go out to the streets alone on his day so much so tobump into her, I think she might already be planning to give something to himlike, on another day in school. Outside of school, of course, not untilNishikata gets called for some random committee meeting by Yukari-chan haha.Anyways, Nishikata thinks that getting his birthday cake alone is embarrassing(I mean, WHY?? MOM YOU B*TCH haha) (By the way I have NEVER taken my ownbirthday cake on my birthday. Well, alone, I mean.) so telling Takagi-san aboutit is near impossible. I would argue though it'll just end if you say it so, andthen blame it on your mom. Which he wouldn't because that's what Takagi likesabout him being kind so... (Haha hit me Takagi) So they go to the cake shop,Takagi supposedly has an order ready to give to Nishikata at such short notice?Again, that's why I think it's planned but not on his day (refer to where Imentioned her agenda earlier) so Nishikata's appearance just made her planeasier to execute. Aw... So lucky you Nishikata, getting a birthday gift from agirl and being so <strike>smug</strike> happy about it haha<a href="https://jisho.org/search/urayamashii" target="_blank">URAYAMASHII</a>lol. Lastly, it's the sneeze. I mean, if you didn't know that sneezes arerumoured to also mean that someone is talking or spreading rumours about you youneed to watch more Anime haha. (#NotAd lol) Everyone is sneezing which I justassume it's the flu season but hey, it can happen anytime there's bad airquality so... Anyways, Takagi talks about rumours spreading about the both ofthem going out (they are) (HAHA GOTCHA TAKAGI &lt;= Not Nishikata), Yukari-chanthinks some dude is talking about her lol, Mano-chan thinks Nakai-kun is notconcerned about her enough (poor girl) (poor dude haha you insensitive fu-) buthey good follow-up bro, and Honjou-san thinks... nothing. I can't figure herout. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> You know who else we can't figure out? (#TakagiSanMe) Haha okaymoving on, the fat dude shouldn't have sneezed lmao, and Takagi... her sneeze isthe cutest haha. See, Nishikata? It's not hard to compliment someone once in awhile. Too bad bro, gotta train that embarrassment so you can get laid somedayyou know what I'm sayin'? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> If sentimental didn't give you enough wordsto express yourself every episode this season, I'm sure you will by the end ofthis because this show is so sweet hehe<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="900"              data-original-width="1600"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l_NHy6zJ_RY/XU-G1zaBegI/AAAAAAAAzRQ/Jkubk4L2LIEuTs1-cw7NFS8Q950M2-FwQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS2_05_eyecatch2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            You thought your reaction to this was like Yukari-chan until...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="900"              data-original-width="1600"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TXTMC6N-BOQ/XU-G21cK6iI/AAAAAAAAzRU/uorn_ITo0XwdbxgKQWy377ngoy8IePhUwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS2_05_present.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ...You noticed this was sweeter than the cake shop haha kyun kyun          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I really don't want to know,Hongo-san. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, in this new episode (#AraOto06) I have a good huncheverything will turn out great but then they will get shit on by the schoolbecause their works will sound like they are still virgins lmao. Well that isnot quite going to happen yet, so let's talk about field trips! Yay! How didthat happen though considering the Club's credibility in school? Let's talkabout it. Firstly, since she's technically topic girl for the episode, Kazusa.She is really stuck. From her getting stuck in love maybe with Izumi foreverfrom here on, she is also kind of faced with the pressure of other girlsinteracting with him, say Sugawara. Why doesn't that other one provoke herenough though? I don't know. But hey, apparently if it's between friends it'salways worse. Also, Kazusa just doesn't have enough confidence in herself. AndSugarwara here too is going to try her best to provoke the heck out of her,which to be honest might not be a good thing. Not that Evil Kazusa matters lol,but it's more like it'll make matters worse considering Kazusa thinks too much,and as a female too? I mean, I think too much but I'm a male so it's not goingto be more than a female. Well, literature taught me that so don't quote on melol, but suffice it to say things might not go too well for Kazusa if all you'redoing is poking the already thin layer of balloon waiting for it to burst. Notgoing to talk about oppai<a href="https://jisho.org/search/oppai" target="_blank"></a> in the<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ofuro" target="_blank">ofuro</a> here somoving on~ <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Nope, not going there) Talking about not going to anywhereerotic, Hongo-san has a hard time keeping her novel works up. I would argue thatshe has a really shitty person for a manager, but she can't really choose it,and the one novelist before her did do worse, but that guy is better thannothing, I guess. Also, relevant to the topic too, let's just ditch all thestuff we have about "esuibatsu" and talking about youth stuff like for theschool festival. So I hope for her sake that she has ditched her thong for anormal underwear (please don't not wear anything lol it's cold out there inJapan) and moved on to... I don't know, learn more things from the teacher? Shedid blackmail him again on the field trip location though so that's great.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Then, let's talk about Sonezaki. Haha, what? I can't talk about her andAmagi going out together until this series ends? Really Sonezaki-san? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Anyways, I understand her perspective, this virgin (lol), but Amagi seems to betaking a more proactive approach here BUT! Here's a big but here, that he isalso discouraged by this not-so-open relationship, it seems. If Amagi is alsothat weak to that extent then I guess that sucks, because Sonezaki is evenweaker in that aspect. She is scared, she doesn't like their relatioship to beopen, so Amagi is kind of stuck in that situation where he has to decide toparade his relationship and potentially get it ruined or otherwise. He... mayhave chosen neither so that might be a problem haha. On the other hand, Sonezakiis (sort of) coming up with a way to make them be able to<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha" target="_blank">ichaicha</a> inpublic or in school to say the least, so kudos for her making the effort. Then,we shift our focus back to the field trip with specifically<strike>Mocho</strike> Mo-chin and Sugawara (lol sorry). Since Sugawara istaking things into her own hands (which I discourage, once again also because)Mo-chin just feels like she has to do something to not let her best friendsuffer so much and sort of, I guess, clear her mind of such competition so shedoesn't feel that stressed anymore, I would argue. But yeah, you know whathappened above, so also as a beginner Mo-chin then is struggling to even appeaseKazusa and not let her think too much into this, but yeah, it's a balloonwaiting to explode, so if it's me I'll start finding somewhere to hide insteadof hold on to the end of it lol. Still, really makes you think how Sugawaraintends this to end, because if it will ever end I suspect it'll not be as happyas we might think. Potential cliffhanger for the series, everyone. It's kind ofeverywhere now like that female teacher's butt (lol what's with the SFX), solet's see where it takes us next week. I want this to be good. It has potentialto instantly create 5 couples, but as of now it's breaking apart. All of them.I'm getting worried too like Kazusa? I'll try not to think about it. *looks atlength of review* Haha I'll try.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-el22laC0Rdw/XU-TUVZpCII/AAAAAAAAzRo/PkRMvJLqUBo_JXqywIPO4zj7kB31iHWswCLcBGAs/s320/araoto06_couple1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            TFW a JK is thinking about you          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-drLnvQMtcJo/XU-TU2mXeFI/AAAAAAAAzRs/1A_HtTk1bCAy7wlDlazrwlu6v9tXtywdACLcBGAs/s320/araoto06_couple2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            TFW a JK wants to "esuibatsu" on you lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Nahjust joking that girl can't take a big di- OKAY MOVING ON haha we have a newgirl this week. We may have a couple more according to the opening themeanimation so I guess hold tight! Anyways, the girl is nicknamed<a href="https://jisho.org/search/majo" target="_blank">Majo</a> by Tanaka andas you can imagine, she likes supernatural stuff. Well, more than just that, butviolence? Hey, don't you EVER say video games promote violence because look atthis girl. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Thanks to her lovely younger sister (like seriously,<a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a><a href="https://jisho.org/search/banzai" target="_blank">banzai</a>) (MmmmmNan-chan!! lol) she finally gets some friends. Well, more importantly, she getsto go to school. Well Tanaka can take anyone so yeah, she'll be your friend,whatever. Haha and so she appears, Kujou. (From here Kujou will refer to theelder sister in the same class) Surprisingly freaking the shit out of Yamamoto,but on that I think we should just leave her alone. You know, just like how sheknows to leave Kujou alone lol. So other than that, the girl of the week triesher best to be friends and converse with others, only to realise there arehardly anyone she can get along with. With Robo's advice (thanks Aki-chan it wassomething to remember for me tbh) Kujou tries her best to go along with peoplewho she can understand and vice versa, while trying to cover her own passion ofstuff probably no one will be interested in. Well, that death prediction game isone thing haha (What, you guys never<a  href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SBXM8hF-9Ic/XU-5HVYHBFI/AAAAAAAAzSo/v5rwd1U_i44uwVCj82YYY29WcKXpLA0ZACKgBGAs/s320/asobiasobase06_voodoo.jpg"  target="_blank"  >poked a stuffed doll full of needles</a>before? Me neither), but other than that somehow the only one she can get alongwith in terms of opinion might just be Loli. Yeah, that kid. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Somehowtheir opinions of a romance movie is totally off, and considering they stillthink differently outside of the box, it might be hard for them to truly getalong, but hey, one friend at a time, yes? (Loli freaked out watching a horrormovie lmao what does she watch anyways) (maybe<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34799/PriPri_Chii-chan" target="_blank"  >PriPri Chii-chan</a>is more her thing lmao) Also, MVP the younger sister this episode forpractically teaching her the ways of school (well nearly), so she can at leaststay in school for a couple of days without freaking even Tanaka out in school.Will Tanaka be freaked out though? Or get beaten to death by the blunt side of adesk or chair first? One way to find out haha. To end this, I feel like I'm abit like Kujou, just... not the blood part I'm scared of needles lmao. Becauseit is hard to make friends based on what you like which is pretty mucheveryone's starter for conversations, and then you're the one that says "J-Pop"and EVERYONE just walks away from you so... too bad lor. I can never say thosestuff to others. That's how it works then, but there's the Internet too today soI wonder how Kujou will be coping with that though. Problem is she might havethat age gate to even talk about those stuff in like forums but hey, what'sstopping her? All in all, a real good episode covering everything slice-of-lifeI know I wouldn't be able to talk about them all, but hey, there's always nexttime. Maybe next time... someone will finally understand<strike>Kujou's jar wall</strike><strike>Yamamoto's seriousness</strike>&nbsp;<strike  >Majime's speed thoughts</strike>me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XXDm_L6srMU/XU-3hGW_SEI/AAAAAAAAzSU/urUCoxgiOLoXl5smTAP6GUsZlym2eJv7ACLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda06_kujou3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Forgetting about her interests she doesn't look half bad honestly            rather cute tbh          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ICHZJIWaQug/XU-3iPC-UeI/AAAAAAAAzSY/lOaz3tCu6PkRRcOI5AeN7I-orrs1tzuFwCLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda06_kujou4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I wish this was her handing me a love letter instead of asking me to            play a death prediction game          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

This week was<b>CHiCO with HoneyWorks new single</b> and... thank goodness the B-side wasn'tgood haha. I know, just scared of reviewing stuff already. Then again, maybebecause I heard of the cover by (guess what) Hatsune Miku and MAN is it terriblehaha. CHiCO-chan your voice is SO much better. The topic song itself was goodthough, and kudos to HoneyWorks for not screwing it up. Definitely on top of thelist for Anime theme songs this year. Next week brings us<b>Aimer's new single</b> which no doubt I will need to try to find a way tolisten to it on release date because she doesn't like Apple Music lol I blame onthe music label<br /><br />News this week: I taught you guys<a  href="../../2019/08/how-to-read-tweet-i-liked-for-dummies.html"    ><b>how to recognise Tweets I liked</b></a>so to rejoice (mostly) with me on the latest news,<b>SCANDAL released a new song</b> which isn't all bad, and they did a<b>YouTube Live</b> promoting that new song. Yeah, not much this week to behonest Comiket this weekend is way more active than my Twitter feed whichdoesn't say much tbh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hmm... I feel empty now. Don't know why, maybe it's me spending too much timetyping all weekend, or maybe it's me mesmerised by the recent purchase that isthe Google Daydream View VR headset. Well, I waited a week to play with it sinceit came in literally the next day I went to see the doctor and I swear lookinginto the headset I'll be sure to get a worse headache lol. Anyways, maybe it'smore because of me having to go back to that dreaded place by the time I postthe next issue of this, and that makes me sad. I hate countdowns. Cya guys nexttime then, and hopefully by then... Futon-chan you want to let me buy yourphotobook already? My wallet is ready. Yep, that international shipping wallettoo haha stay tuned next week to see if I get to buy it then<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
