I'm back!! Haha<br />
<br />
Well, I didn't leave here anyways lol you don't see it anyways. But suffice it
to say after fighting with myself (my body) for a whole week and practically
doing nothing at home but sleep... and going to work for in the middle of the
week with a splitting headache for some reason, this must be a wonderful week
haha. Anyways, whatever fun is over (if any), and next week features a public
holiday filled weekend lol, so let's end this week at least with me spending an
overall of... I think I spent more time in front of my work laptop than this PC
lol let's begin<br />
<br />
I DID NOT EVEN CARE ABOUT THE FREE TO PLAY GAMES THAT I PLAY haha let's move on
(#ModernDayProblems amirite)<br />
<br />

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Damn it Nishikata, how did you get so strong?" Haha you should've found out
    about his exercise regime. Excuse me, Takagi regime haha
  </div>
</blockquote>
I'm like, how do you beat Takagi-san? Nishikata, just don't accept anything.
Just don't, and you would have won her. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Again, that would have made an
awful series, so here's another episode (#TakagiSanS204) of him losing haha. So
yeah, firstly, it's arm-wrestling time! So once again if the above is not
obvious enough, at this point Nishikata could be considered as RIPPED for a
middle school student (lmao), so he clears the floor of male classmates with
ease. That is, until Takagi-san decided it'll be fun to top his high score lol.
I mean, it's not hard actually. Just either pretend that you cannot do it for
long enough so that he laxes his grip and you strike, or just say something
embarrasssing like holding a maiden's hand and you strike the moment he blushes.
All very, very intuitive approaches to win over a guy who has plenty of ego up
his whatever haha. (Not his heart you won't win BOOM haha) Next, everyone is
thinking about being mature. Lightning probably struck Mina-chan again for her
to think about the short passage of life lmao (but yeah Mina-chan seriously get
an image change for a start because even the others look more mature than you),
whatever new guys were introduced just to make Nishikata not feel too lonely
asking that fat friend of his (Kimura if I'm not wrong) (sorry bro for the
insult) but yeah, also not another thought, because coffee is not a measure of
how matured you are. I drank coffee at a pretty young age and people have only
told me my tastes are old-fashioned or bitter. "<a
  href="https://jisho.org/search/shibui"
  target="_blank"
  >Shibui</a
>", they call it. So yeah, so much for drinking a week of coffee at home
Nishikata, only to notice that the one serving in the vending machine (there's
two btw you could've chosen the one not drawn so detailed lol) is way bitter
than the ones you drank before and you also are dumb enough to think Takagi's
facts were right to hold it in your mouth for better taste? Haha only liars can
come up with this kind of nonsense. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Trying to be matured here btw
so...) Lastly, someone's bike did not come to school. We are of course talking
about the bike of Takagi-san, and Nishikata intends to guess why she didn't
bring it to school today. And yeah, Nishikata is probably right, but considering
the Master Teaser she probably is capable of planning this on you already, so
either way you will lose because the truth will never be in the answer. Yeah,
only boring people like us will say the bikes' brakes aren't working and be done
with it. Geniuses play a long draw since the day before, and then throwing you
into a long route to school giving you plenty of time to think about your kid
life (lol) and then letting you think you were duped the whole time only to find
out that you were duped into another truth which isn't the primary one. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
I must say, Takagi's IQ might be really too high for any of us to comprehend
haha. Anyways, he lost, for even for a moment I forgot what was the second
answer in which she hinted she said at the beginning, and to save you the effort
of finding out, Takagi said she wanted to hold hands with him to go to school.
Again, Takagi-san, that way of picking up this boy is not going to work. I don't
think any of them are going to get laid this season, I'm pretty sure. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
Lastly, loved that BGM the moment Nishikata stares at the coffee drink with the
man face in it haha that's the best this episode<br />

    "Is that how Sugawara-san feels..." Haha yeah, yep, yes Izumi she just gotta
    explain her life story to you to get the one point across
  </div>
</blockquote>
Okay Sugawara I say this is ENTIRELY your fault for spilling the beans but
thanks author once again because if she doesn't say it this will never hit that
blockhead haha. In this new episode (#AraOto05) of cries and laughter, if "TOMO
YO" doesn't symbolise friendship in real life I don't know what will haha.
Anyways, story first. Firstly, it's Sugawara (still typed it wrong) (mistake not
shown throughout the review for sanity purposes) and Izumi. Not that Kazusa saw
it because she can only be worried about it so we might as well leave her be
(it's like, a scene of her self-thought every episode keeping this series going
tbh haha) so let's talk about whatever they talked about instead. Sugawara
revealed her past on Izumi, talking about her kid theatre days, there's this
director who likes kids a lot (yes technically a pedophile but no since he
doesn't "esuibatsu" lmao) (Episode 2 please haha) and in particular Niina-chan
as a kid (too cute haha) (again, must be toxic in this fictional Japan, all
those jealous af kids) so he decided to cultivate her to be an outstanding
actress. Like yeah, with all his effort, as all he sees... is in the kid's
beauty. That's it. Makes you wonder if such purity of attraction exists (I'm
about to find out haha give a couple more years and I'll be illegal to like kids
lmao), but yeah, in Sugawara's story, yes it exists. From her lesson, it was to
remind Izumi (also of course leak to him the secret) that Kazusa is also a girl,
and to say anything completely flat out without going through your head is...
going to make things awkward any way you say it. So I sure hope Izumi learnt his
lesson. Also, sorry Kazusa in advance because your classmate ratted it out on
you lol. That you like your childhood friend. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Also, what is with
fingers on a bowling ball handle? Haha) Next up, it's Mo-chin. And contrary to
what I mentioned as we saw last week, instead of being the control group (having
a pure romance) we might have an outlier. A serious one, this time round, but
also as expected, is a guy who doesn't really care. It's as if he just wants a
girl to go out with. That, in hand, will make Mo-chin even more so confused
about boy-girl relationships, so yeah, thanks idiot. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (I'm not going to
talk about paying the restaurant bill, but) Sugimoto appears to be fine in front
of her, but then notice how much he changes when in messaging. If the subtitles
didn't do much justice he sounds way more canny than he should have, talking to
a female. Again, is it just me or do I behave like this too because I'm a male?
*thinks* I may have to think about it when this happens next time haha.
(Although I would argue I'm more feminine in expression compared to a male) (I
put stickers and stuff lmao okay that depends on the platform WhatsApp sucks
haha) (And yeah guys don't do the "haha" thing) Then, there's Hongou-san.
Sitting on the teacher's car whizzing by, and doing all the weird sh*t I wish I
could censor but this is not Seitokai Yakuindomo so it might still happen? Okay,
one thing at a time. In search of the truth, Hongou-san still believes what the
teacher says, and to be honest thus far? The teacher isn't wrong. Of course he's
saying all that in chat just as a reference (he did state that he isn't
interested in high school girls and she <i>barely</i> passes as one lol) (I
agree haha), but it's still pissing her off as usual, but more of the point is
she... is kind of clinging on him because she doesn't know of anyone else to
consult this on. As a novice novel author whose manager is nothing but useless.
So yeah, we might be in for a ride for a while with these two hehe. Last but not
least, and you bet I have been waiting for this as a highlight and climax for
this dull episode (was it dull though?) to end well: It's Sonezaki's reply to
Amagi and his report. Of course, the farce here is she literally marked on his
work lol, and then Amagi is just excited <strike>to read them all</strike> haha
of course to read the end of it where he literally asked her out in writing
and... good news, guys. He got laid. *applause* You did it, bro. You broke the
zero record in this series already. Congratulations, man. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Of course he
has reason to be excited, but as you might hear (literally) from the next
episode preview where the students are going on a field trip, you will notice
Amagi may not have the privilege to brag about his relationship with the
Literature Club President. You know what? If I get to go out with someone and
she's scared about telling the world about it I'll keep my mouth shut haha cya
guys next episode (FIELD TRIP HYPE haha)<br />

If.... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> If... IF!! If the first part of every episode never left you to
want to punch Tanaka in the face, you can stop watching this series because it
is boring to you lmao. Ignoring the fact that production is literally ensuring
that intro segment happens every week, in this week's new episode (#JoshiMuda05)
if girls are your thing and guys aren't I'm sure you'll go along with the new
transfer student lol. I would say "not classsifiable" would be applicable to you
too, Lily-san, so <strike>shut the f**k up</strike> keep it down a bit, that
attitude haha. Okay, it's a new girl, she voiced by (OMG I love this already she
retweeted too many times this week) Satou Satomi-chan, and as you would have
known, I have hardly heard of her in such a role. (Okay "Seitokai Yakuindomo"
but) And you bet I'm filled up all the way up till my neck. Not in spots, no
(haha), but man is the voice acting on this good. So yeah, Lily herself, she
weird (the class determined it real quick) but it's not because she's like an
onee-san or something, but she seems to have a phobia. Allergy, even. And from
the looks of it, it might be the latter, for good or for worse. (I want to
imagine the extent of jokes on this but I think I'll leave that alone haha poor
girl) Anyways, she introduced herself real well, thought she could get away with
sitting at the back of the class only to notice she sat with the dumbest, most
unpredictable classmate of all time... we don't need to introduce her I've
gotten quite enough of Episode 1 haha. So yeah, this episode is somewhat
dedicated to Lily for her to you know, blend in with the class and get to know
people. Firstly, targetting the weak social people so she can be friends with
them. I wish I was a woman in another life in a girls' high school but... yeah.
Then, be friends with the most popular girl in class. And in this case that will
be Ninomae, and as we know a lot about her, this time around... I guess Lily-san
may be thinking too much. But damn, haha. Then, helping people out if you can,
and not all the time, unlike Ninomae. (Hey, if you need a reminder that Google
removed "Don't be evil" from their company motto list...) In Lily's case, she
helped out Loli kinda, in refreshing her mind about what it means to have kids.
Eh... she probably got into a worse situation considering it involves Tanaka
haha, but yeah she kinda got away with it for now maybe. Lastly, get helped so
misunderstandings can be cleared. Which is mainly on why the heck Lily would be
allergic to touching Tanaka even when she says she's only allergic to males. I
guess testing with all male animal species may be unwise, so Robo did the
smartest science thing by doing a psychological blind test, and if Tanaka
touches her again and she's fine then it's psychological. It's not. I mean, it's
not haha. She can feel a frog's hand from a mile away, this girl. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Aw
man, with this episode going on and on, I have a feeling I'll like this series a
lot haha. But man, is Satomi-chan's acting standing out even more than Rieri's
from last week. (GOMEN! MAJI GOMEN!!) (And yes it's because they suppressed her
good as Shichijou Aria... well not really lol) Okay, cannot praise more liao
she's going to get allergic to my compliments lmao<br />
[If I didn't end this review yet, it's because I would like to talk about the

P.S. "She's not that different from me though?" Wow, Tanaka, how many
reincarnations worth of leopard's courage have you consumed to be able to say
that lmao (I want to say this in Chinese so bad but I'm not going back to those
days lol)<br />
P.P.S. For research purposes Tanaka has gotten hit by a tissue box&nbsp;<strike
  >1</strike
>
<strike>2</strike> 3 time(s) since this episode may continue monitoring for
further occurences (lol) (on the other hand I should've counted how many times
Lily screamed hahaha HAHAHAHAHAHA)<br />
[Yes that "please don't tease me" is NOT a reference to another Anime on this

the argument between two idiots on the right or watching Akane undress on the
left is better haha *looks at Akane* (and then you realise reading the manga
that it's filler content dammit Anime]<br />

Well as you guys have known I didn't spend too much time listening to songs this
week, so... <b>Porno Graffitti's new single</b> isn't impressive, and I think I
did mention this in recent releases from them already, but yeah, not enough
punch on their song structures, you know, making drastic changes to verses and
choruses won't be making their resume good in any case to be honest.
<b>miwa's new single</b> is... not released yet (two weeks from now) but the
topic song is... I mean, she has changed a lot ever since she cut her hair. I
miss her long hair now. Next week we'll finally get our hands on
<b>CHiCO with HoneyWorks new single</b> as opening theme for Anime "Araoto", so
that's good, been looking forward to that for quite a while. Hope it doesn't
disappoint. Now I'm really starting to think if there will be anyone good to put
on Top 20 this year lmao<br />
<br />
On Twitter this week, <b>TrySail released a new video</b> for their music video
collection which is chosen by fans, and... I mean, you can see it for yourself.
It's super cute but you know, China because those Japanese chose a kung-fu song
which I didn't give lol why.
<b>Natsukawa Shiina is coming up with a new EP</b> end of September (yay
Nan-chan) (summer too so I sure hope she'll make it a summer to remember hehe),
they revealed the <b>cover art for Asakura Momo's new single</b> (what else am I
going to report here? lol) and... you may want a listen to
<b>yucat's new song</b> on YouTube. It's a recorded live performance and... you
can like the song I'm fine haha<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's it. Note to self to also spellcheck last week's issue because... I didn't
go to work so there aren't any lunch breaks to read through them lol. Cya guys
next week then, and maybe then, MAYBE, I'll start doing up on a couple of those
posts over the long weekend. I'll try. I want more time to make a better blog
template because Blogger can't do responsive so I'm doing it myself somehow...
you can try to play around with it if you aren't in mobile if you want. I'll
refine this if I have time haha bye<br />
