Anyways, not work is going tooccupy my life for the next two weeks after that which I shouldn't explain toomuch here (Hint: It's conscription-related) but suffice it to say that I... mayhave more time to do this now lol work pressure amirite<br /><br />Let's begin. Anime this week is nothing compared to the songs released today, tobe honest.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS206">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Whoever gets higher total on this sports test wins" Come on Nishikata if    there isn't push-ups in it you'll ALWAYS lose lmao  </div></blockquote>"The committee work is all done now, so..." And this is how Nishikata realisedhow much Takagi-san is already in his life lmao it's like me with porn lol AHEMin this new episode (#TakagiSanS206) the teasing continues. By Nishikata himselfhaha. Well, he's always setting things up for himself on Takagi, so yeahnaturally he'll get caught in it somehow. Let's start with the sports test. Aswith last year (yeah this is a thing too bad we won't get that but) Nishikatachallenged Takagi into a showdown on their scores, and... I mean, you can expectthe result. Surprisingly, Nishikata did not lose despite the... one time hecan't do sit-and-reach (like me) and the one time he got teased by Takagi haha.But yeah, he just admitted defeat. It's like folding your ace pair hand beforethe cards even reveal at a Texas Hold'Em. Oh well Nishikata, you idiot. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Then again I wish I had someone to look up to preferrably a woman (lol) so thatit can motivate me to exercise haha *pulls reps in gym* ARGH I'M NOT ON STERIODShaha okay let's move on. Next up, the field trip. Since the committee meetinginvolving Nishikata is done and plans are made to happen soon (the trip), he canfinally go home with Takagi. Yay! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, besides that, we don't knowmuch about what will happen since it'll be in a future episode and...Nishikata's drawings are cute lmao. Then, there's the trio again. Once again, Ithink we can have just a series of that and call it "Chuugakusei no Mudazukai"because it's so awesome of a slice-of-life segment it deserves it's own Animehaha. Anyways, they went to a dagashi shop (*gets Hotaru flashbacks*) and boughtstuff, Yukari doesn't want to eat hers on the spot even though she hungry (incase you wonder why their house probably has an early dinner, like mine) andsince Mina-chan won one more she gave hers... to the wild cat. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> That catman, has awesome reflexes. Besides beating all two of them in running away (lolYukari) (lmao Mina-chan) the last one... Sanae (I swear I forgot her name) justlet the cat go because we know that cat is not just feeding itself to resort tosuch acrobatic stunts haha. So yeah, very wholesome story I would argue. Andthen the couple decided to visit the same shop after the girls left, what luck.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> After a game of dodgeball outside of school which he lost (I mean, whata surprise) Takagi wants him to buy her sweets for the field trip. So yeah, nowthat she knows you are rich boy Nishikata lol, why not just take it as a dateand eat cup noodles with her? Hey, at least he's enjoying it. And so is Takagibut it doesn't show on her face. Subtle and sweet. Not talking about the sweetsat the shop, by the way. Worst thing is of course, the arrival of his friends inclass. Yep, that is silent drama level maxed out liao, that one. Nishikata isright on if they ever call him out he can still retort, but hey, sucks to havefriends who are mute, right? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, just confirming on this with justtheir own eyes lmao. But seriously Kaji Yuki stop dating with this Anime girlalready there are already rumours about you and another other girl lmao (really,no joke, I can't find a translation of that though but) you still got more to donext week to not get tricked, I mean, teased again by the Tease Master haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="900"              data-original-width="1600"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nTCLl3MbE0c/XVkA197steI/AAAAAAAAzfA/ZAfBQPqYjbEaLY03M02mctfQfkF1ofdLACLcBGAs/s320/takagisan_S2_06_bros2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            You know you are screwed caught doing something bad when...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="900"              data-original-width="1600"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YS82Yp-neWc/XVkA2r_ZMLI/AAAAAAAAzfE/WCiC3ukZD34Owo_Y7I5Eo7e3PSFyUDtOwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisan_S2_06_sit%2526reach.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ... you can't even pass your sit and reach lol LITERALLY ME IN            MIDDLE SCHOOL haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "I can continue to tease you for the rest of your life?" Haha Takagi HELLYEAH Nishikata just doesn't know that she can actually do that even beyondschool life hehe<br />P.P.S. "A loss is a loss" Haha yeah especially when you don't even want him towin anyway, Ta-ka-gi haha<br />[A Takagi GIF a week keeps the teasing away, I would say. So...]<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-32kt-Nt_Pbg/XVkMHdzFuhI/AAAAAAAAzfg/QyxGOLIIQxgPy3_ZzGK_vAx2s1_cAPqqACLcBGAs/s320/takagisan_S2_06_fure.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Again, just imagine Takagi saying "fure" repeatedly, yes?      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AraOto07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "In this room right now, ten boobs are jiggling around" LOL WTF I'm leaving    haha  </div></blockquote>I guess the thing is more like "I want you to know everything already, but Idon't want to be your teacher" kind of thing, right, Milo-san? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I don'tknow man, we're reaching DomeKano territory for this teacher-studentrelationship somehow. Okay, the new episode (#AraOto07) we are... damn, thisb*tch, Sonezaki. Is she having too much fun?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> But heck did this turninto the darkest series this season over here, and let's talk about why.Firstly, the trip. Ignoring how much fun Sonezaki is messaging Amagi lol,Mo-chin can't get off that one guy Sugimoto (goddamn and that's why you won'tget laid bro) (so much for saying it to myself I don't even have one lol) andHongo-san... let's just say she is really into<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shuuchi" target="_blank">shuuchi</a><a href="https://jisho.org/search/purei" target="_blank">play</a> haha.Meanwhile, Kazusa still can't get over the fact that Sugawara is in her mind asif she was being the obstacle between her and Izumi (well, not wrong) but thenas Sugawara wants to clear her mind in order to somehow obtain an understandingfrom the already frantic and shy girl who doesn't want to speak her mind so...they have a pillow fight. What? Man, this show. Well firstly they just got toslip in this part for the sake of the series just like the bath scene, sowhatever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> If they got anything out of this, it is that stealing ideasfrom others is the best lmao. So yeah, they got their urban legend, and maybeKazusa isn't too stuck on her friend being in her way anymore, as she... maywant to confess to Izumi after all? Hey, after taking the recital role in theschool festival, why not? It will get to him though, don't you worry about that.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> However, this is where somehow the show takes a real turn, whereSugawara is... she is confused. Hey, after giving advice for like, 6 episodesstraight and be the first to talk about "esuibatsu"?? I'm surprised how youhaven't broken down yet. So yeah, the bigger problem is that she went to ask foradvice from the last expected person on the list... nope it's not Milo-san lol,but her teacher in theatre school. And may I say Niina, that is a bad choice.Remember when she got advice from her peers when she was in that school? Yeah,those were way better. But yeah, of course the teacher is going to do the mostdrama thing by telling her to interfere in the yet to blossom relationshipbetween Kazusa and Izumi because hey, what's not to love for if it isn't foughtwith your own hands? Ugh you f**king pedo now I hate you even more now. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Anyways, that is some way to end the episode (especially the kissing wtf) solet's hope next episode isn't a train wreck because Izumi would hate to seethat. You know, b*tch fights maybe. I doubt so? But if there will be one Izumiwouldn't be able to deal with it. I doubt I will be able to do so too, so... heysay who isn't any wiser in this? Haha this show is in a very well concealedirony also Kazusa stop thinking about boobs I want to summon that 1x<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/32650/Masaki_Jougasaki"  target="_blank"  >Jougasaki</a>so bad but I know I shouldn't haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JDTNPj4vbpU/XVkLz2S53yI/AAAAAAAAzfU/AfXMn4Nd2ooh68SjRi68rliOz2C5tHL8ACLcBGAs/s320/araoto07_sonezaki5.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Before getting a BF          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5igpoMVJ86M/XVkL0jmgUPI/AAAAAAAAzfY/XnCnFqJTMQI2XEBlMI0Xc0iRe-wcP1VdwCLcBGAs/s320/araoto07_sonezaki4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            After getting a BF lol<br />            (I can't WAIT to get laid haha)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Hey, bear inmind only <i>I</i> am into J-Pop lmao. In this new episode (#JoshiMuda07) whereTanaka tries to ruin your solo music session, we talk about someone else who isnot hanging her junk out and think it's bad lol Tanaka go read up on somehistory would you. Okay jokes aside, let's go into the darkness. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Were-introduce Yamamoto? Okay, if you aren't familiar with her after this manyepisodes, she is... man after watching the episode? You tell me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Anyways, the episode. Firstly, we finally know of the bandages that have beenwrapping Yamamoto's... body (I can't describe it it's too gory lol) this wholetime: it's rashes. *lenses drop out of my spectacle frame* Which obviously meansshe needs some serious treatment, but then again she is kind of like me becauseit never hurta so I don't care but I don't cover them with bandages so whateverlol. Then, she goes for a walk in the human world. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, the arcade,specifically. Playing the claw machine, more specifically. She fails many times,sees others be successful and gets pissed off especially when it's a couple whowon lol, and Majime comes in to save the day. You know, not that she iscoincidentally good at playing arcade games or anything. Yamamoto got it as aprize, and she tweeted her with her "boyfriend" on the Internet lol youattention seeker I don't even dare to post my own face- Then, there's thenurse's office visit. This one, I didn't expect there's a teacher in SainotamaHigh who can top this girl, but I think we have found her. "Shiikyon", as shehas nicknamed herself (and not from Tanaka) (I think), she has to endurelistening to Yamamoto talk about her "wounds" but then again I thought it washer initially having to leave to go teach as she is a teacher too, but I may bewrong. Then again, the initial impression sure made it feel like she canunderstand kids like Yamamoto better than that university girl-loving teacher intheir class lol. Then, there's the mask. You know, because Majou happens to haveone to sell and Yamai happens to see it and buy it (now that's what I call atrade) (Capitalism, everyone) until... she got freaked out when Majou explainedto her the backstory of that mask involving a possessed war soldier lmao.Lastly, a wonderful display of an idiot with another idiot. But seriously, I gota good laugh at this one, especially the end haha. In a nutshell, Yamamoto wasdumb enough to stick her head into one of those display stands on the streetwhere you can put your face in and take photos (just like Waseda did lmao) butyeah, problem is she can't get out of it. Tanaka was passing by and was kindenough to... stick her head in it too. (call me pun genius haha) So being in thesame boat, they decide to, in the most ingenious way possible, carry their headsup (pun genius, haha) all the way to school so at least somebody can help getthem out of it. To make things worse, Yamamoto thought Tanaka couldn't top herin&nbsp;<strike>stupidity</strike> stupidity lmao (I'm still pretty sure it ishaha) but yeah, delinquent behaviour Tanaka couldn't miss out on the stupidstuff you do so your loss, Yamamoto. End up, they all had to sing the schoolsong together holding hands with <strike>Jesus</strike> Waseda haha did you hearthe lyrics of that song?? I seriously thought this show would at least give mesome form of seriousness on this until I notice that it was too late lmao yesthey were singing<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tama" target="_blank">tama</a>&nbsp;(as in theones beside a schlong) many times in it God this show (English words too?wtf)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_N0Ofsj4w14/XVkaAyEz8TI/AAAAAAAAzfw/SFU2R1_7zKw6vzvJgsyNfv183qKxC4epgCLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda07_shiikyon3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How you know your teachers are not to be trifled with lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NVyRaoaekac/XVkaB29u_kI/AAAAAAAAzf0/tJ0bxcm8LbU6mDAG_HF3oJQdyllUVWv0wCLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda07_kaomoji.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How you know your teachers are not to be trifled with lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "So your pride is worth less than 100 yen" lmao the teacher is getting goodat coaxing Yamamoto "I think at some point I have to charge you for the expenseson my glasses" haha go ask from her parents and also tell them to treat hercondition too it doesn't look good on her<br />P.P.S. Also, never thought I would say this, but this is my first encounter ofwatching Anime girls put on contact lenses. Yes, they were way bigger than theyare in real life. Which also explains why the lens will never get into her eyebecause it's still too small and they don't have the budget to animate thatlmao<br />[Okay I accidentally fell in love with Yamamoto now so here's<strike>more of</strike> her since teachers were MVP this episode lol (damn<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/39149/Miyu_Tomita" target="_blank"  >the voice actress</a>is real young perfect JK voice btw especially the shy parts hehe)]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y3-ik6glOio/XVkbS-1Tr8I/AAAAAAAAzgE/JCrObzXTHuwFK8pWSsLww1e1TtiOVfV-gCLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda07_yamamoto6.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This (drawing of her) is so cute I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Iuts843fWY0/XVkbUHZ8pEI/AAAAAAAAzgI/JYJsJ68LN1MJVdY01tgCQVkTlMAY46cSQCLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda07_lenses.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            And with this image I've broken the principles of logic by showing            images of three of the same person by using only two images lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week was quite a week in Klassic Note, I'm so sorry I only remembered likeone of them last week haha. <b>miwa's new single</b> turned out to be impressiveas I had the mood to listen to it. To be honest? It was actually veryreminiscent of her usual style despite her saying on an interview (not going totranslate Japanese here) that she is on another arc of her music career.Nonethtless, the topic song is great, and I am considering as much as 3 out ofher 4-track single. Yeah. That's as far as I might go. I mean, if you didn'tkeep releasing digital singles for the past year miwa I would've bought one CDby now. Anyways, moving on! <b>ClariS new concept album</b> for summer isn'tgreat; I didn't like the cover songs of summer (I mean, seriously?), and theirnew song for summer is... you guys heard of Fuchigami Mai's new single yet?(Okay I'm crossing boundaries here, but) Man is it disappointing, the album.Last but not least, <b>Aimer's new single</b> isn't awesome considering Ishouldn't have just listened to the short version music video on YouTube becauseclearly that is edited down which is worse than a cut down preview from thestart... but yeah, I'll probably give the song despite the super long bridgepart of the song. Hey, she didn't write the song so whatever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Oh <b>nano.RIPE's new single</b> releases next week, and going from thepreview... we're getting an emotional song. I better be in the mood for it. Iwill be, considering I'm going back to camp BOOM got them haha<br /><br />On news this week, (I don't know how I missed this for like, a month but)<b>cinema staff's best album</b> releases next month including their indiereleases and including their new song which is AWESOME,<b>Kitou Akari's debut song music video preview</b> is nothing but awesomeconsidering it comes from Anison veteran music label Pony Canyon (wow #NotAdhaha), and <b>SHE's is going on a three-month digital single release</b> likewhoever is leading to their album now...<b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's new album</b> is coming end September. Wellthese guys will keep me company haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's it then. And if you haven't read any of the recent posts over the pastweekend you should as I spent a lot of time on it. I spent a lot of time thisweek on Zelda BoW though (gamers should know what it is) so... yeah. Making thatNintendo Switch which I bought for my sis on her birthday worth it since she'snot playing this damn thing lol. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully bythen... I'll be happier. I doubt so, but one can dream. Haha good night<br /><br />P.S. I updated on the image thumbnails now (from as of the blog migration ie.July 2019) such that all thumbnails can be clicked/tapped on their image only(instead of the whole table it's on) and you can click/tap on hyperlinks on thefirst visible one now. Through the power of JavaScript and many weekends oftesting I have learnt yet another lesson haha ok bye<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
