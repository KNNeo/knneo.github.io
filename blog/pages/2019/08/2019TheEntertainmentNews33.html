Hey.<br />
<br />
If this post came out later than normal this week, it's probably obvious to the
usual reader that I'm on work leave tomorrow haha. Anyways, not work is going to
occupy my life for the next two weeks after that which I shouldn't explain too
much here (Hint: It's conscription-related) but suffice it to say that I... may
have more time to do this now lol work pressure amirite<br />
<br />
Let's begin. Anime this week is nothing compared to the songs released today, to
be honest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS206">
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span
    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Whoever gets higher total on this sports test wins" Come on Nishikata if
    there isn't push-ups in it you'll ALWAYS lose lmao
  </div>
</blockquote>
"The committee work is all done now, so..." And this is how Nishikata realised
how much Takagi-san is already in his life lmao it's like me with porn lol AHEM
in this new episode (#TakagiSanS206) the teasing continues. By Nishikata himself
haha. Well, he's always setting things up for himself on Takagi, so yeah
naturally he'll get caught in it somehow. Let's start with the sports test. As
with last year (yeah this is a thing too bad we won't get that but) Nishikata
challenged Takagi into a showdown on their scores, and... I mean, you can expect
the result. Surprisingly, Nishikata did not lose despite the... one time he
can't do sit-and-reach (like me) and the one time he got teased by Takagi haha.
But yeah, he just admitted defeat. It's like folding your ace pair hand before
the cards even reveal at a Texas Hold'Em. Oh well Nishikata, you idiot. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
Then again I wish I had someone to look up to preferrably a woman (lol) so that
it can motivate me to exercise haha *pulls reps in gym* ARGH I'M NOT ON STERIODS
haha okay let's move on. Next up, the field trip. Since the committee meeting
involving Nishikata is done and plans are made to happen soon (the trip), he can
finally go home with Takagi. Yay! <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, besides that, we don't know
much about what will happen since it'll be in a future episode and...
Nishikata's drawings are cute lmao. Then, there's the trio again. Once again, I
think we can have just a series of that and call it "Chuugakusei no Mudazukai"
because it's so awesome of a slice-of-life segment it deserves it's own Anime
haha. Anyways, they went to a dagashi shop (*gets Hotaru flashbacks*) and bought
stuff, Yukari doesn't want to eat hers on the spot even though she hungry (in
case you wonder why their house probably has an early dinner, like mine) and
since Mina-chan won one more she gave hers... to the wild cat. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> That cat
man, has awesome reflexes. Besides beating all two of them in running away (lol
Yukari) (lmao Mina-chan) the last one... Sanae (I swear I forgot her name) just
let the cat go because we know that cat is not just feeding itself to resort to
such acrobatic stunts haha. So yeah, very wholesome story I would argue. And
then the couple decided to visit the same shop after the girls left, what luck.
<span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> After a game of dodgeball outside of school which he lost (I mean, what
a surprise) Takagi wants him to buy her sweets for the field trip. So yeah, now
that she knows you are rich boy Nishikata lol, why not just take it as a date
and eat cup noodles with her? Hey, at least he's enjoying it. And so is Takagi
but it doesn't show on her face. Subtle and sweet. Not talking about the sweets
at the shop, by the way. Worst thing is of course, the arrival of his friends in
class. Yep, that is silent drama level maxed out liao, that one. Nishikata is
right on if they ever call him out he can still retort, but hey, sucks to have
friends who are mute, right? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, just confirming on this with just
their own eyes lmao. But seriously Kaji Yuki stop dating with this Anime girl
already there are already rumours about you and another other girl lmao (really,
no joke, I can't find a translation of that though but) you still got more to do
next week to not get tricked, I mean, teased again by the Tease Master haha<br />

P.S. "I can continue to tease you for the rest of your life?" Haha Takagi HELL
YEAH Nishikata just doesn't know that she can actually do that even beyond
school life hehe<br />
P.P.S. "A loss is a loss" Haha yeah especially when you don't even want him to
win anyway, Ta-ka-gi haha<br />
[A Takagi GIF a week keeps the teasing away, I would say. So...]<br />

I guess the thing is more like "I want you to know everything already, but I
don't want to be your teacher" kind of thing, right, Milo-san? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> I don't
know man, we're reaching DomeKano territory for this teacher-student
relationship somehow. Okay, the new episode (#AraOto07) we are... damn, this
b*tch, Sonezaki. Is she having too much fun?? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> But heck did this turn
into the darkest series this season over here, and let's talk about why.
Firstly, the trip. Ignoring how much fun Sonezaki is messaging Amagi lol,
Mo-chin can't get off that one guy Sugimoto (goddamn and that's why you won't
get laid bro) (so much for saying it to myself I don't even have one lol) and
Hongo-san... let's just say she is really into
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shuuchi" target="_blank">shuuchi</a>
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/purei" target="_blank">play</a> haha.
Meanwhile, Kazusa still can't get over the fact that Sugawara is in her mind as
if she was being the obstacle between her and Izumi (well, not wrong) but then
as Sugawara wants to clear her mind in order to somehow obtain an understanding
from the already frantic and shy girl who doesn't want to speak her mind so...
they have a pillow fight. What? Man, this show. Well firstly they just got to
slip in this part for the sake of the series just like the bath scene, so
whatever. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> If they got anything out of this, it is that stealing ideas
from others is the best lmao. So yeah, they got their urban legend, and maybe
Kazusa isn't too stuck on her friend being in her way anymore, as she... may
want to confess to Izumi after all? Hey, after taking the recital role in the
school festival, why not? It will get to him though, don't you worry about that.
<span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> However, this is where somehow the show takes a real turn, where
Sugawara is... she is confused. Hey, after giving advice for like, 6 episodes
straight and be the first to talk about "esuibatsu"?? I'm surprised how you
haven't broken down yet. So yeah, the bigger problem is that she went to ask for
advice from the last expected person on the list... nope it's not Milo-san lol,
but her teacher in theatre school. And may I say Niina, that is a bad choice.
Remember when she got advice from her peers when she was in that school? Yeah,
those were way better. But yeah, of course the teacher is going to do the most
drama thing by telling her to interfere in the yet to blossom relationship
between Kazusa and Izumi because hey, what's not to love for if it isn't fought
with your own hands? Ugh you f**king pedo now I hate you even more now. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
Anyways, that is some way to end the episode (especially the kissing wtf) so
let's hope next episode isn't a train wreck because Izumi would hate to see
that. You know, b*tch fights maybe. I doubt so? But if there will be one Izumi
wouldn't be able to deal with it. I doubt I will be able to do so too, so... hey
say who isn't any wiser in this? Haha this show is in a very well concealed
irony also Kazusa stop thinking about boobs I want to summon that 1x

</blockquote>
Haha Wota with that intro is literally me when I hear a new song. Hey, bear in
mind only <i>I</i> am into J-Pop lmao. In this new episode (#JoshiMuda07) where
Tanaka tries to ruin your solo music session, we talk about someone else who is
not hanging her junk out and think it's bad lol Tanaka go read up on some
history would you. Okay jokes aside, let's go into the darkness. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> We
re-introduce Yamamoto? Okay, if you aren't familiar with her after this many
episodes, she is... man after watching the episode? You tell me. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
Anyways, the episode. Firstly, we finally know of the bandages that have been
wrapping Yamamoto's... body (I can't describe it it's too gory lol) this whole
time: it's rashes. *lenses drop out of my spectacle frame* Which obviously means
she needs some serious treatment, but then again she is kind of like me because
it never hurta so I don't care but I don't cover them with bandages so whatever
lol. Then, she goes for a walk in the human world. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, the arcade,
specifically. Playing the claw machine, more specifically. She fails many times,
sees others be successful and gets pissed off especially when it's a couple who
won lol, and Majime comes in to save the day. You know, not that she is
coincidentally good at playing arcade games or anything. Yamamoto got it as a
prize, and she tweeted her with her "boyfriend" on the Internet lol you
attention seeker I don't even dare to post my own face- Then, there's the
nurse's office visit. This one, I didn't expect there's a teacher in Sainotama
High who can top this girl, but I think we have found her. "Shiikyon", as she
has nicknamed herself (and not from Tanaka) (I think), she has to endure
listening to Yamamoto talk about her "wounds" but then again I thought it was
her initially having to leave to go teach as she is a teacher too, but I may be
wrong. Then again, the initial impression sure made it feel like she can
understand kids like Yamamoto better than that university girl-loving teacher in
their class lol. Then, there's the mask. You know, because Majou happens to have
one to sell and Yamai happens to see it and buy it (now that's what I call a
trade) (Capitalism, everyone) until... she got freaked out when Majou explained
to her the backstory of that mask involving a possessed war soldier lmao.
Lastly, a wonderful display of an idiot with another idiot. But seriously, I got
a good laugh at this one, especially the end haha. In a nutshell, Yamamoto was
dumb enough to stick her head into one of those display stands on the street
where you can put your face in and take photos (just like Waseda did lmao) but
yeah, problem is she can't get out of it. Tanaka was passing by and was kind
enough to... stick her head in it too. (call me pun genius haha) So being in the
same boat, they decide to, in the most ingenious way possible, carry their heads
up (pun genius, haha) all the way to school so at least somebody can help get
them out of it. To make things worse, Yamamoto thought Tanaka couldn't top her
in&nbsp;<strike>stupidity</strike> stupidity lmao (I'm still pretty sure it is
haha) but yeah, delinquent behaviour Tanaka couldn't miss out on the stupid
stuff you do so your loss, Yamamoto. End up, they all had to sing the school
song together holding hands with <strike>Jesus</strike> Waseda haha did you hear
the lyrics of that song?? I seriously thought this show would at least give me
some form of seriousness on this until I notice that it was too late lmao yes
they were singing

P.S. "So your pride is worth less than 100 yen" lmao the teacher is getting good
at coaxing Yamamoto "I think at some point I have to charge you for the expenses
on my glasses" haha go ask from her parents and also tell them to treat her
condition too it doesn't look good on her<br />
P.P.S. Also, never thought I would say this, but this is my first encounter of
watching Anime girls put on contact lenses. Yes, they were way bigger than they
are in real life. Which also explains why the lens will never get into her eye
because it's still too small and they don't have the budget to animate that
lmao<br />
[Okay I accidentally fell in love with Yamamoto now so here's
<strike>more of</strike> her since teachers were MVP this episode lol (damn

This week was quite a week in Klassic Note, I'm so sorry I only remembered like
one of them last week haha. <b>miwa's new single</b> turned out to be impressive
as I had the mood to listen to it. To be honest? It was actually very
reminiscent of her usual style despite her saying on an interview (not going to
translate Japanese here) that she is on another arc of her music career.
Nonethtless, the topic song is great, and I am considering as much as 3 out of
her 4-track single. Yeah. That's as far as I might go. I mean, if you didn't
keep releasing digital singles for the past year miwa I would've bought one CD
by now. Anyways, moving on! <b>ClariS new concept album</b> for summer isn't
great; I didn't like the cover songs of summer (I mean, seriously?), and their
new song for summer is... you guys heard of Fuchigami Mai's new single yet?
(Okay I'm crossing boundaries here, but) Man is it disappointing, the album.
Last but not least, <b>Aimer's new single</b> isn't awesome considering I
shouldn't have just listened to the short version music video on YouTube because
clearly that is edited down which is worse than a cut down preview from the
start... but yeah, I'll probably give the song despite the super long bridge
part of the song. Hey, she didn't write the song so whatever. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />
<br />
Oh <b>nano.RIPE's new single</b> releases next week, and going from the
preview... we're getting an emotional song. I better be in the mood for it. I
will be, considering I'm going back to camp BOOM got them haha<br />
<br />
On news this week, (I don't know how I missed this for like, a month but)
<b>cinema staff's best album</b> releases next month including their indie
releases and including their new song which is AWESOME,
<b>Kitou Akari's debut song music video preview</b> is nothing but awesome
considering it comes from Anison veteran music label Pony Canyon (wow #NotAd
haha), and <b>SHE's is going on a three-month digital single release</b> like
whoever is leading to their album now...
<b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's new album</b> is coming end September. Well
these guys will keep me company haha<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's it then. And if you haven't read any of the recent posts over the past
weekend you should as I spent a lot of time on it. I spent a lot of time this
week on Zelda BoW though (gamers should know what it is) so... yeah. Making that
Nintendo Switch which I bought for my sis on her birthday worth it since she's
not playing this damn thing lol. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully by
then... I'll be happier. I doubt so, but one can dream. Haha good night<br />
<br />
P.S. I updated on the image thumbnails now (from as of the blog migration ie.
July 2019) such that all thumbnails can be clicked/tapped on their image only
(instead of the whole table it's on) and you can click/tap on hyperlinks on the
first visible one now. Through the power of JavaScript and many weekends of
testing I have learnt yet another lesson haha ok bye
