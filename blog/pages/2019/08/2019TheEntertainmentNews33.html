Anyways, not work is going to occupy my life for the next two weeks after that which I shouldn't explain too much here (Hint: It's conscription-related) but suffice it to say that I... may have more time to do this now lol work pressure amirite<br><br> Let's begin. Anime this week is nothing compared to the songs released today, to be honest.<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSanS206><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Whoever gets higher total on this sports test wins" Come on Nishikata if there isn't push-ups in it you'll ALWAYS lose lmao</div></blockquote>"The committee work is all done now, so..." And this is how Nishikata realised how much Takagi-san is already in his life lmao it's like me with porn lol AHEM in this new episode (#TakagiSanS206) the teasing continues. By Nishikata himself haha. Well, he's always setting things up for himself on Takagi, so yeah naturally he'll get caught in it somehow. Let's start with the sports test. As with last year (yeah this is a thing too bad we won't get that but) Nishikata challenged Takagi into a showdown on their scores, and... I mean, you can expect the result. Surprisingly, Nishikata did not lose despite the... one time he can't do sit-and-reach (like me) and the one time he got teased by Takagi haha. But yeah, he just admitted defeat. It's like folding your ace pair hand before the cards even reveal at a Texas Hold'Em. Oh well Nishikata, you idiot. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Then again I wish I had someone to look up to preferrably a woman (lol) so that it can motivate me to exercise haha *pulls reps in gym* ARGH I'M NOT ON STERIODS haha okay let's move on. Next up, the field trip. Since the committee meeting involving Nishikata is done and plans are made to happen soon (the trip), he can finally go home with Takagi. Yay! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Well, besides that, we don't know much about what will happen since it'll be in a future episode and... Nishikata's drawings are cute lmao. Then, there's the trio again. Once again, I think we can have just a series of that and call it "Chuugakusei no Mudazukai" because it's so awesome of a slice-of-life segment it deserves it's own Anime haha. Anyways, they went to a dagashi shop (*gets Hotaru flashbacks*) and bought stuff, Yukari doesn't want to eat hers on the spot even though she hungry (in case you wonder why their house probably has an early dinner, like mine) and since Mina-chan won one more she gave hers... to the wild cat. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> That cat man, has awesome reflexes. Besides beating all two of them in running away (lol Yukari) (lmao Mina-chan) the last one... Sanae (I swear I forgot her name) just let the cat go because we know that cat is not just feeding itself to resort to such acrobatic stunts haha. So yeah, very wholesome story I would argue. And then the couple decided to visit the same shop after the girls left, what luck. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> After a game of dodgeball outside of school which he lost (I mean, what a surprise) Takagi wants him to buy her sweets for the field trip. So yeah, now that she knows you are rich boy Nishikata lol, why not just take it as a date and eat cup noodles with her? Hey, at least he's enjoying it. And so is Takagi but it doesn't show on her face. Subtle and sweet. Not talking about the sweets at the shop, by the way. Worst thing is of course, the arrival of his friends in class. Yep, that is silent drama level maxed out liao, that one. Nishikata is right on if they ever call him out he can still retort, but hey, sucks to have friends who are mute, right? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So yeah, just confirming on this with just their own eyes lmao. But seriously Kaji Yuki stop dating with this Anime girl already there are already rumours about you and another other girl lmao (really, no joke, I can't find a translation of that though but) you still got more to do next week to not get tricked, I mean, teased again by the Tease Master haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=900 data-original-width=1600 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgI75OgJQyVgyTQaWm2_OIM5681q9thAv29I4EY3gdcsKfUUHrRDw8i9qwYpRRltjZHmdUWp5SxGKiGiNodIz_UVkIymJg9e7O7iIukP_5bb4BH8sVUOdcTlw1hJyt9z8XeeWSEF0SWYig/s320/takagisan_S2_06_bros2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You know you are screwed caught doing something bad when...</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=900 data-original-width=1600 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcWcalGPxvplS8dhwcWEMLZdQwqdZ62naXjuKCXneBAgL5822H4FTWUSkCHWHjlMesI0bApcvSWqx9xxKEIQDKEWN9hY48dpjJeGYjXE9NTQHgTgf5pPKC06pNSf-iAzAwLJESjrATyzw/s320/takagisan_S2_06_sit%2526reach.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>... you can't even pass your sit and reach lol LITERALLY ME IN MIDDLE SCHOOL haha</table></div></div>P.S.

Okay, the new episode (#AraOto07) we are... damn, this b*tch, Sonezaki. Is she having too much fun?? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> But heck did this turn into the darkest series this season over here, and let's talk about why. Firstly, the trip. Ignoring how much fun Sonezaki is messaging Amagi lol, Mo-chin can't get off that one guy Sugimoto (goddamn and that's why you won't get laid bro) (so much for saying it to myself I don't even have one lol) and Hongo-san... let's just say she is really into <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shuuchi target=_blank>shuuchi</a> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/purei target=_blank>play</a> haha. Meanwhile, Kazusa still can't get over the fact that Sugawara is in her mind as if she was being the obstacle between her and Izumi (well, not wrong) but then as Sugawara wants to clear her mind in order to somehow obtain an understanding from the already frantic and shy girl who doesn't want to speak her mind so... they have a pillow fight. What? Man, this show. Well firstly they just got to slip in this part for the sake of the series just like the bath scene, so whatever. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> If they got anything out of this, it is that stealing ideas from others is the best lmao. So yeah, they got their urban legend, and maybe Kazusa isn't too stuck on her friend being in her way anymore, as she... may want to confess to Izumi after all? Hey, after taking the recital role in the school festival, why not? It will get to him though, don't you worry about that. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> However, this is where somehow the show takes a real turn, where Sugawara is... she is confused. Hey, after giving advice for like, 6 episodes straight and be the first to talk about "esuibatsu"?? I'm surprised how you haven't broken down yet. So yeah, the bigger problem is that she went to ask for advice from the last expected person on the list... nope it's not Milo-san lol, but her teacher in theatre school. And may I say Niina, that is a bad choice. Remember when she got advice from her peers when she was in that school? Yeah, those were way better. But yeah, of course the teacher is going to do the most drama thing by telling her to interfere in the yet to blossom relationship between Kazusa and Izumi because hey, what's not to love for if it isn't fought with your own hands? Ugh you f**king pedo now I hate you even more now. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, that is some way to end the episode (especially the kissing wtf) so let's hope next episode isn't a train wreck because Izumi would hate to see that. You know, b*tch fights maybe. I doubt so? But if there will be one Izumi wouldn't be able to deal with it. I doubt I will be able to do so too, so... hey say who isn't any wiser in this? Haha this show is in a very well concealed irony also Kazusa stop thinking about boobs I want to summon that 1x <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/32650/Masaki_Jougasaki target=_blank>Jougasaki</a> so bad but I know I shouldn't haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJ_idX0NkPaDtXFlGknOA9SyMwBCB-NPQromBxNOpFjgTxRusobT4eMgnznd5hCbpbM4KNnXB_wMJSRNfoTqUAeaESz7TN6qcB74leLgDINyl-BN5OxU-FsCfJrrDy-k1DYe2BRUNypn4/s320/araoto07_sonezaki5.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Before getting a BF</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-ft6Xz_oGebZrZUKXp30XeVmRwCri0wXENe1ENGY1NFZRWIzBFl9GhvLdzhAu0orq_RjgmSLlyxJlx9l9AlNLegE288AYZoZrLu4c5yYoiF_7BYH0nEctDHcqzQ_rdeYe_F7L96FhQgU/s320/araoto07_sonezaki4.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>After getting a BF lol<br> (I can't WAIT to get laid haha)</table></div></div>P.S.

Hey, bear in mind only <em>I</em> am into J-Pop lmao. In this new episode (#JoshiMuda07) where Tanaka tries to ruin your solo music session, we talk about someone else who is not hanging her junk out and think it's bad lol Tanaka go read up on some history would you. Okay jokes aside, let's go into the darkness. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> We re-introduce Yamamoto? Okay, if you aren't familiar with her after this many episodes, she is... man after watching the episode? You tell me. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, the episode. Firstly, we finally know of the bandages that have been wrapping Yamamoto's... body (I can't describe it it's too gory lol) this whole time: it's rashes. *lenses drop out of my spectacle frame* Which obviously means she needs some serious treatment, but then again she is kind of like me because it never hurta so I don't care but I don't cover them with bandages so whatever lol. Then, she goes for a walk in the human world. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Well, the arcade, specifically. Playing the claw machine, more specifically. She fails many times, sees others be successful and gets pissed off especially when it's a couple who won lol, and Majime comes in to save the day. You know, not that she is coincidentally good at playing arcade games or anything. Yamamoto got it as a prize, and she tweeted her with her "boyfriend" on the Internet lol you attention seeker I don't even dare to post my own face- Then, there's the nurse's office visit. This one, I didn't expect there's a teacher in Sainotama High who can top this girl, but I think we have found her. "Shiikyon", as she has nicknamed herself (and not from Tanaka) (I think), she has to endure listening to Yamamoto talk about her "wounds" but then again I thought it was her initially having to leave to go teach as she is a teacher too, but I may be wrong. Then again, the initial impression sure made it feel like she can understand kids like Yamamoto better than that university girl-loving teacher in their class lol. Then, there's the mask. You know, because Majou happens to have one to sell and Yamai happens to see it and buy it (now that's what I call a trade) (Capitalism, everyone) until... she got freaked out when Majou explained to her the backstory of that mask involving a possessed war soldier lmao. Lastly, a wonderful display of an idiot with another idiot. But seriously, I got a good laugh at this one, especially the end haha. In a nutshell, Yamamoto was dumb enough to stick her head into one of those display stands on the street where you can put your face in and take photos (just like Waseda did lmao) but yeah, problem is she can't get out of it. Tanaka was passing by and was kind enough to... stick her head in it too. (call me pun genius haha) So being in the same boat, they decide to, in the most ingenious way possible, carry their heads up (pun genius, haha) all the way to school so at least somebody can help get them out of it. To make things worse, Yamamoto thought Tanaka couldn't top her inÂ <strike>stupidity</strike> stupidity lmao (I'm still pretty sure it is haha) but yeah, delinquent behaviour Tanaka couldn't miss out on the stupid stuff you do so your loss, Yamamoto. End up, they all had to sing the school song together holding hands with <strike>Jesus</strike> Waseda haha did you hear the lyrics of that song?? I seriously thought this show would at least give me some form of seriousness on this until I notice that it was too late lmao yes they were singing <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tama target=_blank>tama</a>Â (as in the ones beside a schlong) many times in it God this show (English words too? wtf)<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhwlFsBkWOlhGyumSM4oxoOaAj5R3E580p_J8S9tkcClRaUTduXKzVqS6ScAfEtuH0BmszrO1SWkbwxlsDsTU4AYNEu6uDeQprYREOADgns4LtrhXFJ7uvaFiDQSaKlgYJYmrSh7NYgUA/s320/jyoshimuda07_shiikyon3.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How you know your teachers are not to be trifled with lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-tpX1eyHqh2-vHd2BUC9lYNUQblryyCYlkIn-KR2x8pwkY0Nx9V-GeJNt2E6zB8QVwg4fUiYoK0fQsoPcB1ytq3kSviGRwO8gpu3VDn_BOoeLZmnz83ZL0Ccdx3ojSoD36lwII-XGZm4/s320/jyoshimuda07_kaomoji.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How you know your teachers are not to be trifled with lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Also, never thought I would say this, but this is my first encounter of watching Anime girls put on contact lenses. Yes, they were way bigger than they are in real life.

To be honest? It was actually very reminiscent of her usual style despite her saying on an interview (not going to translate Japanese here) that she is on another arc of her music career. Nonethtless, the topic song is great, and I am considering as much as 3 out of her 4-track single. Yeah. That's as far as I might go. I mean, if you didn't keep releasing digital singles for the past year miwa I would've bought one CD by now. Anyways, moving on! <b>ClariS new concept album</b> for summer isn't great; I didn't like the cover songs of summer (I mean, seriously?), and their new song for summer is... you guys heard of Fuchigami Mai's new single yet? (Okay I'm crossing boundaries here, but) Man is it disappointing, the album. Last but not least, <b>Aimer's new single</b> isn't awesome considering I shouldn't have just listened to the short version music video on YouTube because clearly that is edited down which is worse than a cut down preview from the start... but yeah, I'll probably give the song despite the super long bridge part of the song. Hey, she didn't write the song so whatever. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><br> Oh <b>nano.RIPE's new single</b> releases next week, and going from the preview... we're getting an emotional song. I better be in the mood for it. I will be, considering I'm going back to camp BOOM got them haha<br><br> On news this week, (I don't know how I missed this for like, a month but) <b>cinema staff's best album</b> releases next month including their indie releases and including their new song which is AWESOME, <b>Kitou Akari's debut song music video preview</b> is nothing but awesome considering it comes from Anison veteran music label Pony Canyon (wow #NotAd haha), and <b>SHE's is going on a three-month digital single release</b> like whoever is leading to their album now... <b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's new album</b> is coming end September. Well these guys will keep me company haha<br><br><br><br><br> That's it then. And if you haven't read any of the recent posts over the past weekend you should as I spent a lot of time on it. I spent a lot of time this week on Zelda BoW though (gamers should know what it is) so... yeah. Making that Nintendo Switch which I bought for my sis on her birthday worth it since she's not playing this damn thing lol. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully by then... I'll be happier. I doubt so, but one can dream. Haha good night<br><br> P.S. I updated on the image thumbnails now (from as of the blog migration ie. July 2019) such that all thumbnails can be clicked/tapped on their image only (instead of the whole table it's on) and you can click/tap on hyperlinks on the first visible one now. Through the power of JavaScript and many weekends of testing I have learnt yet another lesson haha ok bye<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
