Hey, welcome back. Nope, I've not prepared Top 20 for Klassic Note just yet, and
that might be something to worry about. We're right smack in December already
and I'm still giving songs, man. This year might be the highest song count in
Klassic Note history yet okay let's be quick about this there's one less show
already<br />
<br />
Also, note to self that if you have nothing else to do on Sunday afternoon
please read some manga haha okay we can begin now<br />

Never thought I'd like Marinka as a daughter but uh... I guess I'm good I rather
be her husband lmao. In this new lovely reunion episode (#SaikoroClub10)
Aya-chan welcomes his father back from overseas. And of course, he is not your
normal father. In a world where everyone calls their dad "papa" (lol not you too
Emilia), someone flew back from Africa. It's Aya-chan's dad Kenji, who is an
avid photographer who just came back from his overseas assignment, it seems. And
of course, this isn't a family without problems. Aya-chan wanted to introduce
the papa to her newly made friends, so he was told to come to the Christmas
party. Just that, you know, he got too into his job again and took another job
over the Christmas weekend. "Must it pay that much??" is probably what is going
through the papa's mind, but uh... we don't talk about that, Aya. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So oh
well, such is life, and it's his job too, and considering that it was too good
of an opportunity to miss... he forgot about his daughter. What a d*ck. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
Well, as seen from the gameplay of Blokus, and since Aya-chan and the papa (yes
I intend to use this word throughout) ended up in the Saikoro Club, they had to
play a game, according to the manager, or they have no reason to stay. I mean,
if this is not the most obvious plot for a reconciliation I don't know what is
haha. Anyways, the guys played a game, the papa started apologising to the
daughter for being who he is, passionate about his job and kind of in return
neglecting his family, but that is who he is. Whatever may happen, the love is
still there. And of course Aya-chan went soft and surprisingly, with a flashback
all the way back to Episode 1, talks about how she learnt from the dad to enjoy
the fun things in life. And considering she has such a wonderful life now
playing games with lovely friends (Emilia, I'm talking about her lmao) (okay
Midori-chan you cute too hehe) she wants to show them to the papa, but he ain't
got no time for her? So yeah, I mean, this gameplay session was kind of it
anyways, so kudos to you, author. Because this might be the only Anime that can
put family drama in a board game gameplay haha prove me wrong. The second half
has to end on a Christmas party since they hinted that last week and it sort of
fits the occasion (of real life, because now is December too) to do this, the
girls had fun (playing board games, of course) at Emilia's cafe. Well, her
papa's, but let's not talk about papa for now lol. Anyways, Emilia wants to play
a dress-up game, and Ladies &amp; Gentlemen coincidentally was chosen because (I
see what you did there, author) it's a pair game. So yeah, so open is this Anime
world for not showing shame from the girls because the two guys get to pair with
their crush considering whatever perfect world this show is in that'll give you
who you want lol. *Loner feels intensifies* So yeah, Emmy paired with
Midori-chan (you can guess the rest), and I guess the twist is on the gameplay.
So in a nutshell to what their futures together might look like, Aya-chan is
that expensive b*tch Tanoue cannot afford to date, Miki-chan has modest desires
even though Yoshioka probably is rich (I swear he was playing the game with
another 0 in his savings every turn lol) (as in Miki only wants the 200 but he
probably has 2000), and Midori-chan is the best husband who will give his girl
everything she wants. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Avoid the trigger of whatever bisexual things we
might be witnessing lol, they gotta end it with a ballroom. No, wait, not this.
They gotta end the episode with... some love scenes. Thanks, Anime. With the
lack of romance shows this season (I blame myself partly on this for not
choosing any), we end with the... confessions sort of, of the two guys. Don't
expect too much because Tanoue only gave a gift to Aya-chan with of course, no
meaning behind it haha (oh Aya-chan you too pure pure girl lmao), and Yoshioka
bade Miki-chan goodbye for the year. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well, someday bro. You got two
more years in high school to do this you'll get there. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Ah all in all a
fun episode to watch (You see what I did there, following Aya-chan and the
papa), and because we got this part sorted out ie. family and romance we can
finally get back on track to conclude the season with probably more board games
lol. And going from next episode, someone is going to submit her new game. It's
probably going to go badly #RealityCheck but we'll talk about that next week.
(But #RealRealityCheck though please make that one room game a reality I'll get
my friend to buy it haha)<br />

sarcastic friend who knows it's not what it is<br />
P.P.S. "Next time I'll be sure to bring my wallet" Oh so he didn't play for this
game session?? Also, who knows if you'll come again when you can't even promise
to your kid on her Christmas party, huh?? HUH?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> What a jerk<br />
P.P.P.S. "Let's rock paper scissors and pick the pairs up in the order we win"
NO I WANT TO CHOOSE haha let's just say the two guys have their choices
Midori-chan so you can pair with Emmy-chan<br />

Okay, this be a long week of releases as mentioned last week, so let's talk
about all of them. <b>SHE'S new EP</b> we have heard mostly through music videos
from the past three months, and the only new song isn't as great as I thought,
so I'll take the two I've already given beforehand. Moving on,
<b>The Floor's mini-album</b> is... probably passable like their previous
mini-album earlier in the year, but I did did give a couple of songs. I just
feel that them after major debut may have lost their appeal somewhere, I'm not
sure. <b>Yogee New Waves' new EP</b> is still surprising to say the least, as I
hesitate to give more songs outside of the topic song which in itself isn't much
of an impression as their album earlier this year to be honest. And since I dug
this out last week, <b>vivid undress' major debut album</b> is okay to say the
least, as I continue to give songs despite them giving me a headache because
it's that good. (I blame myself on my current condition for failing to give more
songs imo) Last but not least, and since I dug this one literally on release
date (thanks Google!), <b>wacci's new album</b> will be on hold for now. It's
either I get emotional and give them all and forgetting the song count at this
time of the year OR I get emotional and not give any song. I'll try not to do
the latter haha<br />
<br />
Moving quickly to next week on the December of new releases, we continue on
wacci's new album of course, but there's also <b>SIX LOUNGE's new album</b> to
end the year of single releases. This one... I might need some time to give.
Well, the peak of the month is over already so I'm good haha I'll savour more
J-Rock at my own pace I have more confidence in giving this over The Floor and
Yogee New Waves lmao GOT'EM haha<br />
<br />
On news in Twitter and everywhere else if I can't like or retweet them,
<b>Tsuji Shion released a digital single</b> as part of a multi-part series
probably leading up to a new full release because she be under a major label now
and have to show results lol (don't ask), <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> cover
is triggering my megane fetish real good (I hope the Anime will be good I'm
holding my breath for the songs tbh),<b>
  Ikimonogakari is releasing previews on YouTube</b
>
to promote their upcoming full album since their hiatus (and you can hear ALL of
their songs on YouTube Music right now as we speak), and somehow
<b>Horie Yui's full music library is now on subscription services</b> because
previously it isn't? (Jokes on you I'm not that old so I already got the songs I
want the first time they opened it haha) (Btw <b>Sakamoto Maaya</b> is also up
now, her music library, that's more important lol) and finally, in other news
not directly related to music, don't ask me how
<b>Anime "Seitokai Yakuindomo" is getting another movie</b>. Don't even try. I
don't get it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> It's like that
<b>real life drama adaptation of "JoshiMuda"</b> from last season too. Even the
author is perplexed on what he has unleashed onto this world. So, so Seitokai's
author <strike>Tojie-sensei</strike> (lmao I'm sorry for shortening your name
that's all I remember) <u>To</u>zen U<u>jie</u>-sensei... let's come real good
once more, yes? HAHA okay I'm done with this shi-<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, that be a rushed Sunday night. Well, I got lazy and decided to do other
stuff on the scheduled time to watch Anime since there's only one anyways haha
sorry Saikoro Club. Then again I was fixing up this site. I told myself to
finish all in the list I wrote down of (which you should see the changes now
especially in mobile), and now I have decided to conclude the changes since I've
been fixing them since July, by the end of the year. Yes, I'm done with fixes.
This might be an even bigger project than whatever I do at work tbh haha. Cya
guys next week then, and until then... I am thinking of Mocho day and night, I
had to find other girls to jerk off to every other day. No joke. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> MOCHO
DAISUKI haha I can't do the Emilia voice she's too good lol until next time<br />
