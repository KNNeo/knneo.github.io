<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fmYIZF__0u0/Xez1bcQ5ESI/AAAAAAAA2jo/wjGgBPxTF9QdYJIXyQkz_NhjXIx5iKJRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub10_hands.jpg"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>Do you know that when the number in the post title above reaches 52... it willreset TO ONE!!?? lol sorry I'm bored I just wanted a different intro<br /><br />Hey, welcome back. Nope, I've not prepared Top 20 for Klassic Note just yet, andthat might be something to worry about. We're right smack in December alreadyand I'm still giving songs, man. This year might be the highest song count inKlassic Note history yet okay let's be quick about this there's one less showalready<br /><br />Also, note to self that if you have nothing else to do on Sunday afternoonplease read some manga haha okay we can begin now<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SaikoroClub10">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Which is more important to you, animals or your daughter?" I mean, what's    the difference? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I'm sorry Aya-chan  </div></blockquote>Never thought I'd like Marinka as a daughter but uh... I guess I'm good I ratherbe her husband lmao. In this new lovely reunion episode (#SaikoroClub10)Aya-chan welcomes his father back from overseas. And of course, he is not yournormal father. In a world where everyone calls their dad "papa" (lol not you tooEmilia), someone flew back from Africa. It's Aya-chan's dad Kenji, who is anavid photographer who just came back from his overseas assignment, it seems. Andof course, this isn't a family without problems. Aya-chan wanted to introducethe papa to her newly made friends, so he was told to come to the Christmasparty. Just that, you know, he got too into his job again and took another jobover the Christmas weekend. "Must it pay that much??" is probably what is goingthrough the papa's mind, but uh... we don't talk about that, Aya. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So ohwell, such is life, and it's his job too, and considering that it was too goodof an opportunity to miss... he forgot about his daughter. What a d*ck. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Well, as seen from the gameplay of Blokus, and since Aya-chan and the papa (yesI intend to use this word throughout) ended up in the Saikoro Club, they had toplay a game, according to the manager, or they have no reason to stay. I mean,if this is not the most obvious plot for a reconciliation I don't know what ishaha. Anyways, the guys played a game, the papa started apologising to thedaughter for being who he is, passionate about his job and kind of in returnneglecting his family, but that is who he is. Whatever may happen, the love isstill there. And of course Aya-chan went soft and surprisingly, with a flashbackall the way back to Episode 1, talks about how she learnt from the dad to enjoythe fun things in life. And considering she has such a wonderful life nowplaying games with lovely friends (Emilia, I'm talking about her lmao) (okayMidori-chan you cute too hehe) she wants to show them to the papa, but he ain'tgot no time for her? So yeah, I mean, this gameplay session was kind of itanyways, so kudos to you, author. Because this might be the only Anime that canput family drama in a board game gameplay haha prove me wrong. The second halfhas to end on a Christmas party since they hinted that last week and it sort offits the occasion (of real life, because now is December too) to do this, thegirls had fun (playing board games, of course) at Emilia's cafe. Well, herpapa's, but let's not talk about papa for now lol. Anyways, Emilia wants to playa dress-up game, and Ladies &amp; Gentlemen coincidentally was chosen because (Isee what you did there, author) it's a pair game. So yeah, so open is this Animeworld for not showing shame from the girls because the two guys get to pair withtheir crush considering whatever perfect world this show is in that'll give youwho you want lol. *Loner feels intensifies* So yeah, Emmy paired withMidori-chan (you can guess the rest), and I guess the twist is on the gameplay.So in a nutshell to what their futures together might look like, Aya-chan isthat expensive b*tch Tanoue cannot afford to date, Miki-chan has modest desireseven though Yoshioka probably is rich (I swear he was playing the game withanother 0 in his savings every turn lol) (as in Miki only wants the 200 but heprobably has 2000), and Midori-chan is the best husband who will give his girleverything she wants. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Avoid the trigger of whatever bisexual things wemight be witnessing lol, they gotta end it with a ballroom. No, wait, not this.They gotta end the episode with... some love scenes. Thanks, Anime. With thelack of romance shows this season (I blame myself partly on this for notchoosing any), we end with the... confessions sort of, of the two guys. Don'texpect too much because Tanoue only gave a gift to Aya-chan with of course, nomeaning behind it haha (oh Aya-chan you too pure pure girl lmao), and Yoshiokabade Miki-chan goodbye for the year. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well, someday bro. You got twomore years in high school to do this you'll get there. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Ah all in all afun episode to watch (You see what I did there, following Aya-chan and thepapa), and because we got this part sorted out ie. family and romance we canfinally get back on track to conclude the season with probably more board gameslol. And going from next episode, someone is going to submit her new game. It'sprobably going to go badly #RealityCheck but we'll talk about that next week.(But #RealRealityCheck though please make that one room game a reality I'll getmy friend to buy it haha)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gG_ZBifQmL0/XezyPMfjeTI/AAAAAAAA2jQ/12x23YnNxZILznw-hgY74frd2fCHfw9FwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub10_aya4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Must kid Aya-chan be even cuter than she is now? lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3fdxpL56GRU/XezyR1oOySI/AAAAAAAA2jU/5qO7gJxa9PIy-3rd8GHvEOoKGLvcpT7swCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub10_eyecatch.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Is it just me or does the mother have growth syndrome? lmao the            dad's a giant          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Moving on,<b>The Floor's mini-album</b> is... probably passable like their previousmini-album earlier in the year, but I did did give a couple of songs. I justfeel that them after major debut may have lost their appeal somewhere, I'm notsure. <b>Yogee New Waves' new EP</b> is still surprising to say the least, as Ihesitate to give more songs outside of the topic song which in itself isn't muchof an impression as their album earlier this year to be honest. And since I dugthis out last week, <b>vivid undress' major debut album</b> is okay to say theleast, as I continue to give songs despite them giving me a headache becauseit's that good. (I blame myself on my current condition for failing to give moresongs imo) Last but not least, and since I dug this one literally on releasedate (thanks Google!), <b>wacci's new album</b> will be on hold for now. It'seither I get emotional and give them all and forgetting the song count at thistime of the year OR I get emotional and not give any song. I'll try not to dothe latter haha<br /><br />Moving quickly to next week on the December of new releases, we continue onwacci's new album of course, but there's also <b>SIX LOUNGE's new album</b> toend the year of single releases. This one... I might need some time to give.Well, the peak of the month is over already so I'm good haha I'll savour moreJ-Rock at my own pace I have more confidence in giving this over The Floor andYogee New Waves lmao GOT'EM haha<br /><br />On news in Twitter and everywhere else if I can't like or retweet them,<b>Tsuji Shion released a digital single</b> as part of a multi-part seriesprobably leading up to a new full release because she be under a major label nowand have to show results lol (don't ask), <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> coveris triggering my megane fetish real good (I hope the Anime will be good I'mholding my breath for the songs tbh),<b>  Ikimonogakari is releasing previews on YouTube</b>to promote their upcoming full album since their hiatus (and you can hear ALL oftheir songs on YouTube Music right now as we speak), and somehow<b>Horie Yui's full music library is now on subscription services</b> becausepreviously it isn't? (Jokes on you I'm not that old so I already got the songs Iwant the first time they opened it haha) (Btw <b>Sakamoto Maaya</b> is also upnow, her music library, that's more important lol) and finally, in other newsnot directly related to music, don't ask me how<b>Anime "Seitokai Yakuindomo" is getting another movie</b>. Don't even try. Idon't get it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> It's like that<b>real life drama adaptation of "JoshiMuda"</b> from last season too. Even theauthor is perplexed on what he has unleashed onto this world. So, so Seitokai'sauthor <strike>Tojie-sensei</strike> (lmao I'm sorry for shortening your namethat's all I remember) <u>To</u>zen U<u>jie</u>-sensei... let's come real goodonce more, yes? HAHA okay I'm done with this shi-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay, that be a rushed Sunday night. Well, I got lazy and decided to do otherstuff on the scheduled time to watch Anime since there's only one anyways hahasorry Saikoro Club. Then again I was fixing up this site. I told myself tofinish all in the list I wrote down of (which you should see the changes nowespecially in mobile), and now I have decided to conclude the changes since I'vebeen fixing them since July, by the end of the year. Yes, I'm done with fixes.This might be an even bigger project than whatever I do at work tbh haha. Cyaguys next week then, and until then... I am thinking of Mocho day and night, Ihad to find other girls to jerk off to every other day. No joke. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> MOCHODAISUKI haha I can't do the Emilia voice she's too good lol until next time<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
