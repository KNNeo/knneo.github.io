From Anime, to (if those exist) Manga, movies or whatsoever, to Klassic Note... everyone. Otherwise that one line just feels so lonely by itself there haha<br /><br />Oh, Manga.<br /><br /><span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br />I guess next week then lol I keep saying that I WANT TO PLAY MORE TRANSPORT FEVER 2 THOUGH so let's finish this quick haha it just released this week btw<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Just do all the things you want to do!" Emmy-chan MVP she deserves an Emmy lol</div></blockquote>Hey, if last week didn't hint you on another "One Room" gameplay, well, we got it, guys. Twice too, actually. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> In this new episode (11) we talk about Midori-chan part 2, specifically on her own creation of a board game. So yeah, we do know that she took a lot of time to make her game, it was full of holes as the manager mentioned, so she changed it to listen to the people around her comment on how linear the game was. So now, as they played it for the second time, there were more limitations and strategizing to be made so the game has a challenge instead of just randomly placing furniture and calculating the bonuses. That was good and all, but if you didn't see it because I guess she also showed it after she pulled out many all-nighters: the game lacked a goal. A goal, especially for herself. Remember when the game was to just place furniture? I legit thought with the appearance of furniture veteran Sakamoto from Midori's childhood would give us a different game in objective, but I guess it's her game, so she decided to revert back to the original design. Just that now, they are a plethora of choices for furniture (and pets) (well they shouldn't count they don't take up space lol), the challenge mechanism during the second play remains, and there is an end goal with risk evaluation. So now, you can play in many more ways than one to get points besides matching furniture, and the end goal is to decorate your room, just like how she thought of it as a kid in the first place. It's literally a kid's project transformed in reality. (Mark my words but <a href="http://apol.strikingly.com/" target="_blank">I also have such stuff</a> but like Midori from 6 episodes ago I don't wanna show it) The girls were impressed, there is strategizing in this game now (Midori-chan be like OMG), and this... might just get into the likes of that one George who probably won't expect this game coming. A wonderful story to tell especially linked to her childhood, I got the feels, but I guess next week to end the season we move back to Miki-chan. If you need a hint it's just her doing the character development thing on every other slice-of-life series which probably won't bring much impact compared to more physically defining differences like that one in "Slow Start" where Hana-chan is a ronin. But you know, the drama will be pretty much the same so I will not hold my breath. In my mind this might just be the last episode to end the series hehe<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k6vAWlUvrA4/XfXNgSTYZNI/AAAAAAAA2v8/mthYM5nAdDYSuuunXRrUsGua0t_wUjioACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub11_aya2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">MFW that new train game which no one cares about just released lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BQWB15Hnb_E/XfXNnvV9yQI/AAAAAAAA2wA/lQtOCjJ_0tM-XucPCAq7L0pFPW-g6ydbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub11_sleep.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">IQ180 plays there, sleeping in class lol first row too btw<br />(And she still can answer questions, a true genius)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

For this week, we welcome <b>SIX LOUNGE's new album</b> which honestly? I guess I really got burned out with the other bands liao which is kinda sad to let this one go, but I did give a couple more songs, so I hope it was enough. (Remember those days where I can watch their live Blu-Ray or something later to listen to more songs? These guys probably won't even release one lol) <b>wacci's new album</b> finally came to conclusion, but yeah that also means I didn't reject most of them which they will get into the already long list of songs this year. Hey, I love myself some wacci, man. They are the ones who can still sing relaxed songs without getting too high 80% of the time. I mean, look at vivid undress. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br />Next week, as they have released previews this week, <b>LuckLife's new mini-album</b> releases next week. And it took me a while to find out what is with this huge service they giving us by releasing their new release on streaming is because they left Lantis, and is under another (I suppose) new music label now. This is that introductory release, and of course that means we may not get more Anime "Bungo Stray Dogs" ending theme songs from them anymore. Oh well. I'll still listen though. Good thing now is that we will get to actually listen to their songs outside of Anime please buy back your music from Lantis I want them on Apple Music haha<br /><br />On new news floating around Twitter or something, <b>Amamiya Sora's new music video preview</b> is all I have wanted from her all these years (no seriously, megane AND scientist cosplay?), <b>TrySail's new song</b> for Movie "HaiFuri" is... nah (haha), thank goodness <b>Aoyama Sachiko's new song</b> now has a music video in which is also the only song I gave (hey, I like that NEGOTO hype, what can I say) which surprisingly as good animation although I rather it be her physically (lol), ah <b>Waki Azumi's music videos for her double A-side single</b> is out in full which I only preferred one (feel free to guess I don't like fruits anyway lol), <b>Kitou Akari is releasing a new single</b> coming next February and don't ask me why the Anime theme song is always placed second, <b>KANA-BOON is releasing a best album</b> coming March next year (it's a three-piece band now, just so you know), I'm not going to comment much on <b>Yuuki Aoi's new music video preview</b> because I don't like it tbh, and just hot off the press <b>Scenarioart is releasing a full album</b> coming March next year which is also their first in three years and since they left major last year. That is a lot of news haha. Don't worry, I'll cover as much as I can on Twitter too if I see them I assume you can understand images so I just like, but otherwise I'll retweet explaining what happened. You can read my detailed post on how to read Japanese tweets if you want to learn to independent yourself and not have to read this chunk of text lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm done. I need to take a dump real bad so let's be quick next week I will probably finalise on Top 20 even if the new songs come in and blow my mind especially Ikimono I also probably won't consider them already because just this current list as of now I am already troubled I hear my YouTube playlist which is public btw and I'm thinking on how to rank them already remind me to add Hocchan in the ranks haha okay I gotta go until next week <hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
