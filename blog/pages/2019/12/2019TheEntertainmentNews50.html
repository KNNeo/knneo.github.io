From Anime, to (if those exist) Manga, movies orwhatsoever, to Klassic Note... everyone. Otherwise that one line just feels solonely by itself there haha<br /><br />Oh, Manga.<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />I guess next week then lol I keep saying that I WANT TO PLAY MORE TRANSPORTFEVER 2 THOUGH so let's finish this quick haha it just released this week btw<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SaikoroClub11">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Just do all the things you want to do!" Emmy-chan MVP she deserves an Emmy    lol  </div></blockquote>Hey, if last week didn't hint you on another "One Room" gameplay, well, we gotit, guys. Twice too, actually. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#SaikoroClub11) wetalk about Midori-chan part 2, specifically on her own creation of a board game.So yeah, we do know that she took a lot of time to make her game, it was full ofholes as the manager mentioned, so she changed it to listen to the people aroundher comment on how linear the game was. So now, as they played it for the secondtime, there were more limitations and strategizing to be made so the game has achallenge instead of just randomly placing furniture and calculating thebonuses. That was good and all, but if you didn't see it because I guess shealso showed it after she pulled out many all-nighters: the game lacked a goal. Agoal, especially for herself. Remember when the game was to just placefurniture? I legit thought with the appearance of furniture veteran Sakamotofrom Midori's childhood would give us a different game in objective, but I guessit's her game, so she decided to revert back to the original design. Just thatnow, they are a plethora of choices for furniture (and pets) (well theyshouldn't count they don't take up space lol), the challenge mechanism duringthe second play remains, and there is an end goal with risk evaluation. So now,you can play in many more ways than one to get points besides matchingfurniture, and the end goal is to decorate your room, just like how she thoughtof it as a kid in the first place. It's literally a kid's project transformed inreality. (Mark my words but<a href="http://apol.strikingly.com/" target="_blank">I also have such stuff</a>but like Midori from 6 episodes ago I don't wanna show it) The girls wereimpressed, there is strategizing in this game now (Midori-chan be like OMG), andthis... might just get into the likes of that one George who probably won'texpect this game coming. A wonderful story to tell especially linked to herchildhood, I got the feels, but I guess next week to end the season we move backto Miki-chan. If you need a hint it's just her doing the character developmentthing on every other slice-of-life series which probably won't bring much impactcompared to more physically defining differences like that one in "Slow Start"where Hana-chan is a ronin. But you know, the drama will be pretty much the sameso I will not hold my breath. In my mind this might just be the last episode toend the series hehe<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k6vAWlUvrA4/XfXNgSTYZNI/AAAAAAAA2v8/mthYM5nAdDYSuuunXRrUsGua0t_wUjioACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub11_aya2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW that new train game which no one cares about just released lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BQWB15Hnb_E/XfXNnvV9yQI/AAAAAAAA2wA/lQtOCjJ_0tM-XucPCAq7L0pFPW-g6ydbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub11_sleep.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            IQ180 plays there, sleeping in class lol first row too btw<br />            (And she still can answer questions, a true genius)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

For this week, we welcome<b>SIX LOUNGE's new album</b> which honestly? I guess I really got burned outwith the other bands liao which is kinda sad to let this one go, but I did givea couple more songs, so I hope it was enough. (Remember those days where I canwatch their live Blu-Ray or something later to listen to more songs? These guysprobably won't even release one lol) <b>wacci's new album</b> finally came toconclusion, but yeah that also means I didn't reject most of them which theywill get into the already long list of songs this year. Hey, I love myself somewacci, man. They are the ones who can still sing relaxed songs without gettingtoo high 80% of the time. I mean, look at vivid undress. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Next week, as they have released previews this week,<b>LuckLife's new mini-album</b> releases next week. And it took me a while tofind out what is with this huge service they giving us by releasing their newrelease on streaming is because they left Lantis, and is under another (Isuppose) new music label now. This is that introductory release, and of coursethat means we may not get more Anime "Bungo Stray Dogs" ending theme songs fromthem anymore. Oh well. I'll still listen though. Good thing now is that we willget to actually listen to their songs outside of Anime please buy back yourmusic from Lantis I want them on Apple Music haha<br /><br />On new news floating around Twitter or something,<b>Amamiya Sora's new music video preview</b> is all I have wanted from her allthese years (no seriously, megane AND scientist cosplay?),<b>TrySail's new song</b> for Movie "HaiFuri" is... nah (haha), thank goodness<b>Aoyama Sachiko's new song</b> now has a music video in which is also the onlysong I gave (hey, I like that NEGOTO hype, what can I say) which surprisingly asgood animation although I rather it be her physically (lol), ah<b>Waki Azumi's music videos for her double A-side single</b> is out in fullwhich I only preferred one (feel free to guess I don't like fruits anyway lol),<b>Kitou Akari is releasing a new single</b> coming next February and don't askme why the Anime theme song is always placed second,<b>KANA-BOON is releasing a best album</b> coming March next year (it's athree-piece band now, just so you know), I'm not going to comment much on<b>Yuuki Aoi's new music video preview</b> because I don't like it tbh, and justhot off the press <b>Scenarioart is releasing a full album</b> coming March nextyear which is also their first in three years and since they left major lastyear. That is a lot of news haha. Don't worry, I'll cover as much as I can onTwitter too if I see them I assume you can understand images so I just like, butotherwise I'll retweet explaining what happened. You can read my detailed poston how to read Japanese tweets if you want to learn to independent yourself andnot have to read this chunk of text lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm done. I need to take a dump real bad so let's be quick next week I willprobably finalise on Top 20 even if the new songs come in and blow my mindespecially Ikimono I also probably won't consider them already because just thiscurrent list as of now I am already troubled I hear my YouTube playlist which ispublic btw and I'm thinking on how to rank them already remind me to add Hocchanin the ranks haha okay I gotta go until next week<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
