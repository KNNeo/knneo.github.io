I hope you enjoyed the marvel of a body that is Uesaka Sumire andher new photobook (haha) but if not you can go see it first, I can wait.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I... didn't do much besides writing that post yesterday tbh lol<br /><br />Let's talk about Anime today, I guess. Let's hope next season previews come soonso I can talk about RikeKoi haha Ten-chan~!!<br /><br />Don't quote me on this but if I go crazy over Ten-chan every week next year forthree months please <b>don't</b> stop me haha okay let's begin<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SaikoroClub12">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span      class="head-prefix"      ><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Come on, high school second year me!!" Ah, Aya-chan never fails to impress  </div></blockquote>"Walking by the Kamogawa River really reminds us on how we met, right?" YeahAya-chan and how you flopped real bad in the water lmao. In this sort ofnostalgic plus forward-looking final episode (#SaikoroClub12) we talk about Miki-chan'sproblems. You know, she doesn't have many problems other than recognising thatshe is alone. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Just like every other Anime who will face this problemthe girls finish a year of high school (well about half a year for Emmy-chan),and move on to second years. As they talk about what happens in second year ie.being in different classes (I mean Miki-chan, as long as there is Aya-chan it'senough imo) (haha), Midori-chan... not winning the contest haha you don't saybecause George is not going to let her pass that easily, and Emmy-chan goingback to Germany to show off her game to someone there so she can publish it...everyone has thought of something in the near future. Heck, even Aya-chan wantsto follow her father's footsteps and be an animal photographer and liveoverseas. (It's like as if Miki-chan knows something about South America but wedon't know lol) Hey, perhaps it's about time to think about those too,Miki-chan. But instead of doing that, she turned the other direction and hopeseveryone would be around for longer, or even forever. Of course that would be astretch or anyone, but hey, it's worth hoping. So in a one fine day in thespring vacation (which is a rarity in Anime since most things end beore that)(you know, graduation), Miki-chan wants to meet up with all of them. Of courseif you don't have a schedule and everyone is busy somehow, you're not going toget your girls together and play. From calling Aya-chan in the middle of thenight being sad about being alone, to visiting Emmy-chan in her board game cafe,to going to the Saikoro Club to find Midori... well at least she left tracesbehind wherever she went haha. That, and she bought a card game somehow. Hey,you can be sad all you want but we gotta make that paper lol. Anyways, she justsat along aside the river thinking why she be all alone again (your friends arebusy, girl, should've just arranged a time to meet up) (haha), she got spottedby Tanoue and Yoshida who were walking to see a movie together (this is so gay Ican't even), but you know, good guy Yoshida had to<strike>call to her walk to her side and ask her what's wrong</strike> ask hisfriend to call his girl and tell her what they saw. (What a d*ck, don't go outwith this guy Miki-chan haha) And so Aya-chan now knows about it, and perhapsit's a good time to tell you guys that the girls be worried of her, and thephone is cut because whose phone batteries won't be dead in 2019 where batterylife shouldn't be an issue lol. And since she wasn't disrupted and bought a cardgame because it reminds her of her childhood toys, Miki-chan started playing herown monologue with the cards. I mean, I normally do this at home in my room butwhatever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also, Yoshida is looking, by the way. Oh well. So I'm notgoing to creep you guys out with the imagination things, and so the friendsfound her. And you bet they will assure her that they will be friends forever.Well, at least until you guys fall out because of a board game lol. Also "You'rea very important friend to us" since you're the main girl without you thisseries won't exist haha breaking 4th wall there. To end the series, they playthe card game which is real simple in premises considering there isn't muchairtime left (lol), and if name master Miki didn't impress you with her play atthis game, no one will. So yeah, that's about it. Simple yet somewhat happyending. I mean, it sucks already when Midori-chan's game got rejected haha.Anyways, I still think this show in all is great, and besides Miki-chan'stroubles and Kyouko I would argue (just like Miki I think she's a bully lol),that this series is really good, from the games to the subtle boring gameexplanations (I mean, this got my friend to buy some of them so whatever alsoMidori-chan~) to some romance maybe to more board games to whatever whatevermaid cosplay to Emmy-chan (YEAH MVP haha) and so on... there's always somethingfun to talk about every episode. So yeah, this show is good. I can't really findfault in this, to be honest. Also maybe because I didn't come in expecting muchof this series, so not having problems I guess is already impressive. As a finalword, you wish there was this bunch of fun friends to play with you on boardgames you never see how YouTubers play board games? It's not this level to saythe least where's my board game livestream haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-81X8HTGesA0/Xf9lix0DOoI/AAAAAAAA3G4/OuYmvEmphVExfHKFPZL2QuGvBSzU8pFgwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub12_shibusawa.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            My general opinion of this series also Shibusawa your inner fangirl            for senpai is showing lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dzbjd2jWNtw/Xf9lkGuhZZI/AAAAAAAA3G8/-bgEPrfpLv48QQHyTapmxjwDb2oUB6dZgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub12_aya3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I have a feeling that Aya is trying to strangle this deer instead of            healing it lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

(The ollowing paragraphs will be ixed as much as possiblehaha) <b>LuckLife's new mini-album</b> isn't all too bad, as&nbsp;from last weekI did give one o the two song previews I have reverted back to giving the topicsong instead and another song which I haven't heard before because I was quirkylol. Anyways, there's that, I kind of contributed in informing the Internetabout them shifting music labels which gave us the streaming music advantage lol(I, uh, commented that they won't be doing Bungo Stray Dogs theme songs anymorejust because), so that's that. Next week we welcome, very lately to the party,<b>Ikimonogakari's new album</b> after 3 years not releasing new albums. Yeah,that's quite some time. Well, I'll be darned if it's good but in case it got toogood I've already technically excluded them&nbsp;from the Song Awards this yearbecause the timeframe will be too short anyways. Well, besides the one songwhich I gave on their anniversary in March anyways.<br /><br />On news surrounding the Internet and speciically Twitter my ingers are gettingnumb rom copy pasting lol, didn't know<b>NICO Touches The Walls disbanded</b> and is expected to end their activitiesthis year (wow why) which makes their&nbsp;full album earlier in June this yearwhich I did not give any (but I listened) their last release (why),<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES will be releasing a new album</b> next year (no specificdate though), and thanks <b>LuckLife and their new music video</b> in full,thanks. Well, I didn't know NICO much anyways so this is not as sad as AquaTimez but still.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay my ingers are tired rom ixing this shitshow so I'm going to try to contactLogitech support to get this replaced hopefully cya guys next week and untilthen I hope you have a great Christmas I had a real good roll in DOAXVV btw Ihad to show this o because all tickets no gems (because gems guarantee you an SRon a 10-roll) and THREE SSRs on a 10-roll.
