<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NNFcqrk5JeY/XavXP7YEDlI/AAAAAAAA1TQ/7FMX9QKsgYIMiPYsu_JSFMOeOqe_n8X2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon02_shot2.jpg"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>Yeah, I think I gave up releasing that wanted list post liao you guys can justsee the updates I make on the wanted list page instead it's more concise andless cheesy compared to the post haha<br /><br />Aside from that, I am making plans on what to do after I just took a week workleave (thanks to a public holiday on Monday) for the week after next ie. afternext week's issue of Entertainment News. Hmm... I have a bucket list of stuffnot related to the Internet I want to do like change my PC and desk but uh...that can wait haha I have stuff to clear in my hard disks now<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SaikoroClub03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "You do have something in common with (the cat) Sakura!" Oh Miki-chan be a    cat now haha  </div></blockquote>"Where have I seen you before?" I think I have a feeling you have bullied mebefore haha *gets terrible flashbacks* In this somewhat mellow new episode(#SaikoroClub03) we have to dig in to Miki-chan's past. Hey, just like any otherslice-of-life Anime, focus has to be given to the main guy/girl to talk abouthis/her problems. And for Miki-chan? This might be the beginning of the serieswhere we seriously talk about it. So, story goes that elementary schoolMiki-chan gets bullied a lot since she's shy, and a bunch of coincidences led tothe board game weekend at Aya-chan's house the next day, which spells a lot ofhints on the truth behind that incident. Ignoring that for now, we areintroduced to two new characters, namely Hana who is Aya-chan's elder sister(the subs are misleading but ane-san should give you a clue) who was spottedcrawling under a ledge to see their family cat Sakura hiding and refusing tocome out, got coaxed out by the equally timid Miki so that the cat could go tothe vet. Then, in a strange coincidence (Anime does this to people sometimeshaha) we found out that she was under the same roof as the best girl in thisseries lol. Added in is also Maki-chan, who looks like a yankee and who Ithought would look more like Aya-chan's sister considering those ear piercingslol just joking. Anyways, the five of them play a four-player game since Hanapussied out (lol) where they play a game of risk. Not the board game Risk, butsomething Indiana Jones-like, I suppose. Whoever is scared of traps leaves withwhatever they have, or just keep moving forward in hopes of grabbing moretreasure. To not bore you guys considering even introducing two new characterstook half an episode lol, the first game was Maki-chan confidently guessing whenthe traps will appear and withdrawing as necessary, and luck eventually caughton to Miki-chan (I mean, is it because of friends though?) (Or the cat? haha)and she took the gamble in a game of confidence-testing. It's just a game, guys.Either you win or you don't. I don't normally relate games to real life becausethe stakes are low (come on, save games in video games are actually moreimportant than playing the hard game itself, to be honest)(#RealLifeGamerProblems), but hey, it's a lesson Miki is trying to learn, sosure, why not. They got to put in these life lessons once in a while. And itturns out Maki-chan, or Kyouko as she was earlier referred to, did not bully her(I mean, they led me in that direction good there haha) but saved Miki frombullies when she was young. What fortitude, isn't it? So yeah, happy story.Just, forget about the bullying, yes? Miki-chan, it is time to move on from thesad past. You have friends now, and I think that's what will make you strong.Moving on, we have another character focus episode, this time on Midori-chan(Miyu-chan~ haha) (Sorry it was the Jyoshimuda livestream influence lol Waseda)where she has a problem to deal with in relation to her vice chairperson of theclass, it seems. It's just going to be more people finding out about herpart-time job and playing board games deredere haha cya guys next week<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lmwob_cpkLM/XavKqtkXgWI/AAAAAAAA1S4/cmmMcVQY7hYIrW1IwIoHW5DVznNqmgioQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub03_sakura2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MVP cat haha so...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u6R8x7m3xqs/XavKri5Me5I/AAAAAAAA1S8/fyVk0X5zJgsBxRa2z3YJX8tO-LF23EXWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub03_trap.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ... here's more cute girl reactions since I can't get enough lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Again, not that I'm wanting it haha, but they better play a board game (oreven, one of these shown in the Anime) in a future livestream it has to happenor I'll stop watching haha yeah I guess I'm giving this one I'll get over theboring rule explanations Midori-chan is cute anyways<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Babylon02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "... so you become the prosecutor you want to be." Yeah, the kind that hangs    himself after being unable to serve the smallest of justice haha dear cops    out there please don't  </div></blockquote>I have a feeling if I shout "bullshit" at their campaign I will be taken awayimmediately haha the people don't know though WAKE UP SHEEPLE haha. In this newepisode (#Babylon02) with the aftermath of many deaths in a case discovered withno return, Seizaki continues to find out more clues with regards to thepolitical truth hiding behind the new technological outskirt. And yes, we mightsee that stereotypical investigation route happening once again. Let's talkabout it. From the first episode, we know that this case is more than justrelated to drugs as initially implied, but more of political reasons now thatthe leading candidate may have bribed several officers and professionals in theregion to assist in his victory. So yeah, Seizaki might be in even more of atight case now that he has lost his buddy Fumio who killed himself? Unlikely,and I'm going to<a href="https://jisho.org/search/meitantei" target="_blank">meitantei</a>deduce here that he was threatened to commit suicide (come back to here in 10weeks to see if I'm right) (probably not haha, us coming back) instead of beingmurdered directly without a trace as searched from the apartment or by his ownwill. Well, if it involves the drugs back from the start then this might bepossible, so I'm turning away from that now BANANA FISH had the same story therehaha. Anyways, back to this, Seizaki decided to stop following the woman he sawlast episode and instead focus on other women who have been brought to thebribed leaders, and landed on Hiramatsu Emiko. And so, the episode mainlyfocuses on her interrogation from Seizaki, after she was questioned coming outof a hotel where several big leaders meet after a golf session even thoughclearly they were supporting different factions in the election. So yeah, makesyou cringe a bit just thinking about it already, huh. In the interrogation, asSeizaki's initial intention was to draw out a confession from this woman inorder to support his claim that the leading candidate is bribing officers intosexual agreement (ie. "Oh this woman's a** is great" kind of thing lol of courseit's not that but what's the difference?) so that the guy's throne is assured.But I guess Seizaki is always losing on this front as it would seem that themayor-to-be has made good arrangements on this, and likely Seizaki approachingthe woman was a bad choice since that might be the bait. You see where I'm goingnow? So if that is the case, almost all interrogation can be nullified since hermotive will be to escape and tell on him. I mean, Seizaki was dumb enough toreveal his personal information so that his identity could be confirmed later(we haven't reached plot twist yet, just a moment please), and then she makesher escape. I would just guess the other partner was seduced into letting hergo, but for whatever method, if she escaped maybe from the vent (and that's whyinterrogation rooms cannot have vents lmao) or in whatever way, she did it. Soyeah, he and his superior are stuck now in this investigation. And it'll be ahard time to explain this to the higher-ups considering they need time to crackon this case which seems really drastic since it involves the election WHAT ISTHE MAYOR-TO-BE DOING OVER HERE AT THE COMMITTEE MEETING?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, did Inot mention last week that the police was probably bribed already, especiallySeizaki's immediate superior? See? What did I tell you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sorry for myimmortal-level intuition from watching mystery Anime lol, but yeah, now Seizakiis in quite a pinch. As of now, his fate can only go two ways. Either he doesnot tell the truth and immediately gets prosecuted (even if he doesn't get ithis family will; remember he has a wife and son?) OR (which is more likely) hetells the truth and supposedly not get threatened by anyone in the room (goodluck on that bro haha), the case closes and he lives to see another day.Probably not as a prosecutor since he might be laid off but he can stillinvestigate. Typical mystery drama which uses others besides the main guy tocontinue investigation especially when we know the truth has to be out someday.Hey, sorry for spoiling it but we shall see what happens. I doubt Seizaki willbe dumb enough to take his own life under threat but we don't know. He's themain guy after all. (Also Fumio did it lol) So, to sum up, it ultimately boilsdown to what the woman mentioned in the interrogation: what is justice? "Justiceis when you stop being a b*tch!!" is what I would like to say lol, but hey,what's the fun in the drama if not for this? I guess we shall see what happensnext week. Man, this level of drama cringe Anime NOW you got me hooked hehe Iguess I'm giving this but man, only one theme song? I could use a breather fromthis much suspense<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VGGlopfpCnE/XavXP30QBEI/AAAAAAAA1TM/945GnRPed-gi4EKv0XcSjR4aFRCa66MxACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon02_shot1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            In case you wonder how real paparazzi take photos...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NNFcqrk5JeY/XavXP7YEDlI/AAAAAAAA1TQ/7FMX9QKsgYIMiPYsu_JSFMOeOqe_n8X2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon02_shot2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ... this is a good example.          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Oh the intro was a FLASHBACK haha remember the kid Fumio is dead he can'ttalk to Seizaki anymore<br />P.P.S. Again, sexual relations with others is something cops will ask in aninterrogation. But not like they want to know how pink your ****** is they justwant to know intimacy level B*TCH please haha IT'S A 4P TOO OMG lol don't Googlethat<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week might be quite the week of the month because after this there mightnot be much else, but I'll think of something. As mentioned,<b>Kitou Akari's debut single</b> is the highlight of the week, and thanks tomusic label PONY CANYON releasing it on major streaming media including AppleMusic (worldwide too apparently, it's on my local Spotify too) I can make mydecisions early. So yeah, I'm breaking the seasonal trend of reviewing releases(finally) and doing another Klassic Note Review maybe next week if all goeswell. The other release which I mentioned I wanted to wait to align withphysical release was <b>Polkadot Stingray's new mini-album</b> and... I ended upgiving all the topic songs which were released as music videos earlier on lol.Well, you made it easy, guys. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, give a listen if you are a Pokemonfan (and even if you are not like me) to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/3rsIACZZKTQ" target="_blank"  >their cover of the Pokemon game theme song</a>, the OG ones. It's so, so good...<br /><br />I've also followed up on music live performances I've listened to over theweekend and last weekend and cleared <b>Nisshoku Natsuko</b> but not anythingnew besides that one song about waterfall and Rock music haha. I'm still tryingto give the monotonous style that is <b>BUMP of CHICKEN's new album</b> whichreleased in July this year and maybe I'll go listen to<b>a flood of circle</b> again, I don't know. My ears are kinda f**ked for nowso I could use a break.<br /><br />Skipping talk about next week since they aren't any talk anyways, on Twitter ohyeah <b>fumika's new full album releases next week</b> (oops) (sorry fumika-sanI feel bad now) <b>Kawano Marina's new music video</b> is out and it's... I'lllet you decide, and <b>Anime "Kaguya-sama" 2nd season has been confirmed</b> inproduction and (I know it's not music but) I really wonder who will be singingthe opening theme song now haha. I doubt Suzuki-san you will make headlinesagain since this might be going the Takagi-san route now (someone will confess,we know) and unless Mizuno from Ikimonogakari can come back to write anotherawesome not-too-old-fashioned ballad, we might see him again. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm sosorry, Suzuki-san, I'm so sorry...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Well, cya guys next week then. I feel so empty now now that I get to, uh...defecate more? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> At least some doctor out there can tell me I'm havingIBS and telling me to take probiotics so I don't have to go visit him againsince I know what meds to take (lol I still have to though), but man, is thatthe most casual physician I've seen. He gives you his WhatsApp number to let youask him on anything (before 11.45pm lol) and even lets you pay via mobilepayment anytime after you leave and "bought" the meds. Is he some witch doctor?Ah, I don't think so since he's male but... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We shall see, doctor. Ifthis guy works like how my mom described her friend went through, then I mighthave hope. Cya all for next week then, and hopefully until then... I will getthe Wanted List page done. I'll finish it eventually. Maybe at work too hahadon't tell my boss this is technically taking breaks lmao<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
