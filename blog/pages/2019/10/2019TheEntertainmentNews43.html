Hey, welcome back.<br />
<br />
If you haven't read my literal smooching of Kitou Akari's debut single yet
please help yourself. Meanwhile, if you have noticed how the site changed to a
somewhat responsive format... please tell me if anything else breaks on this
site because I can't check all of them on my own so I'm only fixing what I saw
over the past few weeks. I just hope it'll last haha it was worth it though I
look at it everyday lol is is just me<br />
<br />
Well, let's get to stuff this week, yes? Uh... I really want someone to sub the
new Sora no Method episode though I don't really want to watch it without subs I
can't catch up to it tbh<br />
<br />
<br />

Hey, Midori-chan, if your "other things to do" is to play board games with other
cute girls, you are forgiven. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this why-so-serious new episode
(#SaikoroClub04) we get a character focus episode, as with all slice-of-life.
Sadly, it's not one we know of. Yeah, they literally throw you into a new
character's life now that you sat in well to watch this series lol. It's
Shibusawa Ren (Ren-chan from here on), the vice-chairperson of the student
council of the school, and... somewhat related to Midori-chan. Firstly, the
problem. Ren-chan needs help planning for the school festival, seeing the
current chairperson is hospitalised for just having quite a quirky character
lol, but yeah and her influence only works if there is an idea going, so yeah,
everyone in the room is drawing blanks on new ideas is the issue. Then, she
decides to ask for help. Who else to ask besides Midori-chan, the girl who was
with her in student council in middle school, who was a genius planner full of
ideas, and together will make them stronger than ever as a team? But of course,
Midori refused such an offer. I mean, if you didn't even realise why she isn't
in club meetings but in a board game shop, you need to watch episode 1 again
haha. So yeah, even Ren-chan won't be able to influence the determination that
is Midori who has decided to, hey not that everyone can, be a board game author.
I know those exist, but hey, to know that they aren't shadowed by game companies
and instead being placed their names upfront, that's what will make board games
a work than merely a product. Much is to say that on video games besides indie
but, you get the point. So... Ren-chan insists on her help, so she asked for a
showdown. Again, for someone who knows how to play every single game in the
shop, Ren-chan is asking for a duel she cannot win. Nonetheless, the game
introduced is simple yet mind-blowing in concept that if you don't use your
second brain of deception you are not going to succeed and end up with enough
cows to build a barn out of it lol. (Not going to make the cow jokes on these
girls since they don't have any milk-) So yeah, Ren-chan lost real quick
surprisingly over Aya-chan who is the professional at losing lol (I guess she
got used to the games she learnt a little about how not to lose too bad) and...
yeah, left because she can't deal with the result. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah, what a sore
loser. Anyways, when she says she will be back is not going to be a joke since
we have half the series to cover lol, but we also now know a little more about
Midori-chan's past. The reason she was in the board game... game lol, was
because of her elder brother, who played a board game Catan with her when she
was a kid (the game doesn't look easy as it's resource management) (man,
Midori-chan must be some genius), brought her into the shop and that's when she
met the manager for the first time. So yeah, deciding on her life dream now
doesn't seem to be much of a far-fetched reality. It's not impossible, but hey,
what's wrong with having dreams that are hard to achieve? Just like how Ren-chan
has to do the school festival as her own being the leader of the student
council, so Midori-chan's dream... they all are determined to make it happen.
You know, that stereotypical encouragement Anime that Miki-chan is losing out on
for some reason, but I'm sure she'll get around it by the end of this maybe
haha. Next episode... I mean, if this is not fanservice I don't know what is
this episode may be kid Midori-chan MVP but we know next week it's going to be
Aya-chan WITH THE SWIMSUIT!!! <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> To end this, we are also introduced to
the fourth main character of the series with the lovely yellow long hair
reminiscent of
<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/48391/Chitoge_Kirisaki"
  target="_blank"
  >another Anime character</a
>
lol, so it might not be long before we know who she is. Don't tell me she is
already a board game author Midori-chan is going to be sad haha or happy she can
meet one tbh<br />

"Think about this well" Okay so is this a threat now? Ugh, no one wants to be
involved with politics. But hey, did Seizaki mention that he wants to work for
the benefit of the people? You ask for what you get, so make the decisions now.
<span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this if I'm not wrong, conclusive episode (#Babylon03) for the first
arc of the series (yeah, that's fast), this just probably blew all of our minds
as living humans (lol okay I'll try not to) trying to understand the logic of
this story thus far, and yeah, it's as ridiculous as I expected. Hey, didn't
know you are making a sequel, Edogawa Ranpo. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, story. So, totally
not as expected as last episode because I thought they were playing political
here instead of psychological, Nomaru who was the leading candidate in the
elections, is actually a good guy? Let me explain. So as with my deductions last
week, I mentioned that Seizaki will have no much choice but to tell the truth,
but he will not be able to continue investigations. So throw that out of the
window since he still can, and surprisingly, it has NOTHING to do with what
Nomaru intends to do on the new city Shiniki, with his negotiations with others
and everything. But wait, it wasn't supposed to be this fast. Being in Magase
Ai, someone the people in the Shiniki initiative knew about all along, was the
primary... seducer, okay, negotiator (haha) (since we can assume in Japan that
most leaders were men) of most of these stuff, which makes Shiniki's future
bright and prospective with all the new laws, benefits and possibly solutions as
a testbed to improve Japan as a country. It's all going well and all, but
Seizaki is feeling doubtful. Why though? Mainly still because two people
commited suicide over it. So yeah, the truth is because of that woman. Remember
Emiko? As revealed by his higher-up, this was one of Magase's many disguises as
a woman, to change her image and use her... seductive skills to control men, to
summarise. Not that we won't take the bait because we aren't it yet lol, but
suffice it to say that she might have been a double spy for Nomaru's plans since
she was introduced from Itsuki, who is poised to become the new mayor himself
since Nomaru has no plans to be one. If you didn't notice, introducing the woman
was a solution AND a mistake. The politicians didn't get that correctly, but
guess what, Seizaki's investigation group did. Firstly, from the evidence. From
Fumio's steps, he was only discovered through pacing software (I assume this is
the future where AI is awesome haha) that he was visiting a woman before he
killed himself in the apartment to meet with Seizaki, and there were no traces
of a third-party present. Not that the crime scene was cleaned perfectly after,
but since it's clean means a drug is involved, which brings us to the next
point. Second, the drug's real identity as prosecuted from the investigations
group in episode 1. Turns out, it's a suicide drug. An insomnia drug engineered
to make you sleep... forever. Yeah, what a way to go, yes? So since this doesn't
really have much of a trace, it can be disguised, wait for it, BEFORE the new
law takes effect, on other conventional methods of suicide to make it
convincing. From overdose of anesthesia which probably no one can confirm if
it's a viable way to die without hurting yourself, to hanging as from Fumio,
they all look like normal ways of death. That is, if you use it with the drug.
And who gave them the drug? Remember Itsuki? Remember Magase Ai? Yeah, you can
make the connection. And so, the new mayor-to-be's objective is revealed. With
dozens of people lined up on the tallest building in the city and you know,
jumping off one by one, all we need to remember in this episode, and for
goodness sake guys this is just Anime, is that this city just allowed suicide to
be justified. So, if you do not know (because secretly I know of this fact when
I was a kid I literally found out about it myself and saying it here might be
illegal) that suicide is punishable by law, you got another thing coming.
Especially those ones where you don't die, haha oh those are the worst. *evil
laughs* Yeah, so turns out the evil is within thyself, fulfilling the pressures
of living in society and seeking death as an option which quite a few youngsters
have been doing as a reality check outside of the Anime... wow is this totally
going up my alley. Oh, I won't kill myself though as I got to watch this till
the end, but you get where this series is going. This, is going to be one hell
of a ride for the next arc MIKAKOSHI IS SINGING THE NEXT THEME SONG!!! *laugh*
Okay NOW I can't die haha I gotta live for next episode lmao<br />

[Okay, so TL:DR; Ano Tomokazu who created the drug probably is aligned with
Itsuki, who seeks death, who created the sleep forever drug, and probably beta

  </div>

This week... well I guess I can talk about them haha I mean, they aren't bad.
And I'm in the mood for it so why not?
<b>Anime "Saikoro Club" ending theme single</b> came out, it wasn't bad so I'm
giving the topic song. <b>sphere's new single</b> dropped in unexpectedly, and
despite them promoting the B-side which is also the theme song to their new
drama short series on TV, don't expect another Klassic Note Review anytime soon
because it wasn't great. Well, not until I give a watch on that which will not
be this week to say the least. <b>fumika's new album</b> is... still on hold, as
I struggle to even give one song based on my standards today haha. I'm sorry,
fumika-san. I want to give you chance, so maybe, maybe I'll close one eye on two
songs is as far as I'll get. 14-track album, by the way.<br />
<br />
Okay I'm pretty sure we don't have anything else new next week so yeah, I'll be
looking through the ones I've heard before which I let it rot over time because
I'm too busy with work to have the mood to give them. (Procrastination ebe my
middle name haha) Oh yeah, and I'm ditching
<b>BUMP of CHICKEN's new album</b> just because and hopefully picking up
<b>a flood of circle's old album</b> since I sort of liked one of the songs they
sang in a live video I saw recently. Well, it's the off peak season at this time
of the year already, so I'm not going to rush to listen to more songs. I hit 200
this year already I'm good haha<br />
<br />
On news online especially on Twitter, just in case I didn't make it clear or you
skipped the Anime review if you dislike suicides lol,
<b>Komatsu Mikako is singing a new song under Q-MHz</b> starting the new arc
from next week (damn, no Apple Music streaming?),
<b
  >Tachibana Rika's music library is out on streaming services following her new
  digital single</b
>
which... I think it's already better than most of what I've heard so far lol,
and <b>Yuuki Aoi is releasing a new single due January</b> next year. Maybe I'll
give Rika-sama some chance by listening to all her releases now that
inconvenience is out of the way haha I used to spend a lot of effort to listen
to songs you know now it's just whenever it's on streaming lol I GOT WORK MAN I
DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS lmao I will still do it though it's my legacy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This shall be it, my head is aching for some reason probably from sleeping too
much. My left ear is still disabled for some reason following the trip to the
"doctor" last week so... well I'm on work leave now so that sucks haha. On
things related to <b>Klassic Note</b>, do expect a scale down to the song awards
as I will like... declare on how this should go on from her seeing my work
schedule. Automation is on hold now that I learn of database management, so
maybe I'll come up with a simple app at some point hehe. I've got plenty of
things to do to make that happen though, so as ambitious as this plan is I will
not finish it by this week. Still, I'm trying. Maybe open source it to be like a
music management and analysis system in the future, why not. Cya guys next week
then, and until then...<br />
