Meanwhile, if you have noticed how the site changed to asomewhat responsive format... please tell me if anything else breaks on thissite because I can't check all of them on my own so I'm only fixing what I sawover the past few weeks. I just hope it'll last haha it was worth it though Ilook at it everyday lol is is just me<br /><br />Well, let's get to stuff this week, yes? Uh... I really want someone to sub thenew Sora no Method episode though I don't really want to watch it without subs Ican't catch up to it tbh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SaikoroClub04">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "The student council members must be an example to all students." Yeah, and    look at you. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>Hey, Midori-chan, if your "other things to do" is to play board games with othercute girls, you are forgiven. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this why-so-serious new episode(#SaikoroClub04) we get a character focus episode, as with all slice-of-life.Sadly, it's not one we know of. Yeah, they literally throw you into a newcharacter's life now that you sat in well to watch this series lol. It'sShibusawa Ren (Ren-chan from here on), the vice-chairperson of the studentcouncil of the school, and... somewhat related to Midori-chan. Firstly, theproblem. Ren-chan needs help planning for the school festival, seeing thecurrent chairperson is hospitalised for just having quite a quirky characterlol, but yeah and her influence only works if there is an idea going, so yeah,everyone in the room is drawing blanks on new ideas is the issue. Then, shedecides to ask for help. Who else to ask besides Midori-chan, the girl who waswith her in student council in middle school, who was a genius planner full ofideas, and together will make them stronger than ever as a team? But of course,Midori refused such an offer. I mean, if you didn't even realise why she isn'tin club meetings but in a board game shop, you need to watch episode 1 againhaha. So yeah, even Ren-chan won't be able to influence the determination thatis Midori who has decided to, hey not that everyone can, be a board game author.I know those exist, but hey, to know that they aren't shadowed by game companiesand instead being placed their names upfront, that's what will make board gamesa work than merely a product. Much is to say that on video games besides indiebut, you get the point. So... Ren-chan insists on her help, so she asked for ashowdown. Again, for someone who knows how to play every single game in theshop, Ren-chan is asking for a duel she cannot win. Nonetheless, the gameintroduced is simple yet mind-blowing in concept that if you don't use yoursecond brain of deception you are not going to succeed and end up with enoughcows to build a barn out of it lol. (Not going to make the cow jokes on thesegirls since they don't have any milk-) So yeah, Ren-chan lost real quicksurprisingly over Aya-chan who is the professional at losing lol (I guess shegot used to the games she learnt a little about how not to lose too bad) and...yeah, left because she can't deal with the result. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ah, what a soreloser. Anyways, when she says she will be back is not going to be a joke sincewe have half the series to cover lol, but we also now know a little more aboutMidori-chan's past. The reason she was in the board game... game lol, wasbecause of her elder brother, who played a board game Catan with her when shewas a kid (the game doesn't look easy as it's resource management) (man,Midori-chan must be some genius), brought her into the shop and that's when shemet the manager for the first time. So yeah, deciding on her life dream nowdoesn't seem to be much of a far-fetched reality. It's not impossible, but hey,what's wrong with having dreams that are hard to achieve? Just like how Ren-chanhas to do the school festival as her own being the leader of the studentcouncil, so Midori-chan's dream... they all are determined to make it happen.You know, that stereotypical encouragement Anime that Miki-chan is losing out onfor some reason, but I'm sure she'll get around it by the end of this maybehaha. Next episode... I mean, if this is not fanservice I don't know what isthis episode may be kid Midori-chan MVP but we know next week it's going to beAya-chan WITH THE SWIMSUIT!!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> To end this, we are also introduced tothe fourth main character of the series with the lovely yellow long hairreminiscent of<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/48391/Chitoge_Kirisaki"  target="_blank"  >another Anime character</a>lol, so it might not be long before we know who she is. Don't tell me she isalready a board game author Midori-chan is going to be sad haha or happy she canmeet one tbh<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Bpqag0ETUY/XbUU8sUOmmI/AAAAAAAA1iE/Gj5oNLGiiU8i6j3Uv3TEsew3uXIEmaCQACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub04_ren2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW mom doesn't give me sweets for doing my homework as a kid lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DNdfcYzGqa4/XbUU9jtqJLI/AAAAAAAA1iI/VOQiwka1UwwtrXRkcl16QG0q6KogzP1LACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub04_shock.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I don't know if this is racist to be shocked but the girls be cute            hehe          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Seriously, why does half the girls in this school wear ear piercings? It'sa thing there or...? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. "I'm not leaving until you say yes" Okay, then let's play a board gamewhile you're here. Haha Ren-chan you got JEBAITED haha #FeelsBadMan well notreally<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Babylon03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Did you all kill a person to achieve your plans?" Haha, that's what we want    to know too, Seizaki.  </div></blockquote>"Think about this well" Okay so is this a threat now? Ugh, no one wants to beinvolved with politics. But hey, did Seizaki mention that he wants to work forthe benefit of the people? You ask for what you get, so make the decisions now.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this if I'm not wrong, conclusive episode (#Babylon03) for the firstarc of the series (yeah, that's fast), this just probably blew all of our mindsas living humans (lol okay I'll try not to) trying to understand the logic ofthis story thus far, and yeah, it's as ridiculous as I expected. Hey, didn'tknow you are making a sequel, Edogawa Ranpo. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, story. So, totallynot as expected as last episode because I thought they were playing politicalhere instead of psychological, Nomaru who was the leading candidate in theelections, is actually a good guy? Let me explain. So as with my deductions lastweek, I mentioned that Seizaki will have no much choice but to tell the truth,but he will not be able to continue investigations. So throw that out of thewindow since he still can, and surprisingly, it has NOTHING to do with whatNomaru intends to do on the new city Shiniki, with his negotiations with othersand everything. But wait, it wasn't supposed to be this fast. Being in MagaseAi, someone the people in the Shiniki initiative knew about all along, was theprimary... seducer, okay, negotiator (haha) (since we can assume in Japan thatmost leaders were men) of most of these stuff, which makes Shiniki's futurebright and prospective with all the new laws, benefits and possibly solutions asa testbed to improve Japan as a country. It's all going well and all, butSeizaki is feeling doubtful. Why though? Mainly still because two peoplecommited suicide over it. So yeah, the truth is because of that woman. RememberEmiko? As revealed by his higher-up, this was one of Magase's many disguises asa woman, to change her image and use her... seductive skills to control men, tosummarise. Not that we won't take the bait because we aren't it yet lol, butsuffice it to say that she might have been a double spy for Nomaru's plans sinceshe was introduced from Itsuki, who is poised to become the new mayor himselfsince Nomaru has no plans to be one. If you didn't notice, introducing the womanwas a solution AND a mistake. The politicians didn't get that correctly, butguess what, Seizaki's investigation group did. Firstly, from the evidence. FromFumio's steps, he was only discovered through pacing software (I assume this isthe future where AI is awesome haha) that he was visiting a woman before hekilled himself in the apartment to meet with Seizaki, and there were no tracesof a third-party present. Not that the crime scene was cleaned perfectly after,but since it's clean means a drug is involved, which brings us to the nextpoint. Second, the drug's real identity as prosecuted from the investigationsgroup in episode 1. Turns out, it's a suicide drug. An insomnia drug engineeredto make you sleep... forever. Yeah, what a way to go, yes? So since this doesn'treally have much of a trace, it can be disguised, wait for it, BEFORE the newlaw takes effect, on other conventional methods of suicide to make itconvincing. From overdose of anesthesia which probably no one can confirm ifit's a viable way to die without hurting yourself, to hanging as from Fumio,they all look like normal ways of death. That is, if you use it with the drug.And who gave them the drug? Remember Itsuki? Remember Magase Ai? Yeah, you canmake the connection. And so, the new mayor-to-be's objective is revealed. Withdozens of people lined up on the tallest building in the city and you know,jumping off one by one, all we need to remember in this episode, and forgoodness sake guys this is just Anime, is that this city just allowed suicide tobe justified. So, if you do not know (because secretly I know of this fact whenI was a kid I literally found out about it myself and saying it here might beillegal) that suicide is punishable by law, you got another thing coming.Especially those ones where you don't die, haha oh those are the worst. *evillaughs* Yeah, so turns out the evil is within thyself, fulfilling the pressuresof living in society and seeking death as an option which quite a few youngstershave been doing as a reality check outside of the Anime... wow is this totallygoing up my alley. Oh, I won't kill myself though as I got to watch this tillthe end, but you get where this series is going. This, is going to be one hellof a ride for the next arc MIKAKOSHI IS SINGING THE NEXT THEME SONG!!! *laugh*Okay NOW I can't die haha I gotta live for next episode lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zPGOHTkBe4g/XbUgf5WmK7I/AAAAAAAA1iY/O7rIzKedzfIvuru3u0IbLFsAm4yOdfYBwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon03_oldman.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW when I have to work on Mondays but BOOM GOTCHA I don't have to            next Monday haha I'll be happier than this guy          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T__AN5s-FZo/XbUggv-7KwI/AAAAAAAA1ic/f1Js5N-o0mQ9Zeg0AsnG1Xk_oWZHM-1VQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon03_magase.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The real devil is in the eyes of a woman, they say.<br />            But let's call her a drug peddler just in case haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I wrote this sentence only afterreaching the end lol<br />[Okay, so TL:DR; Ano Tomokazu who created the drug probably is aligned withItsuki, who seeks death, who created the sleep forever drug, and probably betatested on himself and... I guess it worked. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> What a way to go, what away to go...]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week... well I guess I can talk about them haha I mean, they aren't bad.And I'm in the mood for it so why not?<b>Anime "Saikoro Club" ending theme single</b> came out, it wasn't bad so I'mgiving the topic song. <b>sphere's new single</b> dropped in unexpectedly, anddespite them promoting the B-side which is also the theme song to their newdrama short series on TV, don't expect another Klassic Note Review anytime soonbecause it wasn't great. Well, not until I give a watch on that which will notbe this week to say the least. <b>fumika's new album</b> is... still on hold, asI struggle to even give one song based on my standards today haha. I'm sorry,fumika-san. I want to give you chance, so maybe, maybe I'll close one eye on twosongs is as far as I'll get. 14-track album, by the way.<br /><br />Okay I'm pretty sure we don't have anything else new next week so yeah, I'll belooking through the ones I've heard before which I let it rot over time becauseI'm too busy with work to have the mood to give them. (Procrastination ebe mymiddle name haha) Oh yeah, and I'm ditching<b>BUMP of CHICKEN's new album</b> just because and hopefully picking up<b>a flood of circle's old album</b> since I sort of liked one of the songs theysang in a live video I saw recently. Well, it's the off peak season at this timeof the year already, so I'm not going to rush to listen to more songs. I hit 200this year already I'm good haha<br /><br />On news online especially on Twitter, just in case I didn't make it clear or youskipped the Anime review if you dislike suicides lol,<b>Komatsu Mikako is singing a new song under Q-MHz</b> starting the new arcfrom next week (damn, no Apple Music streaming?),<b  >Tachibana Rika's music library is out on streaming services following her new  digital single</b>which... I think it's already better than most of what I've heard so far lol,and <b>Yuuki Aoi is releasing a new single due January</b> next year. Maybe I'llgive Rika-sama some chance by listening to all her releases now thatinconvenience is out of the way haha I used to spend a lot of effort to listento songs you know now it's just whenever it's on streaming lol I GOT WORK MAN IDON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS lmao I will still do it though it's my legacy<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This shall be it, my head is aching for some reason probably from sleeping toomuch. My left ear is still disabled for some reason following the trip to the"doctor" last week so... well I'm on work leave now so that sucks haha. Onthings related to <b>Klassic Note</b>, do expect a scale down to the song awardsas I will like... declare on how this should go on from her seeing my workschedule. Automation is on hold now that I learn of database management, somaybe I'll come up with a simple app at some point hehe. I've got plenty ofthings to do to make that happen though, so as ambitious as this plan is I willnot finish it by this week. Still, I'm trying. Maybe open source it to be like amusic management and analysis system in the future, why not. Cya guys next weekthen, and until then...<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
