I'mtrying to make this look similar to the mobile page and... I guess it needsimproving. So yeah, trying not to write cr*p here since this will be the postdescription which covers quite a lot in the homepage so that it looks nice fordesktop since mobile doesn't have this problem life is boring so let's get thisdone with so I can sleep early and work again tomorrow <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SaikoroClub01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Houkago Saikoro Club</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "We can never get lost!... Because we don't have a destination!" Wow you    just blew my mind haha this logic  </div></blockquote>I like how in Anime when you ride a bicycle and fall into the river face downyour bag is fine floating above the surface lol. In this first episode(#SaikoroClub01) of a series I didn't expect myself to like, I think I'm withthe main girl Miki: this<i>is</i> fun. And especially to even just watch. I will not dictate my affinitywith board games (maybe next time), but that's probably also half the reason Igave a chance to this series to see how technical it can get despite itsslice-of-life elements. Firstly, we talk about main girl Miki-chan. She is fromKyoto living in the city (or is it the other way round?) (don't ask if I candifferentiate between accents btw), she is alone, and she likes being alone. Sowhen super lively girl Aya-chan comes by in a bike and accident-s in front ofher (lol), she... almost went the other way haha. Awkward it might be for anencounter, but hearing from her voice that she is a local (I assume we are inKyoto), Aya asks Miki to show her around her place. Funny how much time there isafter school to walk around unknown places and still have fun (#CannotRelate) (Ifeel you, Miki-chan), but yeah, that's how Aya-chan works. Pretending to getlost is actually fun. Well at least, according to her. Sorry if I can't relate,but that's probably how most women work, with window shopping being probably thebest example I can think of. But yeah, I guess at the end of it Miki-chan didhave fun knowing of places around her hometown she doesn't know of. Then, theysaw the chairperson lurking out at the streets at night. Ooo... sounds likesomething indecent lol, but Midori here is working part-time, and so, as shesaid, it's not against the rules. (Then again the irony is rules can be brokenunlike when it's law where you will get punished for breaking it) Part-timeworking may not be anything abnormal (especially if her family's not sowell-to-do), but it's for a board game shop, it seems. Stalking the chairpersonto her work location, the girls find themselves in a world full of boxes withthe potential to show you a good time lol. Well, board games. Having a fun timeplaying it, that kind of "good time" haha. The manager who looks like someripped dude who will f**k you in a porno (lol) introduces them to our first gamein the series, where you get to play as a rug salesman in the Middle East byoccupying places on the board and charging people rent. Sounds like a board gamethat can be fun if you have people who give reactions (lol Aya-chan), butotherwise it's as much as I expected. Halfway through, Miki complains she can'tplay the game well and asks Midori for advice. So yeah, to avoid breaking herown rules lol, she joins her as a teammate. Despite not following the rulessomehow, she is very good at finding loopholes. (I think there is a hentaidoujin out there of her finding loopholes to have underage sex lmao) Otherwise,it was a game, they had fun, this would probably be more fun if they did it in afuture live event or livestream (please make this happen I know the VAs we WILLhave a good time watching them play), but yeah, not really deep into thetechnical stuff, to say the least. Okay, overall impression so far. I know theywill not throw in the jargon too much until they reach the 3-episode rule thing,but yeah, for now it's just simple slice-of-life to show story progression andhow the trio will come to be. Now that Miki-chan has something to do for theweekend (lol), at least we will get to see more of them playing board games buttoo bad, not in full because there's only 20 minutes in this thing and the staffcan't animate all of it lol, but suffice it to say it was entertaining to watch.Educational it might be, whether inside or outside of board games, but withMarinka here being the hype girl I can't see what is wrong with me watching thisseries. Hopefully I won't get too bored after the new guy comes in next week buthey, I see the potential of this gearing towards plot progression than boardgame progression. Don't disappoint me, Anime. I know Aya-chan won't. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ona side note, I may want to think of giving Tomiya Miyu's debut single ie. theopening theme, a chance. She's 19 this year, by the way. (Meh, Tomacchan startedat 18, show-off. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>)<br />[Oops didn't realise the screenshots are all her AYA-CHAN MVP THIS WHOLE SERIESlol prove me wrong]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-srS5MJ8R49c/XZlZEgZEbpI/AAAAAAAA0_s/Zv53zR93KGoct58wKAQQpcHzIwkQ1pjbgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub01_aya3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This face is so cute I can't even<br />            (Really decent animation, by the way)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s2rk9Er9THM/XZlZFvXyRAI/AAAAAAAA0_w/SpysvvEMUcsmK3gF0yLuDhRi08Lx5hHUACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub01_eyecatch.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is probably what happened when these aren't around and when            there's a typhoon outside and the girl can't go home lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "You're not allowed to enter cafÃ©s or other entertainment locations after6PM" Yeah because she's going there, the chairperson lol<br />P.P.S. "I didn't know she had friends like this" No, not until today haha<br />[Also, some hidden clues after looking at<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29223/marrakech" target="_blank"  >this</a>board game Marrakech: When the guy faces the edge of the map he will move alongthe edge of the board, I would assume clockwise.

Okay, let's talk about it then. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Inthis rather hilarious sci-fi maybe series which has little in time for firstepisode (#NullPeta01) there are plenty to talk about. But considering the lengthof this episode, it's not going to get my attention for long. I mean, I'm donewatching this already it's so short. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, story goes Null (yep it'sa name) is a schoolgirl trying to resurrect her elder sister Peta back usingtechnology (hey HDMI and USB-C glad to see you in the future lol) and... it kindof failed. Retaining nothing of the sister's looks and gaining a shit ton ofabilities, she aims to be the best anee-san in the universe lmao. That's it.Yep. That's episode 1. I would imagine this is the EXACT SAME STORY as the videogame that will also come out soon after this, but man... is that it? I can seepotential in this, and it is kind of funny, but comedy this short is not goingto get me hooked, I assure you. Remember, for reference Anime "Ao-chan" twoseasons ago was 10 minutes, and that didn't even have a concrete story. Yeah,probably will be dropping this since sci-fi and this is not much to impress meeven on first episode, so either I give the theme song and be back in Decemberlol, or I play the game (no f**king way haha), or this is the last you'll see ofit here. Goodbye Null-chan, you will be missed haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_iXxTtD8je0/XZlead-OHCI/AAAAAAAA1AA/nilMFxwGgMI7P5wjixPAU9h93toa0gFJgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/nullpeta01_null2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Since I'm not covering this anymore here's cute Null-chan (CV: Waki            Azumi) haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1_EYS7HW1Rk/XZlebmAec5I/AAAAAAAA1AE/poDwCSv1PXgVpilxDHE2rD3FiqBG0hPlwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/nullpeta01_null1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How I know I can't study a Major in Electrical Engineering lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.&nbsp; To be frank? This reminds me of Nichijou with Hakase being a kid whomakes a robot do her bidding. Well, the difference is this one doesn't listen toher orders haha well the Nichijou one didn't too actually<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Dagashi Kashi</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay, there's quite a big break between this and the last few chapters which areonline in case you didn't know the series ended last year so... yeah, I'll talkabout them as far as we can. The "new" chapters (150-155) talk about randomstuff, dagashi too, but also, into the eventual end of the series. We'll talkabout that in a moment, but first, random stuff. They talked about Hajime-sancomplimenting or even just taking over Yo-san's YouTube channel lol (I wonderhow many views that video got *bends forward*), the two guys fought over Ki noKo and Take no Ko (go Google them and you'll get why they even fight) (not thatI tasted it before though they should just be snacks so I don't care? haha don'tbeat me), they talk about the new Moe-level mascot Umami-chan (again, imoutobanzai haha), Kokonotsu was sucking on a lollipop which lasted long enough tolet him know whether he won the newcomer artist award (lol Hajime was rightthough), and Sayashi went on another date with Kokonotsu. That last part, wecannot not talk about it. Mostly about Kokonotsu's goal of being a manga artist.It used to be his life, now he's hesitating. Mainly because of Hotaru-chan, butmaybe because taking over what would be heritage might be a life choice too.Again, I can never be more envious of someone who has a seat in succession of afamily business. Well, anything other than the financial industry in thosestupidly long Taiwanese dramas I'm good lol. I'll keep this short because I havea feeling I'll talk about it in the future anyways, but suffice it to say he'sstruggling to make choices. And that, at least Sayashi assures her supportbehind this dumb dude who still doesn't realise that he is going to be asuccessful man in the future with a woman behind your back haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="376"              data-original-width="529"              height="227"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m6S9g6y0Zd8/XZnp0Nq4-JI/AAAAAAAA1Aw/HTxpFrwbTZMJD_PAP9j1AIjq5Llnx7ptwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/1519.png"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Just like you, Hajime-san <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />            (Her pay, I meant her pay lol)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="290"              data-original-width="652"              height="227"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jQ2MLkbJXLA/XZnp0KrG6QI/AAAAAAAA1A0/zXgadhQdZcUNyjOQX6HB0xMZsDRFOKolQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/1527.png"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="510"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Top 10 Toughest Anime Choices lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. This postscript is dedicated to a quick review of (from the above also fromyours truly) Kotoyama-sensei's new work "Yofudashi no Uta". The first twochapters (in Japanese) describe the life of Kou (who looks like Kokonotsu forsome reason) leaving his house to experience the night life around his place.You know, to see those people who drink into the night and past this middleschooler's curfew, as in Japan. But, he met a girl Nazuna (who lookssurprisingly like Hotaru lol) who introduces him into the night, to the adultlife, and helps him curb his somewhat present insomnia which is not making himany better in school or even his life in general. In the most novice fashion, hegot "duped" (I suppose, haha) into a house, onto a bed (uh huh), and... someonedrew his blood out. Not a mosquito (lol the kid), but turns out Nazuna is avampire. And like in legends, one bite doesn't turn you into a supernatural,since love and passion is required. Now you can see where this goes. Added inwith things he has to deal with as a somewhat smart and attractive guy in school(someone confessed to him in school), this is going to be fun. Hmm...Kotoyama-sensei is this book out yet? Because I would love to read it. And canwe get Ayachi to voice the girl? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Just joking it can use a differentcast if this becomes an Anime. I would say, nice premise for a story. Not that Iread or watch a lot of vampire-related stories before but<br />P.P.S.

Okay, it's not fantastic, but again, with his style hitting me at thistime of year when I just want some good old melodic Rock tunes, he came in atthe right time, before Mrs. GREEN APPLE. Talking about them,<b>Mrs. GREEN APPLE's new album</b> is okay, and I ended up giving so many oftheir topic songs from the album and its singles and not given any new newsongs, so... we shall see about that. Ignoring their rather unappealing popstyle (lol) their melodies are fine maybe. Again, maybe it's just me wanting togive more songs from them or male vocals to balance the analysis for the yearsince I've given so many females over the past month. Also,<a href="https://twitter.com/ohara_yuiko" target="_blank">Ohara Yuiko</a>, Ithink I've fallen in love with you. The music does not matter haha okay maybeit's because of that first song in your album<br /><br />Next week brings us... nothing. Uh oh. But then again I could use a break we areclose to 200 songs this year already and it's only October, geez. On Twitternews and everywhere around, <b>Uesaka Sumire announced a new album</b> whichwill release early next year (maybe I'll listen, maybe I'll not),<b>yucat announced a new mini-album</b> continuing her adventures in thePARALLEL WORLD releasing in November not in streaming so maybe I'll only seethat next year, <b>The Floor is releasing a new album</b> due December, and<b>sphere's new music video preview</b> isn't fantastic tbh. Not bad, plenty ofgood news due end of the year. I'm going to have a hard time closing the KlassicNote year though but not with LuckLife that will never appear on time for me tolisten lol<br /><br />I'm also kind of preparing on a proper revamp to suit Klassic Note to my busywork life now that I have much lesser time to review stuff besides new songs. Somusic videos, Anime soundtracks and so on might be shelved for awards andcommendations where applicable, along with some of the ones that requirededicated time to maintain and add on to give a proper sample to talk aboutevery year. We shall see how it goes and I'll confirm by the end of the yearwhen I do the awards.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay, I'm done for the week. I say that because I don't have work leave or MC ortime off tomorrow lol but hey, do we really need one? Cya guys next week, anduntil then... oh, I created a post talking about... girls I like haha I'm such anerd so be sure to read all about it. The rest of the list will be done by theend of the year when I have time hopefully. It was supposed to be a separatepost but I figured I could play around with it and make it a standard column.Maybe I should make it look like those western things to suit the title when Ihave the time which is none haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
