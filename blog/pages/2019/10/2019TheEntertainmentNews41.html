Yes, I did wait for it to bediscounted to play it. And I got the first game for free so whatever I gave themGoogle survey money they deserved it<br /><br />My plan for the weekend was continue to work on the migration of mobile view tofull on responsive view for this blog, and posting the first Wanted List ofgirls (separate from the page) and... the former took too long to do haha. Andyes, I ignored many minor bugs so that the site still views content correctly.So yeah, I hope you have noticed the changes. Hopefully I'll iron out the issuesfrom looking at posts over the past 5 years and hopefully by then I'll move toWordPress haha just joking let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TokuNana01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;">      Keishichou Tokumubu Tokushu Kyouakuhan Taisakushitsu Dainana-ka:      Tokunana</span    >  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I'm here to protect your futures" Eh I'm okay I can die lol  </div></blockquote>I like how two people can talk up a plan in a bank robbery but the bad guys toldthem to not move. Well, technically it's okay lol. Okay, in this first episode(#TokuNana01) preview of an Anime original series, I don't think I'll becontinuing this, to be honest. Let's talk about it. Firstly, the flashback.Seiji the main guy has a story to tell on how he became a cop today. He wassaved by a detective based on an event 9 years ago (I mean, you'll know it bythe end of the series lol), and that made him want to be a cop since it's cool?Okay, idiot main guy, checked. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Then, there's the worldview. Not reallyexplained or shown in the trailer, this modern fictional world is full of beingsfrom other races. Elves, vampires and other giants are among the most notablebesides humans (not Game of Thrones reference I promise I don't even watch thatshitshow lmao), and they live peacefully along with each other. Yeah, most ofthe time. This already gives in to how much this world already doesn't excite meconsidering we were given the clue that there are also dragons in this show.Lastly, and the main focus of the episode, is using a bank robbery to show thepowers of Tokunana. To be honest? I was not impressed. I mean, Bungou Stray Dogshad a WAY better scriptwriter than this show haha. So, military guys came intothe bank to steal a diamond, and left in a armoured vehicle only to be stoppedby the group. What's most irritating here in my opinion isn't much of the action(it's reasonable at best), but all the inferences provided from intelligentthinking ie. the other guy Seiji talked to, Ichinose, and how loosely theyconnected with each other. It's like playing L.A. Noire but missing all thesecondary story routes and getting to the ending. And that, I think I don't wantto see repeat in future episodes anymore. Not going to bet it'll be any better.The seven people are cool though maybe. Ichinose just looks like a more maturedversion of Seiji lol, Seiji is the newbie now because he called himself hostagein the bank (the diamond probably has something to do with the real bad guys),that little ninja girl with the drones and explosives won't blow up my interestanytime soon haha, the leader is a less cooler version of most action showleaders I'm sorry, the driver might just be a driver I don't know, the sniper ofan old man is probably 2nd coolest among the bunch, and if you didn't see ashinigami in this Anime yet go back and watch the last part. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All inall, not really something I could sit on and call awesome, so I might as wellskip it. It's just not cool enough to call it. To end this, and I don't want tobe critical, the theme songs are quite bad lol, and the animation is barelytolerable. Must they make it so sketchy? Haha okay maybe it's just me<br />[TL;DR Ninja girl is cute and shinigami woman is cool. The rest are trashlmao]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G1M5h5xw2Yk/XaKdVbPPX2I/AAAAAAAA1IM/g0kP8JIhClcsavrjUlVL5VJzmCf-DGOPQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tokunana01_bellemer.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I want this girl to get a separate Anime in itself lol I'm such an            pedophile          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ykIuzH4xg4w/XaKdWO5NAUI/AAAAAAAA1IQ/sBqgtqrVM90XWaAZNqIJIC9O7FZszzqWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tokunana01_leader.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Why does this remind me of            <a              href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EKdA5va0EqQ/XaMUynm7b6I/AAAAAAAA1KI/HHJXw0a0id8D-Hj7UandiweCMy1ZCzRxACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/working7_23.jpg"              target="_blank"              >someone familiar</a            >?            <a              href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xjVQxrrZShs/XaMN7tLI-0I/AAAAAAAA1J8/ixQhjV639fIbSpulzM1jjQ-0BtgwaLsTgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/bleach172_ichimaru.jpg"              target="_blank"              >I don't know</a            >...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "We put our bodies on the line and it'll work out" Okay, no wonder manypolicemen have to sacrifice for justice lol please use your brains cops<br />P.P.S. The Tokunana's head is like "we don't have much to do on off days so justlet us do some work" lol well it's kind of theirs now that the accomplicementioned the Nine<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Babylon01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "We didn't have a warrant." "I asked for one" I have a feeling the break-in    is happening first before the application for warrant lol  </div></blockquote>Did the kid say he wanted to be in a case that's politically related? Well, hegot it alright. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And after this one, I think I might have to keepwatching to find out why. The first episode (#Babylon01) talks about a mystery.Hey, don't all mystery start out mysterious? Of course they do, and this isn'tany exception. The premises might be simple: there was a police raid of apharmaceutical company on suspicion of a drug overdose, to simplify things. Itmay sound like a simple case, it may take a lot of time for the duo of Fumio andSeizaki to read through all the documents to find out what really happened inorder to conclude this case, but in the journey they may have dug out more stuffthan they can cover. And this, I think it's enough of a premise to keepwatching. Firstly, the investigations. This hierarchy is going to be clean cut.Well, until we find out the boss of the investigations group the duo is in isalso corrupted haha. I guess not for now, so let's assume all the guys here lovetheir jobs and want to get to the truth and are not evil. Seizaki seems alittle... something I don't know, using his best friend who is a journalist inthis investigation. Still, things are going well until they saw a documentcovered in blood and ink covering contents of two pages worth, which might besomeone mental involved in this. Also, further investigations lead to anunintional entry to a suicide incident, now tied to politics with the recentmayor election coming up. After Seizaki's head asked him to bear allresponsibility so the old man can retire in peace lol, the duo continue toinvestigate into this supposed multi-level mystery which might just in the endinvolve the drug on which they raided in the first place. Next, let's talk aboutworldview. The city in question is fictional, it's specially created to workindependently off west of Tokyo apparently (sounds like some new commercialdistrict my government here is building lol), and you know, they need a newleader. With this much modernity and technology progression you would wonder whyanyone wouldn't want to reap in the benefits of being the leader of the city,right? So yeah, the leading electoral candidate is popular, but he might also beevil. That, we might be able to see more about it in the next few episodes.Lastly, suspense. This show is very different when you have a proper author onthe line. Since this is an adaptation, the original story is gripping yetcontinuing at all times, from identifying the bloody paper, to seeing theanesthesia suicide, to... you can watch the end yourself but supposedly Fumio isdead (sorry for spoilers), it always gives you intrigue to want to find out moreafter every corner. And that, I applaud the Anime production for holding it welland not dragging it too much. All in all, it may be mellow, the real surprisesaren't in there yet, but I'm curious to find out more. I mean, the guy hangedhimself and wrote to his buddy a farewell message? I mean, if not arresting thesuspect in the hotel with an affair makes you want to die, I should be deadmultiple times now lol. So yeah, what actually happened? I highly doubt theenthusiastic kid will hang himself, and if you can type this long of a message Iassume it's with his own consent, so...? I guess we have to watch to find out.THEY GOT ME haha. On a final note, as this is an Amazon Prime Video special, thefirst three episodes are already out as we speak. If you guys need to confirm ifsubtitled ones are included too that'll be good, but suffice it to say I willfollow TV broadcast schedule and (also hold my horses, and)<u>watch this once a week</u>. Yep, if you can't wait then please help yourself,but this series shows promise. And considering it haha the main arcs, I can'twait to see what happens next. No really, now I have to live with thinking oftwo suicides for a week lol Anime why<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sRxyBL0Xce8/XaKpUgEnD8I/AAAAAAAA1Io/qltQJnQ6MC8X_4sKMUqk0fAN4tXAh4r8wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon01_hang.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This series in a nutshell lol<br />            (Ever since Ranpo Kitan this might be the second time I post a            screen of a hanging)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XZjzoVGw--o/XaKpWRtFAqI/AAAAAAAA1Is/ZVJ-NMyoGSU1VA2pmJ2GqTq-1stBWhJJwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon01_happiness.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This series in a nutshell lol<br />            (This guys is so happy I can't even)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

It's a "he". Yeah, you can see where this is going. So yeah, he'sTanoue, Midori-chan's childhood friend I suppose (why Midori doing the tsunderething it's not like he likes you lol), but also, that he has a crush onAya-chan, if Miki didn't very explicitly tell that to us pretty much the wholeof the episode. It's simple, it's kinda pure, but the guy isn't getting what hewants. An opportunity, I mean. The only one he got was sitting beside her seaton day one. Because he has a class full of<strike>jerks for classmates</strike> wonderful classmates who are helpful andkind, this guy is having a hard time finding an opportunity. I feel you, bro. Ireally do. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> That is not until Midori has to introduce him to hernewly-made friends (lol) and Aya-chan suggested they all play together since themore the merrier. (I need that cast play game livestream promise me that Animeproducers) And, they sit down to play a card game, specifically a bluff game.And with this game, we have learnt that Aya-chan can't lie (well she did, but weall know when), Tanoue keeps trying to save Aya-chan from a loss (spoiler alertshe lost lmao), Midori-chan knows everything about the game already, and Mikiknows the guy's dirty secret haha. All in all, the episode was still quite adrag, but at least the guy got what he wants, that is, interaction withAya-chan. Too bad the girl thinks you have a thing with your childhood classmateso that sucks, but hey, at least he's in now. Good for you, bro. Good for you.Besides the drag in the story though, everything else about this series is fine.Also, I did say technical stuff will bore me down on this? If you just survivedthis episode you'll get what I mean haha. We're reaching the three-episode rulealready, so hopefully I won't have to break it and stop watching this seriesAya-chan is so cute I don't wanna haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pLoT_fgYJf8/XaLDs0RaDGI/AAAAAAAA1JQ/ErOrwV8uapw2j-4rDq7FHCPTU8XrBw7MgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub02_tanoue1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I swear I have the same expression as this guy when looking at            Aya-chan haha<br />            (Is this guy from "Yu-Gi-Oh!"?? lol)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WiLdI73-eKE/XaLDtv_MZ6I/AAAAAAAA1JU/U60thGL-Bf8N3KYEFIi1KoIF_U2-d20AQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/saikoroclub02_midori3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This episode is sponsored by the UNOÂ® card game lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I'm concluding<b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's latest album</b> with two new songs (I really amnot in the mood, I guess) (2017 was a miracle for them lol), and<b>Mrs. GREEN APPLE's new album</b> also concluded here in Klassic Note. Thisweek also had plenty of<b>live performances from this year's rock festivals</b> (specifically ROCK INJAPAN FESTIVAL) so I took a look and took focus on two artists which I'll listento next week I guess.<br /><br />Talking about next week, all hype is on <b>Kitou Akari's debut single</b> whichis rumoured (by me <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>) to be all the talk in Klassic Note and due to be onits shelf if it is good, almost foreshadowing over<b>Polkadot Stingray's new mini-album</b> which isn't bad but let's hope myimpressions of them have been wiped well so I can give them a second chance, tobe honest. To add on, in my spare time (typically at work haha) I'll give alisten to more of <b>Nisshoku Natsuko</b> with her intense piano music tunesdespite being a veteran, and <b>BUMP OF CHICKEN's new album</b> this year sinceyou know, they got me with their new song and I found this so now I gotta giveit a listen haha that's how I work here don't mind me<br /><br />On maybe the latest news hitting Japan probably not as hard as this weekend'styphoon (I hope my girls are alright lmao), with a quick dig I saw THE ORALCIGARETTES and BUMP OF CHICKEN finally releasing their<b>full catalogue on Apple Music Japan</b> (your experience and region may vary)(lol UNISON SQUARE GARDEN stop the half-assing and give it all out instead ofcurated digital albums),<b>YUKARI from RYTHEM is collaborating in lyrics with Tomatsu Haruka</b> on herupcoming single (if you can remember any of them) so that's interesting,<b>Amamiya Sora's new music video</b> is not going to impress me anytime soon,and <b>nano.RIPE's new music video</b> might be even more disappointing. Comeon, no one is listening to your songs online already. Pick up your pace, wouldya? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's it then. I wanted to watch the new episode of Anime "Sora no Method"which has been out to the public as a 5th anniversary special introducing newcharacter... I don't remember who but it's voiced by Marinka haha that's why Igotta but then I realised I can wait for subs so... if it doesn't come out bythen I'll watch raw. It's just harder than reading books since I have to pausethe video every 3 seconds lmao. Other than that, likely board game club andsuicidal meds Anime were in the lines for now, so we shall see how long they canlast. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I should get a haircut haha Idon't care about it though if I don't have to go to work haha<br /><br />P.S. My condolences to whoever suffered (if Death hasn't taken them yet) in therecent typhoon that hit Japan in its strongest in 60 years. Waki Azumi though,is just posting about her life at home on Instagram all night lol I'm surprisedher telcom services didn't get cut<a  href="https://twitter.com/azumi_waki/status/1183347372308303874"  target="_blank"  >JUST STOP THIS</a>I don't want to jerk off to you-<br /><br />P.P.S. Yep you bet I forgot about manga from last week haha next season then<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
