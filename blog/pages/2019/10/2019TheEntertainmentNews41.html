Wow that was quite the journey, Monument Valley 2. Yes, I did wait for it to be
discounted to play it. And I got the first game for free so whatever I gave them
Google survey money they deserved it<br />
<br />
My plan for the weekend was continue to work on the migration of mobile view to
full on responsive view for this blog, and posting the first Wanted List of
girls (separate from the page) and... the former took too long to do haha. And
yes, I ignored many minor bugs so that the site still views content correctly.
So yeah, I hope you have noticed the changes. Hopefully I'll iron out the issues
from looking at posts over the past 5 years and hopefully by then I'll move to
WordPress haha just joking let's start<br />

I like how two people can talk up a plan in a bank robbery but the bad guys told
them to not move. Well, technically it's okay lol. Okay, in this first episode
(#TokuNana01) preview of an Anime original series, I don't think I'll be
continuing this, to be honest. Let's talk about it. Firstly, the flashback.
Seiji the main guy has a story to tell on how he became a cop today. He was
saved by a detective based on an event 9 years ago (I mean, you'll know it by
the end of the series lol), and that made him want to be a cop since it's cool?
Okay, idiot main guy, checked. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Then, there's the worldview. Not really
explained or shown in the trailer, this modern fictional world is full of beings
from other races. Elves, vampires and other giants are among the most notable
besides humans (not Game of Thrones reference I promise I don't even watch that
shitshow lmao), and they live peacefully along with each other. Yeah, most of
the time. This already gives in to how much this world already doesn't excite me
considering we were given the clue that there are also dragons in this show.
Lastly, and the main focus of the episode, is using a bank robbery to show the
powers of Tokunana. To be honest? I was not impressed. I mean, Bungou Stray Dogs
had a WAY better scriptwriter than this show haha. So, military guys came into
the bank to steal a diamond, and left in a armoured vehicle only to be stopped
by the group. What's most irritating here in my opinion isn't much of the action
(it's reasonable at best), but all the inferences provided from intelligent
thinking ie. the other guy Seiji talked to, Ichinose, and how loosely they
connected with each other. It's like playing L.A. Noire but missing all the
secondary story routes and getting to the ending. And that, I think I don't want
to see repeat in future episodes anymore. Not going to bet it'll be any better.
The seven people are cool though maybe. Ichinose just looks like a more matured
version of Seiji lol, Seiji is the newbie now because he called himself hostage
in the bank (the diamond probably has something to do with the real bad guys),
that little ninja girl with the drones and explosives won't blow up my interest
anytime soon haha, the leader is a less cooler version of most action show
leaders I'm sorry, the driver might just be a driver I don't know, the sniper of
an old man is probably 2nd coolest among the bunch, and if you didn't see a
shinigami in this Anime yet go back and watch the last part. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> All in
all, not really something I could sit on and call awesome, so I might as well
skip it. It's just not cool enough to call it. To end this, and I don't want to
be critical, the theme songs are quite bad lol, and the animation is barely
tolerable. Must they make it so sketchy? Haha okay maybe it's just me<br />
[TL;DR Ninja girl is cute and shinigami woman is cool. The rest are trash
lmao]<br />

P.S. "We put our bodies on the line and it'll work out" Okay, no wonder many
policemen have to sacrifice for justice lol please use your brains cops<br />
P.P.S. The Tokunana's head is like "we don't have much to do on off days so just
let us do some work" lol well it's kind of theirs now that the accomplice
mentioned the Nine<br />

Did the kid say he wanted to be in a case that's politically related? Well, he
got it alright. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And after this one, I think I might have to keep
watching to find out why. The first episode (#Babylon01) talks about a mystery.
Hey, don't all mystery start out mysterious? Of course they do, and this isn't
any exception. The premises might be simple: there was a police raid of a
pharmaceutical company on suspicion of a drug overdose, to simplify things. It
may sound like a simple case, it may take a lot of time for the duo of Fumio and
Seizaki to read through all the documents to find out what really happened in
order to conclude this case, but in the journey they may have dug out more stuff
than they can cover. And this, I think it's enough of a premise to keep
watching. Firstly, the investigations. This hierarchy is going to be clean cut.
Well, until we find out the boss of the investigations group the duo is in is
also corrupted haha. I guess not for now, so let's assume all the guys here love
their jobs and want to get to the truth and are not evil. Seizaki seems a
little... something I don't know, using his best friend who is a journalist in
this investigation. Still, things are going well until they saw a document
covered in blood and ink covering contents of two pages worth, which might be
someone mental involved in this. Also, further investigations lead to an
unintional entry to a suicide incident, now tied to politics with the recent
mayor election coming up. After Seizaki's head asked him to bear all
responsibility so the old man can retire in peace lol, the duo continue to
investigate into this supposed multi-level mystery which might just in the end
involve the drug on which they raided in the first place. Next, let's talk about
worldview. The city in question is fictional, it's specially created to work
independently off west of Tokyo apparently (sounds like some new commercial
district my government here is building lol), and you know, they need a new
leader. With this much modernity and technology progression you would wonder why
anyone wouldn't want to reap in the benefits of being the leader of the city,
right? So yeah, the leading electoral candidate is popular, but he might also be
evil. That, we might be able to see more about it in the next few episodes.
Lastly, suspense. This show is very different when you have a proper author on
the line. Since this is an adaptation, the original story is gripping yet
continuing at all times, from identifying the bloody paper, to seeing the
anesthesia suicide, to... you can watch the end yourself but supposedly Fumio is
dead (sorry for spoilers), it always gives you intrigue to want to find out more
after every corner. And that, I applaud the Anime production for holding it well
and not dragging it too much. All in all, it may be mellow, the real surprises
aren't in there yet, but I'm curious to find out more. I mean, the guy hanged
himself and wrote to his buddy a farewell message? I mean, if not arresting the
suspect in the hotel with an affair makes you want to die, I should be dead
multiple times now lol. So yeah, what actually happened? I highly doubt the
enthusiastic kid will hang himself, and if you can type this long of a message I
assume it's with his own consent, so...? I guess we have to watch to find out.
THEY GOT ME haha. On a final note, as this is an Amazon Prime Video special, the
first three episodes are already out as we speak. If you guys need to confirm if
subtitled ones are included too that'll be good, but suffice it to say I will
follow TV broadcast schedule and (also hold my horses, and)
<u>watch this once a week</u>. Yep, if you can't wait then please help yourself,
but this series shows promise. And considering it haha the main arcs, I can't
wait to see what happens next. No really, now I have to live with thinking of
two suicides for a week lol Anime why<br />

If this isn't a triangle relationship between the main girls I don't know what

Okay, besides the slice-of-life goodness Aya-chcan can't get involved in between
the other two lol, the new episode (#SaikoroClub02) introduces us to a new
character. It's a "he". Yeah, you can see where this is going. So yeah, he's
Tanoue, Midori-chan's childhood friend I suppose (why Midori doing the tsundere
thing it's not like he likes you lol), but also, that he has a crush on
Aya-chan, if Miki didn't very explicitly tell that to us pretty much the whole
of the episode. It's simple, it's kinda pure, but the guy isn't getting what he
wants. An opportunity, I mean. The only one he got was sitting beside her seat
on day one. Because he has a class full of
<strike>jerks for classmates</strike> wonderful classmates who are helpful and
kind, this guy is having a hard time finding an opportunity. I feel you, bro. I
really do. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> That is not until Midori has to introduce him to her
newly-made friends (lol) and Aya-chan suggested they all play together since the
more the merrier. (I need that cast play game livestream promise me that Anime
producers) And, they sit down to play a card game, specifically a bluff game.
And with this game, we have learnt that Aya-chan can't lie (well she did, but we
all know when), Tanoue keeps trying to save Aya-chan from a loss (spoiler alert
she lost lmao), Midori-chan knows everything about the game already, and Miki
knows the guy's dirty secret haha. All in all, the episode was still quite a
drag, but at least the guy got what he wants, that is, interaction with
Aya-chan. Too bad the girl thinks you have a thing with your childhood classmate
so that sucks, but hey, at least he's in now. Good for you, bro. Good for you.
Besides the drag in the story though, everything else about this series is fine.
Also, I did say technical stuff will bore me down on this? If you just survived
this episode you'll get what I mean haha. We're reaching the three-episode rule
already, so hopefully I won't have to break it and stop watching this series
Aya-chan is so cute I don't wanna haha<br />

P.S. "If I'm doing it alone (game from last week) I wouldn't have known what to
do..." You are WEAK haha sorry Miki-chan you're good<br />
P.P.S. "I guess we never talked even though we were neighbours!" Because your
other neighbour was a piece of shit-<br />

</blockquote>
This week continues on the fever week that is last week, and also to follow-up
on albums which I didn't have much of mood to give. I'm concluding
<b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's latest album</b> with two new songs (I really am
not in the mood, I guess) (2017 was a miracle for them lol), and
<b>Mrs. GREEN APPLE's new album</b> also concluded here in Klassic Note. This
week also had plenty of
<b>live performances from this year's rock festivals</b> (specifically ROCK IN
JAPAN FESTIVAL) so I took a look and took focus on two artists which I'll listen
to next week I guess.<br />
<br />
Talking about next week, all hype is on <b>Kitou Akari's debut single</b> which
is rumoured (by me <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>) to be all the talk in Klassic Note and due to be on
its shelf if it is good, almost foreshadowing over
<b>Polkadot Stingray's new mini-album</b> which isn't bad but let's hope my
impressions of them have been wiped well so I can give them a second chance, to
be honest. To add on, in my spare time (typically at work haha) I'll give a
listen to more of <b>Nisshoku Natsuko</b> with her intense piano music tunes
despite being a veteran, and <b>BUMP OF CHICKEN's new album</b> this year since
you know, they got me with their new song and I found this so now I gotta give
it a listen haha that's how I work here don't mind me<br />
<br />
On maybe the latest news hitting Japan probably not as hard as this weekend's
typhoon (I hope my girls are alright lmao), with a quick dig I saw THE ORAL
CIGARETTES and BUMP OF CHICKEN finally releasing their
<b>full catalogue on Apple Music Japan</b> (your experience and region may vary)
(lol UNISON SQUARE GARDEN stop the half-assing and give it all out instead of
curated digital albums),
<b>YUKARI from RYTHEM is collaborating in lyrics with Tomatsu Haruka</b> on her
upcoming single (if you can remember any of them) so that's interesting,
<b>Amamiya Sora's new music video</b> is not going to impress me anytime soon,
and <b>nano.RIPE's new music video</b> might be even more disappointing. Come
on, no one is listening to your songs online already. Pick up your pace, would
ya? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's it then. I wanted to watch the new episode of Anime "Sora no Method"
which has been out to the public as a 5th anniversary special introducing new
character... I don't remember who but it's voiced by Marinka haha that's why I
gotta but then I realised I can wait for subs so... if it doesn't come out by
then I'll watch raw. It's just harder than reading books since I have to pause
the video every 3 seconds lmao. Other than that, likely board game club and
suicidal meds Anime were in the lines for now, so we shall see how long they can
last. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I should get a haircut haha I
don't care about it though if I don't have to go to work haha<br />
<br />
P.S. My condolences to whoever suffered (if Death hasn't taken them yet) in the
recent typhoon that hit Japan in its strongest in 60 years. Waki Azumi though,
is just posting about her life at home on Instagram all night lol I'm surprised
her telcom services didn't get cut
