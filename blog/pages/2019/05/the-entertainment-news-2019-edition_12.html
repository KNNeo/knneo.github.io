It's kinda late, and I'm just enjoying the music videos on AppleMusic Japan to get the most of my money out, so if you have a subscription besure to check them out. Yes, all sphere members have their music videos up bynow. Not their latest song but hey, Aki-chan technically stopped singing newsongs in 2017 BOOM got her haha<br /><br />I also realised yesterday that(because of the Anime's<a  href="https://twitter.com/bungosd_anime/status/1127045663756185602"  target="_blank"  >official Tweet</a>) Natsukawa Shiina voices one of the characters in the show. I don't know if Imentioned this before here, but yeah, she is finally an<a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>&nbsp;in anAnime I watch haha. (Okay I don't recall Sora no Method so whatever hahaha) SoI'm watching this week's episode first just because of her involvement in theepisode. Sorry Senko-san! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For once, we'll start with Stray Dogs thisweek. An Anime imouto is still an imouto, even if it's in some crazy-killingaction show haha don't die too fast please<br /><br />Note to self:<a  href="../../2016/11/the-entertainment-news-2016-edition_20.html"  >Over here</a>in your review you did not even FOR A MOMENT (lol) mention about Nan-chan threeyears ago when it aired haha (I guess people do change... I meant me haha)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BungouStrayDogs30">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Bungo Stray Dogs Season 3</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "...until they tell us where the Guild's property is." I mean, you know that    (1) it's in the sea offshore and (2) they aren't all dead yet, right?  </div></blockquote>Normally, if you explain too much about your defenses, I'm pretty sure you'lldie really fast haha like a walk in The Park amirite??? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> In the new(haha) episode (#BungouStrayDogs30) that must be the best episode ever for thisseries to say the least, we marry the Detective Agency with Port Mafia. Hey,even the two leaders mentioned about a truce after the Guild incident, so what'swrong with a retired member of the Agency to a Black Lizard underling? Haha, nottrue though, just a heads up, but yeah, also why I watched this first. Thataside first, let's talk story. Ignoring that stupid group who wanted theDetective Agency's coffee downstairs lol, Kunikida started to investigate intothe Moby Dick incident (if you need a recall that "airship" sank after defeatwith The Guild) along with the weretiger Atsushi by visiting retired residenthacker Katai, who is known to be a NEET (if it isn't obvious enough) and a<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hikikomori" target="_blank">hikikomori</a>(screwed up spelling there omg) ie. he doesn't have to leave the house becausehis Ability is so useful it'll make me stay in my house if I have it lol. HisAbility is hacking any electronic objects around him, which makes him the bestperson to maintain a server room in any capacity lmao. (Google, want to hirethis guy? He's not for hire btw) Problem is, he needs to concentrate, forexample, at his comfort of the house, but he got totally confused when he wentout of the streets (he what? haha) and saw someone he liked at first sight.Turns out, along with Higuchi at Port Mafia who was also worried about thegirl's presence after seeing her with her beloved (ugh) (just stop it, Higuchi)Akutagawa (Ryuunosuke) (we'll get to why I use his first name in a moment), thegirl was not an ordinary woman. Well, she was Ryuunosuke's younger sister.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, she is in Port Mafia as Gin, which easily explains why she (it'sa she) hardly talks and poses as a guy so to likely follow her brother who is anAbility user to stay in the organisation. Hey, she is one skilled assassin evenwithout an Ability though, that's for sure. For starters, she has a wonderfulvoice. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, a wonderful episode about a love that can never be(for Katai giving the love letter, and for Higuchi since she can be assured thatthey don't do incest) (I think) (haha), and since he can get over it instead ofimplicating another innocent person into this fray (I would argue though thatshe can protect herself real well anyways), we can finally get back to seriouswork hopefully. He just gotta cry it out first like what I normally do. Ijust... didn't have the courage to do it like he does, so I deserve it. *cries*And to end this, if you didn't read the opening paragraph, Gin was voiced byNatsukawa Shiina, also known now as my beloved voice actress imouto haha shesounds weird in this Anime though (Also, only ONE LINE in this episode AGAIN??wtf she can do better than this haha)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BG2m9z2_MSI/XNbc8QddRrI/AAAAAAAAw5k/hTN5clNPH8sQirV5ZfxXCkYF9LbLD0bswCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs30_tired.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How I think my colleagues will react when I want to ask them            something lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ilV3l_7v5YQ/XNbc8V3L8CI/AAAAAAAAw5g/_ElzbmfvHk89cgNbkRwDPLEQ9KBQAFsmwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs30_lucy2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Why did I like this so much??

"He really is bad at talking to women" lol I mean, I only am bad at talkingto women I like, but this guy... haha<br />P.P.S. That is, THE BEST FLASHBACKI've seen in an Anime series EVER hahahahahahaha *looks at Gin flashbackagain*<br />[Also, I spoiled myself on this episode technically because I sawthe image of Gin with Ryuunosuke on some Wiki. Still. They look great togetherhaha Higuchi don't point your gun at me]<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yaL9p4Eh5nE/XNbb9lANa2I/AAAAAAAAw5Y/875qNy6wAwQlwj5mNxZgYNsf8OB-Og-MQCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs30_katai1.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        As with all characters in this game, Katai Tayama's "Futon" is a story        about a middle-aged man falling in love with a young woman.

I mean, there goes your salary Nakano haha  </div></blockquote>"Are you turning into a fox yourself?" If he ever does, Senko-san, your jobwould be done because he'll just caress his own tail to death haha. (Notimplying about self pleasure but you get what I mean) In this new episode(#SenkoSan05) we have a guest. It's all white, it's called "<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/shiro"  target="_blank"  >Shiro</a>", and it has a tail. Uh oh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The new demigod stops by for Senko-san'scooking, but more importantly as shown in last episode, she wants Nakano to bemore satisfied because Senko-san so far has not been effective in relieving hishectic work life. Well, nothing will, to be honest (haha), but still. It feelslike Shiro may be more willing to let Nakano like, pet her head, but too badShiro is even more worried about being touched on the tail, so yeah she makes arun for it lol. Senko-san is still the best haha. I thought Shiro going throughthe wall will give something to the even more tired Enouji, but I guess notthen. Maybe we'll see it happen? I don't know. Anyways, more happy stuff to keepus happy and remind ourselves Nakano at this point is pretty much in pedophileterritory already, being with the "mother" in the bath (Happy Mother's Dayeverybody lol), and her scratching your back.... hey, it was more effective inremoving his "darkness" though, so that's good for him to say the least. Again,if you want to experience people enjoying being happy and satisfied, this is theshow for you. I suppose Nakano won't think of sex to any extent here lol, sowe're good. Even though I'd argue touching the tail is already sexualharrassment, and with the visual cue inciting people to think of their age? Yoube glad the police aren't at your place yet, Nakano. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XupBgyIdAf0/XNeJgiQSlnI/AAAAAAAAw6g/DjN3xuaKM2YrHCU8nwSgjqOzaon0_o0rACLcBGAs/s320/senkosan05_bath.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How you know you are in child porn territory          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Hi_twumn9E/XNeJjFsUvAI/AAAAAAAAw6k/VSUUdGSLWJQ0olpTJnbVmhuPJYZFU0algCLcBGAs/s320/senkosan05_senko2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Senko-san noooooo~          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

In this newepisode (#AoChan06) we got a guy who can pinpoint how many months a couple havebeen together (and how many times they did) just by looking at their behaviour.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> WE GOT A GENIUS HERE, GUYS!! Haha anyways, it's Yabe-san the editordoing by because the dad can't come up with new ideas, so he gets to go "collectresearch information" with Ao-chan in a place... we would love to go but Ao-chanhonestly should stay out of haha. Ignoring all the blatant boobs that arehanging around with the meat (lol), Ao-chan saw Miyabi... working with hisbeloved Kijima. Oh well, so what else is new? Well, she didn't notice her friendis out there being a b*tch making sure she gets the guy and not her, (and it'snot working lmao) but yeah, Yabe-san is added into the fray because he can callAo-chan by her first name, just like we're doing right now. Is that a problem? Iguess so, in Japanese formality, to say the least. Still, plenty ofmisunderstanding just like this, Ao-chan is getting real jealous but more ofbeing mad at Kijiima because she really doesn't understand him enough, andKijima notices Ao-chan is kind of a dork so yeah, as a normie what else are yougoing to do besides making sure your feelings get across? Yay main guy going tocarry this show going forward! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, a great episode to offsetthe otherwise dull trip to the hotel lol, but hey, thank goodness the dad wasn'there to witness them all but really, Yabe-san is technically worse, and we haveto put up with that handsome and serious face haha HELL YEAH NEXT WEEK BEACHEPISODE!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_SVwhsuoavs/XNeP1THBX2I/AAAAAAAAw7A/U-_pW8LP368CKLKvMuhQ2Lyem_A-V6T9wCLcBGAs/s320/aochan06_dad.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When you realise your small white mohawk can split water currents            lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R2MZYHhxlG4/XNeP1WzPjMI/AAAAAAAAw68/sMZsss1WI8Qx1oFiw8wpEx9kJn-k6UerQCLcBGAs/s320/aochan06_flesh.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            If you noticed that Ao-chan's mouth gapes as wide as those animals            behind (What does that imply? haha)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

In the new episode (#Joshikausei06) we talkabout weight loss. And amongst all the <strike>techniques</strike> scams thatare out there, planking (as shown in the TV in case you don't know of it) isactually one of the most effective. 30 seconds is beginner's lesson btw, and bythe time you can do 1min on a regular basis you probably are fit enough thatyou'll start to lose weight. No joke, I speak from experience... past experienceactually haha. That's what happens if you're like Momoko's mother I assume? Whorealised she was so thicc (not spelling mistake) and is still eating whilewatching televsion all day. Starting it will be hard, so she takes her daughterMomoko as motivation haha. It works though, so good for her.

Haha    </div>  </blockquote>  That one guy who overheard the flashback conversation from Reiner mentioning  his Titan? Yeah, try finding him around, yes? Haha that's what happens when  you can't keep out mouth shut lol. In the new episode (#AttackOnTitan52)  things have quite the development. We were started with a flashback, specially  a flashback we know of, just on the side we have not heard of. Hey, remember  how Marco died some time ago? It wasn't an accident. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, yep he  got wind of the conversation of the two traitors, and died for a bad cause.  Talking about evil, am I right? Again, not like Reiner and Bertholdt gave a  damn about that since the beginning, as we have seen then in the flashbacks  and also the conversation with the "War Chief" Zeke who is probably like one  of them in a larger group of beings I would argue, that want the end of the  regime within those walls apparently. Maybe that's why they "obtained" those  powers? I doubt you can be born with them, but hey, what do I know. Then  again, we have only knew that little more about the political regime that  rests with the precedence of the throne within the walls, with Christia being  the new leader after overthrowing the fake King, but even in all this...  Reiner and the others want this destroyed. Why though? To be honest, not like  I care because it's going to be a hell of a war anyways, but more of now that  we are actually introduced to the worldview in this series. That, I'd like to  hear more. With Bertholdt (I swear I checked the spelling once and have been  looking at the sample since haha) transforming to his Colossal Titan form  after failed negotiations with Armin (I doubt that is any level of negotiation  since he's like "Nope") and seeing his partner pretty much half dead at this  point, he plays the strategic move of taking down the leftovers head-on. That,  or what's left of them. #RIPHange which I thought I'd never say but it's not  like they can play hide and seek to a nuclear-level explosion. What Armin and  the others can do next? I... am not feeling hopeful. Is this the feel of  despair we know of since the start of the series? Man, I just want this series  to have a good ending, if any. But it looks like it won't happen without a  fight. A big one it seems, from the next episode preview. And the Beast Titan  (ie. War Chief Zeke probably) is making its move. Hey, not going to say no to  more action scenes, I would say.<br />  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OhH92IZvqNg/XNl3FK4-1_I/AAAAAAAAw8o/aR7WYVswr6MAqMQA2L6w32r3IRF0unnjwCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan52_explosion.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              #NotWWII this happened centuries ago            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fGHg9U4f0_w/XNl3HZbTyDI/AAAAAAAAw8s/9llQ0ecaDq4lv8IysO1LFWBLgV6s1wnQgCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan52_view.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              You pieces of-            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

I can't do much to be honest. I'll waitthen. We can still though, talk about <b>sphere's new album</b>&nbsp;- whichunsurprisingly was not in Apple Music unlike the rest of their music collection- and it was... less than great to be frank, as I desperately try to find newsongs to listen to, and the topic song... is a real disappointment. I get themusic video, the nostalgia, but no. It's not a best album, we reviewed one backthen already. I want new songs, something good. And... I only ended up with one.Damn. I know. <b>GRANRODEO and LuckLife's new singles</b> will be delayed untilI review them in full. Stupid uploaders.... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Next week, ifall goes well (ugh) (I like how in 2019 this is still a problem) (yes we willtalk about this problem in a future post, I need time to prepare research data)then we may see <b>Kawano Marina's new single</b>. Yes, this girl who once sangfor Anime back in 2011 is singing for herself now. Under Teichiku, because wedid mention this before, but it's okay since she is writing her own songs soproduction won't kill my impressions from the music video... I hope. Fingerscrossed haha<br /><br />On Twitter news, I hope you guys have caught up on the<b>new live videos of TrySail</b> dear Aniplex/SACRA MUSIC has kindly put up forus over the past month gradually, since I did select one to talk about everyweek for the past month. <b>Yuuki Aoi's new album</b> comes out in end of June,<b>Sunrise In My Attache Case is back with another album</b> (I'm holding backmy hype since they followed me too closely two years ago lol), and<b>Yoru no Honki Dance released their new music video</b> which is... so theirstyle, so I'll give it. When there's a song you can't stop dancing to from HonkiDance I'll dance to it. They are the only exception on twerking haha is that howyou use that word? lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay this shall be it. I'llbe back for Attack on Titan in case you wonder why one part is empty haha. Also,spent some time to spend a lot of money to buy a lucky number phone numberbecause supposedly it'll change my life. I don't think I mentioned this, but ifnot for a fraction of my childhood where I read that one numerology book and satdown to listen to my fortune that one time two weeks ago, I wouldn't have paidmoney to do this. Don't worry, it was for my mom. Happy Mother's Day, mom. Hopeme spending money to change my fortune will make my and your lives better. Weshall see. I still need to go to my own telco to change the number... it's acomplicated process haha it's easier to reserve a number online on that onetelco that isn't mine, in a nutshell. Cya guys then, and until next time... Ineed to transfer some lucky Mother's Day money to my mom for once. I feel badletting her takeaway dinner for the rest of the family already haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
