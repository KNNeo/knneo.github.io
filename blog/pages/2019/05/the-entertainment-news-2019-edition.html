Again, Mocho: No half-naked shots, no pre-order. Prove me otherwise.<br /><br />Haha,
just thinking about her newly announced photobook too much over the past few
weeks I really want to buy again but... you know. I did say she's got potential
but if it's not showing the next time around then... I'm going to keep my boner
AND my wallet lol<br /><br />Welcome back to my weekly obligatory post where I
tried to type the intro of this post first before watching so that it feels like
I'm tired and sick or watching shows on a regular basis and it'll be better if I
do this paragraph later where I'll be happier probably because I enjoyed them
and not because my weekend task is done haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "You're not getting enough exercise" Oh man Senko-san got me- Wait, we
    talking about Nakano? lol
  </div>
</blockquote>
"I'm going to step on you" HELL YEAH I KNEW A BDSM EPISODE IS COMING lol in the
new episode (#SenkoSan07) we... I mean, I have a feeling I have been talking
about how a lucky piece of sh*t Nakano is enjoying his life with a demigod, but
hey, this is what the series is about, and I didn't notice how much of groans I
have been ignoring thus far haha. And I'm not talking about Senko-san because I
wouldn't mind haha, but yeah, Senko-san does a massage on Nakano, and man, I
hope this series doesn't turn me gay by the last episode lmao. Anyways, that is
that, and... The happiness probably all went away the moment the one colleague
told him to help out overtime. All Senko-san needs to do actually is to get
Nakano a better job. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay whatever, and he misses the last train. All
his hopes, his awesome dinner, more tail caressing... it's not going to happen
tonight. He can't get home now, so I guess he has to live off convenience stores
and stay in the office. That is unless, you meet Shiro. Funny how the demigods
themselves can't communicate with each other (well technically Senko-san doesn't
have that screen Shiro uses to observe the real world) so yeah Senko-san was in
the dark about Nakano's predicament. So yeah, Shiro offers to send him home, but
of course, in the most spectacular way possible, through the god gates. (lol
it's called "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/torii" target="_blank">torii</a>"
you idiot haha I'm scolding myself) So yeah, Nakano is cheating lol. Shiro
chooses at this time to tell him the story behind Senko-san's decision to take
care of a descendant (yeah she isn't in love with you bro haha) but Nakano kinda
accepts it mostly because he could use a fox for a housewife while living alone
haha. Nakano in return treated Shiro to come corn dog and ice cream (lol), and
all is well. Man, I wish I could have a backup plan like this when I miss the
last train haha it's impossible the last train here is 11.30pm and we don't have
privatised train corporations who will set last train departure times this early
lol<br />

P.S. So she's 800-years-old, weight 25kg and is probably shorter than my
youngest nephew... she's perfect haha #NotPedoTalk lol<br />P.P.S, I like how
Nakano saying Senko-san is the perfect weight and is probably offending ALL
females around the world especially those weight-conscious ones which is all of
them lmao<br /><br />

Yeah Louisa is right you just lost money bro just go work part-time for like
your next few decades and you'll be rich again- Oh he's going to die before
that? He doesn't have any skills too?? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay in this new episode
(#BungouStrayDogs32) Louisa admires Francis as a leader. Hah, as if that would
be true she likes this
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> so much we
don't even know haha. Also, if you have any money left after getting beat up,
Francis, we'll see. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So yeah, we get to find out what happened of the
last of the Guild besides that cafe waitress who is having a wonderful time
making coffee lmao. More like she's making something else amirite?? *looks at
faceless Kyouka* Haha anyways, let's talk about the Guild. Francis is in the
slums with Louisa after the incident on Moby Dick, and... the guy is depressed
af. Louisa tries to convince him to get back on his knees, only to realise that
the wife's wedding ring saved his life. If you need an explanation of how that
worked please refer to Francis' Ability and you'll get it. Let's just say it's
emergency rations in use, and that he thought he can't risk it anymore after
this. Hey, you can risk this woman who doesn't want to leave you. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay,
that sounds wrong (sorry Francis's wife haha) but hey, at least his life is
worth something now, after helping beat up those idiots who haven't got enough
of losing after dealing with the Detective Agency lmao. A man Francis still is,
he and Louisa plan to take back the place in a storm, hopefully to reach as we
have known, their objective for coming here: taking over the Special Ability
Agency who, as you would know and includes that one Sakaguchi Ango, works for
the local government. So yeah, money will do it. Problem now is, he needs more.
Especially when you spent all the money on discounted pots and pans... wait,
what? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (That voice recorder thing is icing on top lmao) As stupid as
this sounds, I'm glad he has learnt of thrift spending, just that... he forgot
he's not that rich to even buy things on discount lmao. Anyways, they rented a
place so Louisa can use her Ability to come up with a complete plan (the place
is called "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/subarashii" target="_blank"
  >Subarashi</a
>-sou" looks great haha) while Francis hangs out with the neighbour lol, is
apparently finding some loophole to gain money quick. So yeah, they have to
solve a mystery. Well, not them two, so they asked Poe to do the job. Yeah,
Ranpo's friend, that is. Hey, it's just solving a mystery, so yeah, the two used
him to their advantage. Because it's the CEO that killed the one guy instead of
the engineer who filed the patent under the company's name of course, making the
CEO guilty instead of letting him get away with it will of course make his
company useless while Francis comes in to clear his company stocks up. Basic
stock market economics, ladies and gentlemen. Anyways, I hope the engineer
doesn't die too soon (lol), hopefully the Guild has a plan to take care of
uncertainties (for example, Fyodor, Fyodor and Fyodor lol), and it looks like we
may be back on track soon considering Fyodor is done with whatever he is
planning in front of his computers real soon. However, I would argue that many
Abilities will be out there to stop him (Katai, for example), so he may not get
what he wants that easily. Well, he did get a book of Abilities from Port Mafia,
so... we shall see. And if next episode didn't get me wrong on the title because
I only know of one assassin, we... might get to see Gin again haha I'm sorry
it's this obsession of the "backdoor" lol<br />

I'm really liking these Ao-chan regrets cleverly disguised as flashbacks of
previous episodes in these intros haha. *looks at production* Anyways, in this
new episode (#AoChan08) we discover Ao-chan's purpose of asking Kijima to sex
her. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> "I'm already full up" Not unless it's his se- Okay I can go on
with the jokes, but hey, I better stop and pull it out. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, the
story, we need to get serious here haha this show is the best. So yeah, as we
can see, "Ao-chan wa... Benkyou ga Dekinai". There, I said it. Can we end this
now?? lol so in a nutshell, Ao-chan decides to do something to make sure Kijima
is flat out rejected but I would argue that she shouldn't do so but just forget
about him which she can't do, so... I don't know haha. But yeah, Ao-chan wants a
clean cut between her and the guy, so she thought (and still thinks) the best
way is to flat out reject him at the highest point of love: sex. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Not
how it works Ao-chan you just betray the shit out of him and he'll leave haha.
Anyways, Kijima asks her out to watch him play soccer in school, and... she
accepts. Little did she know her plan was somewhat foiled by her father who
totally saw through her plan and decides to literally pour viagra into the food.
The whole bottle of it haha. It made Kijima's body real hot (YES! haha) and...
Kijima apologised for not putting his d**k in her. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So yeah, Kijima is
right - it is love when you care about the girl more than your raging boner
haha. Ao-chan left the school not getting laid, and... I don't think Ao-chan
gets love. Like, really. Stop reading all those sick novels from your dad and
read those normal ones. Oh, she only reads BL? But seriously, what was with that
roleplay swap? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> On a final note, I thought we were real close to even
DomeKano territory but I guess not haha thank goodness this show is trying to
stay clean lmao<br />

I know we are not getting any beach episode in this series (I think) but thanks,
Anime. This is good enough haha. And the first episode about the legs that was
pretty good too lol. In this week's episode (8), it's about the rain.
Specifically, hiding from the rain. We got out stereotypical Anime male
bystander again this time with Momoko once again (lucky guy haha), and... they
both were drenched. Of course the guy isn't ripped so there is nothing to see
there lmao, but the girl. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay it's just as much as the animators could
draw, but you know, we all could use a beating after seeing too much by her now
tied up ponytail haha. The friend Shibumi came to pick her up from the bus stop
where they were which is nice, and... the nice aunty gave the guy her
handkerchief. Haha, all in a day of real life, right? Well, I don't see wet
p***ies often outside when it rains so... maybe I should go out often? lmao<br />

  Mikasa is right man: Armin told you guys to stop Reiner, even if it means
  PUTTING. HIM. DOWN. Oh man I love this episode. In this new episode
  (#AttackOnTitan54) we are getting into the thick of the action at last. Sorry
  for all who had to die to be serious, but the smoke was a good fake for
  whatever best soldier was summoned to take out the Beast Titan, and it was a
  great yet easy plan. Man, I'll watch Levi rip the shit out of War Chief Zeke a
  thousand times (if you see a GIF below of that means I've gotten too much hype
  haha) considering Levi is so Special Potential War Candidate level (recall
  "BLEACH" on the Quincy War) (Levi is like Ichigo lol) he just cleared a war of
  normal sized Titans and the Beast Titan all by himself. If not for the one
  sidekick who took what's left of his regenerating corpse away, Zeke should be
  sitting well with the others. Talking about the others, man is this a hopeful
  episode. Reiner is taken out clean by a plan that failed but surprisingly
  Hange-san isn't dead so yeah it required an unexpected miracle haha, and
  Ber... that Colossal Titan... Armin sacrificed well. I'm not really crying
  over this, but man is this sacrifice so huge it might be the biggest in this
  series. Buying enough time to not of course let Eren fight back because he got
  beat up the one time good last time, but it is enough for him to harden so he
  can get out, fix the hole in the wall as well as get back behind the Titan's
  nape at the same time! Man, so much hype this episode I can't even. Good job,
  everyone. And especially to you, Armin, this episode might be a tribute to
  you. I know there's awesome Levi with his crazy ass sword skills but this one
  I cannot give once again. Armin, you may have helped even, win this war for
  humanity. For that, let's hope Zeke never comes back again (lol obvious
  foreshadowing) and we never have to deal with Titans... or will we have to?
  Looks like the last of confrontation is upon us, looking at the next episode
  preview, and I have a feeling despair might be upon us once again. Hey, they
  didn't put the main objective in the seties titles doesn't mean you can't stop
  feeling it. Despair, I mean. Which will also probably bring us to this point,
  what Levi has from what Kenny left behind last season (still within this
  season but last part technically), and why the remainder of them might have to
  fight over it. Levi's opinion this episode might make some sense of a hint if
  you didn't hear, is that if someone were to consume him or have access to
  Titan powers and consume the ones beaten up that'll literally create a
  superweapon and also, stop these guys from regeneration. But hey, there isn't
  anyone else left, right? So... Levi, you wanna try? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Yeah that's why,
  he's too good of a human to need Titan powers lmao can we save Armin now?

Well, as expected from last week, I didn't do much listening to new songs this
week. So... I gave another song from <b>mol-74's new album</b> which I think you
can hear it on YouTube so be sure to give it a listen yourself, and... probably
one from <b>LuckLife's new single</b>. Yeah. That is as much as I heard with
regards to new songs. New-er songs. Oh well, next week is going to be more fun,
to say the least.<br /><br />Talking about next week, I'll give a quick list so
that I cannot catch a breath, we have: <b>cinema staff's new single</b> for
Anime "Attack on Titan" and their new release (without collaboration) in 2
years, <b>Edoga Sullivan's new EP</b> and <b>Spira Spica's new single</b> for
Anime "Ao-chan", <b>Niitsu Yui's new mini-album</b> in which I probably gave the
topic song by now, and <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new mini-album</b> which I hope
I can give something other than the topic song because I'm most definitely not
in the mood for emotional songs. We shall see. It wasn't great of a first
impression either. Wow, that was a mouthful. So yeah, you can see how intense
this will get haha<br /><br />On other news related to music, my friend got
around to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV2DIW_WjkY" target="_blank"
  ><b>AOP's new song</b></a
>
which I totally don't want to hear for another 10 seconds lol (I'll be kind
enough to leave a link here just in case you like techno sh*t like
<i>those</i> guys lmao), <b>Yuuki Aoi's new music video</b> is weird af because
for starters it doesn't sound like (cute) her at all,
<b>cinema staff released their new music video</b> and it's great even if it's
not in full (I can just listen in Apple Music so I don't care haha), and...
<b>I've been holding back posting about Song of the day stuff on Twitter</b>
regarding mol-74 because I think one of the members is stalking me. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And
if you wondered what I really did this week besides watching Anime, I've been
planning on what to write here about my personal life. I hardly remember about
my dreams thanks to work lol, I can't make Statements all the time, I have no
time to do APoL, so I figured I should write a little more about the stuff I
like from time to time. This weekend I've spent some time sorting out my lovely
bromide (special gifts the size of 3R photos) I've collected all these years
since I first realised I could buy from Japan stores late 2013, and... I'm
totally ready for anyone else I know of (voice actresses especially) to release
anything of that range so I can buy them. I... totally missed Satou Satomi's
collection some years ago before I started because I decided she shouldn't be my
first exception, and now I live to regret it haha. I may not write on this
though, for I have decided to maybe talk about the girls I know thus far, and
before I upgrade my PC and all the timestamp information is potentially lost. If
I have the time I'll do it. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... my
life is boring. I made sure it is so I can laugh at simple things in life.
That's... what I felt when I'm 10 and am literally part of an acting emsemble,
no joke. Until next time then.<br />
