Yes, this is going to set a lot of firsts here, but I want to end "Kawaii Golden
Week Japan" here on a good note, so I chose manga. Ten-chan wasn't cute enough
to do a solo music live review on haha jkjk<br /><br />And if you need a blog
record-breaking list, by posting this I:<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    Broke Entertainment News rules by allowing a Manga Extra to appear BEFORE
    the issue itself, normally Sundays,
  </li>
  <li>
    Reviewed manga again when I said I stopped it almost a month ago. Thii will
    be followed by a couple more in the next couple of months when I support
    directly the first two Japanese manga I read... in Japanese, and,
  </li>
  <li>
    Indirectly inferred that something 2D was cuter than Ten-chan.

  (Sorry, gotta slot in the rule of three there haha) (Then again the first
  could've counted as two)
</div>
<br /><br /><br /><br />WHAT AND WHY<br />So yeah, in case you wonder what I
have left up my sleeve, I bring myself up to finish this manga series I've been
following since I was in secondary (middle) school: Tonari no Kashiwagi-san. As
you may have found out by briefly searching online, English translations have
stopped six chapters before the end, so... I have never seen it for myself.
Until now. MUAHAHAHAHA<br /><br />Let's talk about it haha<br /><br />(For the
sake of completion and easier reference I'll review Volume 12, from Chapter
78)<br /><br /><br />

May I take you back in time, a time where sitting beside a girl in class was a
thing. Sitting beside a girl you like is also a thing, and more so for Yuuto who
actually likes Kashiwagi-san (Kotone, from here on) who is cold towards him but
sits right beside him. Coincidentally, she is one of the 2D artists he follows
online. Drama unfolds, and... coming in to the last volume (79-84) he asked her
out. Aw, so sweet. And she said yes. Aw... okay okay, let's catch up on what
actually happened since we last talked about it here. According to
<a
  href="../../2017/02/the-entertainment-news-2017-edition.html"
  
  >my last review</a
>
of this lovely series 2 years ago, if I didn't remember wrongly, it was like a
year since they just sat next to each other, it was Christmas and Yuuto manned
up to ask her out after some group meeting which I really don't remember. Well,
to go out on dates after entrance exams are over, of course. But yeah, you can
imagine how that could already escalate when your girl says yes and you guys
start studying together already haha. So yeah, it happened to Yuuto, it happened
to his friend Kazuki who doesn't like to study so he had to be coached by her
genius girlfriend Sayaka, and... we said goodbye to side character Tina and her
heck, Japanese boyfriend, people. Coming down, all were good times in this last
volume as they all got accepted to the school of their choice, Yuuto got to go
out with Kotone which he thinks is an ideal date to do couple-like things on
which are just going to the movies and having lunch together? Hey, these are
things couple do too, bro. All in all, at this point Kotone showed way more
initiative than Yuuto (okay Yuuto did hug the girl) as they both bravely face
the joys of their maiden relationship, and that just makes me want to die of
diabetes because they so sweet I can't even SHE EVEN GAVE HIM A KISS!!!

Looking back, I still think this is a great story. Firstly, because I can
remember major events. Kazuki struggled to meet the father who protects the
daughter after the divorce, struggled to deal with Sayaka herself (I mean, she's
the perfect example of a tsundere WHICH I LOVE haha), and... struggled to deal
with his own feelings too, and that changed real fast when they got together.
For Yuuto, we know that he is kind of a timid person and admits to making
mistakes just by speaking up (lol), but yeah, on the other hand Kotone has been
real forgiving for the mistakes he makes. Giving him chance, that's what that
is. The two guys both had hardships to deal with to get to where they are today,
and I'm glad for them as I feel so many emotions from the plot itself. Then, we
talk about production. The author Shimotsuki Kinusa chose a lighter and simpler
theme to go with on the plot, so as with my simplistic expectations at that
time... (if I could remember when I started I will tell you) this was a perfect
story to dive into. Getting into the momentum is important though, and of
course, getting to the plot twist where you link the girl to her online
profile... you know, these kinds of stuff. Simple, straightforward, but super
cringy and it makes you happy it had a happy ending. It was a series that I got
into real fast back then when I was finding manga to read because Anime is
boring haha<br /><br />

Lastly, and I think this deserves another paragraph, is how it did not get an
adaptation. In my life this was the second story that did not have a proper
adaptation, following "GE - Good Ending" in which nothing happened evn after the
story ended. (FYI the same author later wrote "Domestic na Kanojo" which, you
may have known, is an Anime last season) For this series, it had a brief moment
in Manga 2.5, a sort of half-animated manga series (thus the name) in which I
guess they just cut down the pages and emote them with... you guessed it, full
voice casting! Actually, that was quite a joy to watch back then, and I believe
it's still available, in Crunchyroll probably. Takagaki Ayahi (voiced Kotone)
and Iguchi Yuka (voiced Sayaka) probably fulfilled my wishes for the series, and
as much as we didn't get a full fledged show, this was still really fulfilling,
in a sense. I'm seriously trying to find references to my own blogs here...
okay, earliest mention of this was in 2011 (man) (the author did mention a
7-year production which started in 2009) where I was already reading some "40
odd chapters" of the series already. Translated, of course. I couldn't read
anything without translations back then. But today. I'm kinda proud of myself
for even being able to understand more than half of what the original work had
to offer, and totally regretted not getting into this sooner. Still, sorry
Kinusa-sensei, I can hardly take cringe now because of my age (and work life
lol), but yes, this is a promise that I will (1) get this series online along
with the two I mentioned above of the post as a tribute to this personal
favourite of mine, and (2) I will try to follow up on your newest work where...
the series continues!! This is not a joke. No translations online AFAIK, so...
we're going raw! Yes, everyone. I'll update here if I can find any sources to
read for free online (it's a thing now but for latest chapters)<br /><br />

P.S. If I'm dating with someone and she wants to give me a reward for like, my
hard work for studying for exams, I'll take a selfie. Edited to perfection.
<span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> (No, just her alone, not with me because I can't bear to see my ugly
a** face lmao) (Audience: What makes you think your girl will look attractive to
you?) (Ugh...)<br /><br />P.P.S. The author is right here, by the way:<br />

(Goddamn, did I say I wanted to talk about every manga author I liked when Anime
"Honda-san" aired? Ugh, I hate myself now)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And this
concludes "Kawaii Golden Week Japa- I think I got enough of this title how the
heck can Japanese write such long titles for their Anime?? <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> (*looks at
AV <strike>titties</strike> titles* haha) So yeah, I don't do this for weekends
because I don't have the stamina (also referred to as "content") to carry on, so
don't expect one tomorrow. This is technically just a tribute and is cute, so
I'm just following the theme. Cya guys on Sunday.<br /><br />Note to self: Even
after skipping half of two out of seven chapters, it only took 20mins. You are
improving. Remember to keep a dictionary nearby for books that won't have
hiragana annotations (those are for younger audience typically) and for
vocabulary haha
