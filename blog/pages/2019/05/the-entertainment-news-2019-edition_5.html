Man, that was a good work break. And if you missed out whatever happened I did
this week before the weekend because you only knew I updated "Attack on Titan"
and didn't see it until the Reiwa Era, you have been missing out haha<br /><br />Anyways,
I did a post daily for 5 days over here, talking about cute things which is
mainly just three music videos, Ibuki-chan's new photobook and a manga, in the
aptly named "Kawaii Golden Week Japan" series I don't intend to tag so yeah,
just click back to see them.<br /><br />Let's begin. I have been relaxing and
doing back-end stuff for Klassic Note and playing too much idle phone games
(okay for this I need to stop) that I didn't spend enough time to do what I
want? Well, I read some Kuroshitsuji and there is hope. Hey, Ciel is not going
to lose without a fight. Or at least, <i>he</i> isn't fighting haha okay let's
get to the interesting stuff lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Okay, I promise I'm just watching this on a whim haha. Thanks to Kido Ibuki's
introduction of her first role in her photobook (review
<a
  href="../../2019/05/fifth-book-worth-of-photos-tsundere-who.html"
  >here</a
>) I decide to take a look and... I think I'm already disappointed. Story goes
(ignoring backstory) that Akiko has moved in to live with her twin brother after
being separated for 6 years (we're not going to touch on why) and... she has a
brother complex. Thank goodness it's not those that take action first as she
still politely asks for permission to hug or kiss him which makes this a very
good show for brocon jokes but I swear this won't make me watch it. The drop
probably happened for me the moment the brother said the word "dormitory" which
should easily indicate that he couldn't possibly live in such a large abode and
will have other occupants who will, no doubt, get in the way of their sibling
relationship haha. I would argue at this point I believe that even as her first
role, Kido Ibuki has proven herself to be born an Anime imouto role since the
beginning lol, which kind of explains why her subsequent roles are also similar
haha. All in all, I can see the antics coming, but considering this is a joke
show in itself, I doubt it'll get crazy ecchi or even hentai scenes like those
shows I rather not mention which shamefully I watched (the water in the bath in
this show is real clear though tbh haha), but yeah, not watching it, even with
the lovely imouto voicing. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay, it was hard to reject this show,
okay? But I only liked like, half this first episode so I wonder how long I can
go if I do watch it lol. Also, not giving Chihara Minori her first song in
Klassic Note. No, damn, way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's get back to normal shows like foxes
lmao<br />

In this new episode (#SenkoSan04) Senko-san teaches us what it means to not rely
on technology. Well for starters, you won't be able to wake up on time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
Well, that was an underestimation, 'cos Nakano didn't even wake up for work.
(Okay I assume this is those things that you can appear in office if you have
work so being absent doesn't get you penalised. I guess he's just hardworking?)
(Or else how can he be so calm? lol) So yeah firstly, Nakano replaces his phone
alarm clock that usually will wake him up. Not that Senko-san isn't a reliable
mother (lmao) (sorry mom!), but then again we are kind of reminded of how much
Senko likes to pamper Nakano, so when even he says give him 5 minutes she'll
take it for real as if not doing otherwise is possible. I mean, why such a crude
way to wake up, Senko-san? Because if we don't there will be no way to wake this
guy up lol. So yeah, he's probably fired haha. Next up, is a more generic
overview of people who can't use machines. I don't believe there aren't that
many people out there like this now, but considering Senko-san hardly will use
such things with the power of fox fire (hey I wished I had that power lol), she
instead decides to give it a try. Ignoring her powers to improve the rainy day
lol, she instead decides not to rely on her deity powers to do housework for a
day. It just... fired back at her real fast at some point. Good thing the
electric breaker tripped or else I think the neighbour can help call the fire
department haha. Again, not her fault, but it might be her fault for using them.
I mean, no one will blame you for not keeping up with technology, is the thing
I'm trying to say. No really, we still have to fall back on primitive approaches
when machines fail anyways, and we can't even say when they will break down. So
don't mind, Senko-san. Nakano hardly does any cleaning so you're already doing
him a favour lol. We also got a preview of what might happen next, as Senko has
proven to be ineffective in improving Nakano's life, so another one might be
coming into the fray. Who and what will be done to the already lucky man? We
shall see it for ourselves soon.<br />

Oh wow, thanks for the REAL season preview haha. But seriously, you think it's
that easy? Like, an ability list? Who keeps that shit with another person?
<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the new episode (#BungouStrayDogs29) kickstarts the official
season after the flashback arc, on a character we actually know if you (or I
have) watched the movie adaptation. His name is Fyodor, and if you cannot
remember his ability, I can't either haha. Anyways, it's considered as secret
since he also didn't reveal anything in the movie besides being an onlooker, but
hey, that's all we need to know. We welcome the death of a villian real fast
this season with newly introduced Port Mafia "Executive" Ace - who if you have
watched the episode could hardly be referred to as one - to take Fyodor in after
he has been "kidnapped" and in a cell. Hey, I guess it's all according to his
plan, after Ace thought of as many ways to make sure this leader of another
organisation doesn't leave. But hey, being too smart for yourself might have
backfired at this juncture. Ace "learnt" of the ability of Fyodor only to know
to be duped and thought of suicide in order to escape his ability space... and
he died for real haha. What an idiot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Again, do more research, man.
Although I would thank you in place of everyone in Port Mafia because you didn't
let them be harmed in the process of taking Fyodor in. However, you might have
f**ked it up and just dumped them in the waters now that someone outisde has all
the information? I highly doubt that is the bible but let's assume it is now
haha. (I mean, if only the ability names are there it's still considered a list
haha) How Fyodor came to know of such a list is a mystery (like seriously, who
writes all of these down besides this series' author?), but yeah, we have a new
enemy in town, Yokohama stray dogs. This is going to be fun.<br />

"Horie's body is beautiful." That's all the confirmation we need bro!! Says her
father haha. In the new episode (#AoChan05) where nothing much happened, we go
back to that one place where Kijima is ready to go to a love hotel with Miyabi.
Nothing happened, no joke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, as we all can see, Ao-chan is
worried for everything. So even though nothing much happened, she keeps thinking
something happened, and... fainted in the bath. I'm not sure if this is spying
or just Kijima dropped by her place lol but, at least the dad is around haha.
And after talking to each other, Ao-chan is pleased to hear that this normie is
a virgin, and got all happy about it. "I'm smarter than him now" lmao Ao-chan
that just makes you all the more of a bi- Anyways, she helps her out with his
English assignment becaue that one book written by her dad under another one of
his aliases is not great lol (and that's how he keeps his career going I guess,
writing for various genres), and... Kijima starts wondering if the girl is not a
virgin haha. I mean, with all assumed knowledge of sex and everything (even if
it's from books) a virgin is still a virgin, bro. As with all of us, I guess.
(If you aren't please leave now) I think now I do feel like some part of the
narrative is missing, whether if it's from the original manga or not I won't
find out (since I only read the first chapter), but still, like the flashback to
Miyabi and Ao-chan as kids they haven't really explained or unlikely we'll get a
childhood episode because the show length is so short. Oh well, if they ever do
please make it good. As of now everything is awesome (I'm starting to like the
dad now lmao), but I just hope they can conclude the story enough to satisfy all
who watch this... technically 6-episode Anime. (I clippped more screens than the
two shows above combined lol)<br />

Hmm in this week's episode (#Joshikausei05) we talk about skateboards, and if
you aren't interested in it this video may trigger your interest haha. Anyways,
the girls are on the way home, Momoko saw a skateboard and started playing with
it. As usual moving too fast in a schoolgirl outfit will get you into some kind
of trouble lmao, so they just sat on it. Accidents happened that I rather not
mention because the glasses girl probably knew it was dumb, but the girls had a
lot of fun out of it. Remember when the world liked skateboards instead of video
games? Hey, just saying. All in all, another short episode which makes me really
think about whether I should watch this on a weekly basis because really, it's
way too short. Even manga reviews will be longer than this, some of them. Well I
guess images speak better than words, so here are some of the highlights of this
episode haha<br />

  Man, so much action, I thought I was watching another not sad show about
  titans haha. The new episode (#AttackOnTitan51) progresses the fight in a
  battle of wits. Yeah, the moment the Scouts noticed they were dealing with a
  couple of tacticians, they gotta use their brains and be fully prepared of the
  fight now. So yeah, no thoughts of leaving, Erwin? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Erwin did
  think way ahead in this battle, and now knowing that the objective of the
  enemy is to surround them and not allow them to leave in any case and you
  know, slowly tire them to their deaths and taking Eren when he's weak, they
  gotta think of a better counter of a plan. So yeah, firstly, to protect their
  escape. Well, not that that have to now that I say it like that, but yeah, at
  least the enemy still thinks so. It was enough to trick now Titan form Reiner
  into following Eren who he believes is making an escape which will make the
  battle meaningless, is then engaging him in a fight once again. As reminded by
  Eren, he would have won if not for super big titan Ber- Berd- I give up haha.
  That guy (haha), who somehow stopped him with his titan presence, so now
  everyone is playing safe by staying away from the walls so we don't have to
  witness a lucky chance victory from the enemy again. To add on, the Scouts
  have a secret weapon up their sleeve. It's explosive, it's powerful, and it
  did damage to an Armoured Titan. Hey, what era are they in? Is this even
  allowed? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, after much explanation and the risks it might occur
  now that they fired it in succession much faster and more&nbsp; with respect
  to the first which blew some of them away, let's hope this won't result in
  casualties. We shall see. Although there is good hope that even if Reiner
  didn't manage to break his nape with all this explosions, Eren might be able
  to deal the final blow. I just hope he does, we can't let emotions get in the
  way now. Oh yeah Eren is heartless when it comes to his hometown, that's for
  sure.<br />

This week has been a "mellow" week in Klassic Note. I guess that's what happens
if you take breaks haha. Anyways, updated NEGOTO's best album (also their last)
with 1 new song and two others I didn't give in the past, as seen from the start
of this paragraph. Other than that... I didn't listen to anything new. I'm
serious. I really took the week off.<br /><br />Next week brings us a couple of
releases I've been waiting for a while. Firstly is
<b>sphere's new album</b> after like, 2 years? Probably more than that if I
meant album, but yeah. Not that it'll break any new ground, but I just hope
there are good songs in there lol. No really, the previews aren't making the
album look good. Also, <b>GRANRODEO's new single</b> for Anime "Bungo Stray
Dogs", and... from the preview it sounds fine, so I hope it stays that way when
it gets extrapolated. Not going to jump into their upcoming album literally
releasing the week after, but hey, we shall see. New releases are scarce in
Klassic Note recently so I might just do it. Their style isn't bad tbh (and when
I say that I meant their melodies suck haha)<br /><br />On news all over the
Internet including Twitter, <b>cinema staff's new song</b> is available for
listen after the new "Attack on Titan" episode aired and... it's not terrible to
say the least (their single releases end of the month), and no surprises that
<b>Ohara Yuiko will sing Anime "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san"</b> opening theme
song for their new season. Yay. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To be frank the first wasn't impressive
though, I barely gave it a pass. Okay one more for the rule of three, and is
that in deeply searching for&nbsp;<b
  >new songs available for Apple Music Japan</b
>
many artists previously not seen - Younha's early days in Japan, LITTLE
CREATURES, Yuuki Aoi as of new label, ALTIMA etc. - are out there now. When they
put these in, I don't know. But I know I'm going to enjoy their presence.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's
it I guess. I still have a lot to do though, after just doing the one thing
which is (not going to be secretive here) creating data for calculating
availability of songs on Apple Music and JOYSOUND, Japan's biggest karaoke
software which has a phone app and it's harder to export data from there to be
honest. But yeah, I found out some fundamental problems with my song list so I
may have to fix those. Also, I noticed my old blogs are rotting so bad I need to
fix them at least aesthetically. So yeah, will be trying those out in the next
few weeks. Been testing out on this blog's predecessor today all day after
watching Anime. Until next time guys, I gotta go back and play my idle phone
game haha<br />
