You know what that means...<br /><br />I'm sorry if thisone came out late, but I got bored and watched another YouTuber play simulationgames and I can't stop laughing lol. Anyways, a lot of things are going tochange after the awesome holiday in-lieu tomorrow ie. my phone number so I hopethat'll make me real busy dealing with everyone who will be shocked of my numberchange which is nobody haha<br /><br />I need to ask the one colleague whochanged his phone number how he did it for WhatsApp... okay let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SenkoSan06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It's somehow heartwarming... just watching her is fun" Literally me    watching every idol I know of haha  </div></blockquote>Now that I look at it, this guy's spending his days off WAAAAY better than mineeven if I like, hug around with my photobooks lmao. In this new episode(#SenkoSan06) Nakano continues to enjoy being aside a couple of fox deities, andthat is the life, people. You wished that was the life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yes, Shirocame to visit again, and literally just fighting over<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ohagi" target="_blank">ohagi</a> with Nakano,used a fighting video game (not going to talk about the super inconspicuousreferences here) (yes it's a reference to PS4 and Super Mario Bros Ultimatehaha) to win over Senko-san's cooking, and yeah, Shiro won every time becauseother than Nakano didn't really have the time to play the game even if he didplay a lot as a kid (it probably got rusty after a while), she also cheated.Yes, she read his mind. F**king cheater. (I want to bring in last season Anime"Kaguya-sama"&nbsp; Ishigami to shame her but nah, haha) Anyways, Nakano lookingat her eat might be already a joy, so he's okay skipping afternoon tea snackshaha. Hey, says a lot about idolism these days too, so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The secondhalf is what I kind of expected, Senko-san visiting Enouji's place. Becausereally, she could use some help, being busy with her college and manga artiststuff. So yeah, Senko-san helped clean up her place (by using her spiritualpowers so it can be done faster) (cue Ishigami shame on cheaters scene againlol) while she gets to eat her lunch in like, a week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like seriously,girl, you have a rack so take care of it haha. She returns the favour by givingSenko-san an outfit Enouji probably won't use since it's for reference... it's amaid outfit haha. Hey, gotta put up with the cosplay fluke you're setting here,Senko-san. (And like, Enouji thinks you guys are married lol) So yeah, she cute,Enouji is satisfied with those photos she can now upload online because not likeSenko-san knows of Internet privacy lol, but yeah, I'm sure this helped her outto some extent, the college student. And... Senko-san thought this was someromance comedy, so she wore it for Nakano to see too. Whatever dude, Nakano isnot that into maids haha okay I take my words back Nakano is a programmer by dayso he's MOST DEFINITELY a NEET haha it's not just guys Senko-san lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rQxmJhY2OoI/XODDtRz76kI/AAAAAAAAxEc/NT2sDuTBZAAX-sF5_VkUkJCLcaGvMSTkACLcBGAs/s320/senkosan06_gallery.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            You're not a Senko-san fan until you went to her photo shoot event            lol<br />(Can we have one too but of Waki Azumi cosplaying as a fox?

(haha sorry    forgot your name) (ah, it's Tanizaki)  </div></blockquote>That was... quite an intro lol so much agreement in this from Atsushi and KyoukaI can't even <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs31) if you didn'tfeel that this show will get anywhere close to a romance comedy, think againhaha. This week, we are presented with two more stories as Fyodor takes anotherweek off his supposed work schedule for appearing in this series lmao. Firstly,it's about Kyouka-chan. Hey, sorry for not thinking that the supposed mother inPort Mafia is behind this because I keep thinking it must be the now bad guy weare talking about (well technically Kyouya is also a bad guy, but still) buthey, we can talk about this kind of stuff once in a while. We drag Lucy in so wecan do some harem story, but most importantly, besides her screwing up thesearch of this one briefcase of a job, Kyouka-chan found a document whichdescribes her past, as dictated perfectly by the government. So yeah, her fatherwas a retired spy, and the mother was an Ability user whom which Kyoukainherited from imperfectly (the reason why the phone was the trigger instead ofjust doing it instinctively) and... one day an assassination attempt on theparents was successful. With enough time to save the kid, the parents werekilled by the Ability and the mother left the only gift she can give her despiteit being the worst thing ever probably, it's the Ability. Hey, who saysAbilities can't be kind after they killed your parents? (lol) But yeah, if youlike to extrapolate, Kyouka probably had no where to go considering even thegovernment wouldn't help her as they had to cover this secret, so she "got takenin" by Port Mafia. The rest, is as you have known. Next, we have another similarstory but I wouldn't call him a parent, is Atsushi's case of knowing that theheadmaster in which the "lab" he was in as an orphan... He's dead, in a caraccident. Ranpo-san probably intentionally gave him the case and with his"Ability" figured out it was related to Atsushi, so it didn't take very long forhim to realise how much of a piece of sh*t and how much of a "parent" he was tohim during his time in Hell as a kid. (Don't even bring in "Yakusoku noNeverland" references in here, please) Yeah, Dazai is totally right on this one.The guy was shit, it was Hell, but it was also him that told Atsushi to (1) notblame himself for his past and (2) <strike>do good</strike> not be evil. Andwhat turned out to be just a visit to celebrate Atsushi's newfound job (lol) (noexperience required haha) after leaving the place became one coincidentaldisaster in which the weretiger wished the old man is alive now. Hey, good onyou, Atsushi. Now at least you can get your past truly buried, along with theguy of course. This episode is sad, it's happy, it's really funny when it is(lol Lucy), and man do I not want these short stoies to end. Covering so manyplot holes, this truly is a show trying to salvage itself before the newopponent rages. We shall see what more we have on board, I guess. Just... tellme which ship it is, yes? Don't give me a document torn off a page and tell meto search all boats on the nearby pier haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hloRKd3TH4g/XODORMLcNPI/AAAAAAAAxEs/pqLYmENg7F8DetRpQiNu8-F1pZeN6t8lgCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs31_nude.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I never thought this show would have nude scenes but here we are            haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dagAFczuvss/XODOSGanoMI/AAAAAAAAxEw/Nn_jnUZa_84KjO7nmGXT1WFJQDBYBlQlwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs31_killed.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The mother is so cool I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. It seems like next week is about the rich guy from the Guild. So we may yetbe covering more backstory after the Moby Dick incident, but now on the opponentparty. Man, this show is so comforting to watch now, I only got hyped on theDemon Snow killing all the assassins in this week's episode lol<br />P.P.S. Lucyin Bungou Stray Dogs is better than whatever Kana-chan acts in Hanayome. There,I said it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Must be the slight tsun or the nude scene lol or maybe weare in yandere territory with Kyouka already I don't know lmao so many feelingsand none of it is crying for the headmaster haha)<br />[As a final note, Ireally am interested in how Kafuka-sensei thinks of all these Abilitiesconsidering I only learnt off BLEACH and mine aren't as impressive as an Abilitythat leeches off someone's blood and does mind control man wtf this is so cool!!haha]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AoChan07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;">      Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</span    >  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "He's different from a male celebrity" lol I'd like to assume Ao-chan that    you have NO IDEA how pecs work on men haha #MaleStererotypes (okay maybe    she's into those South Korean skinny gays lmao)  </div></blockquote>*hears opening intro* Uh... Ao-chan are you okay?? Haha truly living the titleof this episode (#AoChan07) I suppose. Good for you, girl. You have truly becomeone<strike>desperate</strike> depraved woman at last haha. Didn't take very long,isn't it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In the new episode which I stated the episode number already,we're at the beach!! Yay!! Uh, I mean, we're here for the study group, right?Funny how it all went to the drain when Ao-chan didn't even notice it was heldon a hotel near the beach. So yeah, she sat on the beach instead of somewherefar away from that happy place lol she technically chose the beach over thestudy group. Sorry, dad! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I'm sure the father will forgive the daughteron burning his money away like this) ("It's for the future, dad" lmao)Unfortunately, this three-hour time gap ahead of time that Ao-chan gave herselfto revise and redeem herself over the pathetic results she got in her term examsare ruined, mainly by the presence of Miyabi and Kijima, who are here fordifferent reasons. Whatever the case, three hours is plenty of time to playbefore the meet, so yeah, Ao-chan kind of gave in. She is so easy right now Ican't even <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, she got herself a swimsuit which shows off herassets, went to the sea alone with Kijima to probably ask for something shewould never expect to be done on considering Kijima doesn't think like this butshe does (again, she depraved, bruh), and... got trolled by Miyabi who cut aslit on her bra strap to make sure it'll give way at some point. And it did. (<a  href="https://g.co/kgs/fSq7NP"  target="_blank"  >*pinky finger on lip*</a>lmao) So yeah, good job Miyabi for making her the real culprit for Ao-chan'sabsence for the study group, and I just hope the dad doesn't lose the rest ofhis hair over this haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JsJufCZzU_8/XODro64LMVI/AAAAAAAAxFI/cG3GG7k_Ev0ipjaMRJgQGia5NdH3ekX8gCLcBGAs/s320/aochan07_pecs.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How girls look at my front when I was 14 haha no joke          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rwGxMjemR0U/XODsL9j60GI/AAAAAAAAxFY/03bnvVvMWG4H3_QOccDIr4QTgykAINazwCLcBGAs/s320/aochan07_touch.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            They technically doing it already, I would argue (lol #NotPorno)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

This new episode (#Joshikausei07) talks aboutcold weather, and if you expect this country which is one degree north of theequator to have any snowing you've got another thing coming haha. Anyways,Momoko was cold, sad in the classroom and more importantly, bored looking out atthe snow, so she decided to play with her friends. In case you have never triedthis before, due to the properties of condensation of warm air (ie. your warmbreath) over a freezing or cold surface (the glass panel of the window) willcause rapid cooling and create a layer of water on the surface, allowing one todraw over it to create a two-tone drawing, kind of like if you draw on a pieceof paper with just a pencil. So yeah, the girls got excited and started playingwith it, eventually filling up the classroom with it, which is technically justone side as the other side is just the corridor which is not cold enough maybe,the front is the chalkboard (damn, so backwards haha), and the back is typicallya notice board, in case you wonder how a Japan classroom looks like. So yeah,the joke here is that the teacher came in, placed the kettle on the heater (goGoogle yourself for examples, or just watch the show haha) and steam start tocome out from it, heating up the window panels and also revealing the drawingsthat have faded away due to the cooling effect of the environment. Not until youhave a constant supply of steam haha. Bigger problem here is, Momoko wrote hername on it, so... yeah the three got to clean the windows after school haha whatan idiot lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5Y_k9i17aKQ/XODvbn_iagI/AAAAAAAAxFs/ZHfPAiAaD5sgkDrEsOOHbkJLCpTheCVVQCLcBGAs/s320/joshikausei07_shibumi.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            What she thinks it is haha we gonna get boys this series? lol<br />(Shibumi            is the girl's name here btw)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6D5pX880lpg/XODva8cP4zI/AAAAAAAAxFw/YTIci-GAjvglgR-McFAuj8isfuERz-xhACEwYBhgL/s320/joshikausei07_aiaigasa.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            What it actually is<br />(It's Momoko X            <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shougayaki" target="_blank"              >fried pork with ginger</a            >            btw)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><br /><div style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid var(--foreground); padding: 4px 8px;">  [Update 2019.05.20: Yes because it's a holiday in-lieu and I got time to do  this. Let's finish this so I can think of how to write APoL maybe] <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan53">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Attack on Titan Season 3 Part.2</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      In case you didn't get Conny's joke about Eren's house being destroyed, he      was saying "Eren      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ie" target="_blank">ie</a> ga...!!" as      the family name was pronounced lol best joke this season    </div>  </blockquote>  Wow Armin you really pussied out real fast there after gaining some Erwin  attention, huh. Well then again, <strike>he</strike> she was right about  reading the enemy wrongly so... yeah, bad times, man. In the new episode  (#AttackOnTitan53), we are near doomsday. I know it's happening within a few  hours in the story, but for us is weeks of torture haha. Anyways, what  happened. Armin is shocked by the appearance of the Colossal Titan. Again,  they had an idea to fight Reiner but not the super huge Titan that can just  swing Eren's Titan form to his death? I mean, what a way to die, people.  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, it really looks like despair is on our side again, as the  guys led by Jean is not going to make them win at any rate, considering the  Colossal Titan is just heading to the walls to corner what's left of the  humans. Well done, War Chief Zeke. You've done well in assuring their deaths.  On the other hand, Erwin and Levi aren't going to stare at the Beast Titan  along with the newbie Scouts (poor things haha) (should've stayed in town to  face the shaming lol) and witness their own deaths, so Erwin decided on one  last stand. Which is literally sending them to their deaths, as some or most  of the newbies discovered, but hey, Erwin wasn't wrong. It's only the living  who will remember the deaths of many (maybe), knowing humanity is saved from a  calamity from the Titans and would once see their hometown within the walls  again. It was not a small sacrifice, to say the least. It may be dumb, to see  their chances of survival. But that is war, man. That's all that is. (I wonder  how many war reference materials the author read before writing this series  haha) It's as stupidly simple therefore, on Erwin's orders, that they run the  horses as distraction firing the smoke guns hoping not to die by the rock  showers that the Beast Titan is raining down at them while Levi goes in for  the kill. You think it'll work? We shall see next week. On the other hand,  even if they succeeded, it'll be done by the Colossal Titan though, so yeah,  RIP everyone, I guess. Or maybe the death of the Beast Titan will ensure  Bertholdt will stop his actions? Sounds like a plan, but we gotta get rid of  that Beast first. And from the next episode preview... no spoilers, I guess.  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, this show is getting intense. To end this, I just feel bad that  Erwin will not be able to know about the truth of that basement as he  sacrifices for humanity after living twice as long compared to those newbies  who don't even know the truth and think they are just dying in war. Pathetic,  isn't it? RIP Erwin, I can say that first before next episode.<br />  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RdC9RfHP_es/XOIQlE8YpmI/AAAAAAAAxG8/kopEHfC3VJY1j-Ktq4cn-pAf9npzFAu_ACLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan53_stones.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              MFW I realised how good AND bad the animation can be lol            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZS8hiK5xwfA/XOIQmt7rq4I/AAAAAAAAxHA/eBNL3aq-bh4I6sDYl_nlTcoVHil0NNSJQCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan53_levi1.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              MFW I realised how good AND bad the animation can be lol            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

"We can stake our heroic deaths for a chance of victory" Hey, when you go back  defeated the people will only complain, so why not die and win this for once,  eh? Ah then again Erwin lost an arm already, so...</div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This was quite a week in Klassic Note, as mentioned last week, and thankgoodness last week's stuff caught up, so let's talk about all of them. Ignoring<b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</b> which is a flop for me imo (Igenuinely don't want to give the verses for BOTH A-sides),<b>Kawano Marina's new single</b> isn't exactly fantastic (I totally forgot thesongs aren't written by her) (uh oh) so I just gave the topic song, I'm moreinto the mood for <b>Scenarioart's new digital single</b> even though it's nottechnically official (as it is only sold in live events) and also because Iwasn't in the mood to hear it in the first place, so... I guess they dragged meinto their world so I'm giving another song other than the topic song. Thanks,guys. Haven't had this feeling in years haha.<b>GRANRODEO's new single</b> almost hit the shelves I swear but I decided togive the B-side a miss (aw...) haha, and <b>LuckLife's new single</b>... let'ssay I'll give one of the two B-sides a chance. We shall see. And no, notlistening to GRANRODEO's new album which released this week. I'm not that intothem haha<br /><br />Next week brings us... nothing, but the following week willbe a battlefield for mainstream and Anime artists alike, so for now I could usea break. Well, I've been lazy in giving and listening to songs already, so Ithink I should catch up. For example, <b>mol-74's new album</b> finally surfacedonline (not on Apple Music though) and I think I can give a couple more songs.Their usual style isn't the best I will give them, but they aren't bad. That'sas much as I can promise. I only took the hype train like, twice, so I don'tknow how it feels now that I can give a couple more songs from the album. I'llconfirm next week. This, and LuckLife.<br /><br />On the Internet this week,<b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's new song</b> is... surprisingly mediocre sothat's a good start lol. Hmm, that's it, huh. Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thisis it, I guess. I'm not a man who likes to drag on stuff (ignore the length ofthis post please) (do not ignore, on the other hand, the sweet "go to top"button that was added this week) so I shall stop here since there isn't much totalk about in Klassic Note already. I would like to spend tomorrow's holiday(in-lieu) doing up APoL, but I know I'll end up not doing it anyway haha. I'lltry, I'll try. YouTube is too much for me and my attention for music and isrobbing me of those times. Maybe using the Surface Pro to type on APoL withmusic playing on the main PC will trigger my past memories of writing this novelI intend to finish in my lifetime. Cya guys next week then, and until nexttime... stay healthy. This weekend has been so much fast food on me I feel likedying haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
