My left eye is twitching for some reason I don't know why I thoughtit's because I'm getting lucky but it's been like this all weekend and all I'vewon is in-game (lol) and I'm not rich yet so it might be an issue maybe I shouldgo see a doctor or TCM or something okay LET'S START<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS209">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "So, as punishment... let's play again" Don't you love Takagi-san? With this    much of a condescending attitude? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>Come on Nishikata. Where are we in this series already? Just nod because youlike the girl. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#TakagiSanS209) of the secondseason of this still amazing series which displays how dumb Nishikata can be,because like every day he is always prepared to have a showdown with Takagi eventhough we know he will lose every time lol. Okay, I love myself some plotprogression maybe over here, so let's talk about it. Firstly, he (generically)learns from what was taught on TV. Sorry, "again". <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, he decidedto do the "acchi muite hoi" thing (just Google it or watch the episode) onTakagi thinking that she would involuntarily react to his questions before hedoes the pointing? Nice try, Nishikata. Sadly technically I learnt that only athigh school so I'll let you win on that haha. The point is more on that one willdo a physical action to emphasise on the words they are saying, such asagreement in this example. So yeah, Takagi did the smart thing by not doing so(I'm sure you also can once you've been duped haha) and then using it back onNishikata who of course, can't stop himself from loving her. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Next, wegot the trio again! This time, by the pool. Yukari-chan is ironically, scared ofwater yet can't stand the heat. I think you can go die now you have no hopelmao. Unlike me, Mina-chan decided to help her to not lose hope, and think ofwhat she is actually good at. Because we know Sanae can run, and Mina can cook,just in case you guys don't know. But hey, Yukari-chan, I know what you're goodat. You're good at being envious of people in love lol. Moving on, the day hascome. I didn't expect it to come anytime soon and I'm sure it happened before,but hey, it has happened. A day when Takagi didn't tease him once at all. HEMISSES IT THOUGH!!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Besides the tsundere boy getting on my nerves (Ionly respond to females btw, the tsundere thing) we also found out that she gotinto a quarrel with her mom, which will explain why she is down in the morningat school instead of teasing the lucky boy lol, and not going home early becauseshe probably hasn't thought of a way to apologise to the mother. Hey, Nishikata,you can't read someone's face and ask "Are you okay?" instead, don't you?<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I will, by the way. Well, at least you brought a present to cheer herup. It might be a fail, but she laughed so I guess you win for once. And yes, ifyou missed that sweet moment when she asks him to stay for a while more... Ithink I got diabetes haha okay not yet. This last one though, in this episode,might have sent me to A&amp;E haha. So lastly, the couple is messaging.Nishikata is messaging about random stuff like Kimura's<strike>butt</strike> arm lol, and Takagi messaged about how she settled thingswith the mother. You know, just updating things to your prospective partner tolet him know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (I used to have such days, I forgot) (I'm so envious ofyou right now Nishikata) And then Takagi did the casual survey about hispreferences and I tell you, I can come up with better replies on those, no joke.I'll say "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sute-ki" target="_blank">suteki</a>wa <a href="https://jisho.org/search/suteki" target="_blank">suteki</a>" whenshe asks if I like steak, ask what she meant when she asks if I like heartmark(and that's why I'm boring compared to the boy), and probably die over seeingTakagi send me a video of her saying she likes me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh damn, this oneyou win, boy. Also, in all seriousness, I'll send back an image of myself when Idon't blush which I probably don't have so I'll avoid the subject by sending hera butt arm haha. (Yes the lack of strike was intentional) I know flirting is athing middle schoolers do in Japan probably, but every episode I watch justmakes me think back of the times where I was popular and girls may like me Idon't know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well, Nishikata, at least Takagi is enjoying it lmaoalso stop describing my childhood with this Anime I feel hurt haha okay it's notthere's no teasing involved<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AIzsPb7Nz04/XXSbJLa5EwI/AAAAAAAA0Ow/KFUJOZUYgUIwIpLtKgDBVr7FJMH8ZD-nQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS2_09_video.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            TFW I get a video message from my girl oh I wish I wasn't in ADSL            times lmao          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hPMN81vUvGQ/XXSbKHBQWtI/AAAAAAAA0O0/81m130QtrgUm0BzN9NSCquYkTLMCF5d2ACLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS2_09_hitokako.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            It also looks like a pair of boobs without the nips Kimura so I            think you should take it down haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Not Takagi will be like "You know I can find a way to make sure you lose,right?" and stop Nishikata from playing? I doubt it'll work but haha<br />P.P.S.

My companions were peeking at more amazing holes" Haha you're not wrong    Kazusa HONGO NO lol  </div></blockquote>"You could just practice on me" Oh God what have gone into Sugawara you aren'tmy type but still. In this new episode (#AraOto10) uh oh Kazusa is doing aHongo-san now searching for thongs lmao. Okay, man is the progression here goingon real fast every week, so we gotta cover all grounds before this all explodesin another two weeks. Ready? Okay. Firstly, from last week. Oh God we reallyshouldn't talk about Sugawara now, but hey, let's talk Izumi first. To the guy,he may have touched Sugawara's butt, he may have gotten a boner (I mean, Iwould) (haha maybe), but most importantly? He didn't like the girl. If it's notobvious enough to you all Izumi's reaction is what we call "you're not my type",but to Sugawara... she doesn't get it, I guess. Again, most of them don't evenwatch romance drama, by the way, just so you know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Jokes aside, I guessIzumi is the kind of guy who likes to be simple, is only into porno probablyjust because he feels alone (just go Google and find out why people masturbateand you know) (and no I'm not dropping in my two cents lol), and really likesthe pure feeling he might have experienced recently known as love. With his ownchildhood friend. Quoting from Kazusa, yep things are going fine... not until hedoesn't wish to hold your hand on the streets. That, she may have a tough lessonto learn of the truth in the near future. Skipping Kazusa who is literally justenjoying her time shopping for underwear lmao (I want to be her childhood friendnow lol) (Kawano Hiyori, I mean) (haha), we move on to... let's do the topic ofconversation since the whole of last episode then. Hongo-san, I mean. Not onlyis she found out to be on the streets at night with the sensei's car (bySonezaki and Amagi, more on that later), we now know what her true intentionsare up till this point. So yeah, before it was needing of reference material asshe searched the Internet for guys to f**k, but now it's jealousy. Real jealousyright there. Same could be said about Milo-san here who can barely answer thesame damn way as Izumi about Sugawara, but suffice it to say he was prettyrelaxed on this one because at least we know Hongo doesn't have the guts to...okay since she saw his d**k then I would say "esuibatsu". Which is probably whythe man chose the cheapest hotel and the smallest room so that he can save somemoney to teach the high school girl a lesson without doing anything. Reallywasteful though, I would argue haha. As for Sonezaki though, we should be gladAmagi really is either trying to avoid getting scolded by the girl for beingmaybe horny I don't know (I mean, look at Izumi) (BOOM GOT YOU haha) but atleast he has the guts to say being in the red light district with his girl iscreeping him out. Good for you Amagi, you're the nicest guy in this series nowhaha. Talking about people being nice, there's one particular person we can talkabout who is NOT being nice, and that is Sugimoto. Okay, depending on how yousee this, we can talk about this for another half an hour, but to sum it up yesSugimoto is trying to be<a href="https://jisho.org/search/motemote" target="_blank">popular</a> withgirls he likes.<a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">Normie</a>&nbsp;he isnot going to be if he ever gets a gf, as we are dealing with some girl whoactually knows what she is doing even instinctively. Mo-chin, talking about you,girl. So yeah, Momoko realises she has had enough of the guy, and I guess shedid iron things out with him in this episode. Despite the many threats and thereal threatening tone the guy is putting on her, she resisted all of it andliterally told him to get out of her life because he's irritating, for starters."I don't even like you" lmao. Finally, the romance drama we've all been waitingfor lol. So yeah, buzz off, Sugimoto, lest we find people to beat you up. And,we found out that Mo-chin is lesbian. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay not true, but as how Momokotalked to Sugawara you would think she's MVP this episode because Sugawara, no,Hongo-san didn't even go that far lmao. (Hongo still MVP btw she's the reason Iwant to stop watching this series altogether haha) Sugawara probably didn't getthe hint, but Mo-chin, this might be the worst way to get your friendship back.Well, not like she knows what happened behind the scenes on Sugawara. So doesKazusa not know anyways so whatever, drama. Unlike the<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tomo" target="_blank">tomo</a> though,Sugawara at this point might be getting even more confused about what she isexperiencing in one night. And she isn't even getting laid on the streets yetlol. Smoothly transitioning to (arguably) the prettiest girl in the series,Sugawara may be even more confused than ever. Between Izumi not liking her andMo-chin's confession lol, and her probably still finding that "esuibatsu" momentbefore she "dies" will still... how to say, Sugawara probably had too much goingon her. Considering all of her underlying reasons now is based on that dumbteacher who told her to go for it, whatever it might be now, it's not going toend well. Hey, if it's drama you need... Come on then, Sugawara. Do the ultimatedrama thing that your sensei likes by muffing with Mo-chin. DO IT. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okayjokes aside because this is not that Anime "<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34382/Citrus"  target="_blank"  >citrus</a>", I would say that her confusion might still drive her into doing somethingreal dumb, and that, we will have to see it for ourselves real soon, I hope.Mo-chin may be the wildcard for a moment but this girl, man... All in all,plenty of development which were mostly expected (I'll ignore the Mo-chinconfession to Sugawara lmao) but more importantly, we have some time before theend. So, here's another cliffhanger. Jujou is pregnant. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Yep, I mean, ifyou need a backstory I suppose the teacher will share with you guys or the girlherself will once Sonezaki tracks her down lol, but yeah, with retrospect tothis episode I guess we'll talk about what happens if you explore that "hole"too much. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> STD it is not, but it's not going to be an expected ending,if it's not a surprise already. The drama is throwing me off on this one, and Ican't really back up now that you got me so far up (lol), but we shall see howthis ends. It's either going to be a WTF or an OMG. Still, I would like to seeit till the end. Don't disappoint me, Anime. I don't want full on "esuibatsu"scenes on this show okay we may already have ruined it with Hongo-san ah DAMMIThaha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wH27QrA5W4U/XXSppNwxzQI/AAAAAAAA0PM/z9ccBpPYptQiZqU0O5HCNdkQ8DpSst9tACLcBGAs/s320/araoto10_grab.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            You think with this Anime our dear Mocho just lost a percentage of            her fans? lol<br />            (<a              href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_R36v5fKQ_A/XXS5qaEzmqI/AAAAAAAA0Pw/FrHEGvOQFiwbQKj7qTVX8EfGjw33W5fKwCLcBGAs/s320/sunsetkungfu_armwrestle.jpg"              target="_blank"              >She's strong too</a            >            btw so she will beat you up haha you won't)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wq6vZAKfMAE/XXSqC4ox0zI/AAAAAAAA0PU/qZG-JwAd7UIAuSOdZnxvznbkIcPF4nrKACLcBGAs/s320/araoto10_69.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Never thought I'll ever name an image file "<a              href="https://jisho.org/search/69"              target="_blank"              >69</a            >" but here we are          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

"You got so hard too" Haha I was wanting to say that, Sugawara? I justdidn't expect this Anime to impress me lol but I figured it might happen sinceshe was such a SLUT haha<br />[And as expected because I thought of it first initially and TOTALLY as a joke,there weren't any red lights because that's probably how it works in Japan atnight, always green unless otherwise. Hongo-san you got screwed so hard youdon't even know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Can I be the director of this series already?

Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this newepisode (#JoshiMuda10) we finally get an episode of<strike>Aki-chan</strike> Saginomiya. Is this an Anime miracle? Haha okaysarcasm that no one understands aside, we finally get to know a little more ofthis mysterious genius. Majime? Take notes. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Besides Wota who wantstalent in her life (hey count me in haha) we now know that Robo here (not goingto spell her name all over this btw so her nickname will have to do) actuallywants...?? I mean, apparently if it's not anything that can biologicaly extendher life she's not going to be interested lol I may be joking but remember thisbecause we'll get back to this real soon. So yeah, it's about her and herfriends, and a guy who likes her? What is this, a<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo" target="_blank"  >shoujo Anime</a>?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (ooo<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun"  target="_blank"  >Kaibutsu-kun</a>is in there main girl who voiced Wota here btw haha totally recommended)Anyways, let's talk about Takahashi. (not<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/34785/Rie_Takahashi" target="_blank"  >Rie</a>btw lol) Somehow this guy reminds me of<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/104733/Fuuki_Iinchou" target="_blank"  >that class chairwoman</a>in<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34881/Aho_Girl" target="_blank"  >some other idiot show</a>lmao, but suffice it to say we're seeing a shy guy wanting to confess to thesmart girl. Come on, admit it, we've all been there. Then you<strike>realise</strike> <strike>deduce</strike>&nbsp;assume you aren't smartenough for her and... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Unlike us (lol), the guy bravely approached thegirl while she's alone one day to... borrow the book she's reading? Okay, Robodidn't reject it so that's a start haha. Surprisingly, all things fell intoplace the moment the guy could relate to how his friend was literally describedin the book even though we know Robo was probably reading this to understand howliving conditions can cultivate various bacteria and microorganisms such thatit'll affect our daily lives or something lmao. Anyways, he thanked her for thebook which made Tanaka and Akane believe something's about to happen and thatthey gonna get laid in the future through recommendations (Tanaka especiallylol) but I think thanks to the friend he might have been labelled as being gaynow. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh well, so much for that love story, I guess. (For more romancestories please refer to the<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance" target="_blank"  >romance genre</a>haha) And then the trio got into quarrels with each other. I know there are 6permutations as to how this can happen thanks math genius, we will only talkabout two of them. Firstly, Wota VS Tanaka. The way to resolve the conflictthough here, as shown by Robo, is to stuff Tanaka with useless things to doproviding satisfaction so to remove those bad memories of conflict lol becausewe know Wota is rather forgiving and that's easy to just let her be. Really, thelovey-dovey thing between those two are freaking me out haha. Then, Robo VSTanaka. (I know right it MUST involve that idiot haha) For this though...besides the fact that Tanaka is already forgiven by killing a microorganism infront of Robo's very eyes since the book she used to kill it is good lmao, wenow know of a rather sentimental flashback of how the trio came to be, and why agenius like Saginomiya would be in a neighbourhood school with the other two.And I think you should consider it too smart alec, because that is what I callfriendship. As dumb as this series might be, it also shows us how muchdifference things will make when you hang out with friends who know you. That'swhat makes life interesting, so you won't feel alone. At least, that's from myexperience. And it's different from that friendship with those two guys lol,and&nbsp;yes Lily, it's unlike your feelings for Majime btw hers for Saginomiyais respect haha. Hah, I'm tired. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And now I know why the Twitterverse(it's an actual term btw haha) is crazy about Waseda on the premier airing ofthis episode, because... spoiler alert, he's<strike>Tenshoku</strike> Ten-whatever P. WHAT???? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, just as arecap, the producer is what Wota likes, so whatever the high school teacher doesas a music producer (composer too probably) is liked by, you guessed it, onlyhigh school girls. And that's why he will never get college girls hooked on hisstuff. Too bad bro, but if I ever attract someone's attention I'll grab whateveropportunity I get maybe even if they not my age group haha not true btw.(Besides, you did say they will grow up so...) To end this, I'm eternallygrateful to<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/character/168491/Minami_Yamamoto"  target="_blank"  >whoever voiced Yamamoto</a>(you also called Yamamoto??) who just ruined her solo singing career for lifelmao (if this is not in the soundtrack somehow WE RIOT) (NO<a  href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AxDn7ZAei_k/XXS6gyje0HI/AAAAAAAA0P4/_ZcPUBIbZbIWyEZXQmzShvo6SBEgmTWDACLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama11_chika5.jpg"  target="_blank"  >FUJIWARA CHIKA</a><a  href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Do8cr1ZaK5M/XXS64keKUpI/AAAAAAAA0QA/WWYXPHoj4vs67berJJqJnc8diTqKbxu8gCLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama04_YO.jpg"  target="_blank"  ><b>GO AWAY</b></a>haha I wonder<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38619/Joshikousei_no_Mudazukai"  target="_blank"  >who</a>copied<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen"  target="_blank"  >who</a>), but yeah this is by far still the most entertaining series in this season sofar.

(Well one istechnically from last week but still) And you can hear almost all of them onApple Music, so why not talk about them, yes? (Ah, I love the year 2019 where Ican stream music) (*All releases mentioned thereafter with streaming availablewill be denoted) Firstly, <b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> is... short ofawesome, but I'll take a good single so yeah the quarterly release review ishappening haha. <b>*MaRuRi to Ryuga's new mini-album</b> is okay, but I'd rathergive the topic song(s) somehow so yeah you guys barely passed on this one. Thisis still way better compared to *<b>Base Ball Bear's new mini-album</b> (I'mgoing to ignore the physical version which will be released live only on the15th) which I only identified the topic song as passable, and<b>*SID's new album</b> which didn't even get me interested in the topic songand just one other new song. But seriously SID, I miss your older tunes. Movingon to unexpected releases, thank goodness Fuchigami Mai's new single (didn'tnotice it was Limited Edition only but whatever) didn't disappoint so I took aB-side even though too bad it's not enough for a review (I mean, you dumped aLive CD in there which I have watched in video and they sucked so... haha) whichis fine I guess. *<b>Tokyo Karan Koron's new mini-album</b> might be theunderdog this week for getting me hooked to classic yet short melodies where Ibrainwashed myself during work hours lol, and<b>*OGRE YOU ASSHOLE's new album</b> is still weird. I'll probably give a songor two once I got over the super cheesy lyrics and by that I mean disgusting notromantic haha<br /><br />Next week is easier on me for music releases so thank God haha which I don'tbelieve in, but it's still quite a couple so we can talk about those next weekif they are good. <b>SIX LOUNGE is back with a new mini-album</b> since the onetwo months ago damn were they this fast, and I'm giving<b>FIVE NEW OLD's new album</b> a chance. We shall see. And if I don't think Iwill exceed song count in Klassic Note this year and if my Google feed and/orApple Music want to hint me on artists I know releasing new songs, I'll try tolisten to them as and when I can. Really, it's thanks to them I know of half thereleases mentioned releasing THIS VERY WEEk, by the way. See? Smart AItechnology is smart. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />On the news around and mostly on Twitter, fumika is releasing a full album thisOctober (FINALLY lol), you must listen to Scenarioart's drummer Kumiko play akeyboard on her first solo song, and congrats Waki Azumi in her solo music debutwith Columbia Japan after Kitou Akari got hers with Pony Canyon. (Columbia isgood too, look at Yuuki Aoi and her new album) Man, with all these (technically)idols on the rise it's no wonder Klassic Note has to change focus in recentyears. I tried, man, but mainstream isn't writing good songs for me to like.Anime producers though... (Haha now you know why Wota likes Tenshoku P? I feelit in my nerves tbh)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I have to conclude soon so sorry if I didn't catch the latest of latest news onSunday since I HAVE WORK DO TO TONIGHT ugh haha. (Well, it's part of life too sowhatever) So cya guys again, and until then... maybe I'll add in the embeds forApple Music just for this week becuase it's so much to talk about the Tweets andlikes online wouldn't justify but I'm tired from just doing this up for theAnime part too haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
