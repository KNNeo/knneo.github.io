<div class="page-header"></div>
Well Nan-chan decided to tell us about <a href="https://ameblo.jp/natsukawashiinablog/entry-12515897271.html" target="_blank">her dream in her blog</a> so I decided to tell mine too. 100% because of her, by the way haha<br />
<br />
I'll put a snippet as to what she said about her dream, but first let's talk about mine. Ready? Yes, it's about the TrySail girls, just a heads up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
"I was in a nearby mall (well Tampines Mall isn't exactly nearby so...) (don't you dare Google on it) in which I remembered (of course, it's not real) that the TrySail girls were handing out bromides ie. commemorative photos I assume promoting something nearby so of course I had to go get some for myself. Firstly, Nan-chan. It looked like she was hesitantly giving them out, but I went forward and snatched it like no one's business. At least she was happy seeing it being taken. (It was as if it was pathetic that no one knows them in the land of Singapore) (not true I'm not the only fan here I promise just look at the AFA they were in) Ten-chan was next. I took the bunch of them with the smile on her face somewhat making sure I will take it no matter what it is, and sorry to Mocho just because you were last. The weird thing about the dream though, that (1) it didn't stop me from getting more so by the end of it my hands were full and they were all different, and (2) there seemed to be multiple of them, likely handing different items out at different timing maybe. It felt like those people giving out flyers who bypassers won't give too much care about, but at least I'm glad I am the one who patronised."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, considering I woke up quite a while and it was still quite vivid and I only can remember this much, I guess it wasn't so much of a dream as much of an expectation if I were in Japan or whatever haha. Also, my imouto's impression is the best which also geared me to write this (and below later) too anyways. Cya guys around then.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<a href="https://ameblo.jp/natsukawashiinablog/entry-12515897271.html" target="_blank">"The Things (I) Saw In (My) Dream With (That) Weird Person"</a>&nbsp;[Dated August 31st]<br />
(so I assume the dream was last night)<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Somehow, I was in the studio. Doing up my makeup, you know.<br />
<br />
Looking at the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E9%A6%99%E7%9B%A4%E8%A1%A8" target="_blank">cast list</a> pinned on the wall, it looked like I was scheduled for a photo shoot on the cover art of my new EP.<br />
<br />
(Recently the cover art of the EP has been revealed, it turned out so good that it looked super cool!)<br />
<br />
(Oh well, might as well paste [the link] here then.) [Eh please go to her official website for details]<br />
<br />
And, I was done with makeup, but there was no outfit prepared. Since normally, I will be in my pajama outfit. [Really? "Mitai" haha I assume is casual clothes] So what are we going to do here. The staff around are also troubled over this.<br />
<br />
(And) Over there!<br />
<br />
Over there! Dashingly appearing (in front of us), a blue shadow! [lol that's your Ten-chan hint]<br />
<br />
Yes, somehow Ten-san [as they address her] ran all the way to the studio here. (from where she was)<br />
<br />
Moreover, dressed in a super flashy blue <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E3%82%B4%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AD%E3%83%AA" target="_blank">gothic loli</a>-kind of outfit. [someone please make that haha]<br />
<br />
"Nan-chan, sorry to keep you waiting! (I) made your outfit!"<br />
<br />
Upon uttering those words, she [wait for it] took off the current blue gothic loli outfit she was wearing on the spot, and passed it to me. [goddamn haha I hope she wearing something underneath]<br />
<br />
I said "thanks" (to her gesture), but can't help but have a bad feeling on what Ten-san meant when she said she "made" this gothic loli outfit.<br />
<br />
"Ten-san, how did you make this outfit?"<br />
<br />
Listening to her reply (with a chill down my spine), Ten-san let out a smile. I could take all of this cheekiness, especially when there are obvious parts of her that are kind, and some parts that are evil right now.<br />
<br />
"How did I... I pasted it up with double-sided tape!!"<br />
<br />
As expected!!!<br />
[not going to do the repeat]<br />
<br />
I inspected in detail the gothic loli outfit that was passed to me. From the fastener on the back, to the netting for accessories, the button on the sleeves... Everything! Held tight, by double-sided tape!! As of how this held up for this long and so well, it was unexpectedly a mystery.<br />
<br />
[remember someone ran to the studio here wearing that btw lmao]<br />
[also, on ad hoc outfits they actually DO use tape to paste some of the fancy outfits together, see uesaka sumire's BQB music video for example]<br />
<br />
"You are going to wear it... right...?"<br />
<br />
Ahhh!! Ten-san!! Please don't talk down to me in such a beautiful yet forceful voice!! That face, don't stare at me while you're saying this!! I'll die! I'll die (of this)!<br />
<br />
As I held my brain with my hands, Ten-san's "ufufu" laugh started to spread! I can hear it so well! It's not even a dream; I can even hear it in real life!!!<br />
<br />
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaa....!!"<br />
<br />
Somehow this might sound like a lie, but as I shouted in my dream, I woke up. It was 6.28AM. I'm still early, compared to the expected time to wake up.<br />
<br />
"It, it was a dream..."<br />
<br />
<br />
P.P.S. I would just like to comment here since putting it in the translation is kind of rude, so... it really sounded like Ten-chan was like a 6-year-old from that music video making where they do their opinion on the shoot ("<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tanoshikatta" target="_blank">tanoshikatta</a>" lmao) and man is this funny haha<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheDreams">The Dreams</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
