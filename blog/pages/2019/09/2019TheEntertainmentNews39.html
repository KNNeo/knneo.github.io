Hey, welcome back.<br />
<br />
I really wonder why I only did those hashtags above for Anime when I could be
doing it for EVERYTHING I've written on every post ever since this version of
the blog existed five years ago. Okay, I'd rather spend time unifying Klassic
Note and its contents haha it's mostly that this weekend you know. Design
considerations now that I can understand database management.<br />
<br />
SOMEONE GIVE ME ANIMAL CROSSING SWITCH NOW okay let's begin<br />

You're going to wonder how a marriage proposal will ever happen with these two.
<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this final episode (#TakagiSanS212) which I can't wait for the
weekend to watch (still, 2 days delay?) and here I'm hearing things like "if I
do date things, I win" from that Nishikata? Seriously man, he's an idiot to fall
for this girl. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> This show in a nutshell haha. Anyways, let's talk about
the
<strike>date</strike> summer festival hehe. So yeah, the guy asked the girl out,
they went, the guy is not even dressed up for the occasion, and the girl is
dressed in a
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/yukata" target="_blank">yukata</a>. So will
the other girls in the series from the trio to Mano-chan to Houjou-san but who
cares about them because this episode's focus is in the main
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kappuru" target="_blank">couple</a>. You see,
Nishikata? It's hard to not use to the word "couple" even if I'm an adult lol
you can treat me as a kid. Ignoring whatever is that "people don't call us a
couple" mini-game, many things happened in the festival between the two which
really spiced things up for the finale. I mean, come on, even if you don't watch
this you should know the fireworks are the highlight okay let's get through the
others first. Firstly, Takagi set out a challenge to Nishikata in order to
fulfil her own desires on this date: do things a couple will do here at any
point and he wins. It's like seeing a Charged Creeper in Minecraft from like, 5
years ago lol (that was the worst video game analogy I can make) so yeah,
Nishikata really struggled to make it happen. From holding hands to taking
selfies to sharing food... he knows. HE KNOWS, what a couple would be doing. But
no, he rather play games and win Takagi. Seriously, why is he such a try hard?
He knows he can't win at goldfish scooping. No really, even if he didn't let the
big one go for the other kid to have it so that her younger sister could be
happy, he probably still won't win. (And now that you have seen the strategies,
be sure to try it out yourself! lol) Well, Takagi eventually gave the fishes
they scooped to them anyways. You know, being the smaritan because you can't
carry that many and/or would even keep one for yourself unlike
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/133654/Saya_Endou" target="_blank"
  >some other girl</a
>
lmao. (I'm so sorry I'll stop with the references) They then bought some food,
just as the trio came out and also bought some food (Yukari-chan is not hungry
she is only hungry for love haha) and Takagi presses in on the offense, opening
her mouth supposedly hoping that someone would feed her... it's not happening,
girl. Again, this does not work because that guy's a dork haha. (And you aren't
even sharing utensils what the-) (haha) And in the middle of the episode,
Nishikata lost sight of his girl trying to avoid other girls from his school.
And yes, it was an omen waiting to happen again, so I'll leave it at that. But
yeah, same town, same people. Meeting them will be a thing, so I'm sorry
Nishikata you asked for it by asking Takagi out in the first place haha BOOM GOT
YOU. And then, they played ring toss. I would argue I suck at it, so Nishikata
you shouldn't feel bad about it even if the teacher saw you two together alone.
<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I like how Nishikata doesn't come up with preventive measures to
Takagi's teasing like for example, faking a throw so he can throw her off her
own tease, but hey, not like the teacher doesn't know you two are just friends
hanging out. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (He probably think they were hanging out with the others
and just wanted to play this) Apart from the p-p-prize uncle telling Nishikata
to make a c-c-choice (okay stop insulting people who stutter, me) and...
interestingly, instead of choosing a prize for himself (I guess there aren't any
that he likes, carnivals are that level of quality anyways), nice guy Nishikata
strikes again (oh I forgot to put that just now) to give Takagi a present
instead. A hairpin, in this case. He got a mask in return though lol WTF TAKAGI
I GAVE YOU SOMETHING NICE haha. Lastly, they were waiting for fireworks in the
crowd. Standing there, I bet he didn't even realise that the mask was the
perfect guise, isn't it? You put on that and do that and it'll be an easy win.
<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (I meant put on the mask, and hold hands) So yeah he did not, and the
mask has a purpose (I sense Anime filler drama logic here) which is easily seen
when he sees his friends walking by so he thinks he can cover his face with it
and then Kimura literally saw through him (pun intended) and also (which is why
he's MVP this episode) he saw his friend holding something normally a female
would and left quietly, so kudos on you, bro. You be Nishikata's best classmate
this series. (Haha looking at you, Takagi) And this time, while trying to
disguise himself from his friends, he lost sight of Takagi again. This time,
among the huge crowd, he couldn't find her. Yeah, now we're talking drama. And
so did Takagi realise, only it's too late because (1) the fireworks are up and
(2) she wasn't with the guy she wants to. I want to talk about how wonderful the
theme song is, but let's focus ourselves on how desperately Nishikata tried to
find the girl while she... hid away up upon the temple hoping he will come? What
is this, some ancient love drama plot? (I sense middle-aged scriptwriters here
lol) The plot twist here, and again Kimura MVP, he and the other guy (sorry I
don't remember your name) but in particular Kimura, was on the lookout for
(probably cute girls but also) Takagi since he sees her without him around. You
know, the not couple sighting. And as he sees Nishikata around, he shouts to
hint him on Takagi's last seen location, and that's how you get a happy ending.
Too bad it wasn't, (I sense evil Anime production vibes) because the fireworks
ended just as they found each other. Aw... Okay now we gotta get that cab trip
to Chiba- Oh, we not doing that? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Yes, you losers if you never watched
Kaguya-sama) (oh and if you intend to sorry for spoilers haha) And that brings
this season to an end. What do you guys think? For me, I really hate the idea of
the guy being dumb and not just ignorant or block-headed, but man Nishikata, you
not feeling embarrassed or literally a tsundere will help move things a lot
between you two. Nonetheless, he did hold her hand, so lucky you Takagi, but he
wins. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Games, teases, and jokes aside, this season ended up making them
a couple. And that... might be the most we can ask for this season. The start of
this season probably gave us good hints on how this might be progressing,
spending more time to show us how much they enjoy each other's presence
(Nishikata included), and those feelings that progress over time must be more
important than the games they had to play (well, Takagi had to play since
Nishikata always started it) because this love, man. If you guys didn't even
shed a tear at the ending where guy tries to find girl... I'm not going to help
you. But if you did, I'm sure this might have been more impactful than the rest
of the season, even though I would argue this is not like, a build-up on drama
or something. To really end this, I'll take a leaf from Takagi who has been
secretly observing, asking questions about, and been interested in this guy
called Nishikata throughout this series and this episode. Because Nishikata is
such a nice person even as seen throughout the date, from letting someone else
win the goldfish, to giving gifts to others even upon losing, to frantically
searching for that someone as if he or she was a close family member... he is
the true winner in her eyes. And this feeling of a nice guy, I think, is the
true treasure we should hold deep in our hearts as fans of this series.
<span title="*silence*">😐</span> I'm sure Takagi does too, and I'm also sure we like her more than the
guy too (vice versa for ladies maybe?) (seriously, the drawings on her are
always so good though), but all in all, it is what it is. Middle schoolers they
may be, but they are having a better time than me when I was a kid, so lucky you
all. I'm going to a corner to cry now haha<br />

P.S. "Normal adults won't do that!" I mean, your friends probably would. Hikari
would.<span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />
P.P.S. This postscript is dedicated to talking about this episode's insert song
(not the cover ending song by Takagi, and is) by Ohara Yuiko who has been doing
the opening theme songs so far. I'm soooo glad I gave this song back in end July
because man, the feels when you know the lyrics (hopefully for you, from the
subtitles) and they give that Nishikata searching Takagi amongst the lights
thing? It's so staged, this insert song, but for this song being inside the
Anime, I cried. It was that touching. Thanks, Anime, for making this miracle
happen. A third season need not matter. You won "Araoto" this season (shut up
Baka haha). And I'll take this impression as its best. <span title="*sob*">😢</span> I'm done.<br />
[Since it's last episode let's put more sweet Takagi reactions in, yes?]<br />

It's that time of the season again, so yeah with most shows ending this week (of
course, including Takagi-san), and this coming in somewhat in time this weekend,
I will, as usual, comment about the shows I've seen on the list. Shows I
<u>may</u> give an episode (and does not mean it's confirmed) will have premier*
episode dates listed.<br />
(*Premier airing refers to TV premier; early screening events and exclusives are
not counted)<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    I won't be watching <b>OreSuki</b> (Ore wo Suki na no wa Omae Dake ka yo)
    but I know my harem-loving friend will. No, that related Anime thing written
    on the post will NOT entice me to watch this it LOOKS terrible haha
  </li>
  <li>
    If I'll ever watch <b>Houkago Saikoro Club</b> [Premiers October 2nd] it'll
    be because of Marinka. Period. Because the technical terms in board games
    will make me so bored her character will be the only way to cheer me up I
    might be skipping this altogether I don't know
  </li>
  <li>
    I... may have to watch back season 1 if I am to give
    <b>Hi Score Girl II</b> a chance someone give me 2 weeks work leave lmao
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Null Peta</b> [Premiers October 4th] may get emotional at some point, but
    if it's not the-game-is-done-way-better-than-anime-adaptation emotional I'll
    live with it haha. Anime original series btw and it's releasing with a game?
    Is this how it happens now?? Either the game is going to be boring or I'm
    going to hate the Anime prove me wrong lol. (Also Waki Azumi stop getting on
    my face!! Geez haha)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Tokunana</b> (Keishichou Tokumu Bu Tokushu Kyouakuhan Taisaku Shitsu Dai
    Nana Ka: Tokunana) [Premiers October 6th] sounds like an interesting
    original anime filled with hidden dragons disguised amongst humans until I
    notice I have to give the dragons. I like the idea of action Anime with
    alternate world disguises (say BLEACH, Bungo Stray Dogs) so I might give
    this a try. It's all the guys though where are the females in this special
    unit? Ah, there are 2 haha. Also, why put the young boy newbie as main
    again? Do all special agencies need to have one of those? lol come on be
    more original, Anime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Babylon</b> [Premiers October 6th] didn't really get me hooked in until I
    see who wrote the opening theme song (Hey Q-MHz write some more songs for
    Mikakoshi would you) and I guess I can get another thriller anime in my
    pocket. It has been some time since shows like "Subete ga F ni Naru" and
    "Ranpo Kitan" came under my microscope. I wished it had more action like
    "Tokunana" above though, but I promise, I will not pit these two against
    each other if I'm giving this too haha
  </li>
  <li>
    Why would I want to come back from work looking at work?
    <b>Africa no Salaryman</b> is not going to be up my alley unless I'm a furry
    there are TWO this season including this wtf
  </li>
  <li>
    Is <b>Pet</b> going to air this season?? I have a feeling I'll get to watch
    the real life stage drama first before the animation lol really it didn't
    even announce a date why is it on this list
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
Hmm...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
I guess we'll take this time to catch up on Manga, shall we?<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq manga">

Oh yeah the guys were infiltrating the rich peoples' places to gather
information, let's see what they have gotten so far behind the backing of the
"real" Ciel Phantomhive. (I still remember the Ciel Ciel thing don't worry I
just don't think this will be necessary now) So yeah, about the maids in that
mansion. Apparently the reason for this many maids in the house and the
continuous search for them are revealed in the recent chapters (154-155) where
the Baron himself is actually seeking for love. Firstly, there's the morning
greeting. Sucks to have to wait to eat breakfast to do this, but you know, he be
a nice guy. The newbies are introduced to the master on his surprise return
after a long trip I assume, and... someone got an invitation. Since I can't keep
the suspense, let's talk about reality. The Baron does this unusual move due to
him not seeking for love, but seeking for a replacement for his wife. Seeing his
age and still single, it'll be no wonder that he has lost his family in an
accident years ago and is not just unhappy with his wife and seeking physical
pleasure lmao. Or more likely, someone to complete his life ever since that
trauma hit him, literally. I wonder why he has to do the maids though (isn't
that kind of lowering your status?), but suffice it to say that Meirin did get
to see what happened, the head maid was kind enough to explain to her the
situation before letting her go, and Ranmao is the next target. And... unlike
the other newbie who just got a try-out and left the place (lmao it's like with
clothing when you go shopping), she did not return. Which of course, can only
mean two outcomes. Either (1) she did somehow manage to suit herself (remember
she is Lau's bodyguard, that emotionless girl) into the Baron's favours and
hopefully she's still a virgin after that night haha, or (2) she failed to
protect herself, as a bodyguard. Yeah. And from the last cut of the chapters, it
might be the latter. Man, that Baron must be RIPPED haha we don't know for sure.
But one thing's for sure: she didn't win. And that might be an issue of concern.
What will happen of Ranmao though? I guess we have not long to know of the
answer.<br />

Eh, in random stories in this series lol (168-169) we have two stories to talk
about. Someone in the carpenter's house is surpassing Rin, literally and
arguably the worst carpenter on the island who still bears its title (lol), and
the rest of the house is keeping it a secret from her. No one knows why, but a
certain penguin (okay Misaki stop being aroused lol) is obsessed about who can
make such fine work, making intricate items out of wood. Looks like it can only
be from the house, as Rin deduced, but apparently it's more than that, which
will explain why Ikuto is not performing his usual social justice self by
solving the mystery haha. So yeah, Rin incidentally found out that the penguin
(I don't want to write his name down since I can't remember haha) actually sleep
walks around the house, and surprisingly, makes his own woodwork in the middle
of the night! Sure is weird for someone to be able to do this, but hey, the
reason sells, so whatever lol. Turns out it's Mikoto, the ninja who also is an
apprentice carpenter (I mean, is she though?) in the house, who is surpassing
Rin-chan in many ways than possible, which Ikuto would explain whatever is
hidden inside the beautiful box that the penguin found up on the hills. Ninjas
would go there, the penguin doesn't know himself too probably, and the food only
comes from Mikoto's place. Mystery solved. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> The other is probably more
relatable for all of us, which is a day without Misaki in Ikuto's place. To
summarise, there's Suzu-chan, Ikuto, that pig thing
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tonkatsu" target="_blank">Tonkatsu</a> (yep,
the name), and Misaki, the imouto. So a day without her should be a day in
normal as we have seen in the Anime which is probably still chaotic, but hey,
after this many chapters later? Ikuto is believing that he is not building
resistance to that haha bro you don't build resistance to sexual arousal lol.
Anyways, sure is more interesting than other people's affairs (lol sorry
Rin-chan), and... I don't think I will miss this series haha when is it going to
end though<br />

Since someone is translating this, I thought we should continue with it until
the series ends then maybe I'll do the same thing as I did with "AmaetaiHi" by
buying the set. So, the "new" chapters (4-7) continue on the identity-changing
story between Shun and Ayumu, and honestly reading at this speed now instead of
raws? I feel bored. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Let's talk about it first. Firstly, we are
introduced to the new guy, Kouhei. Well, not really new since they all know each
other in middle school, but surely something happened, right? You don't have to
change into Ayumu to know this, Shun-kun. Still, that might still be something
hard to uncover even by disguise standards, so let's leave it as that. Then,
there's the slip-ups. Of course, Ayumu and Shun are fine without being
themselves, especially Ayumu, but Shun slowly noticed that he could be someone
else without being the timid, soft-spoken and restrained self that he has always
been. Is that good though? Only time will tell. But suffice it to say he gets to
ask a lot of questions from others about it, but gets some slip-ups when he
forgets who he is by remembering stuff that this new classmate doesn't know, to
the not childhood friend. Mindf**k already? You're not alone. Again, way easier
to understand with the translations, no joke. Lastly, the prelude to the end. As
seen in Chapter 4, and knowing that the truth has somewhat been revealed in the
latest chapters since a few months ago when I saw it (chapter 80+ or
something?), somehow Shun-kun will be leaving again. Leaving as in, saying
goodbye to his friends in school like he has to do in middle school. So coming
back kinda sucks, and if things aren't settled between all these people as of
now, it'll only get even more unsettling when he leaves again, I guess. And add
in the others who will shortly join this middle school reunion party, and things
might get awkward when the truth about body-switching is out. Hey, no harm
caused, but there's romance involved, so the harm isn't just social, if you get
what I mean. To end this, I think I'll try to see ahead on the conclusion and
plan accordingly. If we do reach there than I may have to spend a weekend
reading through... what is it now? 8 volumes? Well they are short but my
reading's bad so we shall see. Again, subtle story, may be boring, but when the
waves hit you'll love this ride. Also, Sana-chan is that cute I can't even<br />

Maybe I'll do this as a seasonal thing, ie. every three months in the space
between Anime seasons. Gives time for scans to be made and also won't force me
to read stuff every week or month. Also, will cover some of the others next
week, but seeing the Anime premier schedules...<br />

This week has been quite a week at Klassic Note. And if I did say
<b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's new album</b> is going to be hype, then I'm
gravely wrong. Well it isn't, and as of now I haven't even decided what in the
new list I want to give. Okay, maybe one. But that's it. No good. Half the album
is on reserves now, which is bad considering it's all English songs and it's
either give or throw all in my case haha. <b>Ohara Yuiko's 1st album</b> after
like what, 4 years since debut? Okay, whatever, but it isn't bad. I did mention
her melodies aren't great, but as mentioned before and even on Twitter, song
production is making her songs better than ever, and that's a good thing. I'm
loving 3 songs now because of this. She may not be the next big thing, but I'm
glad I gave her another chance since that Anime theme song single. You can feel
this out with how many Tweets that had her name in it haha.&nbsp;<b
  >Natsukawa Shiina's 1st EP</b
>
must be the highlight this week, and boy is it because it's released same day on
Apple Music Japan? I was wanting to b*tch about it on Twitter on how I didn't
get to hear it on time in streaming&nbsp; during lunch and I'm like "WHAT?"
*looks back at Mocho and Ten-chan's song lists* "Is this some miracle??"
<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (No one can relate, by the way, not even my co-workers or my friends)
Okay I did that bit on Twitter already, so be sure to give her... concept EP a
chance? It's her in every other music style besides those that were from her
album, in my opinion. Really, thought Aki-chan was in her new release for a
moment lol the legacy must go on<br />
<br />
Most notably for next week is the fact that I will be giving
<b>Mrs. GREEN APPLE's new album</b> a chance seeing how popular their music
videos have been lately, and I'll get back to SIMAC when I am in the right mood.
On Twitter, <b>Hashimoto Eriko is going solo</b> (well, is that surprising) with
a new demo song music video which ain't bad (the song, not the video),
<b>LuckLife is coming up with a new mini-album</b> due December (which I may not
get to hear it again and if I do I might be disappointed lol),
<b>yucat's new song is finally on Apple Music</b> after 2 months,
<b>fumika's new album</b> revealed a long track list which is honestly just too
many for my ears already maybe, and I realised
<b>Polkadot Stingray's mini-album is in three weeks</b>. That, I think I said it
last week liao so I'll save myself the shame haha. Also,
<b>sphere's new single</b> for yet another Anime has a music video preview.
Well, it's as much as you can expect haha<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I'll stop here. I've been spending a lot of time doing up Klassic Note
stuff (standardisation of file names is a bitc-) and maintenance of this PC
since I'm intending to let it survive till the end of the year which is coming
so I better start planning what I want for my home PC from here on. Well, I
won't have that much time to look at it though since I'm working BOOM GOT ME
haha but I want to make my home time entertainment better. You know, words
coming out from a loner lol. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I hope I
won't continue being bored at work I've been doing the same damn thing for the
past 2 months I think I need a career change TIME TO WRITE THAT RESIGNATION
LETTER haha bye<br />
