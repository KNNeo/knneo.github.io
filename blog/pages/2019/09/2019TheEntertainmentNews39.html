Okay, I'd rather spend time unifying KlassicNote and its contents haha it's mostly that this weekend you know. Designconsiderations now that I can understand database management.<br /><br />SOMEONE GIVE ME ANIMAL CROSSING SWITCH NOW okay let's begin<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS212">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It's a date!" Haha damn kids you're so right I can't even  </div></blockquote>You're going to wonder how a marriage proposal will ever happen with these two.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode (#TakagiSanS212) which I can't wait for theweekend to watch (still, 2 days delay?) and here I'm hearing things like "if Ido date things, I win" from that Nishikata? Seriously man, he's an idiot to fallfor this girl. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This show in a nutshell haha. Anyways, let's talk aboutthe<strike>date</strike> summer festival hehe. So yeah, the guy asked the girl out,they went, the guy is not even dressed up for the occasion, and the girl isdressed in a<a href="https://jisho.org/search/yukata" target="_blank">yukata</a>. So willthe other girls in the series from the trio to Mano-chan to Houjou-san but whocares about them because this episode's focus is in the main<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kappuru" target="_blank">couple</a>. You see,Nishikata? It's hard to not use to the word "couple" even if I'm an adult lolyou can treat me as a kid. Ignoring whatever is that "people don't call us acouple" mini-game, many things happened in the festival between the two whichreally spiced things up for the finale. I mean, come on, even if you don't watchthis you should know the fireworks are the highlight okay let's get through theothers first. Firstly, Takagi set out a challenge to Nishikata in order tofulfil her own desires on this date: do things a couple will do here at anypoint and he wins. It's like seeing a Charged Creeper in Minecraft from like, 5years ago lol (that was the worst video game analogy I can make) so yeah,Nishikata really struggled to make it happen. From holding hands to takingselfies to sharing food... he knows. HE KNOWS, what a couple would be doing. Butno, he rather play games and win Takagi. Seriously, why is he such a try hard?He knows he can't win at goldfish scooping. No really, even if he didn't let thebig one go for the other kid to have it so that her younger sister could behappy, he probably still won't win. (And now that you have seen the strategies,be sure to try it out yourself! lol) Well, Takagi eventually gave the fishesthey scooped to them anyways. You know, being the smaritan because you can'tcarry that many and/or would even keep one for yourself unlike<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/133654/Saya_Endou" target="_blank"  >some other girl</a>lmao. (I'm so sorry I'll stop with the references) They then bought some food,just as the trio came out and also bought some food (Yukari-chan is not hungryshe is only hungry for love haha) and Takagi presses in on the offense, openingher mouth supposedly hoping that someone would feed her... it's not happening,girl. Again, this does not work because that guy's a dork haha. (And you aren'teven sharing utensils what the-) (haha) And in the middle of the episode,Nishikata lost sight of his girl trying to avoid other girls from his school.And yes, it was an omen waiting to happen again, so I'll leave it at that. Butyeah, same town, same people. Meeting them will be a thing, so I'm sorryNishikata you asked for it by asking Takagi out in the first place haha BOOM GOTYOU. And then, they played ring toss. I would argue I suck at it, so Nishikatayou shouldn't feel bad about it even if the teacher saw you two together alone.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I like how Nishikata doesn't come up with preventive measures toTakagi's teasing like for example, faking a throw so he can throw her off herown tease, but hey, not like the teacher doesn't know you two are just friendshanging out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (He probably think they were hanging out with the othersand just wanted to play this) Apart from the p-p-prize uncle telling Nishikatato make a c-c-choice (okay stop insulting people who stutter, me) and...interestingly, instead of choosing a prize for himself (I guess there aren't anythat he likes, carnivals are that level of quality anyways), nice guy Nishikatastrikes again (oh I forgot to put that just now) to give Takagi a presentinstead. A hairpin, in this case. He got a mask in return though lol WTF TAKAGII GAVE YOU SOMETHING NICE haha. Lastly, they were waiting for fireworks in thecrowd. Standing there, I bet he didn't even realise that the mask was theperfect guise, isn't it? You put on that and do that and it'll be an easy win.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I meant put on the mask, and hold hands) So yeah he did not, and themask has a purpose (I sense Anime filler drama logic here) which is easily seenwhen he sees his friends walking by so he thinks he can cover his face with itand then Kimura literally saw through him (pun intended) and also (which is whyhe's MVP this episode) he saw his friend holding something normally a femalewould and left quietly, so kudos on you, bro. You be Nishikata's best classmatethis series. (Haha looking at you, Takagi) And this time, while trying todisguise himself from his friends, he lost sight of Takagi again. This time,among the huge crowd, he couldn't find her. Yeah, now we're talking drama. Andso did Takagi realise, only it's too late because (1) the fireworks are up and(2) she wasn't with the guy she wants to. I want to talk about how wonderful thetheme song is, but let's focus ourselves on how desperately Nishikata tried tofind the girl while she... hid away up upon the temple hoping he will come? Whatis this, some ancient love drama plot? (I sense middle-aged scriptwriters herelol) The plot twist here, and again Kimura MVP, he and the other guy (sorry Idon't remember your name) but in particular Kimura, was on the lookout for(probably cute girls but also) Takagi since he sees her without him around. Youknow, the not couple sighting. And as he sees Nishikata around, he shouts tohint him on Takagi's last seen location, and that's how you get a happy ending.Too bad it wasn't, (I sense evil Anime production vibes) because the fireworksended just as they found each other. Aw... Okay now we gotta get that cab tripto Chiba- Oh, we not doing that? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Yes, you losers if you never watchedKaguya-sama) (oh and if you intend to sorry for spoilers haha) And that bringsthis season to an end. What do you guys think? For me, I really hate the idea ofthe guy being dumb and not just ignorant or block-headed, but man Nishikata, younot feeling embarrassed or literally a tsundere will help move things a lotbetween you two. Nonetheless, he did hold her hand, so lucky you Takagi, but hewins. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Games, teases, and jokes aside, this season ended up making thema couple. And that... might be the most we can ask for this season. The start ofthis season probably gave us good hints on how this might be progressing,spending more time to show us how much they enjoy each other's presence(Nishikata included), and those feelings that progress over time must be moreimportant than the games they had to play (well, Takagi had to play sinceNishikata always started it) because this love, man. If you guys didn't evenshed a tear at the ending where guy tries to find girl... I'm not going to helpyou. But if you did, I'm sure this might have been more impactful than the restof the season, even though I would argue this is not like, a build-up on dramaor something. To really end this, I'll take a leaf from Takagi who has beensecretly observing, asking questions about, and been interested in this guycalled Nishikata throughout this series and this episode. Because Nishikata issuch a nice person even as seen throughout the date, from letting someone elsewin the goldfish, to giving gifts to others even upon losing, to franticallysearching for that someone as if he or she was a close family member... he isthe true winner in her eyes. And this feeling of a nice guy, I think, is thetrue treasure we should hold deep in our hearts as fans of this series.<span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'm sure Takagi does too, and I'm also sure we like her more than theguy too (vice versa for ladies maybe?) (seriously, the drawings on her arealways so good though), but all in all, it is what it is. Middle schoolers theymay be, but they are having a better time than me when I was a kid, so lucky youall. I'm going to a corner to cry now haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="1556"          data-original-width="1280"          height="320"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_vmSUZO6GzI/XYoqpjZzXEI/AAAAAAAA0wo/IwCr8sSvLu8GVeHj7stSWihaQKcqTW8zgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/takagisan_S2_12_yukata.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="263"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        (Painstakingly patched) Perfection.      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S. "Normal adults won't do that!" I mean, your friends probably would. Hikariwould.<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. This postscript is dedicated to talking about this episode's insert song(not the cover ending song by Takagi, and is) by Ohara Yuiko who has been doingthe opening theme songs so far. I'm soooo glad I gave this song back in end Julybecause man, the feels when you know the lyrics (hopefully for you, from thesubtitles) and they give that Nishikata searching Takagi amongst the lightsthing? It's so staged, this insert song, but for this song being inside theAnime, I cried. It was that touching. Thanks, Anime, for making this miraclehappen. A third season need not matter. You won "Araoto" this season (shut upBaka haha). And I'll take this impression as its best. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> I'm done.<br />[Since it's last episode let's put more sweet Takagi reactions in, yes?]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7aKYGUrJmXI/XYorpbzKc6I/AAAAAAAA0ww/iwMZeq-NDmIWRvNKOmuBZTAzPe_U1ptSACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/takagisan_S2_12_takagi4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            That's a "my boy did the good guy thing" face          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yl29e-e2ygU/XYorvm8rPfI/AAAAAAAA0w0/LbOVAeFF4BIqDX3O9VNXmUUvy3UJC8swQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/takagisan_S2_12_takagi7.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            That's a "my boy isn't here" face haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Autumn2019Anime">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Autumn 2019 Anime Season Preview</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    (Source:    <a href="https://randomc.net/2019/09/27/fall-2019-preview/" target="_blank"      >Random Curiosity</a    >)  </div></blockquote>It's that time of the season again, so yeah with most shows ending this week (ofcourse, including Takagi-san), and this coming in somewhat in time this weekend,I will, as usual, comment about the shows I've seen on the list. Shows I<u>may</u> give an episode (and does not mean it's confirmed) will have premier*episode dates listed.<br />(*Premier airing refers to TV premier; early screening events and exclusives arenot counted)<br /><ul>  <li>    I won't be watching <b>OreSuki</b> (Ore wo Suki na no wa Omae Dake ka yo)    but I know my harem-loving friend will. No, that related Anime thing written    on the post will NOT entice me to watch this it LOOKS terrible haha  </li>  <li>    If I'll ever watch <b>Houkago Saikoro Club</b> [Premiers October 2nd] it'll    be because of Marinka. Period. Because the technical terms in board games    will make me so bored her character will be the only way to cheer me up I    might be skipping this altogether I don't know  </li>  <li>    I... may have to watch back season 1 if I am to give    <b>Hi Score Girl II</b> a chance someone give me 2 weeks work leave lmao  </li>  <li>    <b>Null Peta</b> [Premiers October 4th] may get emotional at some point, but    if it's not the-game-is-done-way-better-than-anime-adaptation emotional I'll    live with it haha. Anime original series btw and it's releasing with a game?    Is this how it happens now?? Either the game is going to be boring or I'm    going to hate the Anime prove me wrong lol. (Also Waki Azumi stop getting on    my face!! Geez haha)  </li>  <li>    <b>Tokunana</b> (Keishichou Tokumu Bu Tokushu Kyouakuhan Taisaku Shitsu Dai    Nana Ka: Tokunana) [Premiers October 6th] sounds like an interesting    original anime filled with hidden dragons disguised amongst humans until I    notice I have to give the dragons. I like the idea of action Anime with    alternate world disguises (say BLEACH, Bungo Stray Dogs) so I might give    this a try. It's all the guys though where are the females in this special    unit? Ah, there are 2 haha. Also, why put the young boy newbie as main    again? Do all special agencies need to have one of those? lol come on be    more original, Anime.  </li>  <li>    <b>Babylon</b> [Premiers October 6th] didn't really get me hooked in until I    see who wrote the opening theme song (Hey Q-MHz write some more songs for    Mikakoshi would you) and I guess I can get another thriller anime in my    pocket. It has been some time since shows like "Subete ga F ni Naru" and    "Ranpo Kitan" came under my microscope. I wished it had more action like    "Tokunana" above though, but I promise, I will not pit these two against    each other if I'm giving this too haha  </li>  <li>    Why would I want to come back from work looking at work?    <b>Africa no Salaryman</b> is not going to be up my alley unless I'm a furry    there are TWO this season including this wtf  </li>  <li>    Is <b>Pet</b> going to air this season?? I have a feeling I'll get to watch    the real life stage drama first before the animation lol really it didn't    even announce a date why is it on this list  </li></ul><br />Hmm...<br /><br />...<br /><br />I guess we'll take this time to catch up on Manga, shall we?<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Kuroshitsuji</span>  </div></blockquote>Oh yeah the guys were infiltrating the rich peoples' places to gatherinformation, let's see what they have gotten so far behind the backing of the"real" Ciel Phantomhive. (I still remember the Ciel Ciel thing don't worry Ijust don't think this will be necessary now) So yeah, about the maids in thatmansion. Apparently the reason for this many maids in the house and thecontinuous search for them are revealed in the recent chapters (154-155) wherethe Baron himself is actually seeking for love. Firstly, there's the morninggreeting. Sucks to have to wait to eat breakfast to do this, but you know, he bea nice guy. The newbies are introduced to the master on his surprise returnafter a long trip I assume, and... someone got an invitation. Since I can't keepthe suspense, let's talk about reality. The Baron does this unusual move due tohim not seeking for love, but seeking for a replacement for his wife. Seeing hisage and still single, it'll be no wonder that he has lost his family in anaccident years ago and is not just unhappy with his wife and seeking physicalpleasure lmao. Or more likely, someone to complete his life ever since thattrauma hit him, literally. I wonder why he has to do the maids though (isn'tthat kind of lowering your status?), but suffice it to say that Meirin did getto see what happened, the head maid was kind enough to explain to her thesituation before letting her go, and Ranmao is the next target. And... unlikethe other newbie who just got a try-out and left the place (lmao it's like withclothing when you go shopping), she did not return. Which of course, can onlymean two outcomes. Either (1) she did somehow manage to suit herself (remembershe is Lau's bodyguard, that emotionless girl) into the Baron's favours andhopefully she's still a virgin after that night haha, or (2) she failed toprotect herself, as a bodyguard. Yeah. And from the last cut of the chapters, itmight be the latter. Man, that Baron must be RIPPED haha we don't know for sure.But one thing's for sure: she didn't win. And that might be an issue of concern.What will happen of Ranmao though? I guess we have not long to know of theanswer.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="497"              data-original-width="674"              height="235"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5_5IQL1YCAo/XZCaXOa2R8I/AAAAAAAA02o/G3pocSsGU-EtgMfW2ZGPg09-ddW2lvYTQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/15412.png"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How did the Baron find all the time to write all this himself?

Someone in the carpenter's house is surpassing Rin, literally andarguably the worst carpenter on the island who still bears its title (lol), andthe rest of the house is keeping it a secret from her. No one knows why, but acertain penguin (okay Misaki stop being aroused lol) is obsessed about who canmake such fine work, making intricate items out of wood. Looks like it can onlybe from the house, as Rin deduced, but apparently it's more than that, whichwill explain why Ikuto is not performing his usual social justice self bysolving the mystery haha. So yeah, Rin incidentally found out that the penguin(I don't want to write his name down since I can't remember haha) actually sleepwalks around the house, and surprisingly, makes his own woodwork in the middleof the night! Sure is weird for someone to be able to do this, but hey, thereason sells, so whatever lol. Turns out it's Mikoto, the ninja who also is anapprentice carpenter (I mean, is she though?) in the house, who is surpassingRin-chan in many ways than possible, which Ikuto would explain whatever ishidden inside the beautiful box that the penguin found up on the hills. Ninjaswould go there, the penguin doesn't know himself too probably, and the food onlycomes from Mikoto's place. Mystery solved. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The other is probably morerelatable for all of us, which is a day without Misaki in Ikuto's place. Tosummarise, there's Suzu-chan, Ikuto, that pig thing<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tonkatsu" target="_blank">Tonkatsu</a> (yep,the name), and Misaki, the imouto. So a day without her should be a day innormal as we have seen in the Anime which is probably still chaotic, but hey,after this many chapters later? Ikuto is believing that he is not buildingresistance to that haha bro you don't build resistance to sexual arousal lol.Anyways, sure is more interesting than other people's affairs (lol sorryRin-chan), and... I don't think I will miss this series haha when is it going toend though<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="638"          data-original-width="1134"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-21SWC2cNQ-g/XZClXQbcjYI/AAAAAAAA028/wcx_N3mcP0YGCkbL5vGbbNMcPj7HDlNnwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/168E11.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        The simple joys of life that's me with-      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span    >&nbsp;<span style="font-size: large;">Boku ga Boku de Aru Tame ni</span>  </div></blockquote>Since someone is translating this, I thought we should continue with it untilthe series ends then maybe I'll do the same thing as I did with "AmaetaiHi" bybuying the set. So, the "new" chapters (4-7) continue on the identity-changingstory between Shun and Ayumu, and honestly reading at this speed now instead ofraws? I feel bored. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's talk about it first. Firstly, we areintroduced to the new guy, Kouhei. Well, not really new since they all know eachother in middle school, but surely something happened, right? You don't have tochange into Ayumu to know this, Shun-kun. Still, that might still be somethinghard to uncover even by disguise standards, so let's leave it as that. Then,there's the slip-ups. Of course, Ayumu and Shun are fine without beingthemselves, especially Ayumu, but Shun slowly noticed that he could be someoneelse without being the timid, soft-spoken and restrained self that he has alwaysbeen. Is that good though? Only time will tell. But suffice it to say he gets toask a lot of questions from others about it, but gets some slip-ups when heforgets who he is by remembering stuff that this new classmate doesn't know, tothe not childhood friend. Mindf**k already? You're not alone. Again, way easierto understand with the translations, no joke. Lastly, the prelude to the end. Asseen in Chapter 4, and knowing that the truth has somewhat been revealed in thelatest chapters since a few months ago when I saw it (chapter 80+ orsomething?), somehow Shun-kun will be leaving again. Leaving as in, sayinggoodbye to his friends in school like he has to do in middle school. So comingback kinda sucks, and if things aren't settled between all these people as ofnow, it'll only get even more unsettling when he leaves again, I guess. And addin the others who will shortly join this middle school reunion party, and thingsmight get awkward when the truth about body-switching is out. Hey, no harmcaused, but there's romance involved, so the harm isn't just social, if you getwhat I mean. To end this, I think I'll try to see ahead on the conclusion andplan accordingly. If we do reach there than I may have to spend a weekendreading through... what is it now? 8 volumes? Well they are short but myreading's bad so we shall see. Again, subtle story, may be boring, but when thewaves hit you'll love this ride. Also, Sana-chan is that cute I can't even<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="429"          data-original-width="689"          height="199"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-31eKdKZ_sa8/XZCs_TLt7SI/AAAAAAAA03I/CGSGFyMqHsMau7kF7gVqnS6AoZchyEtVACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/0425.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Never thought of it like that with her in my middle school haha now I        live to regret      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br />Maybe I'll do this as a seasonal thing, ie. every three months in the spacebetween Anime seasons. Gives time for scans to be made and also won't force meto read stuff every week or month. Also, will cover some of the others nextweek, but seeing the Anime premier schedules...<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week has been quite a week at Klassic Note. And if I did say<b>Sunrise In My Attache Case's new album</b> is going to be hype, then I'mgravely wrong. Well it isn't, and as of now I haven't even decided what in thenew list I want to give. Okay, maybe one. But that's it. No good. Half the albumis on reserves now, which is bad considering it's all English songs and it'seither give or throw all in my case haha. <b>Ohara Yuiko's 1st album</b> afterlike what, 4 years since debut? Okay, whatever, but it isn't bad. I did mentionher melodies aren't great, but as mentioned before and even on Twitter, songproduction is making her songs better than ever, and that's a good thing. I'mloving 3 songs now because of this. She may not be the next big thing, but I'mglad I gave her another chance since that Anime theme song single. You can feelthis out with how many Tweets that had her name in it haha.&nbsp;<b  >Natsukawa Shiina's 1st EP</b>must be the highlight this week, and boy is it because it's released same day onApple Music Japan? I was wanting to b*tch about it on Twitter on how I didn'tget to hear it on time in streaming&nbsp; during lunch and I'm like "WHAT?"*looks back at Mocho and Ten-chan's song lists* "Is this some miracle??"<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (No one can relate, by the way, not even my co-workers or my friends)Okay I did that bit on Twitter already, so be sure to give her... concept EP achance? It's her in every other music style besides those that were from heralbum, in my opinion. Really, thought Aki-chan was in her new release for amoment lol the legacy must go on<br /><br />Most notably for next week is the fact that I will be giving<b>Mrs. GREEN APPLE's new album</b> a chance seeing how popular their musicvideos have been lately, and I'll get back to SIMAC when I am in the right mood.On Twitter, <b>Hashimoto Eriko is going solo</b> (well, is that surprising) witha new demo song music video which ain't bad (the song, not the video),<b>LuckLife is coming up with a new mini-album</b> due December (which I may notget to hear it again and if I do I might be disappointed lol),<b>yucat's new song is finally on Apple Music</b> after 2 months,<b>fumika's new album</b> revealed a long track list which is honestly just toomany for my ears already maybe, and I realised<b>Polkadot Stingray's mini-album is in three weeks</b>. That, I think I said itlast week liao so I'll save myself the shame haha. Also,<b>sphere's new single</b> for yet another Anime has a music video preview.Well, it's as much as you can expect haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I guess I'll stop here. I've been spending a lot of time doing up Klassic Notestuff (standardisation of file names is a bitc-) and maintenance of this PCsince I'm intending to let it survive till the end of the year which is comingso I better start planning what I want for my home PC from here on. Well, Iwon't have that much time to look at it though since I'm working BOOM GOT MEhaha but I want to make my home time entertainment better. You know, wordscoming out from a loner lol. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I hope Iwon't continue being bored at work I've been doing the same damn thing for thepast 2 months I think I need a career change TIME TO WRITE THAT RESIGNATIONLETTER haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
