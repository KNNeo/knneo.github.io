<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S--YEcKEUWU/XXznGRJ7pLI/AAAAAAAA0Z0/Rcu-tuvT29YyPcNOWdhsc-bStrZALSDFACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/araoto11_frowning.gif"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>I'm going to a friend's wedding lunch (yep, and yep) so I guess I'll watch thisearlier instead of on Sundays. Hmm, it might be my first wedding event where Iattend alone. And also wear casual. I don't even know what to wear now lol<br /><br />...<br /><br />Oops turns out it's next week well you're getting a preview of what will happennext issue anyways so... Okay it's my bad I'm sorry hey at least I don't have torush all the Anime today haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS210">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Just make sure they are not mistaken" HOHO Takagi making the moves here??    <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>  </div></blockquote>Takagi you piece of sh*t you could've taught him how to use stuff properlyinstead of sh*tting on him lol he's your guy you know. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this newepisode (#TakagiSanS210) Nishikata keeps coming up with ideas to defeat Takagilike he always does. But seriously, if Nishikata were a war general he'll bedemoted real quick lol. And as with each episode, this one also fills me withjealousy. I just didn't mention this every time because it'll piss someone elseoff haha. Okay, what happened. Firstly, it's about eye drops? I think this isthe first time in my many years of watching Anime that I witnessed administeringof eyedrops. Did they do that in "Hataraku Saibou"? I don't care. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Anyways, Nishikata's eyes are tired, Takagi-sensei gave him eye drops so hiseyes won't feel too dry, but as with all of us (or not) we are too afraid toapply it ourselves. (I'm in my mid-20s already dammit haha) So yeah, apparentlythis can also be made into a shoubu, so whatever Takagi wins whoever is thetarget she wins anyways. (I would love for Takagi to walk away when he closeshis eyes though that'll make of good comedy and won't appear in this romanceAnime) And yes, if the focus isn't that someone just walked in to them doing it(lol) I don't know what is. Yukari-chan saw it apparently, and decided totell... well Honjou-san, for starters, about it. Seemingly duped by Honjou'slie, she continues to spread this supposed rumour of them two kissing to her twofriends which... (Okay did Mina-chan just make a KANA-BOON joke?) (Well<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kanabun" target="_blank">it's a thing</a> btwso I guess...) they don't believe because it's not qualifying as a "scoop"? Suregirls, whatever you say. (I have a scoop too! Mocho's new single review is onlydue next week! Aw... haha) Next up, after school activities since school onesare boring and playing with someone else of the opposite gender is moreimportant lmao. You try telling that to anyone in the streets and see if they<strike>believe it</strike> have such a middle school life haha. Ignoringreality checks, Nishikata decided to play a game of hide and seek throughout thetown?? He starts out with a game of rock paper scissors... I think Nishikata hasbeen secretly practicing to lose at Takagi&nbsp; in this (<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span> mobile game<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span>) and of course it isn't without reason. He then set out the rules to be30 minutes and covers all ground within the town. With such obvious clues likethis, either one would make it an impossible mission to find someone that fast,or you will play the reverse and stay somewhere close to the starting position.There you go, saved you the trouble of watching Nishikata's stupidity takeaction lol. I think he needs some education on common sense lol. And once again,very coincidentally (lol), people walked in to their hiding place (well notdirectly) and stayed around so they can't leave. I mean, why leave, right? Sothought Honjou and his new boy (lol) Hamaguchi, who kindly offered a drink fromhis bag while taking a break from the walk home? Hey, we gotta find somewhere tosit down and talk. Sadly the girl doesn't seem to be doing much in return so Idon't know where this will be going lol. So blah blah Takagi decided that... Ican't use Chinese proverbs here, but yeah, keeping thr rumours true will help,so it probably made Nishikata jump with those zero centimeter vibes (I got yourback, Ohara Yuiko haha) and... I guess everyone else will keep theirrelationship a secret. Again, it's not a good thing to let the school knowyou're in a relationship in Japan, depending on the school of course. So themain couple left, and on the way back they saw a piece of paper on the groundwhich Takagi picked up (see what she did here) and saw what looked like atreasure map? And then they went treasure hunting. You think Takagi has plannedthis like that one Kaguya-sama so to spend more time with the guy she likes?Haha I doubt so, but she sure is enjoying it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span> Anyways, Takagi teases hisboy by asking him what happens if the treasure turns out to be a porno magazineand they can't think of ways to hide it and probably will get confiscated by theteacher by bringing it to school the next day... *getting deja vuhallucinations* (KONOBI GO AWAY) Haha okay it wasn't any of that, but it was aspot under a tree. What spot it might be we don't know, but Takagi the smartgirl deduced it to be a kissing spot?? So why would people label their kissingspot via a map placed on the streets again? I don't know haha. But hey, I sureknow this is Anime filler since it featured a music listening session under thetree with the two of them which suspiciously transitions into the unique endingtheme of Takagi singing the first season opening theme. I mean, come on. Soelaborate, Anime. And then they got the author to write this into one of theepisodes so they can use it this season as if it's canon? Naughty girl, Takagi.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> To end this, someone give me the recorder version of the opening themein the soundtrack or we riot blah blah haha bye<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p5NpqdGt0wY/XXzZkMKr1HI/AAAAAAAA0Yw/f4-R3gVGF5Au-oq_A5_-h-9ZmeKh8gVSQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/takagisanS2_10_eyedrop.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Wow this Anime thing is sooooo real lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bx1_AipzWp4/XXzZkqV9WMI/AAAAAAAA0Y0/fkT8quqWZ8MXjWSgOAhrrZprCR0Qh-4BQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/takagisanS2_10_hamaguchi.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This reminds me of the coffee manly thing Nishikata did in that one            episode so much I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Mo-chin I choose you~)  </div></blockquote>Haha I like how Sonezaki is always defending for the wrong people that's why wehave those Hong Kong protests yo~ Haha nonsensical political jokes aside let'stalk about this new episode (#AraOto11) yes? (I privated this blog so they can'tcatch me lol) (Google no~) Ahem, in this new episode where everyone decides tokeep their mouths shut even though we know clearing things up is more important,we finally confirm that Kazusa is straight. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hey, I got to be half asweird as Mo-chin, right? But apparently, everyone is going bonkers haha let'stalk about them. (Long paragraph warning again, in case you need this) Let'sstart with... Jujou, I suppose? Well, there isn't much to talk about besides nowthe whole school knows about it especially Sonezaki, so she's getting into afit. We'll leave her out first, so let's talk about Mo-chin for a bit. Herthinking is pushing into Kazusa once again, and she is real worried for hermaybe as a friend maybe as she avoids the "tomo yo" thing and warns her aboutSugawara. Sugawara, however, has ditched her life to go have sex with- She can'tdo it. We treasure our lives too much, including her. She won't do it. Not evenfor money. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah, as the selfish people we are (lol not reality checkbtw), she instinctively punched the sensei which is probably the best punishmentwe'll see of that guy (lol because of white nostrils I mean you know his hair isalso white?) and we might not see that man again for a while after this hotelvisit. Moving on, Sugawara continues to press on by kindly warning Kazusa abouther confession to her boyfriend, and... Kazusa doesn't mind? I seriously didn'tthink the result was weird to me until she ran down the streets lol, but what Ithought WAS weird is the process of talking through it. I'm like, "Isn't thislike that musical they were doing during the school festival??" <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Uh, no?Then why... oh well at least they got things ironed out, but I must say thisfeels so unreal, if it's not canon material I wouldn't be surprised haha. Then,Kazusa hurriedly runs home to see her boy. I don't know how you can think doingit with the guy seals the deal (I guess she "learned" it from Jujou lolseriously?) but suffice it to say she is not taking in excuses from the best manin the series who will kindly tell her that he likes her not for the puss (oops)but she still won't believe it because she knows someone else will come in andsteal the man. Hey, you have no confidence in your relationship? Apart from thatJujou-san burn (lol we are sorry),&nbsp; you would think that Izumi is going toget his boner up and love Sugawara forever- Maybe that'll happen too I'm notgoing to rule out the possibility but (lmao) suffice it to say you should keepthat pair of crotchless panties Kazusa you might need it sometime in the future-Oh she cut it up into shreds. Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Moving on to Sonezaki, weprobably are concluding the series of Anime with a climactic ending, and itstarts within the school. Being spotted on the streets near a love hotel,Sonezaki and Amagi are in their way to be punished by the school which ofcourse, as stated by the Vice Principal, is a convenient way to set new schoolrules to ban boy-girl relationships on the ground. (I seriously thought it wasdue to them proliferating that stuff ever since the festival since they were thebiggest news since then) Since we all know what really happened and the couplebeing spotted on the streets was probably a mistake just like how Hongo-san wasspotted with Milo-sensei was a mistake (lol <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span>), Milo-sensei chose to helpdefend the couple by implicating himself int his mess before Hongo could. That,as much as it is a brave act, is not going to change things since the VicePrincipal is evil (I mean, the Principal comes to school in his pajamas how canhe be evil lol), so the girls of the Literature Club decide to do the criminalthing by - I would believe this since it's Anime - kidnapping Milo-sensei andholding him hostage so they could negotiate with the school's leaders to revokethe recent changes and charges to the school and the students. Hey, the show'sgotta end in something. Figured out that this would be decent enough of anending. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I dig the climax btw (lol not esuibatsu I promise), and I thinkwe can all see how this will end. Looks like next episode will be a fun one,amongst all things. But I could also see, from this episode, how much it staystrue to the title of the series. Not because of the words specifically mentionedshortly before Milo-sensei was kidnapped (lol), but more on the feels. So far ithas been wild, wrong, totally irresponsible and rash. That, is a good butconfusing setup to a series which bears its own title to the fullest. And that,I can't wait to see what is in store for the final episode. This, everyone, isgoing to be great.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JGBipUS2GiQ/XXzl-sbwf-I/AAAAAAAA0ZU/HbIi-fHrFbEr49bmuR5sIVvk1LZ9KvOuwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/araoto11_chop.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Things that don't happen in real life<br />            (Prove me wrong haha)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-flBgD8RvY3g/XXzl_Z3OHcI/AAAAAAAA0ZY/rIHC1D9Y9jU_ADO3O310vEKEAxXnKc3qQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/araoto11_crotch.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Things that don't happen in real life<br />            (Prove me wrong haha)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I put her as my first but is it too late for her toreach the top now? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this surprisingly emotional new episode(#JoshiMuda11) we are... man, is it really unfair to do this now? I'm in literaltears right now btw because of the story. Since this is not all over the placelike last week, we can talk about it using one topic, and that is aboutaspiration and fanatics. I'm sure we are fans of someone who makes creative workat some point now that you watch this lol, but think about it yourself: How muchof you will be able to meet the guy in person and convey your feelings that youhave epxerienced so far about him or her? Well, for Akane, this one went on afull package, to say the least. So yeah, as with last episode's preview, Akanewants to tell his beloved Teishotoku-P (nailed it) (sorry for last week Istriked it off already haha) how she feels about his songs. You know, the musicproducer that is Waseda, her form teacher in school. The first part is... aninspiration story lol, as the Anime tries really hard to write a song (I mean,in case you don't know, manga authors don't write melodies but lyrics they can)and fit in the lyrics as ironically as they can do Waseda's afternoon haircutsession lmao, and... if you listen closely they do make sense, but thankgoodness this guy still knows how to write a song to not make us want toremember his haircut lol. As good as the songs might be (we got like, two songpreviews this episode too), they aren't getting much attention besides ultimatefan "akane-san" (IKR is it not obvious enough) who, of course, loves his musicto the core since it helped her through tough times in her life. I would arguethat about the songs I've listened over the past decade, but this is where it'llset Akane and me apart: the fan meet in a doujin event. Okay, how this is fanmeeting thing more awkward than that one from<a  href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-obS-C3z0Hpo/XX94L8uXnMI/AAAAAAAA0dY/QigtNrKdj_UwuwKEmuIPFa4Mj5BXr5_XACKgBGAsYHg/s320/tadakun04_praying_crop.gif"  target="_blank"  >Anime "Tada-kun"</a>? Well, apart from the joke in itself that is this series, the show triesreally hard to make jokes as well as progress the story from Waseda realisingit's his student who idolises him instead of a matured university/collegestudent (lol), tries to disguise himself so not to disappoint Akane (I mean, hecould've substituted the fat guy in and it won't even matter) but then theteacher kind of realised that deceiving the fan after so long might not be awise thing, so he revealed his identity eventually after all that covering. Itmight be a shock to Akane (I mean, it would be one to me too tbh), but yes I'vebeen waiting to say this since the beginning and add in the "me too" in this,but I don't care who you look like, because I still like who you are in acreative work no matter what. Listen to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/primaryyuiko" target="_blank">yuiko</a>and you tell me if I should care about<a  href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1040955013630025730"  target="_blank"  >how she looks</a>(you have been warned haha she chubby face though not the best example) from herrecent reveals on Twitter. All in all, a surprisingly lovely episode which mightbe Anime filler (prove me wrong haha) (Edit: Okay it isn't haha wow), but hey atleast it motivated Akane to not write the BL path for her manga lmao. All waslovely and emotional until I have to end off this episode's talk with Majou.Well, besides her superior fortune telling which I wish she could also help meon my romance haha (if it shows it's her I can take her too, whatever), she alsohinted on what the final episode of the series would be, and it's about Tanaka.Considering she is dumb enough to eat cold food despite Majou's accurateanalysis of her future, who knows what might happen to her in the last episodeof the series. They probably won't kill her but will come close enough haha ifthey do kill her then Yamamoto will take the top spot in popularity FOREVER lolI'll never get tired from having a cute idiot run this series we never have one(prove me wrong) and it's one who likes to climb to high spots to be saved everytime maybe she should get her fortune told by Majou as insurance haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ah3CmC2M6jQ/XX2pCJbbh8I/AAAAAAAA0a8/9oyao7U9pogfv_EDC6grMfGd-uB6Bt2vwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/jyoshimuda11_hairwash.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            WTF is with this hair wash position lmao<br />            (I did this once btw not in this position though lol)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gJ90BBxjlng/XX2pDONDx2I/AAAAAAAA0bA/E2p1tlgkz44LSYB__3mA5A7vnWfOAgi2QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/jyoshimuda11_waseda2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Embarrassingly, this is what I'll look like when I review Mocho's            single next week          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Wota's singing is going to suck because it's Anime- *hears her sing* Okayit's Tomacchan singing her best <b>YES</b> haha we need the soundtrack on theseplease do it (Also they should collaborate, Waseda and Akane but seriously whoknows if it isn't already?) (OMFG it's included in the final Blu-Ray volume ofthe series!!!)<br />P.P.S. Since I have a spare postscript lol, let's talk about<a  href="https://twitter.com/jyoshimuda/status/1172344146721263617"  target="_blank"  >the popularity survey</a>!! The manga author nailed most of it by associating popularity with amount ofappearances in the series so far, and if this episode can't tell you which JK ison the top of my list then you can put her at No.2 haha. Besides Loli and thatidiot (lmao) (oh yah Waseda too get rid of him I'm not gay haha) I'll agree onmost of the Top 10 imo<br />[Okay I still think this can be a joke for the series, but glancing through themanga I now really want to read through it but maybe after the Anime ends andthey persist on not doing a season two haha Majou's stories are rather funny Iwould argue AKANE MVP!!!

Hey, I was so bored until I decide tolike a new song that hasn't been released yet, okay? Haha talking about you,<b>No Buses and your new album</b> just lost to that one music video you justreleased this week somehow. I guess I should go back to find some indie Rock I'mmissing those feels already. Speaking of feels,<b>FIVE NEW OLD's new album</b> is definitely the opposite of that, since I haveno feels as to what their style might give me, and that might not be a goodthing, for starters. To be frank? I tried to give chance but all I could give isthe topic song. Maybe this retro style isn't for me but that makes me wonder howI can give people like Sambomaster or even Yoru no Honki Dance.<b>SIX LOUNGE's new single</b> might be great, but so far I've only given thetopic song since I'm honestly not in the mood to listen to an emotional song(you know, it doesn't keep my work life going), so I may come back to this one.And speaking of coming back releases, <b>Base Ball Bear</b> just got anothersong on my list from their latest EP which I hesitated to give. I guess it cameback to me haha<br /><br />Next week... I mean, if I ONLY mention <b>cinema staff's best album</b> nextweek on Twitter and NOTHING ELSE then I'm sorry haha. We shall see. Thisrecently initiated Colleciton Artist in Klassic Note is making waves, and if Ireally get bored even on their indie releases then maybe I'll take a trip to<b>Audioleaf</b>. During work. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> On Twitter and the Internet, stop hypingme for Natsu kawa Shiina's new EP due end of the month,<b>Kawano Marina's re-debut 2nd single</b> is due this November and has a titleand produced by the guy who did her very first single for Anime (it's"A-Channel" btw), and <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES came up with a music video</b> incollaboration with whoever Rozalina is lol.<br /><br />Note to self: Follow more artists so you can pad this part of the blog postevery week haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Wow, I still can't believe I'm doing this long post talking about Anime andmusic every week since like, as long as I can remember. Yeah, since the previousblog that I migrated from. Played the collectible games on GTA Online thisweekend (yes that 6-year-old game) just to get more money and remember the timesI enjoyed that game. Oh well. I'll just wait for Rockstar to give me morein-game money just by logging in. Yes, I'm going to do that later too haha. Cyaguys next week then, and until next time... I want to spend more time playinggames instead of sleeping and playing those free-to-play games that burns mostof my days away I think I'm stuck like the rest of them kids I'm just glad Idon't have to watch ads to play any of them haha bye<br /><br />P.S. KIRARA FANTASIA HURRY UP AND SUPPORT ANDROID 10 OR I WILL QUIT THE GAMEFOREVER lol they don't care<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
