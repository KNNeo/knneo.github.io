You're wrong. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Yes, I'm back, I have to do OT like soon, so I'll post this early. If there areany news I missed in the Klassic Note segment because that's when people like topost stuff on Twitter, I'll talk about them next week. Remember, only Takagi-sanwill be updated tomorrow haha <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span><br /><br />Let's start. If you noticed the site changed again I must have failed atrestoring and patching this place over the weekend haha *looks aside* lol let'sstart<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TejinaSenpai02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Tejina Senpai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Even Physics has abandoned her" You're damn right dude her jugs just shake    so much it defies Physics too lol  </div></blockquote>"Do you have something long and hard?" Wow for a moment but thank goodness youthrew out the ruler or else... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this weirder episode(#TejinaSenpai02) it's not about magic anymore it's just logic ie. how dumb theSenpai can be lol. To be honest? I think the Senpai is me irl but I don't knowmagic and I'm not a woman. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Oh also I'm not a masochist haha. Anyways,about this episode. Unlike the Assistant who doesn't get to leave, I think I'mleaving haha. Let's talk about why. In this episode, the show still kind ofholds to its style from the first episode, delivering kind of half-assed magictricks, mostly ecchi stuff, and a little lack of progression mainly becauseagain, it repeats itself every time, the skeleton of this series. To recap, it'sSenpai screws it up, Assistant comes for the save (or not), and things somehowget worse. Pretty much evidently seen in every part, from smoking a super spicycurry because she accidentally kicked the bottle into it, to doing a quickchange of clothes trick only to notice she didn't bring a change of clothes...The author is literally using the same technique Senpai uses to bring us totheir attention, and it's not magic. We are also, of course, given an insight toSenpai's loner character and self-enthusiasm after Assistant-kun realised thatthis is not even a club yet, so he is already stuck with her for the next 3years poor dude (well maybe 2 if Senpai doesn't do a<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ronin" target="_blank">ronin</a> lmao), whichalso means I should just let him suffer alone and leave. So yeah, I think I amdropping this series after all. It barely made me laugh from the same trick, itdoes offer some insight to some magic tricks which I do not know of (say thecoin into a cup trick) but otherwise... I did not laugh as much as I expectedthis to be. To end this, the closest reference I can bring myself to associatethis series to is sadly, "Aho Girl". But now the surrounding topic is magic, andthe style is very, very dry humour. "Aho Girl" is just stupid humour, but thisone makes sure you only think about panties and boobs haha. So yeah, nice magic,but as one of the kids said in the park, "She's boring". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I just feelbad for her now because she's going to do magic alone- Oh wait the sacrifice isthere now I'M FREE lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s_CE1GRIr_4/XSqPb8x4z8I/AAAAAAAAypQ/S8g9QCeScmUQajTaZtXeIwbfI3QcBfBeACLcBGAs/s320/tejinasenpai02_trick.jpg"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            What this series makes you think it's like          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B4ajAEufhSk/XSqPdxpRiRI/AAAAAAAAypU/oqdvc8lzqFsqj_YnHCO86cSI0N58jRIkgCLcBGAs/s320/tejinasenpai02_assistant1.jpg"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            What this series actually is lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. The best part about this guy, the Assistant, is that he looks at the ecchistuff so far and doesn't react or tell anyone about it. Now THAT is what I callpersonal entertainment lmao ok he did say it but she dumb af lol<br />P.P.S. I'll still watch the Twitter mini-series though because why not those arethe real pros teaching Ede-chan (Hondo Kaede) and Rieri (Takahashi Rie) the realtricks which we might also not be able to see haha why can't they just spoil onetrick and let us see them fail performing it? lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AraOto02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "It's (my crotch) is still itchy!" Goddamn haha  </div></blockquote>Kazusa don't you EVER say you want Pepperoni haha actually I think Hawaiian isalso bad lmao (because... the taste of semen- I think I know too much lol) okayin this never-ending series of an episode (#AraOto02) I can never stop jokingon, "I'll die a virgin" might be the best summary to this episode to be honest.Okay, jokes aside, let's talk story. I mean, with such a cliffhanger of a firstepisode, it really makes me wonder what happened to this series, but I guesswith this episode I may have a better idea, and I think&nbsp; might sit in forthe ride. Firstly, Sugawara-san gets picked up. Hey, we be glad we are her,attractive and all, but yeah, not all of them are b*tches, to be frank. So yeah,coming from a theatre background, someone taught her to fight those people off.Thanks to help from Kazusa, they both had to act like they can't be f**ked ie.the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/seibyou" target="_blank">STD</a> thing sothat the guy will not approach her again. But as the girl said, it will comeback to haunt her (not the itch lol) so yeah, this can only be but a temporarysolution. I mean, is that how it is to be so attractive or are they just in thewrong neighbourhood? Talking about that, the girls in school continue to sh*t onSonezaki as she fails to do the... (I don't know what you call that) that jumpthing during PE, and people comment on her... I'm not going to repeat what theysaid. In perspective, she didn't say no or argue back, so that might besomething to think about for us watchers. Closing in her relationship with...Amagi the guy who praised her looks last episode, the guy got to see for himself(us too tbh) how great she looks without that pair of glasses. Haha that's funand all, which already makes you wonder what might have happened in the past.Yeah, that's going to be hell of a backstory waiting to hit us in the face, Itell you. Again, just look back at the title haha. Then, Izumi thinks he canstop Kazusa from thinking of whatever happened in his room. I mean, if it's not"esuibatsu" you can't stop a girl from thinking about it, but it's more for whatis without. Someone tried to confess to the guy, and he said no. Okay, maybe.And it pissed the childhood friend off. She thinks that he might be thinkingabout "esuibatsu" all the time (the name is good but I'll have to put quotes onthis lest you guys forgot they meant it as se-) but she is wrong, as mentionedby Sugawara later in the episode. Then again, also from Sugawara like as if sheis surrounded by wise people, men don't think like this. Especially men who havedone it alone. "Esuibatsu", I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To end it off, they let an epiphanyhit Kazusa because... why would you ask about your childhood friend going outwith girls when you keep thinking it's not with you? Because... yeah, you likethe guy. And then you remember that he jerks off in his room watching porn (thatscene popped up more times than I expected this episode tbh) and suddenly yourcrotch feels itchy lmao. Most importantly though, this episode ended with aheavy hit: the Literature Club is to be disbanded. Why? Mostly environmentalreasons because I swear the Principal also does what Izumi did too but in hisoffice lol, but that they don't have an advisor. So yeah, goodbye LieratureClub, you will be missed. Now get out there and get f**ked you maidens haha it'stime to- Oh wait, it's not happening? I mean, we have already proven that halfthe girls have done it already, right? No? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, this series is asconfusing as it's fast-paced, so I guess we shall see where this takes us.Hopefully not to hell but to some happy ending. Hey, I like 5 girls who can fallin love. Sadly for this series it might be in the manner of them getting laid.You know what I mean. Again, you can go ahead and do all those so long as Idon't see it. Wait, really? Okay I changed my mind please don't do it justsaying Izumi from first episode is enough haha please don't<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c6Ts_P5CJzk/XSqPpz-FpPI/AAAAAAAAypY/w_XoVU9EOL4dSVL6OxehmdK3ORduSNx3wCLcBGAs/s320/araoto02_agreement.jpg"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            It's like the G20 conference recently with the trade wars going on            lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7kP0jtilTlg/XSqPsJx5qcI/AAAAAAAAypc/f0ss5Fb8rMQx1X5JKJpJy1mJMk6hNvuMACLcBGAs/s320/araoto02_kazusa3.jpg"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            My reaction this whole epiosde and probably the rest of this series          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Finally, the role of reacting tostupid jokes lies in our hands now. Man, in this season full of idiots in theslice-of-life genre? It's making me tired just watching them haha. Why would Iwatch this though? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Now that I think about it, maybe I shouldn't thisis too tiring to watch haha where are all the romance shows?? Anyways, thisshow... man, how should I start. Comparing it to "Asobi Asobase" doesn't evengive that show justice (but seriously that is way better than this one haha),but yeah, it's another stupid slice-of-life show that requires your fullestattention. Think like "Tejina Senpai" above but no one is doing the retortionsie. tsukkomi. Well there's Akane, for starters. I wish I have Tomacchan (TomatsuHaruka) doing the tsukkomi to the jokes in my life (in absolute contrast to herrole in Anime "WWW.WORKING!!!") (sorry for all the references here I gottaexplain how bad this show is sorry) so I'd be satisfied, but hey, dealing withthe one is enough. Then, there's Shiori, who is real smart just in firstimpression but then you'll notice she's a Biology nerd who keeps petri dishes inher bag. (You wanna sample my fluids anytime you now what I mean?) And then forthe most part, we have the idiot. Again, there can only be one idiot in my brainfor Anime, and I finished watching Anime "Aho Girl" not because of Yoshiko,so... Tanaka, you lost. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ignoring all secondary characters including theone teacher who likes university girls ie. above 18 instead of high school girls(also known as JK), this show is filled with people who have... concrete goalsin life. No really, even for Tanaka here too. Just that for her aspiration toget laid in high school especially in a girls' school, that is sadly nothappening. How dumb can she get though? Your guess is as good as mine. As ofthis first episode which aired last week, only some of the characters are great(for example you remove Tanaka and this will be infinitely better haha), Ipersonally dig the opening theme song in creativity (not the first time I heardof such a style), but otherwise you get a full-on sh*tshow that is going to makeyou cry because you'll need to take aspirin halfway through every episode. Soyeah, twice every episode. For 12 of them. I hope your liver is ready. So yeah,I'm giving this up after all. Really, I want to laugh.

TIL there's a family name known as "Ninomae" My brain just gotshort-wired for like, 20 seconds lol you idiots watched Anime "Hitori Bocchi"??lol (I'll take note this is a good naming... method? haha)<br />[TL;DR If you liked Anime "Pop Team Epic" this is the show for you I promise]<br /><br /><div style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid var(--foreground); padding: 4px 8px;">  [Update 2019.07.17: The thing that sucks about watching Anime on a Wednesday  is that I'm tired from work everyday and I still have to be awake to watch  this haiz why you not let me watch on Monday maybe we should put a previous  episode review on watch in the weekend instead]  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS202">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">(quote)</div>  </blockquote>  "Hey, Nishikata" That's the cue, guys. It's coming, the drop from our tease  master. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#TakagiSanS202) if I'm Nishikata I'll  gladly get duped by Takagi-san in every turn haha. So yeah, this time there's  more, but again, I like the focus on showing much affection from Takagi that  the guy she likes will probably never understand. Again, Nishikata isn't that  smart like all of us too, so... maybe give us better hints and stop bullying  him? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know, right? This social justice thing is only going to get me  a friendship with the guy. That's it haha. Anyways, story. Firstly, it's the  ice. (Nope, not that kind) Again, I live near the equator so ice is not a  thing here for the past 20 odd years (and will never be), so I wouldn't  understand how it feels to carry ice from puddles frozen on the ground. So  yeah, Takagi takes a bet with Nishikata stating the following conditions:  whoever brings the largest piece of ice to school wins, but immediately loses  if dropped on the ground. So as expected, Nishikata took a large chunk off  that puddle while Takagi takes enough such that in the case Nishikata drops it  on the ground hers will still be big enough to take to school. (And that's why  you shouldn't be dumb enough too to just take a piece smaller than your  fingernail because it'll melt quick lol) Anyways, Takagi succeeded in letting  Nishikata drop his piece of ice by telling about the punishment, and man, just  imagining it is enough to make him drop. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So in return he has to warm  her hands. With his hand warmer. What do you think it is? *laughhs* I would be  dumb enough to just use my hands though but yeah Nishikata will just die of  embarrassment, which is what happened next. The next morning, Nishikata told  Takagi that he changed his appearance over the night, and asks her to figure  out where. So too bad Takagi has a Masters Degree in logic (lol) while  Nishikata has a Masters Degree in embarrassment lmao. Won't explain what  happened as Takagi looks desperately around the guy she likes (or so we think)  (haha think too much and you lose) and figured out it's his hair since this  and nails are to be honest, the easiest things to change in appearance  overnight. Idiot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, we got to shit on Yukari's poorly cut bangs  (ie. That there is nothing left) too haha and Mina gets one in return. "Just  to make myself feel better I'm going to sh*t on you" is the idea haha  Yukari-chan you are starting to think like a me lol. Lastly, it's Valentine's  Day. Wait, that soon? Happy Valentine's Day everybody haha. Besides Mina-chan  who got her chocolate confiscated (for the school day at least) because she  was handing it out blatantly in class (and the loner guys want it too)  (including me haha), everyone else got their fair share. You know, from  Mano-chan who tried to give her "book" back to Nakai (man, that was lovely to  watch it's very  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kyun" target="_blank">kyun</a> and I like  it) (also Nakai should not hang out with those friends who just blurt out  romantic moments you jerks wait till you get one of those which is never BOOM  haha) to Nishikata looking around the whole day to expect someone to give him  chocolate (ie. Takagi) and did not get anything unti the end of the day in his  shoe closet, still probably hasn't figured out whether (1) it's from the girl  or (2) if it's  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/honmei" target="_blank">honmei</a> or  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/giri" target="_blank">giri</a>. Get f**ked,  Nishikata. And once again, Takagi-san, you are not going to get laid at this  rate tbh <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, they two better off than me already haha sadded maybe  next episode won't be this sad for me lol<br />  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="900"                data-original-width="1600"                height="180"                src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-11K01XDRTq4/XS8uVQQLYsI/AAAAAAAAyt8/MBpg3EuemewMljxGED2VlV282eDv7o6nQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS202_tickle.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This guy is so lucky he doesn't even know haha            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="900"                data-original-width="1600"                height="180"                src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FYE2DTDpUM/XS8uWyrSNQI/AAAAAAAAyuA/0SpTR9txJBM-ac6Qrm028U-G7cyby89JgCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS202_hand.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This guy is so lucky he doesn't even know haha            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. I like how I see the credits and see someone familiar like say, Koga Aoi,  and I'm like "I don't care if she's in this" and I immediately sound like a  Nishikata lmao haha but seriously though only those main guys matter<br />  P.P.S. Now that I notice I'm actually as dumb as Nishikata or just slightly  smarter than him so I'm&nbsp; not going to do that "Karakai Kaihi" thing I did  in season one I'm sorry Nishikata you may be dumb but it's pot calling kettle  here haha<br />  [Lastly, I would like to say I like the flow of the series so far. From seeing  Mano-chan give chocolate to that immediate cut of the guys who still got  nothing haha man they are really making this better than season one and I LIKE  IT haha here's a GIF just becasue]<br />  <table    align="center"    cellpadding="0"    cellspacing="0"    class="tr-caption-container"    style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"  >    <tbody>      <tr>        <td style="text-align: center;">          <img loading="lazy"            border="0"            data-original-height="180"            data-original-width="320"            height="180"            src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ssdkFS7W1s8/XS8wQCKUK6I/AAAAAAAAyuM/sgDsjf94rHg8vJ96qBy0nvhyU_0e-_CEwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS202_laughing.gif"            style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"            width="320"          />        </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">          This is me when I have to laugh at someone haha        </td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table></div><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kuroshitsuji</span>  </div></blockquote>Wow it has been some time, so let's catch up on what happened after the drop.(Eh, still using "Ciel Ciel" as the original since Chapter 1, and "Other Ciel"as the one in the house now) In the latest chapters (151-153), we continue onwhat happened after Ciel Ciel had to escape due to his brother's "revival". Ohwell, that aside, but yes, Other Ciel is living the damn live in literally whatwas the reconstructed Phantomhive mansion, alone with Tanaka and the Undertaker.That's it. So yeah, they'll need to staff up, to say the least. Also, he visitedhis relatives and trolled the sh*t out of them about being back alive, but hey,they gotta believe it. We also got a little insight into Ciel Ciel's plans afterOther Ciel took over his position. Man, that was quite the steal, but human mindare to be believed on the return of a dead person through Shinigami powers thanthe one who has survived the ordeal... albeit through a demon. Hey, both areevil, so whatever haha. Anyways, Meirin and Ran are hired in a mansion up Northof town, and of course, despite suspicion, they are hired. Of course they can'tbe there to do house chores only since Meirin can hardly do anything but killpeople lol, so that's that. But before they are to be found out, they, like theother 6 people involved here in Ciel Ciel's group, have a mission: to find outif any blood-drawing activities exist within the grounds. And if so, it must beeliminated to technically cut off Other Ciel's supplies because technically thatboy is a vampire now haha. So yeah, sure is abrupt, but this will be excitingthan any other arcs ever, so I wish this will have an awesome conclusion. Somescrew-ups are bound to happen, but if it is what it takes to take revenge...before Ciel Ciel could take revenge for the Phantomhive family, then so be it.Hey, no one said there aren't cheating. All of them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="436"          data-original-width="835"          height="167"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FVLw3Fr9m-I/XSrgsGLJ_WI/AAAAAAAAyqY/CDOXtK3hXzQnQJmB9BdWkxu_O39ID2UuACLcBGAs/s320/152_12.png"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I <i>knew </i>the housekeeper was lesbian lol<br />        (Also, thanks for fanservice hehe)      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>P.S.

Not that theyare awesome, so I topped them up with a couple more releases just in case haha.<b>Horie Yui's new album</b> should be a highlight considering her previous was4 years ago and I only gave one song, this one proved to be impressive incontrast. I think I missed her singing haha. Anyways, I started with what wasonly the album topic song (music video on YouTube btw) and then ended up givingan emotional song and... hey Kiyoshi Ryujin (composer of Sumipe's latest singletopic song btw) we meet yet again turns out I can't resist your work. So yeah,Hocchan wins this week haha. <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> is okay, I'll givethe topic song because this is the closest to her getting caught and tied up (ifyou watched the music video haha) but the B-side was not impressive. Hey, yougotta be like Mocho she's on a roll recently with Anime theme songs haha. (Yes,I meant it as a joke it's pure coincidence and MusicRayn's hard at work) I alsotook a listen to <b>Cidergirl's latest single</b> by giving these guys a chanceagain after many times missing the target, I think I can give a B-side, to behonest. The Chinese love phrase references may be too much, but I'll deal withit since the melody is catchy. All in all, a fun week to listen songs to. It'snot a lot, but Hocchan filled in the gaps hehe<br /><br />Next week on schedule brings us... nothing. Yeah, I get to take a brek again, Iguess. Maybe it is time to go listen to new songs out there if I'm not too busywith work and fixing this site for the 27th time this month lmao<br /><br />On Twitter news, I'm hooked to <b>ChiCO with HoneyWork's new song</b> for Anime"Araoto", somehow also to whatever hip-hop song<b>opening theme for "Mudazukai"</b> (reviews above btw),<b>ClariS' new cover album</b> of oldies include that one song I have heard themost number of times for the duration of Klassic Note (if you wonder it's"secret base ~Kimi ni Kureta Mono~" if you haven't heard it before yourlistening experience is not long enough haha), and I heard a short of<b>Porno Graffitti's new song</b> in a TV program live... it's okay? I'llprobably give it anyways maybe<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center">  <div dir="ltr" lang="ja">    【今週にApple Music】<br />    ほっちゃん4年ぶりのアルバム、また俺の青春に連れて行くんだ。<br />    <br />    ぜひ、17歳の堀江由衣にｗｗ<a href="https://t.co/LUvtHlEqJl" target="_blank"      >https://t.co/LUvtHlEqJl</a    >  </div>  — Kaineng (@KlassicNote)  <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1148757517289193472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank"    >July 10, 2019</a  ></blockquote><script  async=""  charset="utf-8"  src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>(*It means the same thing as<a  href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1148759196487172096?s=20"  target="_blank"  >the English one</a>btw, just slightly different in expression) (Notice the one Like there hehe)<br />Before I end, I think you may have noticed I...
