<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--KrEqZn8M3E/XTPmiJxESsI/AAAAAAAAy0w/NYgYEJWfFq8ZmO2k4_jRRK6R3_imBpOLACLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda02_BLeyes.gif"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>Is this what it feels to work? Getting tired and sleeping for the weekend? Well,that' my life now lol<br /><br />Anyways, change of plans for this week's Entertainment News. Since I'll bepicking up that JK Anime (lol review below, last week's episode btw) here's thefollowing arrangement: There will be an Anime Extra with Takagi and the latestepisode of JoshiMuda instead of Takagi here so I can catch up with the otherAnime too, and from here on I'll start Entertainment News with last week'sTakagi so I don't have to do the extra border thing haha I hope someone noticedit<br /><br />Why? Because... it's easier. Because I can sleep on weekdays too. Haha let'smove on I'm sad I can't even watch long YouTube gameplay videos now I used to dothat all the time too<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AraOto03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I thought it'll be fine once we get into high school..." Izumi, if Kazusa    got laid already then she'll forget about you, bro. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>Sonezaki, you can just... buy them online, you know? Fashion magazines. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Okay, the new episode (#AraOto03). Hmm... I don't know how to describe it. Well,there was progression, to say the least. Firstly, they got an advisor, theLiterature Club. It took them some effort asking all the teachers in the schoolwhich basically hates them and some of the teachers be like "I want work lifebalance" and just chose not to help the girls out. Oh well, you win, old man.Guess we gotta go for new teachers then haha. Probably someone young andhandsome and IT EXISTS!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well, he was blackmailed into this thoughso... thanks Hongo-senpai somehow you saved the club lol. I wouldn't admit thatthat is the reality here, but in the Anime at least it seems like everyone knowsa little about those things. <i>You know the word.</i> Like Yamagishi-senseihere who actually chats with girls online. *looks at him* You know, and Hongojust happens to be talking with him online, that's all. They decide to meet upand... yeah. That's kinda awkward. And that's why you don't chat online withstrangers things can be deceiving and it almost always turns out bad. Moving on,there's Kazusa's new discovery. I mean, if his mother telling you to go to hisroom to take something other than porno, you know the girl is going to take the<strike>DVD</strike> Blu-Ray too haha. ("It's a Sony" lol sorry for the Anime"Kannagi" reference that no one will get) And that's why you watch porno onlinehaha. (Damn, who am I teaching here? Haha) Okay anyways (I may have revealedplenty of my experience, so... allow me to shake your brain off them) Kazusathought it was wise to bring it back home and let Izumi not be able to find itin his room... And yeah, the girl felt bad and decided to return it, how kind.Somehow she realised that Izumi is still the same all those years, (So wait, shewatched it??) (Alone??) (Whilst groping herself?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>) (Yeah probably notshe is "too pure pure girl") (okay I promise last Kannagi reference haha) andtrying to watch adult content that doesn't pollute (not transportation jokehere) his current interest for trains (Aren't buses the same? A<a href="https://jisho.org/search/chikan" target="_blank">chikan</a> is still achikan, man) (ok maybe Kazusa doesn't know lol) but as Izumi mentioned thelikely reality is that he doesn't think of girls like this in real life even ifhe jerks off to fiction. Also #RealityCheck, by the way. So yeah, popular guywho jerks off to porno probably won't get laid to any extent, unless... welllanding on top of someone is so cliche as a romance plot, and considering thisshow is sick in itself I'm not going to think too much. Kazusa too, is trying tomaybe ask her parents about... not "esuibatsu", so well at least she knows childbirth is going to suck lol. Lastly, also due to Izumi's confrontation of thegirl who took a video of him being confessed to not Kazusa. (Hey, it's gottahappen someday but seeing Episode 2 I highly doubt so tbh) So Sugawara isnailing it so far, questioning how Izumi thinks otherwise because... girls thinkabout that word too. I would like to argue that she is right so far down theroad, but yeah she probably learnt it as a kid from others so probably nopractical experience like the other four. Still, not that I know of it (like,really), but if that is the case, isn't all these perfectly normal for highschool students? Even the jerk off part too. It's more on this series too tofocus on the effects of talking such touchy topics that will make it stand outin the future. And seeing how Sonezaki is so distracted by the fact that someonethinks she looks (potentially) like a model? Man we gonna have good stories totell in future episodes. The <strike>masturbation</strike> cute girls hooked mein lol, now for the probably sad stories to hit me good. "Please, do it softly.I know it's a lot of pain but..." Haha okay let's stop here<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-scvTgCNeEZM/XTPU-PgN7FI/AAAAAAAAyzk/pasTESjNW3MW9753k9rH4-MFrIASCZ_cwCLcBGAs/s320/araoto03_kazusa2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Don't worry Kazusa I also got Episode 1 flashbacks and I'm a            straight male lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eohiCkS5Ap8/XTPU-iL6SsI/AAAAAAAAyzo/Hf04qhxK568ozuUj2qdNb8pqaAgbTiK2gCLcBGAs/s320/araoto03_izumi2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            TFW someone took away your secret stash lmao<br />            (Again, keep it safe even if your mom never steps into your room            which I highly doubt so)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

"Girls think about it too" #mindblown haha no but really? Either this orHongo-senpai's online chat is correct. It's one or the other haha (all not truewe're not even in that realm)<br />[Here's a GIF because I looked at Hongo looking down at herself and I'm like"Where have I seen an Anime done this before" and I think that was a porno lmaookay I think DomeKano had it too what is wrong with all these shows]<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="180"          data-original-width="320"          height="180"          src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--fHLk0jnSbE/XTPXxgVU6_I/AAAAAAAAy0I/yRR5lPDX_bAPCVrXoDUYfMmvO4M9VA9_ACLcBGAs/s320/araoto03_escaping_short.gif"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Me when my superior doesn't have any more things for me anymore lol      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bqanime" id="JoshiMuda02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Joshikousei no Mudazukai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Hey, can I say something amazing right now?" NO. *watches on* Okay I have    the most critical of replies lmao  </div></blockquote>Why am I back? Well besides finding a replacement for that magic screw-up Anime(lol not true btw), I still think this Anime has potential. Yes, over the sameexact style but with boys years ago, that Anime. Yes, it's because of popular<a href="https://jisho.org/search/joshi" target="_blank">joshi</a><a href="https://jisho.org/search/seiyuu" target="_blank">seiyuu</a>, ladies andgentlemen. No really, the one guy in the YouTube comments for the opening themeis so correct "The Wasteful Days of Popular Voice Actresses" <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> There areSO MANY JOKES in every episode, I gotta quote ALL of them?? And then I realisedI do this all the time on other shows too haha so here's not the latest episode(#JoshiMuda02). In this one, we talk mostly about the life of Akane, the otakugirl. The one that has to come up with tsukkomi because the other one doesn'thave to or probably won't (why), and the one who has the most potential to benormal. I mean, look at that girl who keeps thinking about the Dark Soul lmao.Anyways, she'll get her time, so let's talk manga. You guys know I have a fairknowledge about the world of manga. Okay just joking, but yeah, this girl isgoing to be MVP every episode, just a heads-up. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> She looks the mostnormal, thinks about her aspiration to be a manga artist in the future, and isstill (maybe) (somewhat actively) practising on it. Someday, girl, you will makeit. Meanwhile, she troubles on her drawing skills as pointed out by her otherfriend Robo (because if passed to that idiot...) and probably also conveyance ofexpression in her stories. Yeah, probably obstacles you need to overcome to be agood artist, but hey, everyone has that stage. Not the knees-locking part thoughthat one I think she needs to take some drawing lessons lol. Other than that,she thinks quite seriously in her dreams, somewhat motivated by that idiot tocontinue I guess. Wait, is that it? I've finished talking about her? Okay,personal opinion time. WHAT I THINK... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In general, Tomacchan as thisgirl is awesome. Tomboyish or whatever, this voice is it. Having to be a sadist(in speech), to be serious most of the time, and literally a crazy fanatic at<a href="https://jisho.org/search/BL" target="_blank">BL</a> (man, this) too...she nails everything straight on. As expected from a veteran lmao. To add on,Akane is really cute. Arguably better than Loli. There, I said it. Well mainlybecause I'm not a loli, and then again it's probably because she's the perfectdefinition of a JK: innocent, has a dream, has friends who can shit on eachother (mine don't, for a start), likes dudes (on dudes), and is still a realgirl in heart. Pure I don't know, but a maiden she is. For that, I would stayjust to watch already tbh. To conclude, sorry for the Anime production to haveto animate whatever Akane drew as a kid lol, and I'm glad I stayed to watch thisparticular episode. Next episode... the Dark Soul might be upon us. Although Ithink it might just be the teacher chasing after<strike>high school girls</strike> future college girls and trying to fix thembefore it's too late. Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GObT4Qs7M88/XTPjN6jqXdI/AAAAAAAAy0U/7gp9Ua5bkWcvGo6P3DEw7JSXhwdr4UZ5ACLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda02_sleep.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            AKANE-CHAN FEVER!! lol<br />            (Even when she sleeps she's so cute hehe)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yiba3ZhaVmE/XTPjPqQRpEI/AAAAAAAAy0Y/fAmltEZgEVYmlz0Fzbv1anViqKSDzFFSwCLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda02_corner.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            AKANE-CHAN FEVER!! lol<br />            (WTF is she reflecting in a corner? lmao)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I am really hesitant to give it, to behonest. So yeah, it'll stay for another week. Also released this week wasIwasaki Ai's new digital single which is... very different from her usual musicstyle, so I guess that's fresh. I also gave <b>SIX LOUNGE's new releae</b> onlike, the one topic song since it didn't get any better, and yeah listening forthe 2nd time I still gave up on <b>KANA-BOON's new single</b>. Oh well, guess Ineed to take a break from those guys then.<br /><br />And thanks to me giving that Anime above which is all the hype right now for melol I'll probably listen to the <b>theme song single for Anime "JoshiMuda"</b>.That... should be it. Okay maybe the releases from this week too.<br /><br />On other news,<b>Natsukawa Shiina's new album finally surfaced on Apple Music</b> (Japan),<b>YUKI's music library is in Apple Music</b> (Japan) for some reason but stilldoesn't include her latest releases from at least within the past 12 months. If<b>yucat's new single</b> will appear on streaming next week I may just give ita listen, and I've give a listen to a couple of music videos recenrly from<b>Friends</b> and <b>MaRuRi to Ryuga</b> if you still remember them. Eh...considering the former is not doing their own usual style due to singing for adrama tie-in and the latter not sounding any better not looking at the video...I'll see if I can give it as they release in the following months.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's it, man. I got bored of writing here already which should explain why Ican keep my promises to write weekly additional posts besides this one since nowweekly just reminds me of the fact that I have to go back to work again and Icould compensate for some sleep. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Why has it become like this though? Butgood news, the company is considering flexible working hours so... 4 day workweek? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Well coming to work an hour later every day is already a goodstart for me I could use a more consistent morning run haha. Cya guys next weekthen, and until next time... I'm not going to promise new posts until I have themood and evergy to do them, and I know my OT schedule for next week. Ok bye<br /><br />P.S. I may implement the new behaviour for the new thumbnails here soon becausefixing all from the old site is a pain so I guess I"m starting afresh. Estimatedtime of implementation not confirmed maybe after the Anime Extra next week<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
