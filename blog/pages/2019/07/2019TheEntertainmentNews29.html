Is this what it feels to work? Getting tired and sleeping for the weekend? Well,
that' my life now lol<br />
<br />
Anyways, change of plans for this week's Entertainment News. Since I'll be
picking up that JK Anime (lol review below, last week's episode btw) here's the
following arrangement: There will be an Anime Extra with Takagi and the latest
episode of JoshiMuda instead of Takagi here so I can catch up with the other
Anime too, and from here on I'll start Entertainment News with last week's
Takagi so I don't have to do the extra border thing haha I hope someone noticed
it<br />
<br />
Why? Because... it's easier. Because I can sleep on weekdays too. Haha let's
move on I'm sad I can't even watch long YouTube gameplay videos now I used to do
that all the time too<br />
<br />

</blockquote>
Sonezaki, you can just... buy them online, you know? Fashion magazines. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
Okay, the new episode (#AraOto03). Hmm... I don't know how to describe it. Well,
there was progression, to say the least. Firstly, they got an advisor, the
Literature Club. It took them some effort asking all the teachers in the school
which basically hates them and some of the teachers be like "I want work life
balance" and just chose not to help the girls out. Oh well, you win, old man.
Guess we gotta go for new teachers then haha. Probably someone young and
handsome and IT EXISTS!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, he was blackmailed into this though
so... thanks Hongo-senpai somehow you saved the club lol. I wouldn't admit that
that is the reality here, but in the Anime at least it seems like everyone knows
a little about those things. <em>You know the word.</em> Like Yamagishi-sensei
here who actually chats with girls online. *looks at him* You know, and Hongo
just happens to be talking with him online, that's all. They decide to meet up
and... yeah. That's kinda awkward. And that's why you don't chat online with
strangers things can be deceiving and it almost always turns out bad. Moving on,
there's Kazusa's new discovery. I mean, if his mother telling you to go to his
room to take something other than porno, you know the girl is going to take the
<strike>DVD</strike> Blu-Ray too haha. ("It's a Sony" lol sorry for the Anime
"Kannagi" reference that no one will get) And that's why you watch porno online
haha. (Damn, who am I teaching here? Haha) Okay anyways (I may have revealed
plenty of my experience, so... allow me to shake your brain off them) Kazusa
thought it was wise to bring it back home and let Izumi not be able to find it
in his room... And yeah, the girl felt bad and decided to return it, how kind.
Somehow she realised that Izumi is still the same all those years, (So wait, she
watched it??) (Alone??) (Whilst groping herself?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) (Yeah probably not
she is "too pure pure girl") (okay I promise last Kannagi reference haha) and
trying to watch adult content that doesn't pollute (not transportation joke
here) his current interest for trains (Aren't buses the same? A
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/chikan" target="_blank">chikan</a> is still a
chikan, man) (ok maybe Kazusa doesn't know lol) but as Izumi mentioned the
likely reality is that he doesn't think of girls like this in real life even if
he jerks off to fiction. Also #RealityCheck, by the way. So yeah, popular guy
who jerks off to porno probably won't get laid to any extent, unless... well
landing on top of someone is so cliche as a romance plot, and considering this
show is sick in itself I'm not going to think too much. Kazusa too, is trying to
maybe ask her parents about... not "esuibatsu", so well at least she knows child
birth is going to suck lol. Lastly, also due to Izumi's confrontation of the
girl who took a video of him being confessed to not Kazusa. (Hey, it's gotta
happen someday but seeing Episode 2 I highly doubt so tbh) So Sugawara is
nailing it so far, questioning how Izumi thinks otherwise because... girls think
about that word too. I would like to argue that she is right so far down the
road, but yeah she probably learnt it as a kid from others so probably no
practical experience like the other four. Still, not that I know of it (like,
really), but if that is the case, isn't all these perfectly normal for high
school students? Even the jerk off part too. It's more on this series too to
focus on the effects of talking such touchy topics that will make it stand out
in the future. And seeing how Sonezaki is so distracted by the fact that someone
thinks she looks (potentially) like a model? Man we gonna have good stories to
tell in future episodes. The <strike>masturbation</strike> cute girls hooked me
in lol, now for the probably sad stories to hit me good. "Please, do it softly.
I know it's a lot of pain but..." Haha okay let's stop here<br />

P.P.S. "Girls think about it too" #mindblown haha no but really? Either this or
Hongo-senpai's online chat is correct. It's one or the other haha (all not true
we're not even in that realm)<br />
[Here's a GIF because I looked at Hongo looking down at herself and I'm like
"Where have I seen an Anime done this before" and I think that was a porno lmao
okay I think DomeKano had it too what is wrong with all these shows]<br />

Why am I back? Well besides finding a replacement for that magic screw-up Anime
(lol not true btw), I still think this Anime has potential. Yes, over the same
exact style but with boys years ago, that Anime. Yes, it's because of popular
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/joshi" target="_blank">joshi</a>
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/seiyuu" target="_blank">seiyuu</a>, ladies and
gentlemen. No really, the one guy in the YouTube comments for the opening theme
is so correct "The Wasteful Days of Popular Voice Actresses" <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> There are
SO MANY JOKES in every episode, I gotta quote ALL of them?? And then I realised
I do this all the time on other shows too haha so here's not the latest episode
(#JoshiMuda02). In this one, we talk mostly about the life of Akane, the otaku
girl. The one that has to come up with tsukkomi because the other one doesn't
have to or probably won't (why), and the one who has the most potential to be
normal. I mean, look at that girl who keeps thinking about the Dark Soul lmao.
Anyways, she'll get her time, so let's talk manga. You guys know I have a fair
knowledge about the world of manga. Okay just joking, but yeah, this girl is
going to be MVP every episode, just a heads-up. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She looks the most
normal, thinks about her aspiration to be a manga artist in the future, and is
still (maybe) (somewhat actively) practising on it. Someday, girl, you will make
it. Meanwhile, she troubles on her drawing skills as pointed out by her other
friend Robo (because if passed to that idiot...) and probably also conveyance of
expression in her stories. Yeah, probably obstacles you need to overcome to be a
good artist, but hey, everyone has that stage. Not the knees-locking part though
that one I think she needs to take some drawing lessons lol. Other than that,
she thinks quite seriously in her dreams, somewhat motivated by that idiot to
continue I guess. Wait, is that it? I've finished talking about her? Okay,
personal opinion time. WHAT I THINK... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In general, Tomacchan as this
girl is awesome. Tomboyish or whatever, this voice is it. Having to be a sadist
(in speech), to be serious most of the time, and literally a crazy fanatic at
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/BL" target="_blank">BL</a> (man, this) too...
she nails everything straight on. As expected from a veteran lmao. To add on,
Akane is really cute. Arguably better than Loli. There, I said it. Well mainly
because I'm not a loli, and then again it's probably because she's the perfect
definition of a JK: innocent, has a dream, has friends who can shit on each
other (mine don't, for a start), likes dudes (on dudes), and is still a real
girl in heart. Pure I don't know, but a maiden she is. For that, I would stay
just to watch already tbh. To conclude, sorry for the Anime production to have
to animate whatever Akane drew as a kid lol, and I'm glad I stayed to watch this
particular episode. Next episode... the Dark Soul might be upon us. Although I
think it might just be the teacher chasing after
<strike>high school girls</strike> future college girls and trying to fix them
before it's too late. Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week<br />

I didn't really spend a lot of time giving new songs, so let's just talk about
what I did really give. <b>Ohara Yuiko's new single</b> for Anime "Karakai Jouzu
no Takagi-san 2" is... if I had to choose one of two releases on new songs, I'll
take the Anime version but that doesn't mean it's on my shelf I just happen to
be in the mood to give another song haha.
<b>Coalamode's new mini-album</b> is... I am really hesitant to give it, to be
honest. So yeah, it'll stay for another week. Also released this week was
Iwasaki Ai's new digital single which is... very different from her usual music
style, so I guess that's fresh. I also gave <b>SIX LOUNGE's new releae</b> on
like, the one topic song since it didn't get any better, and yeah listening for
the 2nd time I still gave up on <b>KANA-BOON's new single</b>. Oh well, guess I
need to take a break from those guys then.<br />
<br />
And thanks to me giving that Anime above which is all the hype right now for me
lol I'll probably listen to the <b>theme song single for Anime "JoshiMuda"</b>.
That... should be it. Okay maybe the releases from this week too.<br />
<br />
On other news,
<b>Natsukawa Shiina's new album finally surfaced on Apple Music</b> (Japan),
<b>YUKI's music library is in Apple Music</b> (Japan) for some reason but still
doesn't include her latest releases from at least within the past 12 months. If
<b>yucat's new single</b> will appear on streaming next week I may just give it
a listen, and I've give a listen to a couple of music videos recenrly from
<b>Friends</b> and <b>MaRuRi to Ryuga</b> if you still remember them. Eh...
considering the former is not doing their own usual style due to singing for a
drama tie-in and the latter not sounding any better not looking at the video...
I'll see if I can give it as they release in the following months.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's it, man. I got bored of writing here already which should explain why I
can keep my promises to write weekly additional posts besides this one since now
weekly just reminds me of the fact that I have to go back to work again and I
could compensate for some sleep. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Why has it become like this though? But
good news, the company is considering flexible working hours so... 4 day work
week? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well coming to work an hour later every day is already a good
start for me I could use a more consistent morning run haha. Cya guys next week
then, and until next time... I'm not going to promise new posts until I have the
mood and evergy to do them, and I know my OT schedule for next week. Ok bye<br />
<br />
P.S. I may implement the new behaviour for the new thumbnails here soon because
fixing all from the old site is a pain so I guess I"m starting afresh. Estimated
time of implementation not confirmed maybe after the Anime Extra next week<br />
