<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w2zfGHgE0Sk/XTvOJ3VbvGI/AAAAAAAAy8o/n7zRjN5rFm0bTuW6Z0MPtqS1ttxiAG-6gCLcBGAs/s1600/araoto04_ah.gif"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>I should just take MC tomorrow, huh.<br /><br />I feel like if I say this I would get better to go work, but then I noticed Imay have left a trace to allowing the company to file a lawsuit against mepreparing for this, but hey, it's technically paid leave, so... I'm already kindenough to only take once so far this year haha<br /><br />My head hurts so let's do this quick thank goodness I watched... one of thesetwo early haha yep you might have remembered I have to work too<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AraOto04">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "(High school girls) They are disgusting" Well, if you referring to this    school besides the five of them, the yeah I would agree haha  </div></blockquote>In this new episode (#AraOto04) we... AMAGI GET F**KED YO~ <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also, if"guddobai" isn't the cutest thing you heard this episode, nothing will be. Iguess everyone has a part this episode so let's talk about them. Firstly,Sonezaki. I mean, just look at her, literally. Besides that image change, shealso thought that this wouldn't get her hated by the class, and it's a yes, butnow it's literally got too much attention such that (1) Amagi is trying not toembarrass her further in class than he has to to stay in class lol and (2) thatone gal wants to be friends with her. Of course we are referencing to the onetime she said something and Sonezaki didn't really retort on (I guess this willbe for a future episode), but suffice it to say that Sonezaki, as literary asshe is, wants Amagi to prove that his love for her is real. Hmm... I guess a50-page report would do? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And yep, in the most obvious turnoverpossible, and really, because it's expected drama, the guy wrote it, it wascrap, but it's pages of him saying she cute (you're not wrong there haha) andasking her out. What a guy haha I hope he didn't ask for help on this lol. Soyeah, what will Sonezaki's answer be? We shall see. Next up, we can finally talkabout the one girl who got left out real quick after doing the "tomo yo" thingwith Kazusa... it's Momoko. Yes, Mo-chin, as we call her. She tells Sugawarathat... because I guessed that she might be the control group, she has neverbeen in love before. No one, literally no guy in her life has ever appearedbefore to tell her about love. So yeah, she worries about even giving advice toKazusa who right now is just crazy fantasizing alone there (haha more on thatlater) but too bad because she won't have time to be alone now, because the oneguy in the same tuition class who met her while transferring schools as a kidliterally told her about his feelings. Hey, not that love must be immediate, sothey became friends. How you know? Exchange LINE numbers, that's how. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>So yeah, she also ended up sinking into (lol) the feelings that Kazusa prettymuch does, but they seek out the books for answers. Well, still better thanYouTube videos lol but I would argue Sugawara has been right about love so far.Well, not until she was seen with Izumi, which brings us to our next victim lol.Kazusa... she is stuck. Stuck good and well, in a pothole of wild imagination onwhatever will happen to the childhood friend, and it's no longer just takingcare of his lunch or whatever. But she is trying to get out of it. Books may ormay not give her the right answers, and that's why I say ask people in reallife. Reality, man. Which brings us to what Hongo-san wants lol. I guess herultimate motive is to write the novel she wanted to represent love on, but turnsout hanging out with the advisor/teacher/internet friend may be better. Iwouldn't know if he has experience or not, but considering he's some adultalready, and thinking that this girl is impersonating a middle aged dudeonline... well, he's got more experience than me, that's for sure. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Andhonestly, if Hongo-san continues on like this and this turns out to be a mess,I'm going to enjoy this dark horse of a romance story, I'll tell you first. Allin all, plenty to absorb in one episode, but I can see Mo-chin's potential inthis one. Again making predictions, but I want her story to be the sweetest.Well, not really out of a Shoujo manga kind I don't mind, but make it pure. Andno "esuibatsu" please; I'm not going to imagine her (or even anyone here)getting pounded haha. As mentioned once again, the author might be setting outto make these references a way to talk about romance in real life. And that'sgood enough.<br />[MVP MO-CHIN BTW YOU CAN'T STOP ME FROM PUTTING THUMBNAILS OF HER!!!<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>]<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TyRuzijY4so/XTvLqaW5NjI/AAAAAAAAy8U/B9IiZBpNvSAFlM8JPzROtDWPPI4eZaAagCLcBGAs/s320/araoto04_momoko2.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Is this what she looks like if I sang weird songs in a karaoke in            front of            <a              href="https://myanimelist.net/people/26543/Momo_Asakura"              target="_blank"              >Asakura Momo</a            >? lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-46sI88el1uw/XTvLrPqrnSI/AAAAAAAAy8Y/PvXaQvuxtfMDFLlL7XwzA01LMDjpOO6ewCLcBGAs/s320/araoto04_momoko3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I'll write 50 pages worth of "<a              href="https://jisho.org/search/kawaii"              target="_blank"              >kawaii</a            >" for you, Mo-chin.          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

In this new episode(#JoshiMuda04) yes we have caught up, but not on the jokes to be honest haha."If it's between Tanaka-san and shoelaces I'll still like shoelaces more" Wow,my opinion of that idiot in a nutshell, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Hmm it seems likeit's all over the place again, so let's talk about whatever links to the oneperson, and that is Ninomae Kanade, or<a href="https://jisho.org/search/majime" target="_blank">Majime</a> as theycall her by now. So yes, Ninomae-san, we now know what she is interested in. Itwas hinted in previous episodes so be like Tanaka or even Wota (I just forgother name lol) but it turns out to be Robo, or Saginomiya. It turns out that sheis somewhat of a genius, and it takes a lot to be her friend. I mean, look ather selection of friends. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Ninomae wants to be friends with her I guess,but maybe it's just socially awkward for her or she doesn't have that chance tointeract with her, so she can only watch in a corner whilst many girls flauntover her for some reason. #PopularGirlProblems, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways,Ninomae thought it was wise to learn from the one girl she couldn't believewould be Saginomiya's friend, and that is Tanaka. But yeah, since this idiot istoo volatile and is practically unpredictable (I have a feeling I'm saying thisevery week already), Ninomae probably didn't get anything out of it, to behonest. I mean, just from like a test, Tanaka has already proven herself to bemindblowing to all of us already, even more than Ninomae. And yes, Saginomiyadidn't give a damn, she only sometimes laugh at that idiot (very rarely even),and is harbouring her own fantasies somehow not mentioned in this episode onwhatever came out of her last episode lmao, but suffice it to say it takes agenius to understand a genius, isn't it? Not really, as an opportunity presentsto Ninomae to perform. And in case you wonder how you can avoid drenchingyourself in the rain while still being able to lend your umbrella to the girlyou admire who cannot wait three minutes for the rain to stop... the answer isalready in the statement I just made. You can wait, can't you? So, you wait.Lend her the umbrella and say you can wait. That's it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Not that you'llbe any cooler otherwise (pun intended), but all this is kind of reminiscent onbehaviour in front of people you admire, I guess. And then there's the Yamamotothing which is probably what normally represents of all the girls who admireNinomae just that this one is<a href="https://jisho.org/search/dere" target="_blank">dere</a> but in the "I'min the Darkness" kind of way lol. To end this, FUCK YOU TANAKA because youtechnically bullied three people in one episode today including a kid!? *getspunched by Akane* (I remember her name now) Ah, you wish Tanaka will be absentfrom school but even The Plague can't kill her so whatever lol<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-usChDYwQh_Q/XT05jXX-OqI/AAAAAAAAy9w/dVX2tnSTH-odl997EnDspWcT-EeM4sEhACLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda04_landing.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How to make all the girls like you, as a girl lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aCDVg3tC9gk/XT05koHbljI/AAAAAAAAy90/ZZeAWetMFAICjpX3crRHgsC3INaSHNrsgCLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda04_ninomae4.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is so wholesome I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

I feel compelled to give<b>Anime "JoshiMuda" theme songs single</b> especially on the opening themesince... the bridge part wasn't good (the lyrics are just like "What abouttomorrow? What about tomorrow?" kind of shit lol) but hey, again, part of theAnime experience so why not, yeah? <b>Coalamode's new mini-album</b> got to someconclusion this week too, so I'm giving a couple of songs I guess. Hey, it leftquite an impression to make me want to write lyric Tweets in two languages, man.It must be a good song lol. I'm still thinking how to give<b>Iwasaki Ai's new song</b>, and... man it has been some time listening to<b>Takebuchi Kei and her new single</b> is... well she might have been betterthan the average English singer lol. I mean, so hear it for yourself and youtell me if it's good.<br /><br /><b>Porno Graffitti's new single releases next week</b> which I have mentioned onhearing the preview, and on Twitter, <b>miwa's new single</b> is close toreleasing on August revealing a music video preview,<b>Fuchigami Mai is back with another single</b> due August if I think I haven'tgotten enoguh of giving that cat song early this year lol, and I hope you knowof the FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL live broadcasts on YouTube and that<b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION was on live yesterday afternoon</b>.

A reminder that Takagi-san will be on the next issueinstead of adding on like last week, so don't come back again if you seen theseidiots above already lol. Right now looking at Futon-chan (Tachibana Haru) and<a  href="https://twitter.com/hu_ton_/status/1155432513789022209?s=20"  target="_blank"  >her Periscope live</a>&nbsp;talking about her... last comiket photobook? Well, if you don't getanything above because you not otaku level (lol) it's just a cosplayer popularenough to release a photobook which is cheaper and possibly better than allphotobooks (all 5 of them) I bought thus far because it has swimsuits.<a  href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8dhSZIoY3sg/XT2Pl2nmRfI/AAAAAAAAy-g/EvPJvObIoR4yuylzwipzLkkJpyeh_VtVACLcBGAs/s320/yes.gif"  target="_blank"  >Yes!</a>She won already, this girl haha. Of course I can't go there to play (there'slike a gacha segment to roll for limited prizes too), so I'll wait for after twoweeks later to be online and I'll be sure to get it and talk about her morehere. Meanwhile, allow me to excuse myself while I take an early sleep for Ihave already slept all day to make sure I go see the doctor tomorrow lol.
