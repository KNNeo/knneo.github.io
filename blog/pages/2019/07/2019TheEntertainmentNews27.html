I... think I got the new site fixed WHY THE FUCK DOES THE SIDEBAR GO OUTSIDE OF
THE PAGE?? Okay nvm, I'll create a new home page so this doesn't happen anyways,
so whatever.<br />
<br />
Hey, welcome back. Again, if you noticed any changes, please do tell. I removed
some stuff from the sidebar (desktop view), and added a search bar, for
starters. I'll continue working on things, and in case you need an introduction,
just hit the previous post. Maybe I should add that in as a floating button...
Okay let's start with the new season of Anime!<br />

I like how this series is aware of it's own pervertedness lol "bondage" and the
guy be like haha. In this... magical series of a first episode (#TejinaSenpai01)
haha you would wonder why on Earth would I watch a fantasy Anime but fear not,
it's just a girl trying to do magic. This senpai is in a Magic Club all by
herself, trying to find new members to join. She's got everything on her
(literally), even the guts to use the PA system without permission, but she...
she can't do magic. Clearly the irony would make a great premise to watch the
series I would argue, but they had to throw in the most Anime thing for this
every time she fails at any magic -
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> stuff. If
magic isn't your thing but porno is (lol), then this is a show for everyone
haha. That poor guy, who thought he could get a life out of slipping into any
club and laze off, now has to suffer with this... marvel of a senpai, losing
financially and emotionally in many grounds, just not sexaually. That one, I
think he gets a lot even though it doesn't show on his face. Arousal, I mean.
<span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> But hey, makes you wonder what'll happen to him by the end of the
season lol. As mentioned in the preview, the only thing I was most worried about
isn't that much of a stretch, considering panties (Anime "Nagasarete Airantou"
classic btw) and poured milk(?) all over her is the biggest (not talking about
her rack) thing that would happen unless you consider pigeon porn lol, but
otherwise... yeah it isn't too hard (not talking about boner) to get into it to
be honest. Bigger issue is, the jokes are on the weaker side since (1) we know
Tejina-senpai always fails and (2) if it fails differently than expected it's
always ecchi-related. There, saved you half an hour watching this magic trick
unveil. All in all, I would say the premise of just a senpai who fails at magic
in her club and desperately finding someone to save her is... I'll do it,
personally. I'll even find someone to teach you. Just stop showing your
underwear and tease me with words like "bondage" lmao. The theme songs are quite
the disappointment so maybe we'll give this the three-episode rule WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT A FAT DUDE?? WE ALREADY GOT ONE SHE'S IN THE BOX haha I'm so sorry<br />

P.S. Personal opinion only I swear, but after watching Anime so many years I
only find ecchi content in Anime distracting. Also, makes of a bad story unless
it's staple in which case will get boring real quick. Period. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />

  >Dark times</a

series episode one (#AraOto01) we talk about... okay ignoring the word that
should not be mentioned lest the girls so berserk again (because I'm saving it)
(the juice, I mean) (haha), it's hard to not talk about it, really.
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sex" target="_blank">Sex</a>, I mean. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span>
I know we all take it for a joke, but for the Literature Club of girls I guess
not. You know, in one of these clubs you read through books and share your
perspectives with each other, bonding through books and understand the worldview
better. Just yeah, someone thought erotic books would be a great genre to
explore, and look how far we have come. (Again, I don't mean that haha) So yeah,
it just so happens to the five members of the group, talking about some author's
new work about a person writing a bucket list with an impending death. (<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/36098/Kimi_no_Suizou_wo_Tabetai"
  target="_blank"
  >"Pancreas"</a
>, by the way, and
<a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/search?q=%23kimisui"
  >I reviewed it before</a
>) There are plenty of things to do even alone before you die, but you know, the
one Sugawara chose to talk about the most relatable thing at this time
surrounded by students who are constantly getting laid and creating quite a
horrid environment in school... it's... <i>you know the word.</i> With this
premise comes with a couple of reactions I would hope to see progress real soon
since this already started out as quite a disaster. Firstly, we have
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11661/Tomoyo_Kurosawa" target="_blank"
  >Kurosawa Tomoyo</a
>- oh, it's called Kazusa? I swear those two saying "<a
  href="https://jisho.org/search/tomo"
  target="_blank"
  >tomo</a
>
yo" is a reference to the voice actress lol (Audience: She isn't even the girl
anyway!!) (Oh really? Oops) Anyways, the cute girl with the short bob. She has a
childhood friend. (I was really thinking of how much Kazusa would have a
wonderful shoujo manga ending with the guy too until I heard "<a
  href="https://jisho.org/search/otouto"
  target="_blank"
  >otouto</a
>" and I'm like "oh well it's not happening"&nbsp;haha it can still happen
though)&nbsp;Too bad that one guy is constantly surrounded by women who,
obviously for some damn reason, hate the normal as heck girl to the core due to
jealousy. I mean, make friends with her and you'll get to the guy in no time,
idiots. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Anyways, there's that, and... shockingly, she found out that
the guy probably likes the act. <i>You know the word.</i> <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Man, the
worst thing you could do is to forget that you are masturbating in your room
watching porn and forgot to plan out your escape route (This blog is going to
get a mature rating landing page soon btw) so that your childhood friend
wouldn't accidentally see it lol. So yeah, that happened. Really, didn't expect
that, but yeah, count that as my first in an Anime. Not mine though, just so you
wonder. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Really, there is so much to laugh to, but now looking back at
this... it's really wrong, even for Anime standards. But yeah, they gotta prove
it, but I didn't expect to make it so blatant even with the childhood flashback
haha. What she's gonna do about it, I absolutely have no idea. Then, we have
best girl Mo-chin (What's her name? Oh it's
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/116803/Momoko_Futo" target="_blank"
  >Momoko</a
>) (Nope, Anime "<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38295/Joshikausei"
  target="_blank"
  >Joshikausei</a
>" is already over) (Also Asakura Momo, that be your new nickname now hehe) who
is as cute as Kazusa maybe cuter lol, and probably will act as the most pure
among the five. Don't ask me why she's there, but apparently she does, so we
shall see what happens going forward or how long she can stay clean on this lol.
Moving on, we have Sugawara. Probably known in school as an ice cold princess,
she is rather desperate into the topic considering she said it first.
<i>You know the word.</i> <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Don't ask what triggered her, maybe the
books, but yeah she started it all, and it likely stems out from her looking at
her surroundings and wondering if the literature is true because most of them
probably didn't even do it before, yes? I mean, probably relevant assumption
there, those authors probably never done it before and jerked off to porno lol
(I'm sorry Kazusa-chan) but yeah, I guess it's important to experience it
yourself, so that's that. And then there's club leader (I assume) Kirika, a
leader in herself, and at this age, is totally against the act.
<i>You know the word.</i> Even at high school, girl? Sure, keeping it pure, man.
Probably would only get that one guy interested who praised your chastity (man,
you don't even notice that was a praise lol) but yeah, your hatred is not going
to go away. Combating against the environment, she tries to stand up for herself
only to notice she might be in the minority with the others in the club, and
don't even get me started on how dull the school and the sky looks haha. Lastly,
the only one who is the embodiment of the literature club lol, it's Hitoba.
Taking all the experience she can about that thing (<i>You know the word</i>)
(haha) without actually doing it, she goes through all lengths to learn what it
means to write a novel? Hell yeah, she's an amateur author in the making. She's
also an amateur in getting laid considering she's already in those kinds of
social network where I don't, but hey what do I know - the Internet can be a
scary place. Each with a different direction to take, you'd believe this would
make great circumstances to even start watching this series. But as it was
concluded, "I don't want sex to take over my life". I'll take you word for it,
Kazusa. For this one quote from you, I'll watch a couple more episodes. The
theme songs I'll approve anyways (don't notice the potentially awesome ending
theme by the way haha MOCHO~) so at this point it's just up to me to see if I
can take anything worse from what I just saw this first episode. I doubt it'll
go worse, but I'm not holding my breath. Anime like "<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34934/Koi_to_Uso"
  target="_blank"
  >Koi to Uso</a
>" exist, so I'm going to think like so for this series also. Anime, don't
disappoint me just because you got DMM pictures as backing I know of their
portfolio I don't want to keep associating shows like "<a
  href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37982/Domestic_na_Kanojo"
  target="_blank"
  >DomeKano</a
>" with them but look at this sh*tshow haha I'll give a couple a try (And I DO
NOT mean going down on them okay? We have an age gap haha)<br />

going to make sex jokes as far as I can... come... can I even say that? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span>

  "Damn you Takagi-san!" Hey, feel at home yet? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> In this much
  anticipated of a sequel intorduction episode (#TakagiSanS201), we learn that
  he just needs to doubt himself just a little longer and he can go miles
  without getting duped, uh I mean, teased. Also, if you see a certain blonde
  hair girl in the background with ponytails and get some unnecessary hype,
  you're not alone. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, recap. If you missed this series 2 years ago,
  I will tell you, it hasn't lost its touch. And this time around, it seems like
  it's up to something, like Takagi-san. We start off with a simple example of
  how this series goes: Takagi-san starts something up, Nishikata tries not to
  get distracted, but still ends up losing to whatever Takagi-san has up her
  sleeve. It's like magic, just that it's not because you know the trick, it's
  just that you got a PhD in Physics and Engineering haha. So yeah, with
  Nishikata still building up his body (hell yeah, for Takagi) and forgetting to
  put in his textbook in his bag, he ends up having to ask around for one but...
  too bad Takagi-san already realises he's not going to get any as there's only
  one class having English that day and it's them. So suck it up, Nishikata has
  to share it with her (lucky you I can't even do that with PDF lecture notes
  now) and... they play vertical writing in an English lesson? Sure man, keeping
  the Japanese writing spirit alive. And of course, Nishikata didn't "win" in
  the end since there is no trick. Which is also kind of sad Takagi-san because
  this idiot will never know you like him because you always make it as a tease.
  Maybe we don't know if it's true too. Maybe we're the ones getting teased. Uh
  oh. Is this some inception? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Then, there's hypnotism. Two people were
  specifically affected by this techincally, so let's talk about Nishikata and
  <strike>Mina-chan</strike> Takagi-san. Nishikata wants to play this super hard
  trick on someone, and Takagi wants to play hypnotism. Seriously? If you need
  some reality check, it will only work with a skilled practitioner, under
  controlled conditions, and on a hypnotically weak target with very specific
  requirements, as tested by hypnotists. (Thanks, MythBusters) So yeah, all the
  planets did NOT line up for sure, but Takagi can play along with it. It was
  all fun for the guy until he decides to tell her to dig her nose. Once again,
  if you need a reminder, that is also one of the things Takagi doesn't like to
  do in front of people (making ugly faces was in the first season), so yeah,
  she kinda got her, but she was not in it since she got him back as she's
  faking the hypnotism anyways. So yeah, watch again if you don't get it haha.
  And yes, I mentioned Mina-chan also got caught by the hypnotism, and turns out
  her life in the house is real busy. No wonder you sleep and wake up so early.
  But I see we have similar interests in sleeping long hours lol I just sleep
  because I can and I don't have a busy schedule like you, unfortunately.
  Lastly, Nishikata decides to challenge Takagi to a game of stone skipping by
  the river. I'm not going to talk about how the guy lost (yes he did)
  (technically), but about how much of a gentleman he is so much so that he
  deserves Takagi's affection. I think we can see it many times this episode.
  From love letters (lol) to Nishikata kind enough to not let himself see her
  ugly face (I mean, why not?) (Haha okay for the sanity of this series...), and
  also, he accidentally pushing her into the river only to save her even though
  he... didn't want to hold her hand. Because you know, lovey-dovey stuff.
  <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> I would say "just kill me already" with this one episode, but with
  many more episodes to come I see a trend in this particular season, and I want
  to see development happen. Basically I want last episode to be them holding
  hands and dating. Is that too hard to ask? Oh, asking for that means I lost?
  Dammit haha<br />

  P.P.S. Best part about this series once again, is that we get to see real life
  Takagi-san ie. Takahashi Rie who voices the girl, get teased and THAT'S
  AWESOME haha I need those livestreams<br />
  [Because you get to see everything fly over on the fansub stream taken from
  live TV, did I just see a smartphone game for this Anime?? Hohoho time to get
  teased by Takagi-san I guess]

Hmm... okay I did get to hear a lot this week despite my busy work schedule, so
let's tak about them, I guess. Still going on that nostalgia break though
because I could use a burnout from work and music is my company now unless you
think I can watch Anime at work lmao. As mentioned last week,
<b>Earphones' new single</b> is... okay, and yet again they put the rap thing on
the B-side to I'm savnig my money on this one haha. I thought of giving
<b>AyumiKurikaMaki's new mini-album</b> a listen and really am into some of the
songs this time around... only to notice that it was pre-released and the
official date is next week. Ugh, I hate these things. But hey, I'll still give
it, whatever. I also spent some time listening to
<b>Kiriku to Majou's 1st album</b>, and... I think I can't get into it, because
mostly for me on them I only like to give tunes with a unique tempo and feel,
and most of them don't fit the bill. And then there's the melody. So yeah, just
considering this one song and it may not even get in the list, to be honest.
Lastly, thanks to some live video performance, I'm giving another of
<b>Base Ball Bear</b>'s songs a chance, namely one from their 2011 single.
Totally not influenced by Aki-chan or Kazusa form the above Anime or whatsoever.
<span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (The song title was "short hair", by the way)<br />
<br />
Next week brings Klassic Note two releases which I may or may not be interested
in. <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> will test her seduction abilities once
again (haha) so I'll see if I'm giving her or the songs, and
<b>Horie Yui's new album</b> is... I refrained form hearing all the teaser
videos besides the topic song as mentioned last week, so I hope this will be
good. The latter might be on Apple Music though, so I'll look forward to that at
least.<br />
<br />
Besides anticipating Natsukawa Shiina's 1st album appearing on Apple Music which
I realised is only out the week after next (and of course
<a

  target="_blank"
  >thanks amatsuuni for liking my Tweet</a
>
I don't know how you understood to like it but still), I can't see
<b>Porno Graffitti's music video preview</b> on YouTube for some reason (yes
even with VPN enabled), voice actress
<b>Kitou Akari announced her solo artist debut</b> releasing a single in October
(to me I only know her from a couple of shows and she sang the theme song for
Anime "Blend.S"), and yes I liked a Twet to remind myself that
<b>AyumiKurikaMaki's new mini-album officially releases next week</b>. Oh well
haha<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I told myself to hype up the restart of this blog by posting something every
weekend for the rest of the month, but... I'm sorry. I noticed I have too many
things to do (and fix) and I just had to sleep so I won't burn out for the next
work week. But fret not, I have plans to do so, so I will make sure it happens.
Meanwhile, what do you think of the slight changes? I personally dig the search
bar it's much earned perfection right there haha. Perhaps refraining from using
Javascript was a mistake these few years lol. Cya guys then, and until next
time... Not talking about Anime, but I feel so empty now. Maybe it's playing too
many mobile games and grinding that made me numb. I should sleep more haha
remember to come back for Takgi-san tomorrow btw you lose if you don't lol<br />
<br />
P.S. I like how this particular Sunday night is making me like Rieri (Takahashi
Rie) so much because

AND Takagi-san airs tonight. Man, must be great being so popular haha
