It was a whole lot of nothing for me though.Work is boring when you're not at the right post, I guess.<br /><br />Also, didyou guys notice the mobile site changes? Yeah that's how much time I had to makeit look like buttons and now I'd rather visit the mobile site more often thanthe desktop site lol please visit from anywhere you like but hey all CSS mantotally useless on today's applications because I don't Javascript lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="DomeKano06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Domestic na Kanojo</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Did you think a teacher and student were doing something disgraceful?"    Going by your personality, sir? YES haha  </div></blockquote><strike  >Okay is it about time that I stop watching this series already??</strike>WTF WAS THAT?? IS THE TEACHER GAY OR SOMETHING??? Haha in this new episode(#DomeKano06) that I don't know what to make of it already because seriously, Ithought this show was only about boy-girl relationships. (Okay there's theHina-chan thing, but still) We doing transexual now?? I hope not. Firstly, wetalk about getting into clubs. School clubs you idiot, no one's pregnant yethaha. And in case you noticed, Rui-chan isn't in a club yet. I mean, she justtransferred schools. But hey, Natsuo isn't too, so good chances they can go findone together? The problem here seems to be that one teacher Kiriya, who besideshaving a weird personality and being a good teacher, may sometimes be morecurious in romance than he should get his hands on them, is I would like tothink of him as of now. But hey, ignoring that a sudden influx of love andwhatever physical contact that might happen between any number of them, Natsuois forced by the teacher to join the club probably because it only has a singlemember Miu-chan (I don't want to know how Kiriya became an advisor to this"club" with one female member lol) (she's cute btw) (the kind that gets fuckedand won't make too much noise lmao) and the teacher noticed this club could usemore members but Miu-chan is too soft-spoken (won't make too much noise haha) todo something to promote said club. So yeah, wise choice maybe, sensei. Rui-chanalso got interested in the club probably just for interest, and we may yet findout that this is a fairly predictable setup for future episodes where we seemore jealousy pulled out of that innocent girl who had sex just once and barelyknew about the infatuation she may have on that one guy after talking with thecafe owner. (<i>Man</i>, Marie's story is also something too lol) (word punintended haha) So yeah, very complicated now, and even Momo-chan is joining theLiterature Club because she wants to sex with Natsuo behind the bookshelves? Idon't know, man. Way too complicated for this virgin here haha (oh yeah Natsuodid it already lol), and yeah I guess it's in the author's perspective to makethis as forced and as complicated as possible so Rui would do something abouther feelings. But yeah, I just feel uncomfortable with Kiriya-sensei I guess.And I am MOST DEFINITELY not into males haha he's just a jerk and I hate thosepeople haha fuel for this series then I guess hopefully it won't make me dropthis show lol because NEXT WEEK WE'RE ON A DATE WITH HINA-CHAN!!! What, youthink this is compensation to make me forget that you were trying to ruin amarriage??? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AyLkNh9s8vQ/XGkB_UbcAFI/AAAAAAAAt-s/vfLBBVooh0ElAJWqgCGGq9MunDqCMaP1gCLcBGAs/s320/domekano06_3P.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            YOU WANT ME TO THINK THERE'S NOTHING WRONG ABOUT THESE PEOPLE??            lol<br />(Different time same location btw)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CQMBITKXL2E/XGkB_kFYFaI/AAAAAAAAt-w/fUReI_u07F4izw-YExAnzYCecnX_SlJTQCLcBGAs/s320/domekano06_together.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            YOU WANT ME TO THINK THERE'S NOTHING WRONG ABOUT THESE PEOPLE??            lol<br />(Different time same location btw)          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Just so you know Momo-chan, we're a serious Literature Club here so wedon't take no nonsense from members who just want to play around, you know!*looks at Miu-chan* Okay whatever we need the numbers anyway haha<br />P.P.S."When I don't have a boyfriend I was so free I was studying all the time" I knowright? #StudentProblems lol too bad I wasn't one of them haha you cannot feelfree of time when you didn't even have a partner to spend time with beforelol<br />[Oh it's boobs this week for the end card? Nice.]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KaguyaSama06">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "YOU WANT TO QUIT?? Then I won't have time to flirt around!!" &lt;= not    Shirogane lol  </div></blockquote>Her eyes are enough to make you think she wants to kill you? Hmm... good enoughreason, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I mean, isn't it because those two idiots are flirtingthe wrong way day and night on their so-called "love war"?? Didn't know it hassuch an impact on people around them tbh Chika-chan is okay though haha. The newepisode (#KaguyaSama06) brings us a whole realm of events as it seems, and let'ssee if we can catch up with the expansion of this universe we once loved withjust maybe three people. Firstly, the fourth member of the Student Council wasintroduced. Ishigami Yuu as he is known, is a mathematical genius who probablycan do finances so well the President is so free he gets to flirt with girlslol. Anyways, the problem here is more on Ishigami's extreme imagination,bringing him to think that Kaguya wants to murder for he knows a littlesomething about the relationship between the two. That, or I just think he has aweak heart for blackmail but then again Kaguya doesn't really know how toexpress herself (I feel so for her voice actress Koga Aoi too somehow and THAT'SGREAT haha) (if you watch the commentaries after each episode available only inJapan then you'll know hehe) so yeah, we have an Anime character officially(self) diagnosed with the Stockholm Syndrome lol. Feels bad, man. I don't knowhow to really save you bro, but the easiest way might be to intentionally takeanother club activity and say that I'd rather devote time to the latter and thePresident may let you off? That, or just say it, then Kaguya will make sure youdie instantly haha well she won't Shirogane said it then it must be true haha.Okay, jokes aside, I don't see how this will affect the love triangle as of now,but at this point I'd like to believe he's here for the ride he's never intendedto hop on haha. Then, there's Hayasaka. Remember the butler? Well apparently sheis tasked to disguise herself in school to stay alongside Kaguya-sama? But manis she cute when she doesn't have to do her "work". Oh well I guess it's alsobecause she has to deal with a shy girl and confessing to that other guy who isalso shy. You know, the plot of this series haha. To help Kaguya out, shedecides that giving her some form of dress-up while still staying within theschool rules (this girl knows how) will increase her appeal especially toShirogane. It worked though, but yeah as usual apparently commenting on a girl'sappearance feels like sexual harrassment. Oh well, is that not you wanted?<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, saying to someone who doesn't like you is nothing but askingfor death lol, so Shirogane eventually... did not get those words out of hismouth. Too bad then Kaguya; it'll be ages later before you two get together.Lastly, we rewind back a little to a normal scene (this time with Ishigami) totalk about psychological tests. Besides the fact that (if the narrator hasn'tgiven you a good idea of it through its wonderful summary) these things aretotally NOT a way to find out someone's emotions because most of them aremotivated by social media presence and designed by the one guy who have zeropsychology knowledge (refer to Blogthings for an example), they are normally notaccurate to any extent. Just... play when you feel like it then. I mean, NINEKIDS?? I'm sure Shirogane's dad will be happy about it but I don't think herbutt can handle it. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Haha what) (Oh I meant about the traditionalthought that a lady's undercarriage determines how good she is at bearing kidsas mentioned in the episode) So yeah, but man did I laugh out the most at theone Chika-chan found online (and that truckload of flowers dumped on Kaguyahehe). I mean, she just needs to open back the laptop to see the answer though;why ask Kaguya? Oh yeah because she'll get killed if she does so immediately butthen again she's not that worried compared to Ishigami because she got a chestthat can take knife stabs?? Haha this show is great<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rEWnpLFgqbY/XGj2vXGfVGI/AAAAAAAAt-c/y7kDu7VFOEwRX8Gdqu6PvLsLeHy4moDSACLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama06_kaguya3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I lived through an episode of fear this week so here's some lovely            images of girls with flowers          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K-_MUuvqI6I/XGj2vJ_lDxI/AAAAAAAAt-Y/c8MPL44Dp18sUhxgFNeCWSvwWIsp6xk8ACLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama06_chika3.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I lived through an episode of fear this week so here's some lovely            images of girls with flowers          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Wow Chika-chan's got two more months left to live? Then what about theChika Dance? No one's gonna do that now? I mean, Kaguya-sama you gotta take overhaha<br />P.P.S. "I just wanted to tease you a little with (the knife)" KAGUYACONFIRMED SADIST lmao please do me Koga Aoi-chan haha what<br />[On a finalnote, I wished Kayasaka was voiced by like, ex-seiyuu<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/26545/Yurika_Endou" target="_blank"  >Endou Yurika</a>so I can truly love this character. Hey, don't get me wrong,<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/21543/Yumiri_Hanamori" target="_blank"  >Hanamori Yumiri</a>is still good, but it could be better and I SWEAR I'm not talking about herlooks haha I'm sorry]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Dagashi Kashi</span>  </div></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img loading="lazy"    border="0"    data-original-height="268"    data-original-width="650"    height="131"    src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Q8mSuNK-1xw/XGlDFYxar6I/AAAAAAAAt_M/cbj64XG6C48g9I6kHfRkbn27HCcOcqB0gCLcBGAs/s320/1378.png"    width="320"  /></div>In this new chapter (137) of the stay in Hotaru's place and just in caseeveryone including me has forgotten, they were invited by the girl to her place.You know, that big mansion she stays alone in on the countryside. But yeah, it'sa "flashback" episode because instead of starting with more proceedings, theythrew Kokonotsu in quite a situation. In chronological order, the guys weremaking sherbic (it's the first time I've heard of people mention it) (I mean, Idid see some in the supermarket, but never got to trying it out anyway) (maybe Ishould hehe) and putting in the fridge, and if you didn't know how to make it ittakes about 4 hours to freeze. So yeah, the guys played games to kill time (aswith the Dagashi Kashi theme of eating sweets and playing) but Kokonotsuaccidentally drank that serving of beer from Hajime-san which technically is anindirect kiss but he didn't have time to figure that out because he got knockedoff real quick. (Haha is that me if I drink alcohol lol) So yeah, Kokonotsu thenwakes up in the middle of the night where he was brought to the bedroom alongwith many who were already sleeping, and he deicded to have a bath. Sure isweird to be in someone else's place and being so free because it's neverpossible that no one's in the bath haha. So yeah, Hotaru was in it, this is notpublic bath so no differentiation between genders so that's indirect sex lmao,but they remembered about the sherbic. And of course, eating it out of the hotbath makes it taste great. Okay now I really want to try this out for myselfhaha<br /><br />[Note: This segment shall be indefinitely suspended until I findreason to write this on a regular basis. Or if I catch up to some other manga ifI have the time to read them all.]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week was another week of listening to music, and personally I think I'm notlistening to enough at this rate, so I'm just giving songs from which wementioned last week. <b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> is the only thingreleasing this week which I reviewed (screw you Tachibana Rika and your 1stsingle haha) and it's okay becuase I think I'm setting her 2nd single which Ireviewed last year as benchmark now and I'm just giving the topic song so yeah,that's pretty much it. I'll also be giving<b>Taketatsu Ayana's new single</b> but on her B-side as mentioned, and maybe ifthe topic song appears in the album again and I'm lenient this release may getreviewed hopefully by this year. <b>YUKI's new album</b> stayed for another weekin Klassic Note so I decided to brainwash myself (lol) to a couple of songswhich was not the topic song which is fine, but at least I have the mood to givesomething from her this time round.<br /><br />Next week brings us a whole slewof releases which I hope I'll get to listen them all.<b>The Floor's new album</b> will likely be the highlight as it's on AppleMusic, and <b>Hanazawa Kana's new album</b> and<b>Numakura Manami's new album</b> are going to be the ones which we'll see if Ican get a listen to it by next week haha come on I haven't posted on my plans tocompare possible review options to talk about this yet<br /><br />On Twitternews and everything else related to music,<b>FINLANDS' new music video</b> presents itself as a simple song so I'llprobably give it when it comes out next month,<b>Kawano Marina is coming back to the music industry</b> with a major debut anda new single in May, and <b>Ikimonogakari is releasing another new song</b> fortheir band anniversary in March. I also got a listen to that Anime "Kaguya-sama"opening theme song which was featured on music program MUSIC FAIR by that oneSuzuki Masayuki-san who sang the song, and... it's okay I'll probably give itbecause I'm definitely not giving halca-san on her songs lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Idon't know why but I feel empty now. Maybe it's because of work. Maybe it'sbecause of watching Koga Aoi's story (it's on YouTube with subtitles if you needit, just search her name) aired as some special broadcast documentary for Anime"Kaguya-sama" of her struggles to be a voice actress... but hey, I like you nowAoi-chan so you're good. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> And yeah, still watching Takahashi Rie cooktonight so if you're still reading this maybe she's already finished cookinghaha okay cya guys next week<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
