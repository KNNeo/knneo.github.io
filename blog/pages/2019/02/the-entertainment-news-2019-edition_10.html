I know Sunday is Anime day of the week here in my world, but man are the spoiler
images from the official Twitter accounts too much, especially Kaguya-sama.
Seriously man, stop it. I can't stop looking at them while at my aunt's house

    liao I don't know lol
  </div>
</blockquote>
And I told you they're going to leave a trail on the Hina-chan arc haha nice one
Rui-chan. The new episode (#DomeKano06) introduces us what it's like to even
know of 6P haha please don't look it up. So yeah, new character time, ladies and
gentlemen, and it's Momo-chan. "YOU TRYING TO GET FRIENDS, BITCH??" is what I
would like to say to her as Rui-chan, but we cannot be judgemental just because
the classmates said it. You know, we gotta give her chance. What if she asks
about her doing it with Natsuo? (Haha how the heck did she know it though) Okay
that didn't happen, but she DID want to do it with the guy. Let's talk about it.
I know I said I wouldn't re-consider this show from the start, but this
episode's for you, Sasuga-sensei. I can imagine the real work is probably more
explicit, but yeah. We're dealing with a girl with experience. With many guys.
So many it's reputable in school. So many even Natsuo's friend is one of them.
But yeah, we all of course only know things on the surface, so everyone thinks
she's easy-going and basically a sl*t. Problematic, yes, but she tries to be
friends with Rui-chan and Natsuo, and that is good. But then she goes a little
aggressive with males typically I guess, and she tries to get Natsuo to like her
and such, and even went as far as doing the guy. Luckily Natsuo noticed that
scar on the girl's hand... (Possible family abuse?) and that SMS from Rui-chan
for dinner... AND that night with Rui-chan having a fever on bed and he has to
stick it in her lol (Panadol, people, Panadol haha) (okay they only got Tylenol
which is the same thing so where are the pills instead??), AND the flashbacks
from where he remembers how hot Rui-chan was when naked lmao so yeah, the two
didn't do anything. He's kind enough to not only be friends with Momo, but also
to be her family where her family doesn't. You know, #BrokenFamilyProblems. I
mean, we need more families like this so I can get picked up by a girl, probably
after she dates the whole school then I'll have a chance lmao. Anyways, good
story here, sex portion not required although I'd believe fans wanted more of
the somewhat light sex scene here (yes that is light, you guys haven't watched
To-LOVE Ru before?) but I didn't read the manga so that's good, and you guys
know I like expected drama, so either I fitted all the puns here in this review
or I'll just remember it to make myself feel better than Natsuo because he's
getting picked up by girls for favours more often than I have... ever. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>
(okay not true, but all wishful thinking on my part lol) As a last note, I kind
of hate the high-pitched voice from Momo-chan and it voiced by.... *drum roll*
yours truly, Yoshimura Haruka. Yes, I know of her. (She also voices that high
pitched girl in Anime "Sora no Method" no wonder) She's better in that game I'm
playing tbh although I don't mind sexing her irl if I can <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Haha jkjk I
don't even know her age lol<br />

WTF did they literally try to follow up the confession thing and how Kaguya-sama
has to clean up the mess that Shirogane just created? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> This show is
amazing haha. In this wonderful episode (#KaguyaSama05) of this series I can't
get enough jokes out of, we continue on the confession that the one guy did to
Kashiwagi-san after getting advice from the President. Yeah, can't you two just
say you all have no love experience and be done with it? But yeah, though
Kaguya-sama isn't alone on giving advice to the poor girl who doesn't feel like
being with the guy she just said yes to because of a Kabedan‚Ñ¢. So cue Detective
Chika with that hat she borrowed from the drama club lol, and her out-of-pace
advice for the girl which kind of worked I guess, but yeah Kaguya-sama may be a
little more on point I would argue. That is, if Kashiwagi did not go out of the
Student Council room thinking that charity is the thing that'll bring her and
the guy closer. Whatever man, says Shirogane, as he helps them out for some
reason lol. Next up, is a success story. You think every romance Anime of that
one guy who is awesome probably isn't created by days of effort and practice
from someone else who taught him everything so that he won't lose face in front
of the class and that one girl? I would think otherwise now actually, from this
story of Shirogane and Chika-chan. Ignoring how terrible Shirogane was before
the success story, but man did Chika-chan do the worst thing by asking him to
teach everything she knows because he just sucks. Funny to think how he got
through P.E. in school all these years lol. But yeah, opening one's eyes is
quite important in hitting the ball lmao he's afraid of it hitting in his face
but gets slapped himself?? This show is amazing lol the world of Anime in a
nutshell ladies and gentlemen haha. Lastly, another scene I was probably waiting
for ever since Kaguya-sama realised she can just walk to school and back home by
sabotaging the daily car ride lol I swear the previous time it's also not a
coincidence. So yeah, the car broke (the Gestapo said it was an accident lol
that's a WWII joke), it rained, the two both brought umbrellas, but they want to
be in one together. Yeah I know right? #RainyDayProblems Seriously, how many
scenarios can you think of who has a couple who want to be close to each other
so desperately but can't, let alone in real life? Thank goodness the wildcard
came in to save the day yay Chika-chan come on not now WHAT A BITCH haha (then
again they probably needed a larger umbrella and not a pocket one so they
wouldn't be <i>too</i> close together HAHA) (or they can be like that one show
with their shoulders out in the rain, for the guy), and kudos to Shirogane for
making the move first. It took this little effort, guys. It's not about war,
people. Stop exposing each other's intentions and get together already. (Direct
quote from Koga Aoi on an interview about the Anime, btw) But yeah, that's the
fun part, isn't it? God I love this series and Koga Aoi now hehe<br />

of them?? *continues watching* Yep she's listing all of them lmao<br />P.P.S.

Okay quick one since it's kind of late from watching Anime already haha.
<b>Polkadot Stringray's new album</b> is kind of okay, but I quickly noticed
that similar to the last two times I attempted to give them songs from their
mini-album and everything else besides this release, that they are actually
generally better on their hype songs than their emotional ones, which doesn't
sound like a good thing since that is kind of a limitation here to be a
Collection Artist in Klassic Note. Hey, I'll try to give nonetheless, I just
think they are better at hype songs just like the one they got famous in. Not
the music video cosplay; I know that Shizuku looks cute in a cop outfit lol.
<b>SHE's new album</b> is alright I guess? I didn't pick up many songs because I
don't think the melodies are good enough, so I went with the topic song and a
couple more that I think fits on an image that I can give more songs on a
regular basis for them I guess. Remember I want to keep a good impresison of
them writing songs I like, so getting into their style is quite important imo.
Pretty good though, this time around. Man, you guys want to be best artist this
year? Prove to me in the rock festivals this year then.
<b>YUKI's new album</b> is likely going over my head this time around as I can't
wrap myself around to give this mostly due to mood and somehow all the melodies
didn't really stick in my head. I'll try again next week maybe but for now it's
a no-go. <b>Taketatsu Ayana's new single</b> I think I mentioned this last week
so no to the topic song, but I'll probably give the B-side and if Ayachi you
want to make me give this single in the near future it'd better be in your next
album lol. <b>SIX LOUNGE's 1st album</b> also got to some conclusion so I gave
quite a lot of them in which some have music videos online so be sure to check
out the
<a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB"
  >KlassicNote@YouTube</a
>
playlist to give a listen to them yourselves. Lastly, over the weekend I then
noticed <b>Kiriku to Majou</b> has been active in releasing songs and now being
in Apple Music, I gotta listen to their new songs, right? It didn't go well haha
so I'll take the archive first, yes?<br /><br />Next week only brings us
<b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> which I missed the full song preview this
morning because I had to leave the house so I can't standby the radio program
which plays all the other cover songs from other seiyuu lol (did she sound weird
on that radio or I didn't notice her voice all this time?) so I'll be blind
listening to this coming Wednesday I guess.<br /><br />On Twitter which you guys
probably don't read so I'll summarise here,
<b>Uesaka Sumire's new single is due April</b> and written by a familiar
composer (he's a veteran in the music industry and wrote songs for Horie Yui for
Anime "Golden Time") <b>Takigawa Alisa's new single</b> for Anime "DomeKano"
better be good lol, very hype for
<b>Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" theme songs</b> because they are going to compete
with <b>Anime "Attack on Titan" theme songs</b> which are going to be from
Linked Horizon (boo) and cinema staff respectively. Yes for cinema staff once
again. Yes. I need my yearly album dosage, guys. Getting rock music deficient
already haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yeah that's it for the week. I'm going
back to work next week, guys. Well, I started 3rd day of Chinese New Year ie.
last Thursday already so whatever haha. I also took the time to complete the
Klassic Note 10th Anniversary
<a href="https://kaineng.wixsite.com/kn10years" target="_blank">#KN10YEARS site</a> so be sure
to check it out on desktop where that beautiful slide show collage will welcome
you. I gotta consider the first cover arts to show again so that might change
haha not enough colour variety imo. Cya guys next week then
