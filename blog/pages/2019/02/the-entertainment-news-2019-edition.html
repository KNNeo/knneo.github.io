YES haha &lt;= not Natsuo  </div></blockquote>"He was my teacher" I KNEW IT lol I mean, uh, I didn't want to fall in love withmy teacher too. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this follow-up episode (#DomeKano07) to whateverhappened to people ruining Hina-chan's relationship with Shuu back in a coupleof episodes ago, and more. Hey, it's kicking off. Ending the whatever feels likea disaster between Hina-chan and that man, we're kinda ending things here withNatsuo and Hina too. They had a trip to the beach (too bad no bikini or anythinglol), but yeah, they had the time to talk it out. Hina-chan talked about herstory which sounds like she was the victim even though she was the b*tch hahaokay just joking she gave up on being the gossip and went for the teacher lol.Man, I wished I can meet up with someone I liked before in the future and theysay that. Someday man, someday. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Moving on, I would argue that Hina'sstatement about committing suicide may be overboard even for just Natsuoconfessing to Hina because unless she feels the same too there is no need to dietogether haha. (Your say, Hina? I think it's you, man) But I guess that's oneway to think about it, however extreme it sounds. There technically will bethree people dead in the family now though lol. And then there's the Rui-chanscene. I kind of liked it, but hey, that idiot Natsuo has no freaking idea whatthey were doing especially Rui because really stop with your curiosity shit lol.She decided that they should kiss because technically they didn't (THEYDIDN'T??) (well they did kiss their private parts, so... haha), and she wants iton a regular basis. What do you think this is, a subscription service? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>Then again Natsuo always likes to take breathers like this so he can forgetabout other things that are bothering him? Man, being the easy guy here Natsuo,very envious haha. Then there's the exams. All four of them did well of course,considering that the two of them are taught by the in-house teacher lol, and theother two are literally geniuses (if you need a reminder Momo was a greatstudent when she's relationship-free haha), so that's good. Finally, we'll havetime to complete the publication for the school festival. What will they end upwriting? They have a summer vacation to figure it out. I have a feeling it'll bea more hands-on experience instead lol now you wished that AI can transform whatthey see and hear into a novel itself so we don't have to write haha no itshould be the other way round? Oops. To close up (not vaginas lol), there was aninsert song. Yeah, I can't even hear it to be honest. It was Yocchan (HikasaYouko), isn't it? Sorry I was too distracted on Hina-chan... yeah shemasturbating HAHA ugh<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DKFnB2p_l2E/XHKSS948fmI/AAAAAAAAuIk/_KMUex4eodEVR1WayTIbtzN1KidGSYadgCLcBGAs/s320/domekano07_couple.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            They look really good together, don't they?          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-az4rxWBxG3M/XHKSS2jT9II/AAAAAAAAuIo/EzW_Cn-IgJQCJ0hqujam94mKZLwQu9MUACLcBGAs/s320/domekano07_shuu.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Then this piece of sh*t with an innocent grin came in to spook young            Hina-chan haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. Sorry if this bugs me but, Yocchan is acting young again. Yeah, ever since"K-ON!" for me I believe haha I know it's not the first time but still she's 34lmao<br />P.P.S. "Hina-chan got all excited and dragged you into (the ocean)?"Yeah mom, you're kind of right there haha (can't say she was going to drown methough please send help lol)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KaguyaSama07">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "The ship has already sailed!" That's called I have no choice but to deal    with this sh*t again lol should've not done that one time before then haha  </div></blockquote>It's actually creepier that Kaguya-sama is worried that Shirogane is going tospend all summer vacation working even though she has "plans" for him and allwill be ruined lol. In this new comeback episode (#KaguyaSama07) we are hereagain to save that poor guy that Shirogane advised him before? Oh man, will therelatioship problems never end? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> (Spoilers: They won't. I like thisparallel though) So yeah, the guy came back and asked one simple question: howto hold hands? And yeah it didn't get a proper reply until Chika-chan the lovedetective dropped by and yeah, her advice was just to do it. Hey, I wishedsomeone would say that to me at some point. (Haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>) Still, it's Kaguya atthe door hearing all the nonsense about Shirogane's perfect scheme to getsomeone to join him in his part-time job over the summer holidays which willruin all of Kaguya's plans? (WTF) (I know right? Now I'm curious to know whatthey are) So yeah, thank goodness the guy managed to do it... who's that girlbehind them? I guess that's the follow-up then haha I'm going to looking forwardto that. Next up, Ishigami meets his first real beating in this series haha.Seriously, if you ever want to say bad things about people and behind them, lookaround bro. That's the best advice I can give him actually. Other than that,he's technically more depressed than me, can do accounting better than me, andprobably is just way too envious of couples and the school system where being ina sports club makes you more popular. You know, otaku things and clubs thatIshigami likes are in the trash, for instance. Anyways, they also talked aboutclub activities, and that's what got Ishigami himself into trouble. I get thejoke though, but yeah, to say it behind them and even worse when they areliterally right behind you... I'm glad you're still alive haha. (And that's whywe otakus will never understand women lol) He should be dead if not for Kaguya'sbenevolence instead of Shirogane's lol wtf was that buddha circle of light for.Also, didn't expect him to also offend girls with a rack compared to girls whodon't haha Kaguya-sama you cute, yes? Haha don't <strike>hit</strike> kill me<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Lastly, we have the joke of the week. Well it's technically not a jokebecause unlike Kaguya-sama we aren't childish in mindset enough to laugh atweiners (what is she, an outdated PC that needs updating? lol) (come on, welaugh at G-spots now lmao) (no really my colleagues thought that was a good jokein the lift) (yeah they do not know that I'm a perver-) but hey, she does laughat them. Besides this part being the hardest Kaguya has laughed and the firsttime I've heard Koga Aoi laugh (hehe), it is still good of a joke to make it allhappen, especially when Shirogane is involved. You know, Chika-chan literallyjust decided to slap that forbidden word card on his forehead haha it's thatepisode all over again YO <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Though Chika-chan just gave up and said itherself (she could've gotten Kaguya to say it but I'm not smart enough to thinkof a way) after losing to the worldly knowledge Kaguya has to dish out to makesure that word isn't used, but yeah Shirogane felt weird and ran away lol.Although I would say Ishigami now it's a good time to remember this weakness soyou can get back at Kaguya at some point. Then again I'd advise you to never usethat lmao no really don't haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gifoTFbYsr8/XHKdcf_qmPI/AAAAAAAAuI4/W9SAXaZqVaMbtLN1CO3rcQ2QWSiZvDRvQCLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama07_buddha.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            If you need a recall this is the Japanese version of that meme from            that French episode lol why the psyche up          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KQ3Tz9_nDjc/XHKdcV1t_dI/AAAAAAAAuI8/DWI7OA5fUaceB8EtEdPHsCklCNHLAPyfACLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama07_laugh.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            But seriously, thanks for the laughs Kaguya-sama I laughed a lot at            you haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Let's move on.)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week was quite a week in Klassic Note, as mentioned last week. I startedwith <b>The Floor's new album</b> as expected and it wasn't as good as I hoped.As mentioned in Twitter, they combined a lot of pop elements into their rockmusic style which I preferred so it was quite a hurdle to ignore that and focuson the melody, amongst all the stuff. I did try to give a couple of songsthough. The topic song... I may not even want to give to be honest the pop beatsare pissing me off. I mean, look at vivid undress, guys, and tell me listeningto advice from the major label production makes sense. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I ended upgiving <b>halca's new single</b> a listen because why not but also that itwasn't as bad as the last time I heard of her, but man does she need to try toappeal to me on composition considering she doesn't have a particularlyattractive voice for me. Hey, it's Anime lovable but here in Klassic Note wedon't favour those that much anyway, so... she'll get the topic song. Welcome,girl, even though you should've last year haha.<b>Hanazawa Kana's new album</b> didn't come as early, but as expected from aproduction made my various composers from different bands and individual artistsin collaboration, most of them will not get her usual style because we may havegotten used to dear composer Kitagawa who has been writing songs for her formany years. This time around, I would argue that I was focusing more on whoeverI know to give songs instead, so yeah Fujifabric and Chatmonchy got a pass. Theothers.. I may give the emotional songs maybe. Lastly,<b>Numakura Manami's new album</b> came by over the weekend for me, and... thisis the opposite for Kana-chan's album mainly because this is totally in houseproduction, so... it also wasn't good lol. Coming from the Anime music label, Ifeel bad to give any of those melodies considering many are trying to bedifferent even though writing smoother melodies would help in making some moreof those songs easier to give off the bat. Surprisingly, I took another listento the other single topic song I didn't give last year so yeah, that's how badit was I guess.<br /><br />Next week brings us<b>Suzuki Masayuki's new single</b> for Anime "Kaguya-sama" and going from thepreview last week on the music program I will still give it, I guess.<b>TrySail's new album</b> is also out next week, so let's hope this will proveme otherwise as to why I threw their previous album out of the window haha. I'llalso be listening to the two albums I criticised above again and maybe givemore, I'm not sure. I really need more rock tunes man these things aren't goodenough for me<br /><br />On Twitter,<b>Scenarioart is announcing something new</b> on Periscope which I missed(Edit: I haven't) so I'll update next week and on there I guess,<b>Takigawa Alisa's new music video</b> for Anime "DomeKano" is pretty good (I'mcounting on you, Alisa-san), and <b>sphere announced their new album</b> due inMay as return from their two year hiatus and celebration of their 10th yearanniversary. Well, the topic songs thus far aren't impressive so... we shallsee, girls. We shall see. Any chance Aki-chan get a new single soon though?Haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm done I haven't even prepared for worktomorrow lol. Cya guys next week then, and until then, don't anyhow change yourkeyboard because you think one button is acting weird because I changed mine andI hate it now even though I changed my mouse and it was good. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> Bye guys,and note to self, remember to do a special post about your birthday purchasesonline about the three photobooks. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Please all come on time please cometogether (on me) (lol sex pun intended)<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
