I'lltry this for a season and see how it works in here because Blogger is a- let'sget to entertainment haha<br /><br />Life is better without real life women, myfriends. Okay maybe it's because my real friend is trying to get laid and thingsgot weird haha just like Anime!? Man, life imitates art lol<br />(*As this isnot "The Statement" do not take this seriously)<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SenkoSan01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Man, imagine a fox spirit comes into your life when your life is about to be    in shambles... Why have I not seen one around yet? lol (ah you gotta be    handsome lmao)  </div></blockquote>I mean, if I see something totally wrong the moment I open my apartment door Iwouldn't be that happy tbh haha. Anyways, in this first episode (#SenkoSan01) ofliterally a show of fanservice, makes you wonder why Ao-chan gets 12mins andJoushikausei (we'll talk about that later) gets 3mins. Yeah. But then again thisis probably a show that realises peoples' dreams like myself, so I'll take it.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> This, is a slice-of-life show. And not your usual slice-of-life, ofcourse, because it currently features only one man. Yes, a working man. Notschoolgirls, not kids. Well, if you consider that deity of a kid then maybehaha. Still, it's just a show where this guy suffers from the city's burdens ofwork (if you need a summary people in Japan work for at least 10 hours a daynormally against their will) and never has enough time to take care of himselfbecause he lives alone away from home. So yeah, with no one to help him aroundin his apartment (unlike in shows where you live with a manager who can takecare of stuff for you) he just gets more and more depressed over time. He can'tcomplain, because he's technically the breadwinner of the house I assume, so hesuffers in silence. Not until the fox world hears about this and decide to helphim out. Well, Senko-san decided to help him out. So yeah, she descended uponhis house (literally, no need for locks and keys) and cooked him dinner after hehas to work overtime again for the God-knows-how-many times this month. As likeanyone else inside or outside Anime, pure shock should be your only reacitonuntil you realise this isn't a dream and you won't get caught by the cops forpedophilic activities lol. After he gets a satisfied dinner paid for<i>entirely</i> by the shrine lol, Senko explains herself to be someone who isin a mission to relief the guy (I don't remember his name haha) from his stresshe has built up over time, so sure, pampering it is then, subtitles. It wentfrom 0 to 100 real quick, as Senko takes on weirder requests besides cooking forthe dude, was touching her tail. Okay, many things she has done for him has beennicely referenced to things from the old house in the countryside I assume, fromthe grandmother's tea to playing with the cat who probably won't squeal thismuch as Senko-san but hey, I'm not complaining about voices here. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Allin all, quite an interesting episode to start with, and really reminds me ofAnime "Kannagi" but this is a no joke one? So it really feels great to maybeconsider watching this in the middle of my work week instead haha. Really, Ican't find any reason to reject this show. Okay maybe the theme songs but whenhas it been an obstacle? Haha we shall see you next week Senko-san. Man, thattail on Waki Azumi going to make so many fanservice on live events hehe (justimagine it for a while everyone you'll get what I mean)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I1ypThXuLY4/XLKsI-l--2I/AAAAAAAAv54/OGMqudA_e9Ef17xHazyrcA0Crx5K_SjTgCLcBGAs/s320/senkosan01_happiness.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Happiness is...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A9Z2aia2NUA/XLKsIhZWmSI/AAAAAAAAv50/fHB6xatiaV8Tpzu_IDSEpogPhDU9QLsRACLcBGAs/s320/senkosan01_tail.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Happiness is...          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Another reason why I didn't regret watching this seriesfrom 2016, we're already at the third season, everyone. In this new episode(#BungouStrayDogs26) we go into another recollection arc because why not, we seehow Port Mafia was formed. Well, today's Port Mafia. The group featuring MoriOugai as the head. The one who assassinated the previous boss with a scalpel.The one Dazai saw him do. You know, if you can remember from I don't know whatepisode because it has been two years haha. Anyways, there are many to learnfrom this episode thus far, which will no doubt make a turn real quick as itgoes on. But hey, I'll take a rollercoaster ride featuring Dazai and Chuuya.Hey, best Anime couple right there, ladies and gentlemen haha. Story goes therewas a big explosion (I'm not going to pinpoint on this timeline because I'm notthat invested in it you just need to know something happened after the eventwith Dazai's two friends) after the event which spawned the new Port Mafia, andit resulted in a crater in which a new city is born, right on an island offYokohama. Problem is, recent sightings have been found of the previous leaderbeing alive. Hey, he was killed though, slit in the throat. But apparently it'smore than that. He came back to life for whatever reason, and was possessed by agod? (I'm not going to spell that name because I keep remembering it asAkihabara lmao) Hmm, in a world where ability users exist and immortals don't,this sounds really suspicious. We also get to see a young Dazai and Chuuya (Iwouldn't say Mori Ougai is young, but still) who have to fight along with eachother for the first time after it was formed combining an enemy's boss tosomeone who witnessed that old man's death. But this time, the mysterious power,instead of appearing on the previous boss, was on Hirotsu (I swear I had to wikithis because I forgot who he is and I only remember him from the one episode...yes Black Lizard haha) who came into fighting with Chuuya because the kid askedfor it lmao. Through this, Mori Ougai offers him a deal. To share informationand find out the truth so we can stop all this bullsh*t and you know, move onfrom the previous Port Mafia which is technically more brutal than the currentone maybe. Man, I can't even imagine haha. And the current one has Chuuya andAkutagawa in it. Anyways, The kids start their first date together lol, and it'sabout to get more exciting. Hey, I'll take this show above everything. You knowI like normal humans with crazy, extreme, larger than human possible powers thataren't DC and Marvel lol. God, this show is the best. Currently the only actionshow I'm liking because Attack on Titan is an obligation now haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CslSu91IPiI/XLK3WZCOqnI/AAAAAAAAv6Y/48nLi0QlvuIfI2pyVscuI9l-3lN0rBuawCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs26_chuuya1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The reminiscing action shots make this show all the more wonderful            that it came back.          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AVtyphbvMOg/XLK3Wgo9vcI/AAAAAAAAv6c/oWmL0Ch3U_UEzHMDdXy3xPt82nyi59R7ACLcBGAs/s320/straydogs26_dazai.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            The reminiscing action shots make this show all the more wonderful            that it came back?          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "Do you think there is any value in living?" Hey, Dazai, I ask myself thesame question for the past decade haha<br />P.P.S. In case you need helpunderstanding what happened, TL;DR some mysterious power possessed ex-Port Mafialeader (and Hirotsu without us knowing) definitely not due to vengeance butlikely due to the explosion which created Suribachi City. How and why though? Myguess is it's an ability user which created that (I mean, Chuuya can do thatcrater too technically) and is always nearby to possess user powers, andremember the two other enemy groups of the Port Mafia as mentioned by Hirotsu?Yeah, might be one of them. Also, we have no idea what the ex-boss' ability isso... He's alive at least haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AoChan02">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;"      >Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</span    >  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Let's have sex!" The dad approves haha new serialisation incoming lmao  </div></blockquote>"To sum it up, it's enticingly sexy" Haha that's my friend when describing womenlol must you be so detailed? Haha anyways, the only thing I've learnt again inthis new episode (#AoChan02) is that if there's anything to consult on don'ttalk with your dad haha. Okay it's just Ao-chan's dad but still. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Again,this show should be titled "Ao-chan Can't Do Romance" because just like Kijimashe can't too. Don't ask me why, but then again it's everyone's first timeanyways. Firstly, it's about Kijima's junk. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And that's how you start acomedy Anime haha. Anyways, Ao-chan seems interested by it for some reason (why)(haha must be the books the dad's influence is working...!!), and thinks of waysto find out how large it is for herself. I know it's easy for us guys to seeeach other's dong in the bathroom or public showers (you guys haven't done that?haha me neither) (Audience: LIAR!!) (haha) but hey, it's not possible for womento see in men, to say the least. Not unless you're in bed haha. And yes, they dosay hands represent that thing's size, but you know it's not true (I swear Ihave a larger junk than my hands lmao), but then again when you only have yourerotic dad as an encyclopedia (okay the dad was correct but that's extreme case,Ao-chan) and you can't really ask the guy directly... you know, but you gottaknow. Haha maybe that's why then. But then it ended up being Kijima beingserious talking about the confession he did in the first episode and askingAo-chan to think seriously about it. Meaning the girl is talking about d*ck andthe guy is talking about love. Hey, nice guy Kijima here I wonder what's up hissleeve haha. Next up, Ao-chan dressing up serious. Well, the friend was rightbtw haha. So yeah, fanservice for everyone including myself. Lastly, there's thebook swap. It's about a vocabulary book only Ao-chan can read (really Kijimajust bought it to look smart haha) and... the dad substituted it for one of hisbondage books lol. So yeah, accidents happened and the two books got swapped,but Kijima didn't exactly read the book after that so Ao-chan was fine but notwithout the huge setup of misunderstandings at least. All in all, I have afeeling it's the first episode that may have left a bad impression on many butat the same time I still think it's a filter to chase away those who can't takethe sex jokes and maybe the father going forward, but as of now I think it'sstill good, this series. And now I'm actually convinced that Ao-chan actuallyknows more stuff than me (<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sm" target="_blank"  >SM</a>, <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bdsm" target="_blank">BDSM</a>,<a href="https://jisho.org/search/yagai" target="_blank">outdoor</a> play etc.)(yes<a href="https://jisho.org/search/public%20sex" target="_blank"  >flashback to her introduction</a>) so allow me to enlighten you on sex in Japanese in the following weeks hahathis show is great totally not Seitokai Yakuindomo in any way it's a<strike>shoujo Anime btw lmao</strike> okay confirmed it's shonen no wonderhaha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6XCKuaCOjw4/XLLRs_tk9qI/AAAAAAAAv68/BQO0r_i-8Us5ZLmGik-IavR-KWvj_e7fgCLcBGAs/s320/aochan02_lethal.jpg"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Wtf is this a Lethal Weapon reference?

Because it's a very quiet show? Okay, why I am watchingthis. Because of<a  href="https://twitter.com/joshikau_anime/status/1114377439541694466"  target="_blank"  >this</a>, Tachibana Rika. She's main girl, and I've been waiting to watch something Ilike and has her in it as main in an Anime, so here we are. But uh, just a headsup, this one is even shorter in length than Ao-chan (review above), so... yeah.Focus here is to create a story without dialogue while typically focused onslice-of-life things to... you know, ecchi stuff. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Let's talk aboutthem. (I'll pile both episodes till now since I watched the first on a train andnot formally earlier this week and did not write anything down) Firstly, inepisode one (#Joshikausei01) they gave us legs. Yeah, those long, white,flawless-without-a-speck Anime legs you guys asked for soooo much, they finallydelivered. Not that showing legs is weird, but it's about what happened to it.It got mashed, it got exposed to a lot of classroom air, and got slapped.<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Short enough to describe the content on 3 minutes? I believe so haha.Yep, and that's an episode already. Next up, the newest episode (2) gave us anunlucky day. Well, for main girl Momoko she is more than just feeling unluckytoday. She tainted her shirt twice (yes, twice), pissed off crows while throwingout the trash, and can't even have lunch because all the packaging is opening inevery other way but properly. You know, like if you open that milk pack by theside and it opens until halfway through the paper layer... we've definitely allbeen there. But for Momoko, she's just down on luck. Even the straw wasn'tcooperating haha, let alone the vending machine. All in all, really weird seriesto watch in especially I can barely be satisfied about voice acting qualitybecause there isn't much dialogue lol, but suffice it to say I like the simplestories, and sure, I'll watch this once a week. This is better forbinge-watching for many after it ends airing on TV, so yeah, do what you want.Just give the cast a chance because I know all three of them.

Too short to make any quotes or postscripts so if you'll forgive me fromnow on it might just be the one paragraph haha<br />P.P.S. In case you need toknow as I've read the first chapter of the source manga, both episodes are notfrom the manga. Just so you know, Anime production might be going for random.<br /><br /><br />(Thatis what, FIVE shows by the end of the month including Attack on Titan? Well, atleast two of them are short, but still. Should I stop watching Attack on Titan?And then Levi puts the sword to my neck? Haha)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>As mentioned last week, there's that one album which will crush the competitiontotally due to fandom haha, but firstly, let's clear up some releases from lastweek. So in a nutshell, I gave two songs from<b>Cocoro Auction's new mini-album</b>, and another which is the topic song from<b>AIMI's new album</b>. This is as much as I can give, girl. I tried. Also,because of live performances again, <b>I gave another Fujifabric song</b> whichwas actually in the mini-album released earlier in the year, but I've onlygotten to it now. Well, it's because of the mood, actually. And the quirkymelody, but yeah, I gave it. This week, <b>Minase Inori's new album</b> probablyhit more places than other on release date through the Internet includingTwitter, YouTube and Apple Music Japan for me personally, and it was okay. I didgive like, three songs off the bat including the topic song which I cannotforget for the week until I stopped listening to it, but yeah. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><b>Aimer's new albums</b> simply blew past me like a breeze as I barely got anyinterest from her new album songs, and I guess that's not good? I'll try tolisten again next week. Kajiura Yuki-sensei is in it somehow so I want to givechance? As of now I'm giving songs written by not her though haha. I also caughtup with <b>Touyama Nao's new album</b> which actually released last week (yepsorry Naobou) and... this might be worse. Hey, music labels? Why idol solo musiccareer second albums always suck? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay it might just be with Inorin thelast time but hey, I gotta reference something. I may just give one song, ornone if Aimer is better compared to her. I know I shouldn't compare, but sinceI'm not exactly in the mood to listen to both albums, then I'd rather try togive good songs first. And I haven't decided on any. Oh well. I better try togive a couple before next week.<br /><br />Talking about next week, two muchanticipated releases make me want to not work this week haha. Thank goodness forpublic holiday on Friday, yes? *cheers* <b>Uesaka Sumire's new single</b> mightbe the next potential single to be on my shelf considering I haven't heard theB-side yet? But the topic song is good though. The B-side is some insert songfor OVA of Anime "POP TEAM EPIC", so... I hope it's good? I haven't heard anypreviews of it yet so may I not be surprised by it coming Wednesday haha. I saythis first because no doubt I'll put forth&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;(because it'sonly me I swear) fullest attention (if it ever comes on time) on<b>Natsukawa Shiina's new album</b> which will probably be my most seriousreview ever this month haha. Okay, if it's good I'll try to give more. Herprevious single B-side wasn't that memorable so I skipped it, but from previewsI've heard the past couple of weeks it's hopeful, to say the least. YayNan-chan! And sorry Aki-chan but you've not been singing new songs. Must be themarriage thing haha (Not going to make the graveyard joke lol)<br /><br />On theInternet because Twitter ain't got enough news for me,<b>Niitsu Yui announced a new mini-album</b> since her album last year whichwill also feature the new music video which is on YouTube now,<strike  >along with someone licensing  <b    ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM3tabf4MzQ" target="_blank"      >KANA-BOON's new music video</a    ></b  >  (I'll link it here) (and if you in Japan don't even try clicking on  it)</strike>and<b  ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923zOPHTWd4" target="_blank"    >Ikimonogakari revealing yet another new song</a  ></b>for a commercial. Nice song btw. You guys going to announce a new release atsome point? I'm waiting.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's it then. Recently Iopened my website (this one) on like, IE9 (Internet Explorer 9 for those whonever seen IE before) and man does it look like sh*t haha. So yeah, probablyrevamping the thumbnail designs to see if I can make it more backwardscompatible, not like it matters because IE IS DEAD PEOPLE!! Haha even Edgebrowser is going Chromium. So yeah, upgrade your browsers, people. I personallyrecommend Vivaldi because I love Opera and it isn't what I know of anymore.Still, it's quite a customisable browser, so go take a look. Cya guys next timethen, and until then... looks like Anime will be my fuel for the short...erweek. Someone please give me courage to tell my superiors that I have nothingimportant to do at work haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
