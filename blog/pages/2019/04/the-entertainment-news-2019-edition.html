<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-afjDTBXMR9g/XMVCcBlzJeI/AAAAAAAAwQc/Z6Rx0L7et1ArNnHxFuWhWujFxPVpTk_CACLcBGAs/s320/aochan04_3P.jpg"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>In summary to last week, my butt still hurts and I have no mood to jerk off toporn lmao<br /><br />Okay, sad memories aside (self burn right there), this weekwe have more shows to cover. And unlike the last time I had to watch Attack onTitan on Mondays, it will join this list tomorrow similar to Honda-san twoseasons ago, so take note of that. Ok let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SenkoSan03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span      style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"      ><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I'm his wife... and his mother!" Nakano be like OH GOD PLEASE DON'T SEND ME    TO HELL WITH ALL THIS SIN Oh wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  </div></blockquote>I like how Nakano is already at that level where he's already considered apedophile and a child abuse prosecutor- Wait, he was already? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In thisnew episode (#SenkoSan03) of this series I guess I have no choice to give, weare introduced to the neighbour. Yes, finally she took the courage to step outof her abode and call the cops haha. Besides the great misunderstanding whichcan hardly be explained lol, we found out that Nakano finally is paying for hismeals by likely buying the goods on his days off. Thank goodness, we don't haveto eat off cooked offerings lol. And just in time, we can feed the neighbour soshe won't think Nakano is here kidnapping children lol. Nice one, Senko-san!Really, she's literally keeping her mouth shut, with offerings. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okayit's not, but still. It's a real good excuse though, since the neighbour who isknown as Enouji is a student and an artist, which also means she could use somehome cooking since this one barely even eats haha. (How she got that rack thoughwe will never know lmao) So yeah, they kinda explained their relationship toher, and she just eats to satisfy her stomach haha. Easy, right? We're settled,so far so good. Well, when more questions appear like why Senko-san is "dressedlike a fox" (because she is one lol) Enouji ended up believing it was somecosplay of some Anime character which she likes and which Nakano has to paysubscription now to let her watch the whole series so that she can act her rolein the real world, that Senko-san. So yeah, at least that is one way of keepingyour resident deity occupied haha. Hey unlike my mom this one still stays athome and remembers to cook dinner. *BOOM* Haha talking about buying food, sinceNakano has been fed offerings from the temple for like, a week lol, it's time topay back. Hey, for this much of happiness we gettin', this is a small price topay, right Nakano? *him looking at his empty wallet* But yeah, worried thatSenko-san will be seriously questioned to the extent of being brought to thepolice station (yeah I swear it'll happen considering she floats lmao), Nakanodecides to go shopping with her. Really reminds me of the days I have to go tothe market with my mom as a kid. Somehow this sticks with you when you grow upold and lonely lol. And so does Nakano, as she sees Senko-san looking aroundamazed at the product of capitalism and globalisation in front of his eyes, andalso deciding his somewhat limited fate of his future meals lol. Come on, atleast it's good, so I won't even complain haha. All in all, another wonderfulepisode which only makes Nakano (and me) more grateful than ever that someagricultural deity exists to feed him and let him touch her (#PedoAlert) to hissatisfaction... this show is just great. Now to give the theme songs haha<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MsIbIfcgc7Y/XMUcZ6jnjKI/AAAAAAAAwPs/ZllkY87zs8U9byn6TNMcqWCmq0MNGIbfQCLcBGAs/s320/senkosan03_nakano1.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            When you haven't taken your daily dose of fox tail caressing lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qpLBvgRRLwc/XMUcZyuy-yI/AAAAAAAAwPo/6DOHDacKj5wVKWXZGVXcS3hmU9xhuZL3ACLcBGAs/s320/senkosan03_youko.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I want this to become an Anime haha          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

Incase you don't read credits, "Kon kon kon" (haha) is voiced by - I didn't evenguess it because I thought Waki Azumi would take this role too -&nbsp;<a  href="https://myanimelist.net/people/8/Rie_Kugimiya"  target="_blank"  >Kugimiya Rie</a>-san, and if you need references to how cute this veteran can get on her voice,watch some<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/1426/Shana" target="_blank"  >Shana-chan</a>and you'll pick up the vibes immediately haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BungouStrayDogs28">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span      style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"      ><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Bungo Stray Dogs Season 3</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Isekai"? Did someone say that word? TRIGGERED lol  </div></blockquote>And... man, what an episode to end the short arc. Haha did I say that last weektoo? Oops haha. In the final episode of this (#BungouStrayDogs28) shortflashback of a series, we find out that the one real spy in this series has beena spy in like, every flashback lol. We'll talk about that later, but first,proceedings. Firstly, I was right in most cases. (Gotta give myself some credither to sound smart lol) Arahabaki was an existence, probably an ability of somesort but sealed by the military in Japan and which is an Aragami (a sort of Godexistence, if you wonder), and directly possessed Chuuya in the events thathappened. According to Randou's account (not going to talk about his real namewhich is under that hat tbh), he and another guy (we'll get to that later) weresupposed to steal said power and report back to their Western headquarters (ifwe like to believe it might be the Guild but we don't know) (maybe the WhiteHouse has ability users lol) but instead resulted in betrayal and mostimportantly, the attention of the nation. So to save himself, Randou chose torelease that spirit and it destroyed the place good, he supposedly killed hisally, and left the place unscathed. Fast forward to years later where Chuuya isable to control his power, Randou came to learn that truth and seeks to takerevenge (as predicted) not really on Port Mafia specifically but to gain thepower for his own interests, most likely. So in comes his space control powerswhich obviously defy the laws of gravity even if it was set by<strike>Arahabaki</strike> Chuuya, which explains how he can survive the blastback then. Thank goodness X-ray wasn't anyone's ability yet lol and Dazai wasprepared to replacing his hand in a cast with perhaps something more useful (Ithought it was a minigun lol, but) which was probably just to make sure he canbreak Randou's barriers to negate his powers and not get killed by the ex-leaderwho was just possessed by Randou and has a scythe waiting to rip him in halflol. Ignoring the "I don't want to die" moment lmao, the two managed to defeatRandou, he told his story, and that is it. They've done it. Not as spectacularas when Chuuya had to like, limit release, but close enough haha. In the end,his kid friends betrayed him in the most spectacular way possible by joining inwith the GSS wtf, and managed to "assassinate" the leader ie. Chuuya, who ofcourse is not in a pinch of choosing whether to survive when incidentally Dazaiarrived with his army lol. He offered him a place in Port Mafia in return oftaking care of the organisation's and his enemies which technically includes thechildren, but they were protected by Chuuya's orders and the rest were settledby lunch haha. Just another day in the life of Port Mafia, guys. Don't worry toomuch. On a side note, the most important thing you should have paid attention tois the mention of the lab as explained by Mori Ougai. The lab was trying toinfuse human beings with abilities which should remind you of a certainwere-tiger which I somehow cannot remember the name, and should make youunderstand why the Agency doesn't know of anything while Port Mafia knows thatone guy so well as much as to want to recruit him from the start. So yeah, nextweek we'll be back in canon story line, and boy can I not wait to see what morefun we'll have next. The action is short and sweet, the mysteries always getsolved in the most logical way possible, and everything is awesome. We need anew reason to hype this season, and thanks Anime for coming back. *cheers* Lastbut not least, evil Mori Ougai is awesome haha what is it about the meeting withthe old man in the Agency and the woman though... the lore, guys, the lore.Muahahahaha...<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x4pMKJY7-n4/XMUnZgmofDI/AAAAAAAAwP8/jr8Gr8fPAFEFHxxktuUluWSzIkuxYW90ACLcBGAs/s320/straydogs28_ango.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">So evil haha</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AEn92ID35NY/XMUnZkhNREI/AAAAAAAAwQA/FiaSYP-nET4LHSanwNV6B_SDQEyertbBgCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs28_hands.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">So gay haha</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "To die is not the opposite of living; It's just a part of the process oflife" Hmm, very deep, Dazai, very deep in meaning... haha<br />P.P.S. (spoileralert) What the f**k dude you got the military behind you? I thought<i>I</i> was the strongest in the Sheep! Haha but seriously wtf man you don'thave to do conscription and yet... Lmao<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AoChan04">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span      style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"      ><b>アニメ</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;">      Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</span    >  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Ao! Ao! My dinner is just rice!!" If you didn't laugh hardest at this I    don't know what in this series will lmao  </div></blockquote>It's like she even knows of 3P haha let me be the fourth if you guys doing 4P,okay? Haha on second thought I'll have to deal with Kijima so no thanks lol. 4Pis provided I'm the only guy lmao. Okay, in the new episode (#AoChan04) we havecompetition. Yes, people. Ao-chan isn't the only b*tch that wants to f**k lmao.And it's Miyabi, classmate probably in elementary school, it seems. She was theone who sent in the love death threat lol, and she's the one who will stand infront of Ao-chan and stop telling her to be a b*tch even though she's the b*tchand is totally trying to fight for Kijima's attention. (Sorry is the asterisksare bothering you lol) So yeah yeah Ao-chan kind of found out mistakenly that hewas sleeping with Miyabi (obviously not true because Miyabi knows of photoshoplmao) but yeah, back to studying I guess. Then again, it wasn't as easy as justthat. The father knows about it again because Ao-chan can only consult with herdad, and in an outing (with the dad) they saw the couple and the dad sort ofdecided to do something about it. Well, firstly, by already writing a love novelin a female author<a href="https://jisho.org/search/pen-name" target="_blank">pen name</a> lmaowhich supposedly Miyabi uses to guide her through the day in the amusement park.(Man, this guy is earning it, the money haha) The real couple (Kijima and Ao)end up in a haunted house, she was scared and he volunteered to walk her out.Not until you notice that the place is rigged by the father so yeah, it wasprobably intentionally created to make each other jealous of the fact that theyare attached to someone in their own outing. Whether that's good news or not totheir silent period after seeing that fake photo, I'm not sure. What I'm surethough is likely the dad is helping them this time around so Ao-chan can finallyget around to be jealous of the guy and do something about instead of being ab*tch haha Miyabi I'm sorry but you're going to lose to big tits lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gb-NGBIszMs/XMVCcQcKChI/AAAAAAAAwQg/OFMdRrnjwroyn68gdxEwXuzFJYDCvzu3gCLcBGAs/s320/aochan04_miyabi5.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            How to know if a woman is jealous lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-afjDTBXMR9g/XMVCcBlzJeI/AAAAAAAAwQc/Z6Rx0L7et1ArNnHxFuWhWujFxPVpTk_CACLcBGAs/s320/aochan04_3P.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Ao-chan's imaginaiton of the week lmao why censor Miyabi-chan though          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S.

No joke, I speak from Anime experience haha *looks at DomeKano*<br />P.P.S.But seriously speaking, must the dad always dump in the Anime stupidity AFTERexplaining the reality in romance?

Uh,okay... The only one happy is the maid though, as we will soon (immediately)notice haha. Firstly, the trip. The three girls (namely Misha, Washiwashi andMorikawa haha) go for a hot spring location you wish exists (it doesn't) (thator you must be as rich as Midorin to build yourself one) and they had a greattime. That was just fanservice, I guess, and that occasional snooping from themaid lol. (Yeah I finally remember, it's Tsubame) More importantly, the tripended with Misha forgetting to bring a change of panties. I would argue thatbesides buying one on the way home you could also just wear back the previousone (unless you as a kid already wet it because you're horny as f-) instead ofjust bearing all sorts of nonsense including the maid and typhoon while goinghome commando lol. As we can see, besides commanding the heavens, Tsubame hasagain shown what it means to be able to do everything for the sake of hermaster, namely the kid. Which bring us to the last part, where Misha thinks thatshe can prove to Tsubame how she can also be maid and not be like those in thatone Anime (lol 4th wall reference here) but more importantly, Misha has alsoproven to herself that housework is hard work, and people do that on a dailybasis. Thanks, Dad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That is total fanservice probably for Tsubamethough, as she kind of replicates the same scenes as the Anime she watched (lolreally wtf it this flash panties season?) and... yep that's pretty much it. Nomajor screw-ups whatsoever. That's boring haha. But for Tsubame that might bethe best thing ever. Well, until she notices that her phone has been stolen bythe little ones upon Misha knowing that she is quietly being snooped all thistime lol. I don't delete the photos tbh I just smash the hardware on the groundand crush it with my foot haha. Well, I'll tell Midorin to crush it with herbare feet so she can enjoy the pain while we're at it lmao ah this show isreminding me how fantastic this was especially with the level of self-thoughtand jokes I can never stop laughing at.

That, and Lynn-san is in it.Let's talk about it. Story in a nutshell: The end is nigh. Okay, not exactly,and turns out this story is way more than you see in the trailer which I've seenlast year, to be honest. Story goes that a girl Sakura is about to die due to aterminal disease regarding her pancreas, and the one guy saw her personal diary.Yep, opened it up and read it. I mean, as someone who would return it to thelost &amp; found or even just the nearest counter, this is definitely how it canall start if you did otherwise. So instead of hiding it, Sakura chose to tellhim the truth, that her body was beyond saving. In surprise, she found out theguy wasn't worried about it, since it's another person dying. Hey, sounds likeme lol. Still, the girl insisted on spending the rest of her remaining life withthis guy, so she joined the guy in working part-time at the school library. Andthen that it how it all began, and maybe because he knew the girl in front ofhim was about to die, so like, obligation to fulfill her last wishes remain. Soyeah, from going to places to eat (where did they get all this money lol) (ohyeah she was technically working) to even going on weekend trips and lying tothe family and best friend about it (we'll come back to that later), those weregreat times. There were of course, some instances of showing some romanticprogression between the two. I mean, it's a coming of age show anyways, so yeah,sleeping on the same bed because the hotel can't give you two single beds, andpouncing on each other is a thing lmao. And then in comes the hoax: the hospitalvisit. It made the guy real worried for once, and yeah, maybe that is when heshowed concern for the first time, to another human. That, and thank goodnessshe got discharged out of the hospital to (SPOILER ALERT INCOMING) die due to astabbing. Yeah WHAT THE F**K DUDE WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?? Sakura waspronounced dead especially considering her condition ("hey if you could try notto stab my abdomen" lol), and the guy took some time to realise how much shemeant to him, and how much she changed his life even without using his name, andeven so made an impact Haruki will live to remember.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9UNMQff2pnE/XMRkY38J12I/AAAAAAAAwOU/YkCd7wEt6o8BRyv0Ki2e2vsn9r23CzSjQCLcBGAs/s320/kimisui_sakura06.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            In case you wonder what it is about loundraw's drawings that is            beautiful          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-seuhu0rYiCI/XMRkYwjyN7I/AAAAAAAAwOQ/0P2vlkakFAkkFpNZekF_yDZnsdh4mfjoQCLcBGAs/s320/kimisui_sakura07.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            In case you wonder what it is about loundraw's drawings that is            beautiful          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>Okay, been holding back on comments above tbh, so here goes. Firstly, I'm realsurprised not because it wasn't a smooth ending like most of these life endshows would do ie. the one time she went to the hospital will be her last, andeveryone would crowd around to her death while he has to explain the reality tothe people she kept secret to besides her family. Seriously, I thought it wasthat, especially from the trailer. But even if I didn't and made me think shejust died without much notice, the story still gave me a 180 and tell me shedidn't die due to her illness!! So that was quite a plot twist, to say theleast. Secondly, I can relate to this show. Not that I have someone around mewho is about to die and wants to spend his or her remaining time with me (I'venot had the luxury to be touched emotionally by another fellow being tbh), butsuffice it to say Haruki behaves a lot like me. But I would like to point out, Iwould not do one thing he would likely do until the day Sakura dies, that is tokeep her secret. At least, to Kyouko, or even the ex-boyfriend, I would tellthem the truth. I would not keep mum and let them beat me up. No joke, I'm toohonest to keep this secret. If you are going to die and you tell me you didn'ttell anyone else outside the house but you're like, the most popular person atthe workplace or in school, you'll be sure I'll tell every single one of themhaha. Death is bad that it brings people around you to grieve, but it sure isbetter than to find out in the future that the lie is set, and that time cannever be recovered. Obviously drawing into Kyouko's perspective right here, butbecause she seems to be the one who will be hurt the most not knowing of thenews. (Screw the ex, alright? We marry the two spring trees now haha) (Yes,referring to Sakura and Haruki, which means "spring tree") So yeah, I would notstand and watch her enjoying her time with me because as much as I like to jokelike Sakura maybe, I would not take impending incidents lightly. Not especiallyif I see your pills and hear you got hospitalised. If you are just unhealthy Iwouldn't care, but if you are going to die I'm not going to keep mum. That's...what I can assure you. Also, why drag this guy down with you if you're going todie; you need more people to cry for you?? Haha thank goodness I wouldn't evenopen that book in the hospital since I don't want people asking me why I'mthere. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Haha okay let's move on. (Note to self: You can't tell herabout your last weekend in the hospital lol) Lastly, I would say Sakura is whatI want in life but have never seen. Hey, welcome to the world of Anime, ladiesand gentlemen. With a light novel story as base and loundraw doing characterdesign, no wonder this show is done well. But ignoring production since Iwouldn't be picky (not even sumika for the theme songs), but from a personalstandpoint I secretly want someone like Sakura to come into my life. Well, itprobably wouldn't happen already looking back at my studying years (it was closethough; I got a girl to come to my place to study, remember?), but man, onecould dream, right? Cue the ending theme here lol. Still, for someone who relieson relationships to live compared to me who thinks living is itself a pain(sorry pancreas I do you no wrong), Sakura is sweet gum I'd be willing to eat24/7. If such a girl exists and would appear in my life, I say once more, mymotivation to live will be her. Problem is, it's not there. Oh well, I couldwatch this and cry lol Haruki got laid with a dead girl and I'm still alive lmaoGOT ME haha<br /><table  align="center"  cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0"  class="tr-caption-container"  style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img loading="lazy"          border="0"          data-original-height="720"          data-original-width="1280"          height="180"          src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MyVrfDdUCm0/XMRkxLD3XYI/AAAAAAAAwOg/mutdeaEjxpQI40v3sKHkVm9mzcSId54FQCLcBGAs/s320/kimisui_hug.jpg"          style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"          width="320"        />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        This movie in a nutshell?      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>To end this, I would say overall production is good. Lynn-san wasn't what Iexpected in this show, but thanks to<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35639/Just_Because" target="_blank"  >a certain Anime</a>I believe her acting lively characters would be similar, so that is that. (Idon't care about the rest of the cast, in case you wonder haha) Aniplex mightnot be the best choice for music, but it is a choice, and I still liked thesoundtrack. Would argue more soundtrack to make impact would be better though,as three songs have been presented throughout the movie. Animation I can'tcomplain, but considering loundraw started his own studio and can do<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9-mVOtkPJQ" target="_blank"  >this for a CM</a>(commercial), I wouldn't be impressed with the animation quality here, but it'sstill good. The plot line represented is also good, and as I said above, besidesthe plot twist, I really enjoyed how this plays along, as dumb as it sounds.Again, I wouldn't read any book I picked up on the street especially if I knewit belongs to someone like one with a custom cover. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Is this why Ihaven't got laid? I need to up my curiosity more haha. Then again, Sakura hasbeen in a relationship, so she knows how it feels to be loved. And I like howthe plot has explained itself completely in this show, as indirectly shown inher diary Sakura has been interested in Haruki for some time, and naturallyafter experiencing heartbreak and facing impending death she decided to go boldand choose the one guy to be with for the remainder of her life, in whichcoincidence made it all happen as if to fulfill her dying wish. Unlikely shewould confess to the most boring guy in class who doesn't give two sh*ts, butthe book thing definitely made it happen way more easily. All in all, I came inwith an initial neutral only to be impressed by the story. On that, I'll say isa good show. Thanks for making me cry like, as many times as every time oneperson cried. Yes, the funeral doesn't count.<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QqbXt3kliJ0/XMRlAicH-KI/AAAAAAAAwOk/sP-G2PTr8-AbZupDWBMTPktuUrobAq4cACLcBGAs/s320/kimisui_sakura25.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I know it's just all her images here, but Sakura, you light up my            life.<br />(I suddenly have an urge to listen to Kuraki Mai's "Light            Up My Life")          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="180"              data-original-width="320"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ww4BD-Zl0wc/XMRnftaVKUI/AAAAAAAAwO0/_WffGl5QeRgg7KrFU_Gvz-fPexaITuLJwCLcBGAs/s1600/kimisui_actions_sml.gif"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This character is so cute I can't even          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>[Early part postscripts because I haven't gotten serious and so did Sakura lol,and some after I watched]<br /><ul>  <li>    "I'll spend the rest of my life with you" Man, you totally picked up on this    one, bro.

Whether how good or bad it is - food, sports,video gaming, smoking?, love and fidelity?, being otaku and buying a stack ofCDs (lol) - it'll give them something in life, instead of regretting and makingthem frantically search for one when they grow up. It's a pain to do this stuffnow with people constantly questioning about your life goals because you don'thave any]<br />[Advisory x2: The infection or even removal of a pancreas doesnot mean your life is dead. According to medical sources online (I did a bit ofresearch), the pancreas is an organ which helps your digestion by - if you couldrecall in your science lessons - turning food into glucose. Without that you canstill live but you would suffer from severe diabetes (yep) because youconstantly need drugs and specifically injections (refer to Sakura's bag) toneutralise the threat. Maybe that's why she said she was about to die; she gottired of living. Hmm...]<br /><br /><div style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid var(--foreground); padding: 4px 8px;">  [Update 2019.05.01: Yes I got reluctant in watching a show on a Monday so I  chose the nearby public holiday to do it haha let's do this]<br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan50">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span        style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"        ><b>アニメ</b></span      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Attack on Titan Season 3 Part.2</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "Rest up, Eren" I'm like, walking the whole night through the forest bro,      you want me to rest? lol    </div>  </blockquote>  Hmm, and that is a real interesting episode (#AttackOnTitan50), despite it  being short and rather straightforward in development. We're back, guys, and  in this next part of the Anime story (because they can't come up with a better  title) we continue to seal off Wall Maria. But well, it was all again a farce.  It's like they just wasted time doing whatever they set out to do again. I  would argue though, that walking through the forest in pitch darkness and  sneaking to the edges and sealing off the wall is a legit strategy to gain  confidence in the people again. But then again the enemy is full of  intelligent Titans, which is kind of a problem in itself if you think about  it. So yeah, credit goes to Armin this time I guess, and RIP the first guy who  got killed this arc lol, as many would likely join him so... I wouldn't say  too much haha. Nonetheless, the guys did manage to seal the outer wall, only  to realise that all of them (yep all the Titans) were actually cleverly  concealed in the walls all this time. Now THAT is what I call a stealth  operation, Erwin. Thanks to Armin's thinking and not believing that they are  hidden in a ditch somewhere (well for Beredohdt and Reiner it's possible but  the others...) and of course, Erwin believing in the flexibility of the  operation being as Levi mentioned "as long as we don't get rid of the enemies  Wall Maria will never be retaken", we got an answer. Hey, I like when a  mystery gets resolved in the episode itself. But really man, way too quiet.  And you didn't even clean up after your tea? You disgust all British in tea  etiquette haha. But yeah, Erwin has also a purpose for walking into their  trap, because as much as these monsters are prepared, he might also be.  Whatever that is, and what will happen next to Eren's titan fight with Reiner  and everyone else, is the next big thing in this series. Let's hope it's going  to be nothing but a streak of awesomeness waiting for us just like their death  lol<br />  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r5SjeH9cMOw/XMmLJK0TUzI/AAAAAAAAwZM/nYxlCDOnNbU0FmCsIKT81jkhQqd6NronQCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan50_leader.jpg"                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Example of a timid leader lol            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table        align="center"        cellpadding="0"        cellspacing="0"        class="tr-caption-container"        style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"      >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img loading="lazy"                border="0"                data-original-height="720"                data-original-width="1280"                height="180"                src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tTq7EuKkPds/XMmLJCxnUVI/AAAAAAAAwZI/yLhtegDbxmwq5xvwtWgTMrnhCDnEE_QHwCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan50_erwin.jpg"                width="320"              />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Example of a confident leader            </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. Just heard the new cinema staff song from the Anime itself as the ending  theme song, and... I like the flashback feel in the animation, as if they are  paying tribute to something. Is this their end, the lot of them of humanity? I  hope not. This is such a dull show I could use some happy stuff&nbsp;</div><br />...<br /><br />Nah, not doing it, manga reviews. Moving on~<br />(I'llprobably do it in bulk, as I have plans to purchase some Japanese manga. I'lljust need like, 10 weeks to read like, 9 volumes worth lol)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span      style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"      ><b>音楽</b></span    >    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>This week wasn't too much of a week, but we can talk about it. Longing this forquite some time since last year, I finally got to listen to<b>NEGOTO's best album</b>, and yes, their last, and... it wasn't as much as Ithought. Maybe it's just the melodies, or the style doesn't stick with meanymore. Still, I think I can give a couple of songs, even though it doesn'tbring enough justice for the two CDs worth of 36 tracks. You can find out moreon the recent Moment I posted on Twitter what songs I have given and the restaren't in the album too on Apple Music if you want. Again, hitting that previewbutton is still, in my opinion,the easiest way to hear a bunch of songs in ashort period of time. I also remembered <b>metro polica</b> listening to oldiesand... man have they come far since the last time I saw them with a major album.Some of their newest songs are good, so I might give something next week maybe.Yes, it's because I got so much attention again following Karano Marina lastweek lol what's with all the following here I'm too old to understand lmao<br /><br />Nextweek brings us <b>nano.RIPE's new digital single</b>, so yeah, not full single.Still, it's been some time since they sang, and I did say from the music videopreview that it isn't bad, so I guess I'll have to give it haha. I'll also havea couple of days work leave and holiday to back that up effectively reducing mywork week to 2 days (YESH), so yeah<b>I'll try to clear that Aqua Timez live and Ten-chan's</b> if I have the timeto not sleep all afternoon haha<br /><br />On Twitter news directly orindirectly (lol I have to use this phrase now so I can group all other newstogether), <b>Scenarioart is releasing a new single</b> in the upcoming monthsfinally, <b>Yoru no Honki Dance released a new music video</b> preview and... Iguess it's fine. Man, they don't sound like themselves anymore, to be honest. Isit because of major label? You can tell us, guys. No pressure haha.<b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> got a music video preview and... what is withall this cuteness? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The<b>ending theme song for Anime "Ao-chan"</b> revealed their release date whichis end of May like the opening theme (man, why), and<b>cinema staff's new single</b> is ready to go. Well, hopefully the Anime is.Lastly, because of the above one video featuring<b>loundraw's new video (see movie review)</b>, the song at the background wassung by none other than - if you find it familiar - Hanazawa Kana-chan, with theguy himself writing and producing the song. Wha- Anyways, I hope that will be asong of hers someday, but man, a movie without full-on loundraw animation anddrawing is like the above. Imagine what happens when he takes over everything.I'll be waiting patiently for that day to come.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That'sall I guess. I have to make this post shorter with a collapsing element for themovie, so if you see that happen when you hover or click on the title then thatmeans I've done it haha. Cya guys next week then, and remember to come back forsome titan talk. And until next time... I need to plan out my breaks. I have todo stuff, not just sleep all day as much as I like to, to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>Life ia all about sleeping people. Until you notice you have people to interactwith and you can't sleep. Well, invite them to sleep with you? Argh I can'tforget that night with Sakura-chan haha imagine how dumb I would be sleeping onthe couch when I really say three things cute about her. Haha okay goodnight.<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
