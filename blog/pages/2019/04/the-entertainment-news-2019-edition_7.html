<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9N8-N4SRUGQ/XKm0x3LUXCI/AAAAAAAAvv0/mAqtf-QZ56EH9Z0cmwB_Pyxk_1PWbodpQCLcBGAs/s320/hitoribocchi01_fail.jpg"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div><br />I hope you noticed that not so obvious tagline I've placed from last weekand this post just right above mainly because the system in Blogger sucks and Iwant a way to search my own opinions from the past watching Anime lol. So yeah,this is what I came up with. Clicking on them will (hopefully if I can recallthis every week) search the blog for that exact hashtag so you can find the postof the specific episode.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Wait, maybe that's not theway I want, huh. What if I want to find all the posts in the series? I may haveto change this a bit lol (Edit: Official series Twitter hashtags in Englishbecause I Japanese haha) (And if I can't get used to these long hashtags I'lledit back to WHATEVER I WANT lol) (Edit v2: Edited back haha)<br /><br />Anyways,let's get to what happened this weekend, yes? Okay, not all of this happened inthe weekend but I hate weekdays so whatever lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AoChan01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Midara na Ao-chan Benkyou ga Dekinai</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "I'll go to a university as far away (from home) as possible" Yeah to get    away from your dad!! Haha you think he'll let you, Ao-chan?  </div></blockquote>The first thing they should do before putting that bold statement out to saylooks doesn't matter is to make the main couple ugly. Can you do that, author?<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this... fairly interesting first episode (#AoChan01) of this12-minute series (yep, getting Aho Girl flashbacks already) if there's somethingAo-chan can learn how to say for starters instead of being so kind is to say"fuck off", because she hates guys. And it's not like some other girl who hatesguys because the dad's a freak (wait), she hates guys because she thinks guysare lewd. (Must... not... relate... to... WORKING!! No<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/24419/Mahiru_Inami" target="_blank"  >Inami-san</a>go away!!) Actually, she just wants to study. And for good reason, as she wantsto be a good student and have a great future. What's wrong with that, isn't it?It's only wrong when you have a sicko for a father ugh haha. Really, she doesn'thave just <i>any</i> father. It's the kind of father no one wants to have.Really, not even myself, and I'm male. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, there's this guy calledKijima, he's popular, he wants to talk to Ao-chan, but hey we got like, thisperfect student who doesn't even have time to talk to men, or so she ensuressince he thinks everyone is as mentally sick as her father anyways. (What aboutthe editor by your dad though he is<strike>a good man I think who is</strike>&nbsp; not your dad lol) So yeah, butshe has a hard time rejecting the shit out of people. I mean, she can just say"stay away from me" and be a real prick but really, she's just being nice, andmaybe that's what attracted Kijima to her. I mean, if otherwise you would beattracted to someone who loves to just study as a high schooler, you need amedical checkup lol. Anyways, she gets an opportunity to get past her message,but instead gets flustered over Kijima's reaction mainly because Ao-chan herselfdidn't know of anyone else that pure (lol) besides her dad so has no idea hownormal men behave, but maybe also because she thinks he's a fine dude. Well, heis going to get in the way of her studies though at the end (or is it thedad...) so I would argue otherwise, but yeah, this is probably why she won't beable to study as the title suggests. Spoiler alert: She might be in love. And Iwon't thank the father here because besides giving card hints to do the boy andlifting up her shirt (un)intentionally, he is just going to get in the way. Hey,the father had romance before? Or was it after the mother's passing that... Idon't care about that piece of shit haha. What will happen next to Ao-chan afterKijima literally confessed to the girl he likes even though it leaves Ao-chantotally confused to the extent of not remembering what was her reply? I guess wegotta watch to find out. Meanwhile, I gotta complain about the episode length(please refer to 2017 Summer Anime to see me write a load of stuff explainingthis trend) (oh I didn't?) (What about winter 2018?) and the lack of pace in thefirst episode in terms of plot also maybe due to me having read the firstchapter of the original work. Otherwise I would commend on Waki Azumi beinggreat on this role, and as irritating as the father was, and Kijiima being justthe right guy who will attract Ao-chan's attention. We have potential shoujomanga content, guys. Well, as long as the father doesn't interfere, we will. Youknow, Ao-chan? If you need help juggling (not your tits lol) between schoolworkand whatever sick shit people keep throwing at you including yourself, maybe tryto become one and talk sick like that one Student Council president<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/32797/Shino_Amakusa" target="_blank"  >Amakusa Shino</a>lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w-zVv7Ke51A/XKigrxh0c8I/AAAAAAAAvrA/EdP-ZrSd1N8h8zRVWK15R6gsk0rtCmG0ACLcBGAs/s320/aochan01_room.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            You want to live in a room on your own?<br />Why is it all pink? lol            #LewdColour          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ueVF0mJrdjI/XKigrzLRieI/AAAAAAAAvrE/ZlMaWKjd1GMXUwy8l9soxRbpXD5IdaUFgCLcBGAs/s320/aochan01_kid.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            In case you need a word pun explanation "<a              href="https://jisho.org/search/aokan"              target="_blank"              >aokan</a            >" isn't the best phrase to describe your own name.          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. "How did you get such a high score?" "When you start studying?" Wow the guygot burnt real good there lol<br />P.P.S. At some points you'll notice that WakiAzumi's sadistic voice is leaking out, and if you know of "Blend S" you'lleither hate it or love it so much you'd rather let Ao-chan hate you lol I'm goodhaha "Is he a masochist?" NO AZUMI-CHAN DON'T DO IT haha<br />[Since I can't puttwo links on a hover image thumbnail,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/Ey2DNyZg2VU" target="_blank">here's the video</a>explaining why I say pink is a lewd colour haha] [To summarise in case the videolink is dead (#foreshadowing), it was a Pyxis (Ito Miku, Toyota Moe) livestream,Miku-sensei is teaching about colours and deduced pink is an indirectly lewdcolour, especially when Moeshi likes pink stuff and her room is pink lmao]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HitoriBocchi01">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">Hitori Bocchi no Maru Maru Seikatsu</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Why can't elemenrary school last nine years?" Hey don't ask me go question    the education system, girl. Haha  </div></blockquote>You know how to get friends? When you play a prank make sure to put your name init <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay because of a certain blogging website (refer to last week) (yesI know I didn't mention this show at all, but) I decided to give a chance tothis slice-of-life Anime where in the first episode (#HitoriBocchi01) thegirl... I wouldn't like referring to her as Bocchi-chan, but as her name implies(you're going to need a lot of references starting with<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hitoribocchi" target="_blank">this</a>&nbsp;because all their names have meaning) she is alone. In middle school,I'll take that as acceptable because look at Anime "Slow Start" lol. If this wasyou in high school, you may need some social assistance haha. So yeah, shestarts her life in middle school WITHOUT ANY FRIENDS, mind you, like many otherswho probably are in this situation because their friends went to other schools.For her, it's her long time friend Yawara Kai-san (<a  href="https://jisho.org/search/yawarakai"  target="_blank"  >ugh</a>) who couldn't be more kind to being friends with her for this long. Six yearslong, in case you wonder. So yeah, times have to change, and so Bocchi has tomake new friends now. Yeah, until you notice she pukes upon socialising. Hey,was a problem for me too. Really makes you wonder how she'll deal with societyin the future, but we got present issues to solve. Her ex-friend is in the midstof breaking up with her unless she gets to know everyone in class. Hey, only 28other people? Make a friend a day and you'll be done in a month lol. Oh I'mcounting weekends btw haha you gotta make the class know you before the HeiseiEra ends lmao we still making this joke? Okay that aside, she did at the end ofthis episode, make a friend. I hear you say "What?" but yeah, she did it. Goodfor you, girl. Now the series can actually start. If you guys are making this afull adaptation please tell me we getting three more seasons of this because Iwould love to not watch them haha. (please no foreshadowing here) Anyways, SunaoNako-chan (yes<a  href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&amp;op=translate&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%E7%B4%A0%E7%9B%B4%E3%81%AA%E5%AD%90"  target="_blank"  >this too</a>) became her first friend after she got some interested in her and also shedecided to make friends with the closest person to her seat, which wasironically (as they do in Anime) at the back row towards the window. Nako-chanwasn't that much of a punk girl to receive even the attention of the teacher(wtf teacher, you into gals?) but more of a cool and honest character, so yeah,Bocchi got lucky here. No doubt we will see more people appearing around hersocial circle in the episodes to come (hopefully lol) (hey friends of friendscount as friends, Bocchi-chan) (Strategy #5 btw lmao), and we do even see a lotof friendly things going on from just texting in school (man I love this schoolalready normally your phones would be confiscated haha) and just gifting eachother gifts or whatever in between, and once again I can't help but love thisslice-of-life stuff once again. No need for confessions, Bocchi-chan. Likingstuff is natural, and it doesn't require a statement. That's something youshould remember. Moving on, I hope I would get interested in this series somehowbecause I would argue I still can't get over the social awkwardness whichreflects my own personality so well when I was a kid even after watching thatone show last year. Here's to hoping I'll like this after three episodes, yes? Ihave to give the theme song though... And the cast are mostly newbies I onlyrecognise Akarin... (I'm ruling out<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/160367/Kai_Yawara" target="_blank"  >Kai-chan</a>as she's not in this school) I don't even know how to like some of these newvoice actresses because no one told me to watch and like them... <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span> hahaalso Strategy #6 right at the intro of this review btw haha you'll be known bythe class real quick lol (And then the school starts on April 1st and people sawthat notice be like, is this a joke? Ah, the logic is perfect haha)<br /><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y9pddAMuC1g/XKm0xhYTQbI/AAAAAAAAvvw/8-ZKDoBvcj4SZfzBAXt2BOnbSXiDL4BAACLcBGAs/s320/hitoribocchi01_bump.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Honestly the only things I laughed this episode lol why          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table      align="center"      cellpadding="0"      cellspacing="0"      class="tr-caption-container"      style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"    >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img loading="lazy"              border="0"              data-original-height="720"              data-original-width="1280"              height="180"              src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9N8-N4SRUGQ/XKm0x3LUXCI/AAAAAAAAvv0/mAqtf-QZ56EH9Z0cmwB_Pyxk_1PWbodpQCLcBGAs/s320/hitoribocchi01_fail.jpg"              style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"              width="320"            />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me when I &lt;insert any action here&gt; lol          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div>P.S. As many have pointed out the main girl sounds like Kana-chan, and heck,it's her first role? You want to be famous, girl? Start changing your voiceoptions you're not going to be famous being tailwind haha<br />P.P.S. Author wasthe one who did Mitsuboshi Colors too? Isn't that just last year? Well I guessKadokawa was being kind to you haha. Hmm... you like your middle schoolerstories, isn't it? Pleased to be watching your work then. That is, if I stayhaha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>    <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>  </div></blockquote>Okay, not a lot this week but I did a lot over the weekend so let's talk aboutit. This also means I won't come to much conclusion for most of them so... youcan just listen to them too the moment I gave them I'm in it already.<b>Yogee New Waves new album</b> finally was available for streaming for somereason (Victor Entertainment, why) and... I ended up giving the topic songs. Soyeah. Don't ask how great their album was haha. Thanks to YouTube (I think) Iheard of a band I thought I would never give a song from<b>FIVE OLD NEW, and their newest music video</b> sure caught my attention andwithin acceptable melody region despite the raps in between shouting "OMG". Evenso, but I heard the related release which released newly from last month and...I know why I wouldn't like their music style haha this is a one-off thing now.Also, because they sound too like the 80s and I'm not really in the mood forthat so yeah. (99% GTA Vice City vibes, ladies and gentlemen totally can be inEmotion 98.3) I also caught wind of <b>AIMI from STEREOPONY</b> which disbandedlike 7 years ago releasing an album so I gave that a listen, and... it's thesame melodies, just... now I hate the music style. It's just her trying to blendinto the already saturatred J-Pop industry. Yes, those "sing a pop song andyou'll get famous" industry. So yeah, I tried to give instead some of the poprock styles instead which reminds me of the rock band. Really man, I miss those.And also thanks to remmebering to listen to the live performances for lastyear's content, I chanced upon <b>Cocoro Auction and their newest song</b> andthus their newest release which coincidentally comes out this week!! Yeah, andyou bet I missed their style and melodies. So yeah, and now the song has a titlewhen it did not have one back then. Playing the mind game, I guess? So I'lldecide on everything after FIVE OLD NEW next week. I also took a listen to thecharacter songs which were<b>insert songs in Anime "Domestic na Kanojo"</b> and... Yocchan's voice issoooo good, I thought Uchida Maaya was copying her. Wait, what? Yeah. They soundtoo alike? I mean, they are 2D sisters anyway no wonder haha<br /><br />Nextweek brings us one of the either most potent or harmless releases of the year,<b>Minase Inori's new album</b>. Eh, it was a miss last album so let's hope ithits somewhere on me this week.&nbsp;Also out next week are<b>Aimer's new two albums</b> for some reason (she got that many songs to&nbsp;write?) so I'll give that a listen when it comes out maybe. And... I'll&nbsp;follow up on the stuff mentioned above. I have been really lax on even givingreleases a listen to I'm trying to catch up. Yeah, that's how boring work was Idon't even have the mood to listen to songs anymore please help<br /><br />OnTwitter, <b>Hayami Saori is finally on Apple Music</b> so I can give her the onesong lol, <b>VELTPUNCH announced their return</b> with a series of liveperformances with new relesaes pending to arrive (hopefully),<b>Horie Yui announced a new album</b> due in July (better write that down), and<b>SPYAIR released a new song</b> which looks like a motivational song for asports school? Yeah, they do those things. Also, because I watched<b>  Anime "Ao-chan" the opening theme song is already out</b>for listening and for streaming so feel free to only give the song by"EDOGA-SULLIVAN" and not the show because it ROCKS!! Okay, I may try to givemore over next week before Inorin comes in to trash all competition lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay,finally done for the week. Between scary eyes and having babies... I wonder whyRui-chan haven't done it with Natsuo- Haha I'm just kidding I hope I didn't nailit on the manga spoilers lmao. Cya guys next week then, and you bet I am lookingforward to Good Friday muahaha oh it's next week? Haiz I should go get a fake MCand take a break haha<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
