Hey, TIL you can do a livestream signing of Tachibana Rika's new single. Eh...
you don't get the sign though she just signs it in front of you and reads your
comment maybe haha wtf<br /><br />Again, not learning my lesson to watch Anime
on Sunday mornings so I didn't get to nap in the afternoon again. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜©">*sigh*</span> I need
to <strike>finish my tasks</strike> enjoy my entertainment a little earlier but
yeah you bet I will next week at least with Bungo Stray Dogs. Senko-san makes me
feel like a pedophile haha okay let's forget that and move on<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Hey, if it's ONLY one day off I'll be sure I'll stay at home. Well, if you have
a couple demigods and a rack for a neighbour then maybe not lmao. The new
episode (#SenkoSan08) brings us to the beach?? Yeah, because every Anime series
needs that obligatory beach episode, and I know it's just a man and a bunch of
kid-like figures, and that's why <strike>Enouji</strike> Jasuko had to join in
lol. They played in the sea, enjoyed the sun, and had barbecue. Best things to
do on the beach, yes? Ignoring whatever is behind all this (the fact that they
are transported there through holy gates), there's more mystery to where they
actually are now, even if Shiro mentioned it's some secret place that she knows
of. I mean, it is. The only other way people will be there is if they barely
survived a capsizing and drifted there haha. Anyways, we can't question this and
our screwed up work lives every time (looking at you, Nakano), and even me
watching this on a Sunday I also know tomorrow is going to be work again <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span>,
but hey, you gotta enjoy the time and live in it, yes? Simple premise for a
series, but it makes me wonder how it will end now. We are soon to the end, we
have been introduced once again to the other demigod who sits in the world
amongst Senko-san and Shiro-san, she gave Nakano the feast (which is not her
rack surprisingly lol), and... hints on confrontation sooner or later. Hmm... I
mean, it wasn't meant to be, this pairing, or even this pampering for Nakano, so
even if it were to go away he'll just go back to his sad working lifestyle,
so... I guess it's on Senko-san then? Well, hopefully more backstories will
determine how this will end eventually. For now... I'm glad I get to see some
fun even though if I were Nakano I wouldn't even move because THERE AREN'T EVEN
ANY CUTE YOUNG GIRLS IN THIS!! Haha yeah Enouji you don't qualify and I'm not
into 800-year-old kids lmao<br />

P.S. Lol the best part is going to be when they have to send Enouji back home do
they just wait until she sleeps or they just knock her out? Haha also Enouji is
clearly requested by production to compensate for the lack of... fanservice
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. Stop reminding me to exercise and do warmups I didn't do

Wow man, finally some progression I must say. In the new episode
(#BungouStrayDogs33) Fyodor finally took action. Man, you know how long I've
been waiting for this? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, let's talk about the rollercoaster that
has just happened. A mysterious killer is on the loose. You know, those
suspicious enough to gain any amount of attention here lol. Firstly, Fukuzawa
the President of the Detective Agency, has been assassinated. (I mean, his
Ability doesn't protect him, so... why you out on the streets alone at night
again?) Not immediate death of course, just a deliberate plot which we will see
later. He seemed to have been poisoned and is unconscious, so that's not good
news. Meanwhile, this assassin has been gaining all the attention in the area,
so of course Port Mafia will be around to take care of things before the one guy
becomes more powerful than them lol. He eventually surfaced by getting counter
plotted by the gang, and is the one guy who thinks he's more powerful than God
himself, that Guild member who was almost killed by Akutagawa. So yeah, if a
reminder of his powers is needed, he manipulates blood which makes him a strong
attacker and probably look like a stealth killer, but hey, he's not the only
one. Turns out he was being used, and here is where Fyodor and that book he
stole from Port Mafia episodes ago come into play. (Man, this show is so good at
this haha) In finding a way to dish out the assassin, Mori Ougai had to put
himself out in the streets as leader of the group and supposedly, as I guess
they know the intention of the killer already, assassinate the leaders of the
two Ability groups in Yokohama. So yeah, it did happen, a bomb went off while he
and Elise-chan were in a car (OMG Ten-chan I want to be my Ability so much
haha), and if you didn't notice, he survived. So yeah, Fyodor took the extra
step - as scheming as he is - to go in stealth and deliver the final blow
disguised as a policeman. Pure without intentions maybe, but I'd like to say
Mori can avoid that lol. Anyways, that's what happens when people just need to
know a little about your puppet-livesaver Ability and prepare a counterattack on
it. (We still wouldn't know what the Ability is exactly though but this will do
hehe I see what you did there, author) And so, both leaders are down. But they
aren't just down down, oh no, and according to the guy himself after being
confronted by Dazai who is as scheming as he is, it's cannibalism. (We will
ignore all of Fyodor's real motives in obtaining some book for now too much to
talk about liao) If you need explanations for the titles of the next couple of
episodes feel free to drop a message on Twitter haha. (Yes it's titled
cannibalism) Anyways, that "poison" is an Ability sort of virus that infects two
hosts and will only be nullified if one of them are dead, so... yeah it's
literally asking for a fight between the two groups who have recently just
announced a truce after whatever happened between them and the Guild. But hey,
Fyodor had to ruin the beach party haha. Of course none of them can trust each
other, so Port Mafia takes action first (I'll quote their half dead leader on
this one), arriving to the hospital Fukuzawa-san is. Well well, and next episode
I might just go crazy I would watch this first because THE ACTION IS ABOUT TO
BEGIN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!! I can't even hold my breath I need to go back and
watch overpowered Elise-chan again haha this tension's going up and I can't
wait!! (Not describing my boner btw lol)<br />

P.S. Can I just continue to talk about how much I want this to have a spin-off
series where it's just a slice-of-life of Mori Ougai with Elise-chan? I don't
care I want this to be the new Usagi Drop haha (imagine my face as the thumbnail
that's how happy I'll be if it happens haha)<br />P.P.S. I mean, everything
would easily be resolved if one of the victims this season is Kurotsuchi Mayuri
from "BLEACH" man just replace all the vital organs and one of them will be
technically killed. No one will be sacrificed- Oh this is not and everyone is
human? Okay haha<br /><br />

WTF lmao dad you branching out to making adult toys and sex dolls now?? (If that
thing on the bed reminds you of Miyabi you are not alone lmao) Ao-chan I still
wonder why you haven't level up your financial status yet your dad is making
money out of <i>everything</i> here haha. In the new episode (#AoChan09) we...
may just have an early conclusion to the series if what production now wants is
a happy ending, no joke. Ao-chan decides to study. This should come as no
surprise to all of us considering we all watched the first episode but hey, we
are 8 episodes down and this... might be going in any number of directions
besides that, to say the least. Kijima is all in Ao-chan's mind right now which
is kind of cute, but yeah, it's really stopping her from studying, the goal that
she has always aimed for which is good but really shows how badly she can handle
study and relationships at the same time. (Hey, aren't we all?) (Well I don't
have relationships when I was studying so you tell me haha) So yeah, Ao-chan is
as horny as she is desperate, so Yabe-san punishes her for not focusing on
study. Like really, man, that level of fanservice is thankful, to be honest.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Kijima also knows that, following Yabe-san's hint, dropped by
her place to hear how she actually feels considering as the dad mentioned, she
is not easy with words (but her body is BOOM got her haha) but yeah hearing her
out makes Kijima determined to not interfere with her studies and instead,
actually join her in her studies so, you know, they can be together. Aww, how
sweet. And yes again, as the dad also mentioned, Kijima should show her the
ropes of what it's like to fall in love as a teenager instead of being
influenced by the father's works (please Ao-chan do some Internet research at
least, geez) so yeah, that makes them friends now haha *points censored sign*
All in all, a nice episode to end the series- Oh we not there yet? Uh oh. What
else is left though in terms of story progression? We getting sports festival
next week and the dad can't be in the audience to watch? "Okay, make that an
episode!" &lt;= Anime director and scriptwriter (lol)<br />

Teenage life can be so simple, am I right? In this new episode (#Joshikausei09)
we got quite a flashback. Didn't expect them to slot in one of these, but sure,
I'll take it. We dwelve a little into Mayu-chan's past. You know, the one with
pickles as eyebrows and isn't Tsumugi from "K-ON!" lol. Everyone has to start
out alone in high school, but for Mayu-chan it... might be for quite a while. As
many tables surround each other but not her during lunch, she knows she's going
to get left out real quick until she notices her neighbour who at first look
might be some kind of yankee or something. Scared, she distanced herself even
further from everyone until she noticed Momoko playing with shadows under the
sunset and decided to join in. And that's how friends are made, guys. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
And it's also then that they played a lot with each other and on that evening
they were playing shadow puppets until the sun went down. Man, if only things
can be this simple. Now everyone thinks this is stupid and stops playing now- Oh
it's just me? Uh oh. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, I don't mind another episode starring
Shibumi's story (the other one with the glasses btw) so... may the theme song be
good next week haha this show is light-hearted and fun I almost forgot it's 3
minutes long<br />

  Hey, this is going to be fun. In the new episode (#AttackOnTitan55) we decide
  who to save. If it gives you some deja vu as to that other action show above
  this review, I'm sure it was a coincidence haha. I know the one above is quite
  hard to decide, like, between two gang leaders technically speaking (lol) (I
  promise I'm done relating to Bungo Stray Dogs here haha) but this one... it's
  quite an emotional rollercoaster. I decided to let my emotions take the best
  of me for this episode, and with a solid argument in this conundrum, it was a
  fine ending. I'm not going to spoil you here (yes, the postscript is a fluke),
  but suffice it to say what's left of humanity has been rather simply (for sake
  of plot progression) condensed down to two people. For one, Armin sacrificed
  himself to get burnt good so that Eren can deal the final blow to... that
  Colossal Titan (nope, not spelling that name again he's dead for good), and in
  the end is literally scorced to his death but is still barely breathing. Lewis
  was about to hand over the syringe that was passed on from Kenny to Eren to
  save the guy, but... in comes the only newbie survivor carrying Erwin the
  commander on his back. And yes, the usual "who to save" scenario emerges. Both
  sides provide rather solid arguments which I will let you determine after
  offering the sides and my opinion. So, supporting Armin's revival and Erwin's
  death are, of course, his close friends Eren and Mikasa. Eren argues that he
  was a master strategist, devised many plans thus far and even drew out the
  enemy, and Erwin did nothing like that. To be honest, that was quite a solid
  argument considering Erwin only lost his arm lol. Eren also childishly argued
  that Levi was about to hand over the injection until he saw that newbie
  appear, as saving the leader naturally became an option. Not wrong, but hey,
  gotta save that leader to keep up appearances, right? On the other hand we can
  always get a new leader. Haha Levi is that why...? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, spoiler
  free still haha, Eren also then talked about his personal experience that he
  wants to go to the sea beyond the walls as a trio, so... that I guess that
  excuse can come in when it wants. On the other side supporting Erwin's revival
  and Armin's death, Hange argues that Erwin's experience as a leader and
  tactician would be vital in keeping the human species alive within the walls
  and a chance to defeat the Titans which are now at this point, standing beyond
  those walls. (I won't comment on that, but fuck you Zeke haha) Levi also of
  course delivered the most logical argument ever, which is we have to revive
  the leader. Not wrong, considering what's left to command of the Scouts I
  would argue Levi is enough for his squad sort of to be in lead lol. But yeah,
  in war keeping the leader alive is vital in showing prowess and that your
  force is still standing strong at less than 10 lmao. All were told to stay
  away as Levi makes the decision to obviously, save the leader. But [SPOILER
  ALERT] Erwin had that last breath to deny that injection. I guess he's scared
  of needles? (I'm so sorry I gotta make that joke) Haha so yeah, then Levi
  remembered: He was about to save someone who was just prepared to sacrifice
  for humanity. So screw you that one newbie, you don't know your Commander well
  enough. So in the end, Levi gave it to Armin, he devoured what's left of that
  Colossal Titan that Zeke couldn't save (yep he saved Reiner alright thanks to
  Jean haha) (yes Jean live in agony forever you idiot) and... Armin survives.
  It seems like simple storytelling to me now, but man, did I shed a tear when
  they made the decision to let Armin die. I did a salute and tribute last week,
  I'll do it again. But yeah, I guess I have to salute Erwin now, you commanding
  idiot hah. A~nyways, Armin gets to live, Erwin fulfilled his duty to die with
  the newbie army he sent them off their deaths (so many young lives I'm so glad
  we are in peacetime so I don't die for the Army lol #ConscriptionProblems),
  and all is well. Next week... I guess we'll know about the truth even without
  War Chief Zeke telling Eren about it. We are either going to get a good
  surprise, or... maybe wait for Season 4? I don't know man I hate this suspense
  haha I want next week to happen<br />

  P.S. Attack on Titan is like loot boxes: you put in all the effort to do
  something to get the best chances of success and you still barely had a chance
  at it. And in the end it all fails and you're back at square one with nothing.
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. [SPOILER ALERT] If you don't know what to do if your
  dreams come true on the day we defeat the Titans, start thinking about it bro
  'cos YOU'RE COMIN' BACK!! Haha nah not doing it

I mean, I could summarise this week's paragraph with that
<a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1133557877606502400" target="_blank"
  >Twitter Moment</a
>&nbsp;I just posted but I guess I shouldn't just do that lol, but if you want
to skip this then that is faster technically haha.
<b>cinema staff's new single</b> is... okay, I guess, and we are so close to
putting it on the shelf, but hey, I only gave the one song which sounds like a
potential insert song for the Anime they did the ending theme in for this
release. <b>Edoga Sullivan's new EP</b> is actually nice to listen, as after
listening to the topic song I thought I was expecting a whole lot of pops but
instead there's a bit of everything. I ended up giving the other song which also
had a music video released recently which can be found
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/-CcYY09zd7U" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/tYyNMqcfiFw" target="_blank">here</a> for the Anime
theme song so... yeah, they are pretty good. (Not talking about her looks here
haha I don't care about that) <b>Spira Spica's new single</b> is... surprisingly
different compared to the previous release, but then again their pop style is
kind of sinking into me a little, and I'm still thinking whether I should give
another song besides the topic song, so... we shall see.
<b>Niitsu Yui's new mini-album</b> might be controversial in that besides the
new song which had a music video I have not intended to give anything yet. Maybe
one more, but I'll see if I can brainwash the melody on myself haha. Lastly, I
gave <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new mini-album</b> a chance because I heard of the
release just last week as mentioned, but... uh... I don't even want to give
anything. Sorry but your previous release was <i>way</i> better tbh<br /><br />Next
week brings us two much anticipated releases at least in my opinion.
<b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new album</b> is quite a long time coming considering
they only released a single last year before the album the year before, and
<b>amatsuuni's major debut single</b> for Anime "Joshikausei" may be
disappointing, but I'm feeling hopeful. I mean, I've given this many releases
over the past month to be able to tank another song which is sub-par, so just
don't make it too bad in full, yes? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />On Twitter this week (oh
boy), <b>Rie fu is returning to Japan</b> after probably a rocky journey singing
songs in UK (I don't know I should pity her of her stuck with Anime theme song
or not), <b>ClariS is releasing a new cover mini-album</b> after years doing one
for spring songs for this is summer obviously,
<b>I reviewed Teshima Aoi's album in 2014</b> because Lynn-san hosted an AMA
with the fans late at night and she mentioned about this song (it was a good one
btw I gave it), <b>Yoru no Honki Dance revealed a new music video</b> and it was
okay, and
<b>cinema staff's indie catalogue is available in streaming services</b>
including Apple Music. Phew! That was quite a mouthful. I did try to give
Teshima Aoi's album but... uh... I have a feeling such a style has been
presented on Hanazawa Kana's album in 2015 called "Blue Avenue" and that sounds
better haha okay it didn't catch my attention anyways<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay,
and I'm done. I'll probably do up a mid-week post considering I'm getting
another public holiday again BUT I didn't take any work leave because shit's
happenin' (lol), so... I guess I'll see someone there then. I'll be there,
that's for sure. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Cya guys then, and until then... APoL is in my agenda
for now. But from now till then I should try to read up on what I want to write
and how I should write it. That is, if I can stop playing the many games I just
added to my phone haha bye<br />
