<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img loading="lazy"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bvHcQa29qgE/XQ996AbEO9I/AAAAAAAAyEM/WRZlV1W5hDwzmRUwOCP9PSHZaSypScGGACLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190622_235041.jpg"  /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>I told you I'll be back for another one of these.<br /><br />So yeah, I'm backfor one of these, and yes, I've decided to do these at my own pace. Coming upwill be a larger series than this and that one will need some tracing in termsof which chapter did I leave off from when I last read online a year ago, butthis one is easy. It's Kawai Makoto-sensei's latest work which recentlyconcluded, and is titled "This love is illegal." just for internationalaudience, even though we know that is not the REAL title haha let's talk aboutit<br /><br /><br />WHAT AND WHY<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img loading="lazy"    border="0"    data-original-height="1600"    data-original-width="1200"    height="320"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bvHcQa29qgE/XQ996AbEO9I/AAAAAAAAyEM/WRZlV1W5hDwzmRUwOCP9PSHZaSypScGGACLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190622_235041.jpg"    width="240"  /></div>What, should be obvious from above title. "Amaetai no Hi wa Soba ni Ite." is astory about living in a world with androids. You know, not those that power themajority of smartphones (okay joke's over lol), but those beings which areengineered to behave like humans, living with humans. Among them is androidHinageshi (female btw) serving solo-living-away-from-home newbie author Kaede(male btw) and here's a secret: the android likes the human. In many ways thanother, that is illegal (thus the alternative title) and the android will bewiped off its memories if discovered being involved in any sort of romance witha human, even infatuation, I guess. So yeah, don't guess what happened. I'lltalk about the final Volume 3 right here, right now! Yeah, prepare for spoilers,by the way.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq manga">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span    ><span style="font-size: large;"> Amaetai no Hi wa Soba ni Ite.</span>  </div></blockquote>To give a good summary of this series, Volume 1 gave us the happy days, Volume 2gave us a warning, and Volume 3 gave us realisation and confrontation. Firstly,Hinageshi was living a great life with Kaede, the one guy who possibly has nofeelings whatsoever to the android, is being well taken care of by her, to saythe least. And they say she is bad at everything according to her qualificationtests. That aside, she notices her love for the man is growing, and so didKaede's social circle, from his childhood friend and crush Azuki to his managerand editor Tsukushi to Azuki's friend Momo... all of them had their troubles andjoys with android. Then, came in the declaration from a letter sent to herhouse: she has been discovered to have romantic feelings for a human. Hinageshiat this point can either (1) sign the statement which will probably get herarrested but more importantly get her abolished on her current job, or (2) bearthe consequences which is the, you know, wipe memory thing. Confronted also bythe one who reported her, Karin - an android herself - decides to convince herto do so as not doing so will eventually reach a bad ending. You know, the timewhere the authorities get to you and everyone is going to cry. Better to startearly, yes? But no, it's more than that. Azuki and Momo both know such is not astatement for freedom to love, as with many questions, consider the ethicalityin romance between androids and humans. This became a huge impact at the end ofVolume 2 after what seems to be a kid winning an award in the novel authorawards which Kaede attended and the manager shocked to see what she saw: theandroid she praised of her skills when she was a kid.<br /><br />Things get realescalated in the final volume (as with all final volumes) as the resolution ofHinageshi's fate is shown in two prime examples: What happens after an androidis wiped off its memories, and what happens when you have to get wiped, and inthe process too. Firstly, the manager Tsukushi recalls her past with Tanpopo theandroid (probably a reference to<strike>the character popular with kids</strike> the<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tanpopo" target="_blank">dandelion</a>) as shepraised on her work and thinks she can do it big and popular with hercreativity. The thing is, she will not be recognised due to the currentdiscrimination of androids as servants instead of free thinkers. And also, dueto inevitably violating the love rule as Tanpopo slowly opens up to Tsukushi,ends up being dealt with and yes, today her can barely remember what happened.The thing seems to be, that once an android gets wiped, their memories disappearof course, but their will and personality still remain, so the urge to still dosomething is still there, to say the least. Today, she is led by a human ownerwho is "releasing novels" under her own name to prevent the android from beingostracised, but hey, look what happened to her. Tanpopo can barely rememberanything, although she can still remember the passion that will continue todrive her to write. Good on you man, sucks to be Tsukushi though. Her childhoodmemories washed away as fast as yours. Next up, Karin gets her own taste ofreality. She was arrested by the authorities not because of her current humanowner, but because of what she did in the past. She might be the stereotypicalcase where human loves android (and probably vice versa) and the human suggestsfor them to elope and so on, even pursued by authorities. Karin did take theadvice, but also wises up to notice that this will do both of them no good(we'll see this feeling come back later) so Karin decides to leave the humanbehind and start anew. Too bad you can't escape the eyes of the law, for thehuman probably covered for her for the longest time available while she escapesto stay under another shelter, now has to admit all she has done before she getswiped off her memories. This time, it's not a joke. Momo was saddened withoutwords, and we know who will be up next.<br /><br />Hinageshi was up next notbecause the government knew about her infatuation, no, but Karin submitted hercase to the authorities, so... thanks for not ratting her out during yourinterview, you idiot. Anyways, it was an eventuality, so Hinageshi moved awayfrom her temporary owner Momo to go back to her old place to meet up with Kaedeonce again. They confess their feelings for each other, and all is well. Thatis, until the van pulls up at their doorstep. Kaede was unable to do anythingdespite saying he will do anything to stop her from being arrested, andHinageshi felt that implicating the human will do none of them good (referenceabove), so she left without a struggle, promising to come back someday. Thatday... might not even happen. However, when she confessed and was being readiedto be zapped off her memories... [SPOILER ALERT AHEAD] the machine did not work.She did not get wiped off her memories. Many were confused as to what happened,but despite the many attempts, she can still remember why she cried before shewas put under the bed. Many say this might be a miracle due to her strong bondsand relationships with the people around her, but maybe this is a goodexception. This spurred plenty of argument as to the fate of Hinageshi as Kaedetries to release a book talking about such a reality, the little knowledge hepossesses. And for the next decade (geez) experiments were done on her (had tomake this joke, but they didn't consider sex an option? lol) (you know, thenever-ending orgasm kind haha) until eventually, 12 years after being arrestedby the authorities, she was released. Yeah. They gave up, literally. I mean,what are you going to do about it? So yeah, they can't stop her now, as sherecovers and finds back the time she had with Kaede, now already 12 years olderin his late 20s, has been waiting for her patiently to return. Aw,Makoto-sensei, at least you didn't let me down by wiping her off, good onyou.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful series to read. The dialogues may belong since it wasn't translated so I had a hard time reading it but also, it'simportant to convey the feelings of all the characters since this isn't anaction show, so I'll forgive that. The artwork is fantastic, it's the veryreason why I'm into Makoto-sensei's works after Anime "Koufuku Graffiti". Nowyears in after missing her first artbook from a year ago, I show her my supportby reading her latest work which probably won't gain much attention as much as Iwould like, but this was a lovely story. Maybe compare this to Senko-san, butsadder and better plot twist haha. Finally, I like this series, Makoto-sensei, Iwished this was translated to give your work full justice, but I think I'll justread this again and again to improve my vocabulary and also appreciate yourartwork. Everyone in this story is so beautiful, I now truly regret not buyingyour artbook back then.<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img loading="lazy"    border="0"    data-original-height="1200"    data-original-width="1600"    height="240"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-25qHnUQSInM/XQ99wMiCMQI/AAAAAAAAyEE/44E54KgLKzY07cdzaHTzLvkbH2aN8CitwCEwYBhgL/s320/IMG_20190622_160957.jpg"    width="320"  /></div>I'll keep this short since whatever is above is really long already (sorry forthat tbh), but yeah, because I missed the first two so I won't comment, for thelast volume I chose to get one of the special gifts which - honestly it's my ownfetish - is a special illustration of the characters in glasses. Yeah, thanksMakoto-sensei. I feel satisfied looking at Hinageshi with glasses already. Also,Azuki-chan in glasses? Man, why isn't she my childhood friend haha<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img loading="lazy"    border="0"    data-original-height="1600"    data-original-width="1200"    height="320"    src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wsNDuyRA-Ww/XQ990j4KweI/AAAAAAAAyEI/owuCm92gGacPCX-aMOrBy380haGf9U-3ACLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20190619_192830.jpg"    width="240"  /></div><br /><br /><br />So yeah, that will be it. I don't really intend to go all theway and explain the first two volumes (this is quite a short story btw) (maybemake this into an Anime movie someday?) and I think I did mention this storybefore here (<a  href="../../2018/05/the-entertainment-news-2018-edition_13.html"    >this way please</a>) so I guess I won't talk more about it then. This is just a closure to aninteresting read I'd like to share, and maybe images will appear for the mainpart eventually, then maybe I'll revise this post again. But until then, I wishmore could read this story as much as androids probably is a topic of discussionin the fictional world for many works, but still. If written differentlyeverything will feel unique, at least to me.
