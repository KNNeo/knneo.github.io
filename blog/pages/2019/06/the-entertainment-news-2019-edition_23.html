I told you I'll be back for another one of these.<br /><br />So yeah, I'm back
for one of these, and yes, I've decided to do these at my own pace. Coming up
will be a larger series than this and that one will need some tracing in terms
of which chapter did I leave off from when I last read online a year ago, but
this one is easy. It's Kawai Makoto-sensei's latest work which recently
concluded, and is titled "This love is illegal." just for international
audience, even though we know that is not the REAL title haha let's talk about
it<br /><br /><br />WHAT AND WHY<br />

What, should be obvious from above title. "Amaetai no Hi wa Soba ni Ite." is a
story about living in a world with androids. You know, not those that power the
majority of smartphones (okay joke's over lol), but those beings which are
engineered to behave like humans, living with humans. Among them is android
Hinageshi (female btw) serving solo-living-away-from-home newbie author Kaede
(male btw) and here's a secret: the android likes the human. In many ways than
other, that is illegal (thus the alternative title) and the android will be
wiped off its memories if discovered being involved in any sort of romance with
a human, even infatuation, I guess. So yeah, don't guess what happened. I'll
talk about the final Volume 3 right here, right now! Yeah, prepare for spoilers,
by the way.<br /><br /><br />

To give a good summary of this series, Volume 1 gave us the happy days, Volume 2
gave us a warning, and Volume 3 gave us realisation and confrontation. Firstly,
Hinageshi was living a great life with Kaede, the one guy who possibly has no
feelings whatsoever to the android, is being well taken care of by her, to say
the least. And they say she is bad at everything according to her qualification
tests. That aside, she notices her love for the man is growing, and so did
Kaede's social circle, from his childhood friend and crush Azuki to his manager
and editor Tsukushi to Azuki's friend Momo... all of them had their troubles and
joys with android. Then, came in the declaration from a letter sent to her
house: she has been discovered to have romantic feelings for a human. Hinageshi
at this point can either (1) sign the statement which will probably get her
arrested but more importantly get her abolished on her current job, or (2) bear
the consequences which is the, you know, wipe memory thing. Confronted also by
the one who reported her, Karin - an android herself - decides to convince her
to do so as not doing so will eventually reach a bad ending. You know, the time
where the authorities get to you and everyone is going to cry. Better to start
early, yes? But no, it's more than that. Azuki and Momo both know such is not a
statement for freedom to love, as with many questions, consider the ethicality
in romance between androids and humans. This became a huge impact at the end of
Volume 2 after what seems to be a kid winning an award in the novel author
awards which Kaede attended and the manager shocked to see what she saw: the
android she praised of her skills when she was a kid.<br /><br />Things get real
escalated in the final volume (as with all final volumes) as the resolution of
Hinageshi's fate is shown in two prime examples: What happens after an android
is wiped off its memories, and what happens when you have to get wiped, and in
the process too. Firstly, the manager Tsukushi recalls her past with Tanpopo the
android (probably a reference to
<strike>the character popular with kids</strike> the
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tanpopo" target="_blank">dandelion</a>) as she
praised on her work and thinks she can do it big and popular with her
creativity. The thing is, she will not be recognised due to the current
discrimination of androids as servants instead of free thinkers. And also, due
to inevitably violating the love rule as Tanpopo slowly opens up to Tsukushi,
ends up being dealt with and yes, today her can barely remember what happened.
The thing seems to be, that once an android gets wiped, their memories disappear
of course, but their will and personality still remain, so the urge to still do
something is still there, to say the least. Today, she is led by a human owner
who is "releasing novels" under her own name to prevent the android from being
ostracised, but hey, look what happened to her. Tanpopo can barely remember
anything, although she can still remember the passion that will continue to
drive her to write. Good on you man, sucks to be Tsukushi though. Her childhood
memories washed away as fast as yours. Next up, Karin gets her own taste of
reality. She was arrested by the authorities not because of her current human
owner, but because of what she did in the past. She might be the stereotypical
case where human loves android (and probably vice versa) and the human suggests
for them to elope and so on, even pursued by authorities. Karin did take the
advice, but also wises up to notice that this will do both of them no good
(we'll see this feeling come back later) so Karin decides to leave the human
behind and start anew. Too bad you can't escape the eyes of the law, for the
human probably covered for her for the longest time available while she escapes
to stay under another shelter, now has to admit all she has done before she gets
wiped off her memories. This time, it's not a joke. Momo was saddened without
words, and we know who will be up next.<br /><br />Hinageshi was up next not
because the government knew about her infatuation, no, but Karin submitted her
case to the authorities, so... thanks for not ratting her out during your
interview, you idiot. Anyways, it was an eventuality, so Hinageshi moved away
from her temporary owner Momo to go back to her old place to meet up with Kaede
once again. They confess their feelings for each other, and all is well. That
is, until the van pulls up at their doorstep. Kaede was unable to do anything
despite saying he will do anything to stop her from being arrested, and
Hinageshi felt that implicating the human will do none of them good (reference
above), so she left without a struggle, promising to come back someday. That
day... might not even happen. However, when she confessed and was being readied
to be zapped off her memories... [SPOILER ALERT AHEAD] the machine did not work.
She did not get wiped off her memories. Many were confused as to what happened,
but despite the many attempts, she can still remember why she cried before she
was put under the bed. Many say this might be a miracle due to her strong bonds
and relationships with the people around her, but maybe this is a good
exception. This spurred plenty of argument as to the fate of Hinageshi as Kaede
tries to release a book talking about such a reality, the little knowledge he
possesses. And for the next decade (geez) experiments were done on her (had to
make this joke, but they didn't consider sex an option? lol) (you know, the
never-ending orgasm kind haha) until eventually, 12 years after being arrested
by the authorities, she was released. Yeah. They gave up, literally. I mean,
what are you going to do about it? So yeah, they can't stop her now, as she
recovers and finds back the time she had with Kaede, now already 12 years older
in his late 20s, has been waiting for her patiently to return. Aw,
Makoto-sensei, at least you didn't let me down by wiping her off, good on
you.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful series to read. The dialogues may be
long since it wasn't translated so I had a hard time reading it but also, it's
important to convey the feelings of all the characters since this isn't an
action show, so I'll forgive that. The artwork is fantastic, it's the very
reason why I'm into Makoto-sensei's works after Anime "Koufuku Graffiti". Now
years in after missing her first artbook from a year ago, I show her my support
by reading her latest work which probably won't gain much attention as much as I
would like, but this was a lovely story. Maybe compare this to Senko-san, but
sadder and better plot twist haha. Finally, I like this series, Makoto-sensei, I
wished this was translated to give your work full justice, but I think I'll just
read this again and again to improve my vocabulary and also appreciate your
artwork. Everyone in this story is so beautiful, I now truly regret not buying
your artbook back then.<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />

I'll keep this short since whatever is above is really long already (sorry for
that tbh), but yeah, because I missed the first two so I won't comment, for the
last volume I chose to get one of the special gifts which - honestly it's my own
fetish - is a special illustration of the characters in glasses. Yeah, thanks
Makoto-sensei. I feel satisfied looking at Hinageshi with glasses already. Also,
Azuki-chan in glasses? Man, why isn't she my childhood friend haha<br />

<br /><br /><br />So yeah, that will be it. I don't really intend to go all the
way and explain the first two volumes (this is quite a short story btw) (maybe
make this into an Anime movie someday?) and I think I did mention this story
before here (<a
  href="../../2018/05/the-entertainment-news-2018-edition_13.html"
  
  >this way please</a
>) so I guess I won't talk more about it then. This is just a closure to an
interesting read I'd like to share, and maybe images will appear for the main
part eventually, then maybe I'll revise this post again. But until then, I wish
more could read this story as much as androids probably is a topic of discussion
in the fictional world for many works, but still. If written differently
everything will feel unique, at least to me. Ok bye
