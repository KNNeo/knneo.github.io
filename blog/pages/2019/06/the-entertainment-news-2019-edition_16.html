Hey, guys.<br /><br />Another week, another week of... verifying my spending on
the Internet because I spent like, hundreds on international shipping. Don't
thank me, everyone. Doing my part to maintain those delivery routes that keep
the world connected haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¢">*sob*</span><br /><br />What, I'm going to talk about how
terrible my work week is and how I just helped out my friend on his school
assignment on programming? NO!<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Yep, Bungo Stray
Dogs first again until Senko-san gets an interesting cliffhanger BOOM got'em
haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Again, if Chuuya has anything lacking it's intelligence he'll get outwitted by
ANYTHING lmao. Okay in this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs35) there is fighting.
There is action. Yes, it's happening. And dammit do we have to wait for another
week for the conclusion, spoiler alert. But yeah, there is good reason that it
has come to this. The mastermind thus far, Fyodor, has chosen to corner both
groups to a final resort, which is to fight it out. Whoever wins shall be able
to get rid of the opposing leader and make their one survive the ordeal. Sounds
easy, but hey, there is good reason why both of them stand strong in this city
of Yokohama. Let's talk about plot first. The Detective Agency chose to approach
the Port Mafia's tower first, it seems, leaving Atsushi and Kunikida behind
since the former can investigate what happened to Katai (spoiler alert, he's
dead), and the latter can still try over what happened to the kids from last
episode lol. (Again, Kunikida, it's not your fault) Anyways, some they can play
along, but some have other plans. We do know of a lot of interesting new
information which I've much anticipated or even not in some cases, but hey, this
is an action show after all so everyone's gotta have an Ability. Even Ranpo-san.
Thank goodness I was reminded of Season 2 where his buddy Poe-san brought him
into one of his novels, so yeah, apparently Ranpo-san's Ability is similar too.
I guess both are similar to Lucy's power of alternate worlds. So yeah, suck it
Chuuya you idiot you're going to be in there for a week minimum lmao. Also
revealed is that lemon bomb guy (apparently he's still alive after all this) who
literally thought bombing up the whole building is the best way to signal the
enemy to retreat. Is that how it works? Terrorism, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> And finally,
even without the book Fyodor stole from that idiot of a Port Mafia executive
(lol), we get to know what Mori Ougai's Ability is. (Well Fukuzawa is a
swordsman so I guess that requires no Ability anyways) (A reminder that his
Ability is not attack-based from how he "saved" Kyouka last season) (Also, pure
power btw) It's Elise-chan, of course. If you bother to do some research,
Kafuka-sensei - the author for this series - chose to tweak the Ability name
from what should be "The Dancing Girl" to, you know, make the guy look way
cooler than he should have been, so good for you, sir. So yeah, Mori's Ability
is to manifest a puppet he controls, sort of like Kyouka and Kouyo's Abilities,
I guess. (But you know, Ten-chan is cuter <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>) What will happen next now
that the two leaders have chose to leave their beds poisoned and meet up in a
secluded location only known to them (and possibly Fyodor)? Your guess is as
good as mine. Although I would argue that accidents are going to happen even if
they don't anticipate it. The poison might still trigger on them from time to
time, man. Good on them for making it to the meeting though, probably sneaking
around town just to get to there maybe haha. Man, this season is going to end
great, and I can't wait. You know the series is good if you can hype over two
organisation leaders fighting in any action Anime series. Okay BLEACH may be
underwhelming mostly but still lol "COME!" That's Fukuzawa and also me haha<br />

Ah Nakano good for you we don't have snow here so even if it rains cats and dogs
and our trains don't work I still got to squeeze in the buses- Oh you still
going to work? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#SenkoSan10) we describe the worst
things that is in work: working even when nature calls. Lol I'm not talking
about the toilet (your company will probably let you do that lmao), but yeah,
even if the weather's bad outside. Thank goodness for that phone message,
amirite? *laughs sadly for 20mins* Firstly, the bad weather. You know, the cold.
Which never happens when you live near the equator (1 degree North, to be
specific) but hey, you'll wonder how I catch a cold haha. Anyways, Nakano gets a
day off his work because of the weather (explanations to why above, and trains
don't normally run underground in Japan), and he sort of gets to play with
Senko-san in the snow. So that's fun. Enouji was close to joining them but uh,
she hardly has any Enouji to walk to the convenience store at this weather,
amirite?? *finds someone to high-five* (because Enouji = energy) Haha anyways,
it was a fun day, Nakano decides to enjoy more warmth and touches Senko-san's
tail, totally forgetting it's not a non-living object like those faux tails,
so... that demigod just caught a cold lmao. The other half was that super old
demigod's visit to Nakano's place. You know, that one who served him food at the
beach not knowing they walked into her premises technically, so yeah, Shiro-san
got punished for many more things than I mentioned in that episode, to say the
least. She is Sora, clearly more senior than those two probably with their ages
combined, and is also clearly shown by the number of fox tails she has on her
back. You know what's better than one fox tail, guys? FOUR! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So yeah,
she thought the same as Shiro as Nakano seems to not get enough relief from his
work (man, I wish I was in Anime) and... literally offers her body to the guy. I
mean, if you're a petit old woman real life me will absolutely say no, but hey,
if Nakano only wants tail then the rest don't matter. Especially if it's
Senko-san's tail. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Sora laughs it off, but warns him about an
impending disaster should he anger Senko-san. I wonder what it is. But if a
calamity is about to happen whether Senko-san anticipated it or not, it might be
a good way to end the series here, whether it's original to the manga or not
haha. We shall see then, we shall see...<br />

</blockquote>
Haha oh god this girl is beyond saving already at this point SHE STAGED HER OWN
DATE!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#AoChan11) I think "just sex me already"
will perfectly replace the title because... those panties aren't going anywhere.
<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Oh man, it's all so confusing to the reader here, I'm sorry, so here's
the breakdown. Nothing happened. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Okay, the story. As mentioned above,
Ao-chan staged her own study date with Kijima, and... I guessed she enjoyed it
haha. I mean, asking for sex sounds like a man's dream, and I swear Kijima is
totally aware that there's a banger in front of her in the empty house, but you
know, Kijima is not like this. If you need clarification, and I share the same
thought, there are men out there who draw a very clear line between sex and
everything else a couple does. Coune me in too, by the way. If (that's a big IF
btw) there's someone I like and is dating, sex will be THE LAST THING I'll do to
her. Mainly because if that's what you are aiming for you're no different than a
beast. I mean, we are kind of, but we shouldn't insinuate ourselves into it
today, to say the least. I already promised myself to remove all the porn I
possess IF I ever get laid already haha. *shakes head* Anyways, coming back
here, Ao-chan tries to hint Kijima into sex-ing her, but Kijima gives a
challenge in reply: whoever improved their upcoming test score more (More? For
Ao-chan? lol) will listen to one request from the other person. I know Ao-chan
already lost since she is incapable of even wearing silky panties since it
doesn't warm her stomach (TIL btw), so yeah, it's Kijima's win then. Again, not
the way to conquer a man since many do but don't go to sex, but hey, Ao-chan you
do you. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We are also close to the end of the series already as hinted by
next episode's title, so... what do you think will happen? Sex sold separately,
by the way. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />

Well, that was such a wholesome episode, they gotta put in a conflict to balance
it lol. In this new episode (#Joshikausei11) it's about the
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kotatsu" target="_blank">kotatsu</a>. In case
you don't know what that is and you're like me who lives in a place where the
average temperature is warmer than a kotatsu lol, it's basically a coffee table
with a blanket and heater underneath. Pretty simple idea for keeping warm, and I
swear it's way harder to do that with a real fire source in the past than it is
with an electric heater now, but hey, it's an invention nonetheless. The girls
hang out at Momoko's place after a long day at school (I suppose), and they play
with <a href="https://jisho.org/search/mikan" target="_blank">mikan</a> and draw
each other badly lol. Hey, if this is how a good time is with friends I need to
sit down and talk to mine lmao. Well, the girls can't really talk in this girls'
talk so this will have to do haha. And they gotta play a prank on Momoko before
they leave, isn't it? Ah, this series is stupidly awesome. The cuddling is also
quite wholesome too assuming everyone doesn't smell like fish lmao don't hit
me<br />

  I mean, what can I say? My son is too smart, bro! Didn't expect to betray the
  heck out of me lol. In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan57) is... honestly
  quite a lot to absorb here, so let's talk about it as we go. Story goes that
  in another world where Eren's father Grisha was in, he was within walls (lol
  what a coincidence, dad) and treated like trash. Problem is, the world
  surrounding him is a truth. There is also a world out there that is
  suppressing his freedom so leaving the premises seems like a sin even just to
  see an airship without an exit pass. Blah blah blah years later Grisha came to
  know the truth working as a doctor, and that was linked to his past where his
  sister died due to his little outing with her. Well, it wasn't a natural death
  to say the least. He learned of the resistance within the walls and eventually
  became an influence to the group, leading the Eldians as they were meant to
  be, supposed superior race who held Titan powers and ruled the world. (TIL
  there are technically 9 Titans around, so that's a relief) (I thought it'd be
  like BLEACH that I can make as many of them as I like) (Well not just injected
  with Titan spine fluid kind of course) Solid history there though, I sure hope
  the author thought it through, but yeah some saw it as evil and took them out.
  I mean, what's wrong with making a deal with the devil? *looks at
  Kutoshitsuji* Anyways haha, eventually the humans won, took hostage of the
  Eldians and trapped them within those walls should they try to revolt again.
  Interesting story comes in here, tied to the world we know of as of now.
  Firstly, there is the royal family. Supposedly the people who possessed the
  one Titan power that got split into 9, these people with the blood of the one
  ancestor who signed contract with the devil, were the first to rule the
  continent. (Well, they can't write for all continents so...) So yeah,
  eventually the King left the big island and went to a small island, ignoring
  all war that happened in order to I assume preserve royal blood and the
  Founding Titan power. Today, we know of that power as seen in the previous
  part of this season ie. the One which can command, with the blood last seen by
  Lord Reiss licking it on the ground and turning into one lol. Anyways, it's
  probably not him who pussied out, but yeah making death threats was the reason
  why Wall Maria was never taken down until you know, the very first episode of
  this series. Secondly, how there are at least two parties looking into
  obtaining the founding Titan's power. Spoiler alert for those intruders, it's
  pretty much gone lol, so yeah, Zeke and the Titan party AND Grisha and the
  Owl, you guys are going to be finding a whole lot of nothing. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> So
  yeah, that's pretty much the story, as linked to Eren by his father on a very,
  very long dream. If you need an opinion about the backstory for me, I would
  say it's well thought out as much as it is a lot to absorb (I mean, it's an
  Anime and they have to put it all together to make it sound correct too) but
  all in all, this episode explains pretty much every reason to what world Eren
  and the others are living for thus far. Zeke who was Grisha's first son became
  a traitor, working for the other humans for personal gains. Grisha's later son
  who he probably got after sneaking into the walls and meeting a woman and
  starting a family, Eren, sought to find out the truth and why they were within
  these walls. Hey, guess what, Eren? Your walls were made to protect you guys.
  And that, might be the biggest relief to all story thus far. I'm satisfied, I
  guess. Next episode would bring us the final fate of Eren, on whether he will
  be spared or not by what, not obeying orders? What? You guys know at this
  point with all royalty gone and the main island coming after you guys that he
  is YOUR ONLY SAVIOUR, right?? I mean, we have seen probably 4 of the 9 Titans
  thus far, and there is negotiation for this, but man are you all treating Eren
  badly. Why? Why people want to seek the truth but also like to bully people?
  Oh well, not like I want to live that life anyway. What will happen to Eren
  though? If everyone within the walls want the truth, they better not think of
  killing this boy who changed all of this impending fate. Heck, it's still an
  island, goddammit. And we can barely see the horizon. Going to the sea is
  going to be easy, Eren. You just gotta live through this arc lol<br />

This week was... quite a week in Klassic Note. I completely changed my opinion
and gave <b>amatsuuni's major debut single</b> the thumbs up to be on my shelf
(must be the release cover lol) along with (wait for it)
<b>Asakura Momo's latest single</b> which I thought wasn't great until I gave a
listen to it, three weeks after its release. We'll talk about both of them as
soon as they come earliest next week, but until then... yeah there isn't much to
give now haha. New songs, I mean. Looking back, <b>DENIM's new album</b> is
actually not too bad, as I quickly (maybe) got hooked (during work) on some of
the tunes which did get stuck in my mind over the week (in work) (lol) so yeah,
I'm giving more than quite a few. They sound like Yogee New Waves but with rap,
to be frank. I also managed to give a listen to
<b>Middle Kids' new EP</b> and... let's just say I'm trying to ignore any
religious lyrics that might infer whatever because I'm technically a
free-thinker haha. I decided to give also
<b>Tomatsu Haruka's new... digital single</b> but I gave it a miss since I don't
think it's good. Oh well. It just feels repetitive imo, the style and all. And
of course <b>Yuuki Aoi's new album</b>... I'm hesitating to give songs here.
Mainly because it doesn't sound like her and the good songs are real hype and
I'm not, so I'll to be in the mood to give more, I guess. Oh, I also gave
<b>KANA-BOON's new single</b> a listen and... nah. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Next
week... I may need to dig in to some artists which I may have missed in a while,
I suppose. That or I'll just review the ones I've given and not given so far for
a start. I can't really name names here since I don't recall what I told myself
(Note to self: Next time write here first as a note), so we shall see. I'll
probably update on Twitter if I find anything good.<br /><br />On Twitter and
all around the web, <b>KANA-BOON's bassist just went MIA</b> for some reason
(don't ask me why he may be delinquent/a victim for all we know) so they had to
cancel their recent live performance,
<b>Amamiya Sora's new music video preview</b> is looking real cool (the song
though?), <b>Porno Graffitti's new single</b> come sout in end July,
<b>nano.RIPE's new single releases end August</b>, and
<b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES has a best compilation</b> also due end August. Yeah.
That's quite fast, to be honest. Oh well, time to give more songs then
especially those early indie ones. Oh also,
<b>Aimer's new single comes out in August</b>. Yeah, she has been releasing a
lot of new songs, I'm just not giving them lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That'll
be it then. I wanted the last part to be quick but hey, so many to even just
mention, let alone comment. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... I
may be busy updating this blog with my previously mentioned expenditures and I
can't WAIT to share it here with... nobody. I feel satisfied and sad now haha
bye<br /><br />P.S. I did get a change of PC speakers though that new soundbar
is SWEET haha thanks Creative why is the subwoofer crooked though<br />
