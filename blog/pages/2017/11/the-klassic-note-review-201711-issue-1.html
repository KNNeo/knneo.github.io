Sorry it took so long. Assignments are in the way. Now that they are not (besides deadlines which are further away from now lol), let's do a review. A quick one though. I don't want to get TOO immersed. Or maybe I should. Maybe that's what's wrong with me? Okay let's get to it.<br><br>Welcome back, yanaginagi. It's been two years since I gave you a new song, and three since a review.<br><br><br>THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br>yanaginagi - over and over [Single]<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy class=mfp-img src=http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/24/GNCA-520.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-height:974px width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy class=mfp-img src=http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/25/GNCA-521.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-height:974px width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table>(In case you didn't notice, it's her <em>behind </em>a cutout of her. Yeah. Clever. Didn't even notice that until I got the physical copy. And don't ask what's the bright thing at the back.)<br><br>Origin: I think we are quite familiar with yanaginagi, but maybe not that much now that I mentioned her name again. She made quite a splash in Klassic Note back in 2014 with two of her singles from Anime "Nagi no Asukara" and its two ending themes. The 2nd one being my birthday single that year, my first review for her, and with all that going on to convince me to get the other one with the first ending theme from the Anime too... Since then, I've been listening to her singles and her album all the way till the end of that year. It was great. And then it went down. Well, at least for me. Since she is like many other Anime song singers who tend to not have control of their own tunes, this easily explains how much I've been rejecting her singles and only giving her songs once in a while. Until now. Thanks to original Anime "Just Because!" I got to know this singer-songwriter (you bet she is) once again, and as expected, I still like her. The songs, I mean. Her style is impeccable, and we will discuss about this in this review, so don't you worry.<br><br>(*Note: This review is NOT going to cover her other single which was released on the same date. The bright background is a hint of the double release.)<br><br>(1) over and over<br><blockquote class=tr_bq style=text-align:center><em>"(I) bid goodbye to you in my memory"</em></blockquote>Not written by her (I'm putting this down first) and by infamous Anime producer Kitagawa (who writes mainly for Anime artists like Hanazawa Kana, for example), her written lyrics perfectly describe the show, about confession and progression in love as you listen through the song. The melody is also overall okay, has impact at first listen to be honest, and does not suffer from the usual problems in song format, so I'm relatively happy when I heard this in full. And yanaginagi too, she writes nice lyrics, even under expectations of the Anime. Well, this is largely because she was involved in music production of the show too (she is one of the two Anime music producers, she writes the soundtrack AND the ending theme which was sung by the Anime characters), and that makes this feel so at home. Honestly, never thought I'd like one of her songs again, and this one Anime theme song proved me wrong.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br><br>(2) Rain<br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><em>"Rain</em></div><div style=text-align:center><em>(When) In a lonely night</em></div><div style=text-align:center><em>Raindrops are resounding</em></div><div style=text-align:center><em>Rain</em></div><div style=text-align:center><em>Where did you go?"</em></div></blockquote>As usual, she fascinates me with the B-side of her singles, and I've always admired that. At first impression, this is a song I can totally get into because of its simple introduction, and a catchy melody reminiscent of the emotional yet nostalgic feel that I like. Coupled with her own way of writing the song and lyrics herself, it was as if she was calling out to the rain, maybe with sadness, or with desperation. I don't know. It's up to you to feel it. And this song, I felt it good. So I took it into consideration almost immediately, since it'll likely come out as one of those more memorable melodies I'll come to like. The beats may be a little off to signify the feel of rain which I guess I can forgive, but otherwise this song is just great. No complaints.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br><br>Conclusion: Overall a decent single. I don't know about the other single which was released in tandem, but I like this one more. I don't care. This one is good. And you should give chance too if you have not listened and/or are deterred by the Anime itself. It's yet another one of those wonderful singles from yanaginagi that you don't want to miss. I may have missed a lot which I would say otherwise, but this I can't ignore. Give it a chance, yes?<br><br>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br><br>(If you heard the B-side and immediately thought of whatever yanaginagi thinks of Korean pop star Rain, you're not alone haha. Oh, it's just me? Okay lol I'm soooo out of phase already)<br><br><br><br>THE PACKAGE<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1200 data-original-width=1600 height=240 src=https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--x4lp0hBS8M/Wgfs7fbRCmI/AAAAAAAAjOQ/9ULC8DTWFWE_xHfvBEJIlNVLLx5s9CpoQCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20171112_140059.jpg width=320></div>This is it. Again, due to the double release (they call it "W release" over there) (Get it? "double U") of yanaginagi's new singles special gifts are only handed out if you purchased BOTH singles, and what's worse, both in Limited Edition. So my chances of any of those clear files are already zero. Still, I'm not <em>really</em> expecting a big poster (unlike that birthday single I reviewed back in 2014) or that Anime poster (unlike that single released back in 2013), but sure, whatever. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><br>Also, the reason why it took this long from release to review is because (1) I ordered it on a Friday, two days after release date, (2) shipping was delayed until the following Monday and surprisingly, (3) it took more than the usual timing to reach my house, nearly one week after my purchase. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> I can't even complain because I was busy with school and being at a friend's house for some reason. Sorry, it could've been two days ago.<br><br><br><br>This is it, I guess. Nothing much to talk about here already. Cya guys for Entertainment News tonight. Until then... don't ask about my life. You can ask about Anime and music and stuff like APoL. Nothing else. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
