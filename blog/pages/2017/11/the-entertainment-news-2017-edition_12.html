...<br /><br />I can't believe I'm living at an age where I'm watching a voice actress do a cooking show uncut (besides the waiting) online. Yeah. Talking about you, <a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/1510479642" target="_blank">Takahashi Rie</a>. Yeah, she can't cook by the way. And it's a total joy to see her sprinkle salt lol. Anyways, what a way to end the week, to say the least. Thanks, Rie-chan. And I want to see more voice actress "do embarrassing things like this". (Don't quote me on this lol) Please find novices we don't need experts to teach us cooking hehe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDUaOYerHkw" target="_blank">I recommend Minase Inori</a> lol<br /><br />Now, to the real entertainment of the week haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote>*"Just Because!" has been moved to the back. Don't ask why. "Just Because".<br /><br /><b>Blend S: </b>Well just because half of the cast is indoor-type doesn't mean we should only have half the episode outdoors. Right?? RIGHT???<br />The new episode (6) has plenty to talk about, so I'll shorten things up. First half - the barbecue. Well, first things first, they don't want to do anything else because half the group are just lazy lol, but yeah eating is good enough, I guess. But of course, that spawns an idea to go to the beach instead which is...? I don't know, more appealing than being by the river? Hey, I didn't do that scissors-paper-stone thing. Problem is, Maika only has school swimsuit (just in case you don't know how it looks like feel free to search online) so she and Dino the manager end up shopping for one. Haha, the others would expect something worse but it turned out pretty alright. Plenty of hijinks happened compared to the previous trip out mainly because this is not that other Anime last season (<span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span> Gamers) and they just want to show off how embarrassed Akizuki is at someone else's chest, Miu's enthusiasm at finding inspiration (which probably explains her reason for appearing in such outings despite her busy schedule), and Dino and Maika... let's just say they're enjoying themselves, sadistically and affectionately in return, probably. And Mafuyu is here to remind us to not judge people by their looks because of those adult jokes and because she can gulp beer like no one cares haha. Hey, what more can we ask for? This is as good of an episode as it gets.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mg-lFc8jKVc/Wge11KJUu1I/AAAAAAAAjLM/MAj71VyQopsPR0Fhi-F9KWHSNQcKnkmoACLcBGAs/s320/%255BHorribleSubs%255D%2BBlend%2BS%2B-%2B06%2B%255B720p%255D.mkv_snapshot_03.26_%255B2017.11.12_10.16.38%255D.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Let me join these guys please haha someone give me the outdoor part lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I like how this episode the animators just photoshopped in real images for comparison on the jokes lol for example the tuna and the octopus HAHAHA<br />P.P.S. Mafuyu 2nd half MVP!! Haha, what? I can't have sleeping fetish on girls? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Also, Miu-chan must be real appealing for people who know doujinshi. I can't say I'm one of them, but... yeah. Tentacle fetish is a thing. And I agree with Miu-chan's inspiration to some extent hehe<br /><b><br /></b><b>Houseki no Kuni: </b>No seriously, why is Phos living the EXACT SAME LIFE as she does before and after she was deemed combat worthy? Man, don't ask me ask that "human" haha<br />Okay, the new episode (6) kind of just leaves as at as bad as a predicament as Phos right now, and honestly, I don't know how to react too. "Just kill me, man" may be a good answer to that, I don't know. Okay, story first. Phos has proven her legs to be worth for combat, so for obvious sake the sensei chose to pair her with the least likely group to encounter the moon people to do scouting, Amethyst in this case. Well, not until the least likely group to encounter the bad guys becomes the most likely, as the opponent sent out one of its "rare troops" to tackle the twin gems, leaving Phos in quite some danger and everyone else in despair. Hey, it's not only liking the only human left in this planet that will make you love fighting, you know. Despite Phos being left in great shock mainly due to complacency (I mean, it feels like the same life she has before) and lack of training, she probably still has to answer for herself as to why she hasn't reported to anyone else of the appearance of the bad guys. I mean, learn how to be combat support, Phos. It's well due on your responsibility to be in combat and explain your actions. With Bort pointing the sword at you, it's no wonder the sensei did not stop anyone at this point. What happens to Phos' remaining memories? Your guess is as good as mine.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vIb9dEGYfX0/Wge-CUDw_5I/AAAAAAAAjLc/Fntr5CcMiswcxjCUYKD96KJjTvFCZ0LwgCLcBGAs/s1600/housekinokuni06_laugh.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vIb9dEGYfX0/Wge-CUDw_5I/AAAAAAAAjLc/Fntr5CcMiswcxjCUYKD96KJjTvFCZ0LwgCLcBGAs/s320/housekinokuni06_laugh.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When your friends thought you were joking lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I'm not surprised NO ONE has figured out why the sensei is pissed at Phos mentioning about humans (I mean, they're staring at one) but yeah, kind of gives an insight as to the validity of the story from the seas people, which Phos probably forgot. Maybe. I don't know. She can be lying for all we know. Or "not yet awakened", if that's a thing in drama.<br />P.P.S. So wait, the gem thing in the moon people is...? I can only figure out from the website that it's probably Sapphire as mentioned by Yellow Diamond but maybe... CUE THAT TABLE!! <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />(Yep I flipped it around since many fall under the same hardness) (Looks just like online sources now lol)<br /><table border="1" style="border: 1px solid var(--foreground); margin: 0px auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><th><div style="text-align: center;">Hardness</div></th><th><div style="text-align: center;">Name of Minerals</div></th></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;">10</div></td><td><div style="text-align: center;">Diamond<br />Bort<br />Yellow Diamond</div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;">7.5</div></td><td><div style="text-align: center;">Morganite<br />Goshenite<br />Euclase<br />Red Beryl<br />Zircon</div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;">7</div></td><td><div style="text-align: center;">Jade</div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;">6.5</div></td><td><div style="text-align: center;">Benitoite</div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;">6</div></td><td><div style="text-align: center;">Rutile</div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;">5</div></td><td><div style="text-align: center;">Obsidian</div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;">3.5</div></td><td><div style="text-align: center;">Phosphophyllite</div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align: center;">2</div></td><td><div style="text-align: center;">Cinnabar</div></td></tr></tbody></table>(Obsidian does not count considering she only made a noise lol) (Never mind, I'll put her in haha) (Obsidian should be MVP this episode tbh I can hear you Hirohashi Ryou hehe)<br /><br /><b>Sangatsu no Lion:</b> "Tell me about Hina-chan." Hmm she's kawaii?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> That's all I got haha sorry (I mean, the sensei is going on about it too HAHAHA)<br />The new episode (27) (before I start tearing up until I can't type) (NO IT'S STARTING ALREADY~!!) focuses on the bullying incident, but this time, from the perspectives of Kiriyama (continued) and Akari-san, respectively. Firstly, Kiriyama. Ever since last episode he notices Hina was (one of) his saviour, and so decided to prepare for eventualities leading up to the incident (Recall: she was now looked down upon by the class as she beat up someone for - pardon me - talking shit about the other classmate no one else cared) AND ask for further advice from the person he can trust most, the teacher. And for first things first, the teacher is right. No one does not protect the person involved they can relate most, so parents will never say stuff about their own kid. And then, it depends on the victim. If the victim doesn't want to scale things up, then don't. But if they do, then by all means do it. But why would you? (Unless your family has some form of power to talk) So yeah, at this point, it depends on Hina-chan. And the teacher is somehow also worried about Kiriyama shortening his life for making sure Hina is fine over this incident. But I say no, just like Akari-chan who obviously saw Kiriyama slimming down once again out of worry, indirectly because Kiriyama can't afford to lose any more matches for financial reasons. See? It all links up. Cue Akari's perspective of her being told by the grandfather and her responsibility of failing to be the replacement mother ever since their real mother passed away, and you got yourselves a resolution from Kiriyama. And he's right too. You see, social interaction should be about forcing it on others even though knowing about people's reactions. Simplest stuff I can think of are lame jokes and advice that doesn't go through your brain. But then again, that's the whole point. It's providing perspectives. Anything else that requires a decision to make, it's up to you. And that's what Hina-chan should aim for. To think of a resolution that will be of her character and yet still be able to live with. But yeah, it's hard living to be despised of, but hey, that's part of school life. Recent news of shrinking the school class size for public schools made others and me think of what's the purpose of making classes small even though they may be effective in education. My answer is "social circles".&nbsp; Through non-biased large circles of class, we ourselves can learn of our place in such environments and learn to deal with whatever consequences that might happen, even though we all know people will just remember that by you - whether as a joke or not - in the future. I've said my piece. It's up to you to decide whether I'm correct. On the other hand, this show is good. I'll give them that.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nd_bwECm9Gs/WgfLT6sp53I/AAAAAAAAjLs/nN_NwwRdZQg2__uuW0R8oszPreCe6-YSwCLcBGAs/s320/sangatsunolion27_akari.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Since this episode is sad once again, I present you happy Akari-chan!<br />Not my mom's when she manages to grab deals in the supermarket lol<br />(Kayanon~!! hehe)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. "Shit, I lost" And Nikaidou is like "Have you finally got the motivation-" SHUT THE FUCK UP NIKAIDOU NO ONE ASKED FOR YOUR OPINION lol (And yeah I like the minds of the two people in analysis haha man this show)<br /><b><br /></b><b>Just Because!:</b> Man Souma, and now you made her lose her appetite ARE YOU STILL A MAN??!! Ugh haha<br />The new episode (6) is going to throw many of us away, if we think that's all we're going to get from previous episodes. And yes, in many ways, I did not expect most of them. Firstly, Souma to Morikawa. She gave some thought. If so, don't say no!! Man, people sometimes. But yeah, not without reason anyway. It's not to keep hopes up too much so to make some clear thinking of some sort, so yeah, Souma was given a second chance. It doesn't come often Souma, you lucky guy. Must be the twin brothers saying good stuff about you behind the scenes haha. Anyways, we have Souma and Natsume. Although this might only be of concern to Morikawa and lesser to an extent the don't-give-a-damn Eita, I suppose this won't really come in, despite the friends feeling bad for her about it. But yeah, as I said later (lol now you know I write P.S. first) Natsume's feelings for Souma are wavering, so that is fine. Besides, Souma only sees Morikawa in front of him now, so yeah her chances are at most negligible. And then, there's Natsume seeing Eita and Komiya. I don't know about Komiya being friendly with a guy is a thing or not with her or if to any extent that will sprout into love, but yeah, Natsume is clearly concerned. I mean, look at the ending. What the heck, man? Eita being good guy is fine, but is that humping?? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> I'm just joking. But yeah, this might be quite a problem. But hey, I paid for the time to see the drama, figured out I would just see it to the end. Yeah, I expect a great resolution amongst all of this drama. I swear. By the way, did you applaud to the wonderful trumpeting by Morikawa? I know it's done by some music producer, but still. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iR9FeDHvONs/Wgfh5UL9WvI/AAAAAAAAjME/4Bs8YXuIOm8PM11hFPstH2LClo8ZfalsgCLcBGAs/s320/justbecause06_friend.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When your friend noticed you in a lovey-dovey situation with someone else lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. "If you can't push him down, then why not back off" I'm like, Eita won't care if you back off haha idiot Komiya<br />P.P.S. Here's some life advice to all of you out there. If people ask you if you still like that someone and you say "I don't know now" it's time to let go and forget. Just like me. With all three of them. And maybe more if I bother to recall haha (Don't pester for more like those asshole friends of Natsume, yes?)<br />(Omake: Did you know this original Anime is, as always with other works, running its own manga now? I won't say it's fantastic, but I hope it's <strike>as good</strike> the same as this show haha)<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Dagashi Kashi: </b>The new chapter (88) kind of made Hotaru-chan jump the gun, but yeah, it's about Big Katsu, which apparently had nothing to do with pork, which is the meaning of the original word 'tonkatsu'.

Hotaru-chan, probably. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="384" data-original-width="653" height="188" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X0GoZSRj7ew/Wgg9cDPlVYI/AAAAAAAAjPA/Jc0hyPWwJUwuR5kBImWKE2cL6hWPT8QeQCLcBGAs/s320/dgsks88_img000002.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When you said something erotic and your girlfriend hears it lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br />And yeah seeing how this story is getting another season of Anime I should stop reading. Or not. Then again, I haven't caught up to the many other manga that I can continue reading. But man, it's a long trip. For all of them. I'll see if I have the time.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week I was really not much in a mood to give songs, so I'll just talk about them and move on. <b>Komatsu Mikako's new single</b> was a disappointment aligning with the same reasons I give for the failure of Q-MHz of writing good songs I want to hear despite the great singing voice that backs them up. But yeah, I'll give the B-sides another try before I... Never mind, forget it haha. <b>sphere's new single</b> before they go hiatus until 2019 (yeah, in case you don't know) sounds fine, but not review level standard. Not even the anniversary B-side song. But yeah, I'll probably give another chance. I've also settled on <b>Yonezu Kenshi's new album</b> on just one song, I guess, but this one, unlike the two above, is long decided as I've reviewed it from last week. Also coincidentally quick at record level entry, <b>Tokyo Karan Koron's new album</b>, despite the lack of presence in Apple Music, is still okay for topic songs, so I gave one off the bat. The album... I wish it'll appear in full someday, but for now...<br /><br />Next week brings us a couple more releases that deserves attention, namely <b>Brian The Sun</b> from Anime "Sangatsu no Lion" ending theme and after such a long time, <b>nano.RIPE's new single</b>. If you forgot the band went under in band members since their previous album last year, and the now duo have came back with a new release. I hope it's good. I haven't heard anything yet though, to not break the surprise.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">"Review<br />In a lonely afternoon<br />Reviews are writing<br />Review<br />Where did you go?"<br />It's here, guys. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br /><br />(Only one) yanaginagi new single right this way please: <a href="https://t.co/tkAD5qYF8D" target="_blank">https://t.co/tkAD5qYF8D</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/929601860859654144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">November 12, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> In other new news, you guys read the new Klassic Note Review yet? Yeah, please do go take a look. <b>Kotobuki Minako</b> (yay Mina-chan!) will release her 3rd album early next year, so finally it's time for me to give her as many songs as I can considering I rejected the heck out of her previous two singles haha. <b>ClariS new single</b> has been decided and also releasing within early next year. Apparently instead of releasing new songs <b>Ikimonogakari</b> decided to release them on vinyl? Yeah, that's due next year March, but considering it's not news to talk about to my sis, I would also advise you to not get too excited as chances it may be a compilation. (But it did say "original album" so I don't know) <b>Goose house did announce a new single</b> which will be due two weeks from now which I WILL have the time to listen to new songs by then, and I swear there's that <b>new Primary mini-album</b> I haven't heard yet. I'll be doing this later. I'll talk about it next week, then.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cya guys then. And until next time... I want to be relieved of my work. It's not going to happen especially when I have to work for money instead for my grades, so that's going to be tough. No wonder my sis goes overseas like, twice a year. The best escapade for a city person may just be that. Take care of yourselves, yes? My throat is still suffering from that cold ever since last week even though my nose is a lot better already...
