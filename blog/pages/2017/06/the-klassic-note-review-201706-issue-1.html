Likely the reason to succeed in the idol music group that is sphere (which will pause all group activities this year), TrySail is also here to bring you great Anime tunes and with that, more interest to these three voice actresses, namely Natsukawa Shiina (<a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTVCGU3wI9Cn6MTw-yvA2Eqhxc3q8GSUWeyoapKTlxaQPrE8qL8OkXjmr2vCJefY-Ip9jvvx_HOr-xAMDj5Zkqv05-Ymw-1bqgrR7hWy8iuTagbP6Nzn6c4VmRHa8bb3Mcjzqg_6YLUD5O/s1600/SELFSCAN_20170602_0002_nanchan.jpg target=_blank>in yellow</a>;Â <a href=../../2017/04/the-klassic-note-review-201704-issue-1.html>I have reviewed her solo debut single in April</a>), Asakura Momo (<a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBmHau4o1pS4U0cqvOpIa7EX48mAb9RQa9CpIwzzZaiyv88uGzmn4xEFCpMRdEjNEeEhEH_cQdkzlpVSxiQV9rY4zgm_DgL4YSvd-FXN1txxwkHgnCoD43T6Fbcf2-IVCd7KjzWIDm2NEG/s1600/SELFSCAN_20170602_0002_mocho.jpg target=_blank>in pink</a>; Her new single is out soon) and Amamiya Sora (<a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPBdbM6u-BoG6EYbaJbi7O3_WurJX3FUuFF4RQ4-PYCkhWZ9EFBtqoiZCxpJzv9oWyTjlmE9vwHW-W12v-OuyXi6yvUqTgZfi3LLXpAazHSwi3SdlJajrbH0rcBjsZnWoU7Vab38JyVKcZ/s1600/SELFSCAN_20170602_0002_tenchan.jpg target=_blank>in blue</a>; <a href=../../2014/08/the-klassic-note-review-201408-issue-1.html>I've also reviewed her debut single</a>). I may have stepped halfway in into the music careers of these three girls, but TrySail as a whole is pretty good this time round, enough to hold as competition to the other voice actor groups out there. I mean, I've mentioned about reviewing <a href=../../2015/05/the-klassic-note-review-201505-issue-1.html>their</a> <a href=../../2015/08/the-klassic-note-review-201508-issue-1.html>first</a> <a href=../../2016/05/the-klassic-note-review-201605-issue-2.html>four</a> <a href=../../2016/06/the-klassic-note-review-201606-issue-1.html>singles</a> too many times to show how far they have come in the past two years. The announcement of Anime "Eromanga-sensei" thus serves as an opportunity for them to show their best. And with this <strike>7th</strike>Â 6th (the collaboration with HoneyWorks doesn't count, it seems) single fully in Anime tie-up category and them sounding this good, there is literally no reason why you would miss this.<br><br>(1) adrenaline!!!<br>I guess this song needs no introduction. At first impression, this Anime ending theme song is impressive. It's catchy, it's lively, and it has captured the 90 seconds perfectly, I couldn't even complain. Of course, when I got my hands on this song in full I did notice it isn't as colourful as I thought it would be. Still, this song is great. I couldn't say too much myself. Everything is added intentionally from the cheers to the highs in the song; everything in production is so well done. This is of course, the product of a single song composer and producer. Great song, and I don't see why anyone wouldn't like this. To top it off, the music video is even more reminiscent of the theme of TrySail which is sailing, and the hype in it is so high I'd rather not talk too much about fanservice. This is that typical awesome Anime theme song we've always wanted. Really, Ten-chan sounds soooo cuuuute in this song hehe<br>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br><br>(2) Kakawari [Involvement]<br>Okay, not like I know of Madoka Magica and all, but this song is as impressive, if not better, than the ones that I started hearing of when this series started back in 2011. Yes, this might be initially a ClariS song. Familiar images surface when you start to hear the song in full, as many of the vibes and seriousness of this song brings you understanding from the Madoka Magica world and theme song style once again. No really, even the guy who produced the song is literally <em>the one</em> who has been writing all the theme songs for the series, which is in this case for a mobile game. Credits aside, this song also has its faults in the bridge part of the song, and catching up to the main melody of the chorus maybe a handful if your didn't get it the first time (which is what happened with me), but still. This song delivers great power and feelings towards the world of magic and despair to a certain extent, and is certainly a hear when you know you've been heard it for that much. The song, I mean.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br><br>Conclusion: Definitely one of the better singles I've heard in a while, mainly because it's so impressionable, and its nature of having Anime tie-ups means the songs will be good somehow (at least the choruses) and that's good enough. I can take two credited songs in one release. And you should take a listen too, considering that it's so good it's topping digital sales charts in Japan already. And with them moving towards an international audience soon with a change of music label company (SACRA MUSIC; as with ClariS and Kalafina too, amongst many others), we might just see them excel in the near future.<br><br>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br><br>THE PACKAGE<br>Finally, I can continue my rants haha. It's hard being serious this far. I know; I kind of let it out already.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en> Finally it's here. If you haven't heard TrySail's new single you're missing out.<br><br>Soon. <a href=https://t.co/BolGNz0ENB target=_blank>pic.twitter.com/BolGNz0ENB</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/870615077208047617 target=_blank>June 2, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset=utf-8 src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><br>As I said, you're really missing out. (Yes I just posted it before I continued this post haha) But yes, the single. It's "your usual stuff" considering this is the third year I've been seeing these things first hand (haha why does it sound like I'm seeing endangered animals lol) but I guess I'll talk about it anyway. As with their first four singles (because I didn't give two, and one is technically not theirs) this single also features a large booklet featuring a long image of the three of them, as shown below.<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=571 data-original-width=1600 height=141 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMm03Lbsesv6_9_dsnCHvk47-SWz_qCq922-Gdzh8_qtvId3FibahBzHxNLDhDWCdIlnNNW4MhVbor5T22bv7Ei3YLMPWvPVQ9Oij65808hqDNxfzT124l6UgPTqkfji39YeVpnefY-jy0/s400/IMG_20170602_193120.jpg width=400></div>Honestly, maybe it's me, but all I can think of when I look at the virtualisation the hand action is literally them <strike>giving handjobs</strike> lol okay maybe I shouldn't say that I don't want here to become rated haha. But yeah, something like that, I guess. I'm just speechless at that thought. Thank goodness I didn't choose the <a href=https://trysail.jp/contents/98484 target=_blank>special photo gift</a> with the same hand... whatever (lol), but yeah, Animate Online Shop turns out on top again. I mean, it was a hard decision especially when the online shop typically has any left for me to grab on their First Press stuff, and considering this is still with Anime tie-ups, I shouldn't have a chance. But I did think of how things would work out if I chose otherwise, but I couldn't resist. Now I live the regret of not choosing the one with the vertical images of each of them or even a group shot (oops) because I can only fit this gift I have now on my lock screen. (And that is with some shifting of the parts closer in to the center)<br><div style=text-align:center></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1600 data-original-width=900 height=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFTlKWd-e9lYx-TMK0FKG2IdSWdv9nBQKoZioCpY6BOeQA9U7AfNXg6Hr05I1XFI8iO3GYBfXBbUO7thE1FtiBVR77G1egGA8KmbrwWKq57y5JZ1BNx5UGuAr3GP-6Xs-H9tkzZhn7kJIx/s320/Screenshot_20170602-202828.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=180><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>It's been some time, huh. Showing off my lockscreen.<br>Homescreen is Aki-chan btw</table>I try not to block Nan-chan and Ten-chan's faces on my homescreen but it's just impossible. Maybe I should think twice before getting into this so quickly. Once again, the rush for time got the better of me, I guess. That, I did think about. The alternatives though. I could've thought twice.<br><br><br>This is it, for now. There will be two more of these slated for next week, and I'll tell you first that it's Aki-chan (ugh) and miwa, and the latter is not about her new single last month. (Audience: Oh?) Yes, it's going to be interesting talking about miwa's single from last year today haha. Cya guys again then, and until next time... I'm going to run out of money very soon. Good thing June is the month for me to save up as there aren't as many releases compared to other months. I know it'll burn off my Apple Music subscriptions, but I'll definitely be using it to find new songs in the time being. So that is that. Bye!<br><br>P.S. Just a kind reminder because you normally don't mouseover on desktops (and on mobile), but there is overlay images when I introduced the girls. Happy finding haha (Hint: It's the colours)<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
