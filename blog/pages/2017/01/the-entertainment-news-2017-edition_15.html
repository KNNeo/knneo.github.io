Yay! I survived first week of work! Then again I did practically nothing but what I did in university which is studying, so that's not good news. But I think I'm ready, or I better be. I don't want to be viewed as a noob in any way. Even though I am. No seriously, I have literally zero experience in Java programming. Not even in school. Haha don't tell my co-workers, yes?<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>ACCA 13-ku Kansatsu-ka:</b> Japanese vocals backed by English rap? Hitting the jazz pretty hard, I see.<br />Okay, this show. Let's talk about it. Firstly, not the episode, just everything about it first. One - The animation is terrible. Yes, as my sis said it. Then again, it's very reminiscent of an Anime made by the same guys (Madhouse) going by the name of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei five years ago. So, I don't mind. Two - the story. If this show doesn't entice you enough, consider military grade successful ruling (only happens in North Korea and nowhere else lol) turned peace due to an internal inspection department recently worried about a coup d'Ã©tat (I actually had to Google it) and decided to not disband the staff? You've got something else coming. Three - The theme songs. You may not like the opening song, but you should like the ending song. So soothing I think I'll enjoy it soon. Meanwhile, I'm basking in the style of this jazz music for the opening, so don't ask about the tastes of Klassic Note because this one goes in the line of "unconventional but I like it" type of music haha. All in all, I'll continue watching considering they left such a cliffhanger right at the start. Jean has a lot of things coming behind him. I hope his lungs are ready.<br />No really, that much smoke bro. You're gonna get lung cancer sooner or later.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Qace3YkZWvE/WHYlcdaIcyI/AAAAAAAAdBc/UWuorLlr18kiU0g0povqMMzur3czDXk7gCLcB/s320/acca01_shock.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The best image quality yet. *shock*<br />Yeah, cannot extract those moving images too sketchy liao lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Yuuki Aoi for best female voice in this whole episode (not the girl above), probably this whole show. But hey, I'm not here for voices. Aoi-chan is enough for me. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span><br />P.P.S. I like how ALL the text in this "country" is done using Katakana. Like literally, this state's official language is romanised Japanese. Damn this show is interesting.<br /><br /><b>Kuzu no Honkai: </b>Wow what did I just see... I don't even know how to start.<br />For those who read the manga, keep it to yourself. I know you're grown up already, so shut up. Otherwise, you'd be pleased to know of the three main things I got from this new romance show. First, it was more than just weird. It's sexual. Somehow half of this episode is no different from watching a porno (which I had tbh), and it irks me. It irritates me because I wasn't here for any of that, thinking that mutual trust was built upon the illusion. Secondly, let's talk about the story. You're one of the main guys (male or female) who knew of another person who's crush is on your crush. Yeah, very complicated actually. And not exactly your usual rectangle love or whatever. Nonetheless, you know of that, and you agree to keep with the illusion by physically liking the... damn I don't even know how to explain. The origin story is weird. Really weird. Not that anyone else agrees, but still. Lastly, how this show is going to pan out. Typically affected by everyone else. We got a hint of secondary characters (that kid who wears good sports shoes for a three-legged match), and they may chip in into discovering or manipulating the illusion. Problem is it's rather physical, and I really wonder how far this can take besides the main two eventually being with each other, destroying the illusion.<br /><br />The above is just honest, formal opinion of my own after much thinking throughout the episode. If you want honest stuff you're going to get it. Questions pollute my mind as I start watching this particular first episode. How did anyone agree to by a physical entity of another out of unrequited love? (Really, I wish it was THIS easy lol) Really. Next, THE MAKE OUT SCENE. You have been warned. It's totally rated the moment they started kissing before the opening theme and it's saliva coming out. I commend on you watching that scene where they just stripped the girl off her clothes and she was orgasmic throughout because either you've watched porn (and even for me I still looked away) or you've pretty much watched every other Hentai Anime that I don't watch. Then again, I appreciate the honesty of this show if it's originally like this, just... too much. They do this in the manga?? I would (not) like to see that scene. (I've only seen one chapter, but still) Then, there's production. Anyone noticed how this show is literally made like a comic? The advantage is literally that it saves on animation making, because it's mostly smaller images. And guess what? It doesn't really make of great animation effects considering you're watching animation. Yeah? So really, not a lot of good reasons for me to watch this... damn I don't even want to talk. On other things in summary, Anzai Chika (the voice actor who does Hana-chan's voice) sounds a lot like Hanazawa Kana-chan in this show thus far, and MVP Aki-chan for her mature woman role, really. She did pretty well this episode. It's a good start. Whether it is for me? That leaves much to be expected. If that is the episode that draws the kids in, then I'm fine. Otherwise, I may just quit if they start making out in the nearby hotel. Heck, they don't even need one. So much scum, it's pissing me off already.<br />P.S. It know it's long, but still. Theme songs are great, so I'll be sure to listen to those when they come out.<br />P.P.S. They must be TOTALLY BLIND and put on anaesthetic when they made out. I'm definitely not blind for doing that imagining of someone else. Never. Then again the guy is desperate, so I really wonder what the heck is wrong with Hana-chan, really. This show is weird.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ggI8SlFdFpg/WHjdHmKQVGI/AAAAAAAAdCc/KAs0Jlj_HPcdT7wJ6NVBn6BuwmH-Ptw6QCLcB/s320/kuzunohonkai01_summary.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A very good summary for this show.<br />The main two are behind the front two who they love.</td></tr></tbody></table>You guys want a secret from me? It has been apparently (for a few years) my goal to find someone I could just make out with day and night. Not with the illusion though; It's really putting me off, this show.<br /><br /><b>Sangatsu no Lion: </b>Hmm, this episode (13) is about two shougi matches. Yes. If this game isn't your thing like me who doesn't watch this show for this part, then you might as well move on. Although, there are a few pointers we can catch on, just not Smith's life and "bad friend" (as I would like to call it) Nikaidou interfering with Rei's match. Problem typically means we'll see a predicted ending amongst all this complication. That confrontation without the violence is inevitable. Damn I hope this is not the ending to this season. Okay, the parts I picked up. Smith talks about how Rei is serious about shougi yet super-focused, which, if you did read previous weeks of me talking about it, is his strength and also his weakness. Also evidently shown in his own match, he is surprisingly taking on defence than attacking, which is just a way of hinting to us that he is scared of something. Well, you know. Who wants to get beat in the face twice, right? Anyways, the path of shougi is hard and long, so we shall see about it ourselves.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NTYNuPx4fjQ/WHrgZOB67pI/AAAAAAAAdDY/jLW_pcaRWTogXN3xUJyUDtNRTHe-zSnPQCLcB/s320/sangatsunolion13_smith.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me when I want something to reward myself but fate tells me to go home lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />And this week's winner is... surprisingly, ACCA. Underdogs always win, I must say. *starts dancing to jazz*<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Acchi Kocchi: </b>I read recently in my old blog posts (yeah I sure am bored at work lol) that I should continue with this which I didn't for months, and here I am. Original serialisation is at seven volumes worth of content, and follow-up has been as far as five. After reading only the first two volumes which mostly contained Anime stuff revised, I'm quite impressed. You may not find the drawing quality great because Kyoto Animation obviously bumped it up quite a lot, you may hear more lamer jokes and references, but all in all I really enjoyed a lot of it. The Anime itself may have shuffled the stories back and forth, the animation has been jacked up quite a bit, but overall the manga is still quite a fascinating read. Although my first impression is Anime (and I hope it's yours too because the drawing...), I still enjoyed reading everything again, as usual. I'll continue the rest of it hopefully by next week so it can join the waiting list haha<br />(I'll show speed reads for manga by putting one image per volume I read, just to keep it memorable)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EA8i_2w8elg/WHtjD9CpCnI/AAAAAAAAdDo/78c-AO7Mxvg4Em1q0GHcfIe0ET_QTNK3QCLcB/s1600/akckvol1_thumb.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EA8i_2w8elg/WHtjD9CpCnI/AAAAAAAAdDo/78c-AO7Mxvg4Em1q0GHcfIe0ET_QTNK3QCLcB/s320/akckvol1_thumb.png" width="320" /></a></td><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4hSnDVmxMbI/WHtjEah7B_I/AAAAAAAAdDs/2niVx84xLoQGwsLRjVHHlr_Mzw28KxPlACLcB/s1600/akckvol2_thumb.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4hSnDVmxMbI/WHtjEah7B_I/AAAAAAAAdDs/2niVx84xLoQGwsLRjVHHlr_Mzw28KxPlACLcB/s320/akckvol2_thumb.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Something from the Anime.

There aren't any releases this week, as far as the artists I am familiar anyway. I didn't also as far as go find new songs too. I guess this month is going to start dull, huh. I will try though, for next week. Apple Music isn't of much help anyway. <b>Cocoro Auction's new mini-album</b> was quite a turn-off, and <b>LILI LIMIT's latest single</b> somehow managed to get my attention more.<br /><br />If you want something more in the near future (near as in two weeks later haha) there is <b>ClariS new album</b> (I'm ditching fhana for good now) and there's like all the theme songs for the three Anime I watched this week, so... there you go. A whole lot more releases but not this month, I guess.<br /><br /><br />Cya guys then. Yeah, Klassic Note one is short, but as I said, I'm starting low, hopefully reducing the number of songs I'll give this year. Damn, last year was an overload already. I don't wish to reach a point in this where I review too many releases such that, I start forgetting new songs which I give because I didn't give enough time for them to remain in my memory. That's essentially what it is back then. Hmm... I don't know. We shall see. I'm taking this against the 200+ artists I know releasing new songs every other week. Except this month haha. Until next time... another major holiday is coming where I stay, so that's good news to hear. Happy more holidays, everyone. After this it's going to be rough. No holidays ahead for a couple of months so I'll have to take leave at some point haha<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Entertainment News</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
