<h2 class="title">THE OFF-NOTE PROJECT 2016: Songs That Didn't Make The Cut…</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
Yes, you're not in the wrong place. And no, it's not me trying to re-brand anything. Perhaps, it's the perfect way to explain these fallen tunes...<br /><br />Hey, and welcome to that promised post. Every year I give so many songs, but there will be that many songs that I don't. Reasons are unlikely justified, but it gives me reason to explain to you what songs I would give and what I wouldn't, with or without restrains of any kind. Still, whether giving it or not that's how it works, and I think it's just as important to share it with you.<br /><br />Also, I noticed the importance of some of the songs being reinstated to their decision state, and into the final list. Thus, 2.99 stars is no longer an adequate measure of what is to come. So, with a new title, let's talk about some of them.<br /><br />(This time I will talk about <b>prominent ones that I decide not to give</b>, and how much it has impacted on my life ie. obstinate enough such that it wants to get back on my list but didn't lol. Those that did get back are not in this list fyi)<br /><br />[In preview chronological order]<br />Single: Right Now<br />Artist: ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Right Now<br />Reason: I cannot remember anything from this song. Okay, just a little from the chorus.</li></ul>Single: BANG!BANG!BANG!<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Silent Siren<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Star drops<br />Reason:Weak verses, even though good chorus.</li></ul>Album: FIXION<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>THE ORAL CIGARETTES<br /><ul><li>Song Title: A-E-U-I<br />Reason: If written more driven to the beats of A-E-U-I may be more appealing as a song.</li></ul><div>(The above probably got stuck in my head for a while. They can write catchy songs but that's it, which is a pity. Also explains why I only gave B-sides of their singles this year.)</div><br />Album: Doubt no Koshin<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Kuso Iinkai<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Fuzai Shoumei<br />Reason: If it sounds like the topic song of this album, then why the heck am I giving it?</li></ul>Album: Origin<br />Artist: KANA-BOON<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Goodbye<br />Reason: Nice chorus, fails at everything else.</li><li>Song Title: Diver<br />Reason: Not because it's a Naruto theme song, but the verses are not good.</li></ul>Album: Mi Kara Deta Uta<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Takezawa Migiwa<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Arasuji</li><li>Reason: Melody was rather weird overall.</li></ul>Album: S<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Silent Siren<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br /><ul><li>Song Title: Cherry Bomb<br />Reason: Weak verses, and especially if when you listen to the best songs the band has got, this is far from that.</li></ul><div>(Same problem as THE ORAL CIGARETTES, I guess. The verses were really not memorable)</div><div><br /></div>Single: Toumei na Onnanoko<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Hanazawa Kana<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Toumei na Onnanoko<br />Reason: Not what I expected. Missing the days Kana-chan sings songs that sound impressive after much listening.</li></ul>Single: Bye Bye Blue<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Kotobuki Minako<br /><ul><li>Song Title: "YES"<br />Reason: Melody too generic to feel any form of impact, maybe due to too many out-of-place notes?</li></ul><div>(From the above I believe that the Kotobuki Rock fever is nearly over.)</div><div><br /></div>Album:Point<span style="white-space: pre;">.</span><br />Artist: Primary<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Hope<br />Reason: I get where they are going with this song, but the tempo maybe a little too heavy to be acceptable.</li></ul>Album: Undertow<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>THE BED ROOM TAPE<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Hook<br />Reason: I gave it a lot of chances. It didn't seem to impress me, mainly due to lack of song structure and/or repetition.</li></ul>Album: all time Lovin'<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Toyosaki Aki<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Ginga Station<br />Reason: Second half of the song (after second chorus, not the first) was disappointing.</li></ul>(Above is the reason why I can't never a perfect album. Sorry, Aki-chan. Wasn't your fault.)<br /><br />Album: Cho Ikimonobakari ~Ten Nen Kinen Members' Best Selection~<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Ikimonogakari<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Koiuta<br />Reason: Style of song too strong, thus lacking in appeal to me.</li></ul>Album: TWELVE<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Mrs. GREEN APPLE<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Watashi<br />Reason: Very irritatingly implied of love, though overall melody is good.</li><li><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">Song Title:<span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp;</span></span>Hug<br />Reason: Why the gay voice? It was a nice melody.</li></ul>Album: D.A.N.<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>D.A.N.<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Dive<br />Reason: If not for the lonest introduction and weird voiceovers before the song itself this would be easy to give.</li></ul>Single: Vision/Nijuu Rasen Kouzou<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Kuso Iinkai<br /><ul><li>Song Title: AI<br />Reason: Verse does not align with chorus, it seems.</li></ul>Album: What a Wonderful World Line<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>fhana<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Relief<br />Reason: English? Now this is sooo not going to be in list, despite the decent melody.</li></ul>Album: heavenly<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>SpecialThanks<br /><ul><li>Song Title: KOKOKARA<br />Reason: I'd love to give the instrumentals, but that is as much as it is good at.</li></ul>Single: ninelie<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Aimer<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Speaker<br />Reason: Everything is good, but the vocals is not. Aimer is not suitable to sing this IMHO</li></ul><div>(A real pity, this one.)</div><div><br /></div>Album: Brighter<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>ikkubaru<br /><ul><li>Song Title: seaside<br />Reason: Sounds like QUATTRO, but not good enough.</li></ul><div>Album: Sail Canvas</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>TrySail</div><div><ul><li>Song Title: Ashita mo Hareru<br />Reason: For more reasons than other which this song resembles many but worse, this will not be accepted.</li><li>Song Title:<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>primary<br />Reason: Sounds great, but melody is not uncoordinated.</li></ul><div>Album: eve</div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>cinema staff</div><div><ul><li>Song Title: Kirifuda<br />Reason:Very poor bridge, rest of song melody cannot cover this portion of the song.</li></ul></div></div>Single: Atarashii Uta<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Hanazawa Kana<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Looking for your Smile<br />Reason: Failed at the bridge part of the song due to its over extended nature. Otherwise has good chorus and verses.</li></ul>Single: Princess<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>miwa<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Shan Ran Ran<br />Reason: And this was an Anime theme song. No wonder it isn't even worth mentioning.</li></ul>Single: Miss. Revolutionist<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Taketatsu Ayana<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Miss. Revolutionist<br />Reason: Mostly due to versea and particularly bridge part of the song, otherwise is a good melody overall.</li></ul>(The above also got stuck in my mind for a good time. I can still hum the chorus. Oh no, I better not)<br /><br />Album: Tomatsu Haruka BEST SELECTION -starlight-<br />Artist: Tomatsu Haruka<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Circle<br />Reason: Verses and bridge weak, chorus is good.</li><li>Song Title: In Our Hands <br />Reason: Very good chorus, but verses are going to be the thing that'll stop me from giving this song from "Yasashiku Hibi".</li><li>Song Title: Koi no Uta<br />Reason: Mood of song is not expected and tempo of song is too slow. Decent melody though.</li></ul>Album: U<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>UNLIMITS<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Lonely Blue<br />Reason: Poor bridge, and even after that only chorus is above average.</li></ul>Album: Ren'ai Shousetsu to, Tsuuka Ressha to, 1g no Tameiki<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Manami<br /><ul><li>Song Title: 25-ji no Cinderella<br />Reason: Many have tried this style, but have never gotten the melody right. This was a good overall though.</li></ul>(The one above also is kind of a deal breaker. Maybe it's just me being biased giving the other two)<br /><br />Single: Take Me Out<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>SCANDAL<br /><ul><li>Song Title: I want you<br />Reason: A little too simple in melody, and a little too high-pitched in vocals. Not to mention it’s technopop.</li></ul>Album: Good New Times<br />Artist: Gotch<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Good New Times<br />Reason: Despite being topic song for album doesn't sound good in melody overall. Also, music style too.</li><li>Song Title: The Sun Is Not Down<br />Reason: General music style compelling. Melody of chorus is good though. English song I wished I didn't understand.</li></ul>Single: cubic futurisimo<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Uesaka Sumire<br /><ul><li>Song Title: cubic futurisimo<br />Reason: As expected, technopop is not a thing in Klassic Note. Also, bridge part is too long and inappropriate to song.</li></ul>Single: DIP-BAP<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>THE ORAL CIGARETTES<br /><ul><li>Song Title: DIP-BAP<br />Reason: Chorus feels very different in mood to the verses and so on. Otherwise separately they are good.</li></ul>Album: SHISHAMO 3<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>SHISHAMO<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Egao no Tonari<br />Reason: Mainly rejected due to melody, lack of emphasis of chorus and in rest of the song.</li></ul>Album: Adan Ballet<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Cocco<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Unohana Kusashi<br />Reason: Sounds similar to same album song "Yuushuu no Bi" in terms of melody</li></ul>Album: Boku ga CD wo Dashitara<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>KANA-BOON<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Naimono Nedari<br />Reason: Song structure weak. Feels like listening to a segmented song. Catchy beat does not offset overall melody.</li></ul>Album: daydream<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Aimer<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Hertz<br />Reason: I rejected a smiliar tune and lyrics in another single earlier in the year, so this one will also have to pass.</li></ul>Album: Life<br />Artist: plenty<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Kokoro no Mama ni<br />Reason: Melody is passable, but just barely. Not good enough to be give four stars.</li></ul>Single: Wake up<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>KANA-BOON<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Weekend<br />Reason: Half the song is the other half of rap style that I didn't favour of the group. Verses are weak too.</li></ul><span style="white-space: pre;">Single: </span>Juunigatsu no Himawari<br />Artist:&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Aqua Timez<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Gift<br />Reason: The rap I missed, but not the rap melody I liked. Background beats are not as strong either.</li></ul>Single: Yui<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>miwa<br /><ul><li>Song Title: On My Way<br />Reason: This song… it's not clicking in me. I feel the beats, but the melody isn't impressive enough.</li></ul>Single: Reason Living<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>SCREEN mode<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Distance<br />Reason: Close to something good, but overall song is weak to give.</li></ul>(So close, and SCREEN mode would have been on my shelf. Phew)<br /><br />Single: Kaze ga Fuku Machi<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>LuckLife<br /><ul><li>Song Title: journey<br />Reason: Statistics show I will get bored of this song, and I have given quite a lot this year. So… no.</li></ul>Single: Sakebe<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Numakura Manami<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Koto no Ha<br />Reason: The bridge part is too hard to give, almost as hard as cinema staff's "YOUR SONG", or worse.</li><li><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">Song Title:</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>HEY!<br />Reason: Very lively, catchy chorus, but then again this song doesn't suit her voice. So overall rejection here.</li></ul>(Ah, this one. Maybe it's because of Mikakoshi I'm scared of giving Nu-chan her debut single)<br /><br />Album: EXIST!<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>[Alexandros]<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Aoyama<br />Reason: Weak verses throughout song, bridge also weak.</li></ul>Album: MAMI KAWADA BEST F<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Kawada Mami<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Contrail<br />Reason: Too long of a bridge and occasional unsuitable pop sounds, but otherwise has good chorus.</li></ul>Single: Million Litmus<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Kotobuki Minako<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Million Litmus<br />Reason: Verse is poor, spoils overall good song including bridge part which is decent.</li></ul><br />Single: TV Anime Kono Bijutsubu no wa Mondai ga Aru! Character Song CD Vol.1<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Usami Mizuki, Colette, Tachibana Yumeko<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Aozora Canvas<br />Reason: Less than catchy chorus, weak overall mood even though have decent bridge</li></ul>Album: Tokowaka no Kuni<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">Artist: </span>Yuuki Aoi<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Rezetowaru<br />Reason: Like the rest of the mini-album, lack of instrumentals plus her less than perfect slurs make for less than wonderful songs.</li></ul>Album: SHARE THE HAPPY<br />Artist: Miyawaki Shion<br /><ul><li>Song Title: #Doko Made mo Share ~girlyparty~<br />Reason: Weak verses and chorus, overall less than desired song</li><li>Song Title: Puchi Pura<br />Reason: Good chorus, rest of the song sounds like typical pop tune, so not giving due to unprecedented bias</li></ul>(Yeah, the second one got stuck in my head for way too long, so much so I had thoughts of extending the song count even after I started calculating results and giving awards)<br /><br />Album: OH! MY MISTAKES!<br />Artist: Tsuji Shion<br /><ul><li>Song Title: Horoyoi<br />Reason: Too simple a melody compared to rest of song, rejecting due to song count/extended tones in every verse (refer Primary album songs)</li><li>Song Title: Obake wa Kowakunai<br />Reason: Sub-par chorus, songs has many parts of speech than singing</li></ul><br /><div>And then I realised this took a lot more time for me to do up and it looked more confusing than last year. Also, if you prefer to use the search function on your browser start with artists first it'll give you a better chance. Then again, why would you? All these are trash. Go listen to the new songs this year. Or the best from last year. Now let me go sleep, please. This post is tedious to do, seriously.<br /><br />P.S. Once again, sorry to all the artists and their songs mentioned here, especially if you wrote them. Unfortunately this is the only dark side to Klassic Note, and it's a necessary evil.</div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
