Hey, it's been a wonderful first week of school (subject to opinion lol) (and maybe it's because the past two hours have been great lololol), and I'm here to talk not about it, but everything else that is keeping me sane after a whole week of surprises. Well, next week is also going to suck because it's "acquaintance-with-your-tutorial-mates" week (lolol... well you know), so this is as important to offset my tensions every week, I assure you.<br /><br />Okay, let's start. If you start after here you're smart because no one gives two bird sh*ts about my life haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Aho Girl: </b>Wow that's some next level shit there "I want a better brother" But then it's true Akkun is an idiot too haha does that mean now when I use the word it'll refer otherwise? Oh no once "the idiot" always, you know.<br />The new episode (7) talks about a couple of stuff to kind of show how not stupid that idiot can actually turn out to be. From consoling teachers to naming dogs (I mean, it sounds dumb but), there's nothing she can't do bad if she puts her effort into it. That is, until she puts in too much effort, like playing hide and seek with her classmates. Man, must suck being her classmates btw. There's also good mention of Akkun and this issues, from quarreling with the idiot (which makes him one too lol) to making her sister... happy? I mean, the sister can be dumb, but don't write a book about how to live her life, yes? Unless you're a certain octopus assassin who has seen all walks of life and is providing career advice or whatever (<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Assassination Classroom). Anyways, this show can only get funnier, and I guess it still is. Now I kind of miss the beach scene last episode also the Prez too the teacher's boobs aren't giving me a boner haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fIFdOc3S4MY/WZQ66ctw-JI/AAAAAAAAhYE/fCZdNwLhhOY931e2CVNyoKDoin3OifFbwCLcBGAs/s320/ahogirl07_dog.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Damn, being a dog is hard.<br />Goes to show how dumb they both are considering no owner asks their pet for a name lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Tsurezure Children:</b> "Just do it in person! Force her!" Takase's best friend, 2017 (Haha I know it's me lol)<br />The new episode (7) teaches us that we can never be like the Dating Master. He is like a God, coming down to save you when you need to, and leaves when his job is done. His name is <strike>Jesus</strike> not that's not it. This show dammit, this show. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Before I explain why I talk about this first (I mean, there's the intro, but still), let's talk about what's not really a problem. Hotaru is now spying on his brother enjoying a great time <strike>being made fun of by</strike> chatting with Minagawa, and the smarter girl of course noticed on the tone of the message (because the brother doesn't speak this way) and changed modes immediately, especially to give the brother a bad name. I mean, that's really mean, considering even from a friend perspective, and if I'm the guy I'll probably give up liking Minagawa in any way too, but that's for him to decide, yes? Meanwhile he has to deal with the mother because he has to explain he hasn't... well you know. *laughs hard* Other than this, the episode is filled with problems, like Gouda being unable to understand a sophisticated woman's heart like Kamine (no really, very stereotypical, this girl), who just wants simple stuff like assurance. Hey, she got it though. Moving on, Takase also has his problems, after quite literally sh*tting on a girl's feelings on messaging being a bad way of confession, now has to deal with being friends with her again. Tougher than it seems, a toilet trip brings down <strike>Jesus</strike> Katori who tells him to be bolder in his approach. I wouldn't say hugging the girl is a good solution, and might just make her cry again, but remember I'm not the author and/but I would love to see it happen hehe (This post is SO going to get so many tags for Christianity once I post this lol) Last but not least, MVP Takano (and will always be, for now) notices she has a fever. For someone else apparently. Been there, done that. Well, saying for myself though, which is kind of what she is experiencing right now. Returning back to what I started, the reason why I mentioned about Katori is that he can solve most if not all the problems mentioned above, well maybe not subtle, maybe people will be less convinced than Takase (lol), but hey, this is not a Cupid show. We're meant to see the drama. And this, I like. As usual the audience gets the last laugh hahaha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kX6qLWTf1x4/WZRA33_NByI/AAAAAAAAhYU/4ptvIEYmEvcZn1R3PObjCh5KILBAA7dxQCLcBGAs/s320/tsurezurechildren07_katori.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Instead of an image of "wife Hotaru checking on the husband's phone"&nbsp;(lol),<br />allow me to introduce to you the coolest guy on the show!</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Love Master Katori may not have the chance to tell you Takano, but I can. It's called being love-struck. As I said, been there, done that. To at least two girls in my life, as far as I remember. Okay, maybe the one more from last year. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again I get fever even without love it's mostly anxiety anyway haha<br /><br /><b>Gamers!: </b>Wow the on-screen dialogues gone on for WAAAAAAY too long I swear but seriously it's still rather entertaining how stupid these idiots <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> are haha<br />The new episode (6) brings us to new levels of excitement, anxiety and anticipation, and I would say, it's well paid off. If you haven't watched it and would like a summary, look at the next episode title haha. Anyways, complications still arise between the couples, from Uehara still setting things up for others (Hoshinomori, Amano), Aguri drawing a love diagram because she don't get it, Amano wanting to be friends with Tendou and so on. A deciding event was scheduled to do all these though, and the Anime did spoil a bit for that (but hey, that was anticipated I assume), and if you think about all of it going through all their minds... they were not wrong. Two things happened that were really wrong and would trigger another series of drama, I would assume. Firstly, Amano screwed it up. Amongst all scenarios that are unexpected, this one, it's a last draw for even the author, I believe. After that, is assumptions. Besides everyone else looking, it's Tendou. She thought she was going to get her friendship with Amano ended so saying 'yes' is the best way to deal with it? Hey, don't say this was a scripted event haha. All in all, very confusing, crazy (even unnecessary) tensions, all leading up to the one thing Amano said. Hey, welcome to episode 1, everybody. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cs6Gp9qEAzk/WZbU5wrNxNI/AAAAAAAAhaM/3laTrU3rZP86hTQxvgDLnEKcUX0Y4C_KgCLcBGAs/s320/gamers06_keita.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When your friends know of your bad habits but think you're not going to do it lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S.&nbsp;Am I the only one screaming throughout the episode “Just say it already!” to Keita?? I have a feeling I’m alone in this haha<br />P.P.S. Okay NOW I want to see next episode. And please tell me it's the HAPPYEND (*cues Toradora! songs*) that I've been waiting for. I really want some Karen x Keita moments in this show or else I'll feel cheated like the other three this episode lol<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>漫画</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Dagashi Kashi: </b>The new chapters (71-73) are... okay I was just mainly interested in the time they WERE NOT talking about sweets apparently haha maybe I was as bored as them in summer makeup class but whatever. The former two talk about some magic skill you can do to produce some kind of mist with the sweet packaging it seems, and a familiar sweet with special car-sickness preventing essence or something or whatever my English sucks as bad as Kokonotsu's Japanese haha. The last one... I'll leave it for you to understand. Slice-of-life is better understood when you know how it feels. <strike>Here's a prime example of Kokonotsu with Sayashi below hehe</strike> maybe I should not haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="275" data-original-width="472" height="186" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T9Fv786As3Q/WZk36lTd2NI/AAAAAAAAhd8/7nBEbrN3cX0nX5i9ATq1SuhhJulm0kOMQCLcBGAs/s320/dgsks73_tou.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me when I finally get my a** up to finish schoolwork and I show off to my parents haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Am I the only one wanting to see more (like, a lot more) of Kokonotsu x Sayashi without Hotaru, Hotaru, and Hotaru around?? (Especially with the new season of Anime?) Damn, I agree with Kokonotsu; this girl needs to go home haha<br /><b><br /></b><b>Konobi: </b>The new chapter (54) talks about a new story, it seems. The Prez has taken in a prize won by Tachibana-sensei, a new set of colored pastels. The high-quality ones. Not like you and I know of it, but Usami <strike>does</strike> doesn't haha. And that's where the problem starts, as Colette helps the Prez (who came up with the idea) to switch them over to see if Usami gets the difference and also break ends (pun not intended) by making Coletter destroy the good stuff. So yeah, you get the point. No surprise if you don't think they wouldn't get found out eventually, so guess what? Uchimaki is the real artist hehe<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="504" data-original-width="702" height="229" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vrdik1CZesk/WZkymzdm6gI/AAAAAAAAhdk/CYdK00W_1bEw6TXfRlrFYoPH2jGIsLmEgCLcBGAs/s320/konobi54_usami.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me when I noticed I bragged too much on a thing I have always been wrong lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>A Channel: </b>The new chapter (100, wow) continues on the adventures of Run and Tooru on her grandmother's place. Faced with the differences in the countryside, their lovey-dovey time together and more grandmother stuff, this sure is a story to tell. It's super relatable too, in my opinion, especially the grandmother-grandchild thing haha. Even though in Run's case her stupidity can never be related to anything I know of in life. I mean, everyone is smarter than me.

So let's move on haha. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/e4/e8/56/e4e856bd-34e1-c0c0-ce6d-f3eec275dc50/source/268x0w.jpg" />Komatsu Mikako's new single</abbr></b> turned out to be a disappointment, so I'm only going to take one of the B-sides and leave. Please, Q-MHz, write good new songs. Mikakoshi's voice is not enough to balance the irritation I get from listening to your melodies. I also gave <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music117/v4/32/25/f7/3225f70e-d401-4fd1-5665-559f8fe2c767/source/268x0w.jpg" />wacci's new album</abbr></b> a chance seeing I listened to their new single months ago, and it's okay. I'm not expecting much, but I'll be giving a song or two. Refer to my Twitter posts for details haha.<br /><br />I'm also giving <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/28/d9/78/28d97850-79a0-4d87-88a4-b9565d933b9e/source/268x0w.jpg" />Cocco's old single "Yake No ga Hara"</abbr></b> a listen from back in last month I listened to it on a live video performance, and it's somehow I like this kind of style of music from her apparently. I don't think I'll be giving more though because I rather let it come to me than me digging through (or even listening through) her recently released best albums. Following on the list of recently reviewed releases, I've also concluded giving new songs for <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/64/e4/8f/64e48fcb-967d-a51c-c8d3-d382c38169b6/source/268x0w.jpg" />PHONO TONES x ADAM at collaboration</abbr></b>, especially from the latter side, which is also two songs like the former release. Man, if they combine all four I listened together it'll be on my shelf already lol<br /><br />In new releases, I'll be expecting <b>the single for Anime "Gamers!" opening theme song</b> and since it's been some time I give Anison I'll be kind, hopefully. (Edit: Oh yah did I mention TrySail's new album is also next week? lol) As far as I can remember most releases happen in the week of the 30th, so I've got nothing else now. Well, explains why I'm giving more songs this week. People like Cocco and wacci will stay for a while longer. Yeah, that 10-year old single from Cocco. As I said, her music has a peculiar style that I like. That's all.<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I'm getting busy getting everything done for school, so if you would excuse me. Then again, I have not yet delivered a v2 for APoL's latest chapter. I'm sorry for that, but that may have to wait. Besides, it's not much besides spelling checks which I hate to do because of all the reading material I have to go through for my project, so... yeah. I need some break once in a while. Cya guys next week, and until then... I mean, I can't come with something every week, so you can do it for me. Write it in the comments section below- Oh we don't have any? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br />P.S. Really getting tired of doing those mouse hover image tags, but I will if I have the time, yes?<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Entertainment News</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
