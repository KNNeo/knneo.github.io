Ah, financial assistance is so much trouble. So many documents to prepare, even though you know there's a good chance that you're going to be rejected because you didn't fill up the club activities portion of the application form.<br /><br />Geez, I'm sarcastic as I say I am. But yeah, I have no life. Let's talk about what is my life now, for the week. Everything is here. After that it's brainwashing YouTube gameplays. Welcome to my life, people.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Koi to Uso:</b> I mean Ririna, what makes us different from monkeys (and Africans apparently; sorry to all) is that we don't do it spontaneously. I know you'll dream about it though lol<br />Okay this might be the (6) and last episode I'll be watching. And yes, you guessed it. They finally touched upon a topic I don't want to watch: sexual intercourse. And what sounds more ridiculous (though necessary; I'm not here to sh*t on the author even though I am) than natural is that the government will be watching, and people around him do know about it, like that middle school classmate somehow, I don't know. Ignoring that, I'm still surprised how much the government is involved in this story, and yes, that's what I'll reject on. It's not because of the too-pure-pure girl Ririna who probably never saw porn in her life because of her excellent grades. It's also not because of Nejima who has to eventually make a decision between love and... arranged love or whatever this is called, but yeah, it's kind of absurd at this point. If I'm Nejima the ending would happen if I asked Ririna one question "Are you afraid of ruining your future?" and she says yes. Otherwise, I might just ruin my own life in sacrifice. Then again, it'll also affect her somehow, so that's why the one query. Okay, I've said enough. I might just take the theme songs and go. I've listened enough to have to give Frederick and... whoever sang the ending some chance. In summary, it has been a good run, but as I said, I'm not interested in shows who directly or indirectly talk or do disturbing scenes even if it means getting the message across. You know I'm not comfortable if I do not stare directly when watching an episode (or two, or more), and I've watched porn.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dS_4Pys6-HY/WYr6IlXl_4I/AAAAAAAAhQg/XLzWuFdjQlAmuroWzs5vU9o2pbDCaTDiACLcBGAs/s320/koitouso06_nejima.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When you notice your sh*t friend's got the worst pair up with a nice-looking girl lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Again, it's not because of Kuzu no Honkai (which I watched 4 episodes of) (okay it's 3 and a little bit) that I reject this show, but I know I will come to this conclusion. What keeps me here up till today is the fact that I'm interested in (1) the government involvement in such a pairing and (2) whatever is happening with Nisaka and Teresaka or the many lies that exist from the start. So yeah, the former has more weight to me rejecting this show and it has been revealed enough, so I'm leaving. If you have been enjoying this show, then I'm sorry. This is also good reason why I don't watch real-life drama.<br />P.P.S. To end on a light note (not in terms of sex lol), I like how Nejima is behaving all weird since we know cameras can be ANYWHERE (I mean, they "arranged" a room for you two) and he's trying hard to find them. Okay, now I really don't want to talk about it no more.<br />[<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/08/07/koi-to-uso-06/comment-page-1/#comment-2291635" target="_blank">My final comment</a> for RC]<br /><br /><b>Aho Girl: </b>TIL Yuuki Aoi-chan has been credited illustrator for the opening theme animation. (Hint: look out for <span style="font-size: x-small;">ÂéüÁîªÂçîÂäõ</span> "genka kyouryoku") Did you notice the sign "(It's) in summer"? Yeah, <a href="https://twitter.com/staff_aoi/status/892934975921635328" target="_blank">she mentioned on Twitter that she wrote it on a piece of paper</a>&nbsp;and the production used it. And according to her this isn't the only one hehe I'll look forward to the next<br />The new episode (6) is as wow as the other episodes before it, I assure you. The beach part was great, and I didn't expect too much from the sand burying part but I laughed a lot haha. There's also onsen, but not like you'll see an idiot climb over the gender wall to see what's on the other side lol. Lastly, that idiot tops it off at the festival winning everyone's hearts and always topping above the now regular backup dancers for her fantastic act. I mean, it wasn't intentional but it's so natural. Oh yeah, and did I mention Akkun just got a new friend? Hehe I'll give you a hint it's not a human lol I mean it's okay bro many girls prefer pets than like me <span class="emoji" title="üò¢">*sob*</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BnV_O55h8R0/WYsBJvipLAI/AAAAAAAAhQw/LFm3YFQWPrccuxoaJLq3zeXxf6Ut9ddgwCLcBGAs/s320/ahogirl06_watermelon.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">If you haven't watched I'll let you guess how this idiot did it</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. "You sure know a lot!" "Being a Prez is a lot of work!" I like how I'm commenting that idiot is right so many times haha yeah you noticed I didn't use the word that sound like "braised" lol<br />[<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/08/08/aho-girl-06/comment-page-1/#comment-2291636" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>]<br /><br /><b>Tsurezure Children: </b>I mean, I was expecting a tearbath from the lonely boys, but it's nothing like what I saw this episode haha<br />The new episode (6) gives us more love than we could ever have, I'll talk a lot about it so be prepared. Firstly, we have the Akagi couple. Remember that gal? She just became like everyone else right about now as Akagi pounds on her (haha) the truth about what she likes of this manboy or whatever, and I must say, I'm not disappointed. How to say... it's like sadism and masochism or other fetishes, you know? Akagi just happens to like the gal personality, so that's nice. And really, that position is real awkward I must say. (I was thinking of between showing this or...) And then, the Chiaki couple. Kana thought she should get intimate in relationship with her boyfriend but turns out it's not happening, or is it? Then again, mixing it with comedy bits is a little insincere in Chiaki's part I must say, but he might be the guy that still misses the friendship (or thinks his girl might think so too), so has yet taken much action since the last time we saw them. But hey, I kind of like how this is going actually. A few more episodes and I may have to reject this show because of disturbing show haha joking this show is far from it? Then, there's the "bachelor's squad", as I would like to call it. Yamane is good friends with Motoyama, a baldie who obviously is as lonely without a girl as his friend until he noticed he's been deceived by the friend who wants to go out to the movies with a girl haha. Hey, being in the squad may be a thing, but being buddies means supporting your friend on whatever he gets. And this, I like Motoyama because of his bro character. This is the kind of friend you want in your life. Last but not least, we got Katori-senpai <strike>a kitten</strike> another <strike>girlfriend</strike> fan who is a new character surprisingly (they are still pushing new people out though, just in case you wonder) and unsurprisingly a friend of Kana (episode 3, btw) she immediately falls in love with Katori for some reason. Hey, you know, the prince stuff that all girls are supposedly in love with which explains why we aren't getting laid lol. But yeah, instead of... *searches episodes* Matsuura-san who thinks it's irritating like I do lol, this girls is mesmerised with everything he says and does, which of course makes of great comedy for sure. I would love to spoil the plot twist, but I laughed at the bloodshed part a little too much. Yeah, more than that idiot show I watched HAHA<br />(Judging from the next episode preview I'm going to love next week A LOT haha is it just me who digs Suzuhara x Takano??!!)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nZPNa2wUtMQ/WYsHw81VdvI/AAAAAAAAhRA/a_A9RV_NFgcNbX3CQQVV1-hVMWSYXoZMACLcBGAs/s320/tsurezurechildren06_katori.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">WTF is this some ninja Anime or something??</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I'd love to post one image from every scene but instead I'll tell you what it is instead:<br /><ul><li>Akagi - When he holds Ryouko-chan (lol) up by her legs really looks like they were doing it with clothes haha</li><li>Chiaki - When their faces are at the closest, the detective bit</li><li>Yamane - Did Motoyama just One Punch Man that dork?? lol the truth hurts (okay I got another one I totally forgot: I didn't know you can spell "onna" (Japanese for 'woman') that way lol)</li><li>Katori - [Spoiler alert] When the girl lands on Katori's chest. Her elbow, I mean. I'm going to GIF the bloodshed in a minute</li></ul>P.P.S. As recommended by me and as usual, watching the Anime without reading the original work is the best. Which explains why I BOUGHT the first volume of the manga (in English of course) and skipped like, four chapters because they aren't shown yet. Or ever, maybe. I hope so though. If you saw the opening theme the girl in the image and another I've seen in the manga (see chapter "Patricia") is in too<br />[<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/08/09/tsurezure-children-06/comment-page-1/#comment-2291640" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>]<br /><br /><b>Gamers!: </b>Hmm, this episode (6) talks about more stuff between the bunch of them, and yeah, this should just explode at some point already. I mean, as you should have noticed, this relationship... hexagon? Yeah, this spider web of misunderstandings, because of lack of communication, or the potential of them being inaccurately delivered. From Amano ro Hoshinomori to Uehara to Aguri or whatever is in between including Tendou, I mean, just get together and clarify things already. Well, Uehara on his part has been trying to do that apparently with the meeting club, but yeah, it's not working as expected. Amongst all whispers and couple meetings that SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED at this point already (well, the characters are bit too sensitive to interactions too), it just helps to needlessly extend and spoil the relationships between the various couples. This can go anywhere honestly, and it's not going in the right direction as of now. Hey, mind you it's a romcom after all, so this is great lol. On other smaller things, we now know Amano is playing the mobile game with Hoshinomori and Uehara noticed it (you see, saying it out would've solved problems), Hoshinomori has been making games apparently, and Amano has been sucking at his dating simulation game because he thinks he can't get along with people like Tendou. You see? All misunderstandings in this show can just be clarified. Well, not now at least. Hopefully some day, I hope.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SBjZYaDmlTA/WY0ndjlRB2I/AAAAAAAAhR8/_4ppSr_LU-EJzgIHoKOVoHIo6gANi224QCLcBGAs/s320/gamers05_badend.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Resident Tendou 7: Blondie Hazard? lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S.

The new chapters (98, 99) talk about... bugs and sweet fish it seems lol. Well, in summary these chapters talk about the girls' summer vacation out. Just that it's Nagi and Yuuko that are indoors and Run and Tooru are really outdoors. I kind of forgot Nagi has an older brother (because of the dad lol), Yuuko is as usual scared of everything, Run did not bring her swimsuit (dang, or not?) and Tooru... let's just say the grandmother is kind of awesome haha<br />(One image only just because hehe)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="336" data-original-width="463" height="232" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-57Zh3gSShqQ/WZAKzlQKcOI/AAAAAAAAhVA/fgFoXU01T_Ia8CVfaMZMX59FVgjZHgh2ACLcBGAs/s320/a-ch98_img2.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I swear Nagi's house only drinks cola.<br />And very, very sweet drinks lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hmm as mentioned last week, there are indeed a couple of releases this week. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/0a/fe/d0/0afed0a8-bf81-bd3b-aeab-40312768bafb/source/268x0w.jpg" />Yoru no Honki Dance's new single</abbr></b> was expected because of the live tracks portion of the release, and the B-side didn't take me anywhere, so that's that. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/89/b5/d2/89b5d2b3-c223-9eca-aa3f-c7d4175fb9ca/source/268x0w.jpg" />CHiCO with HoneyWorks new single</abbr></b> is okay, but I don't feel inclined to give the B-side, so... maybe next time, yes? The topic song for "PriPri Chii-chan" is good though, don't get me wrong. HoneyWorks has good reputation in Klassic Note, as far as I can remember. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/b5/43/34/b54334b7-77f9-5f4a-4772-4d0bba3c7444/source/268x0w.jpg" />Minase Inori's new single</abbr></b> is alright despite people flocking over the music video on YouTube praising it end to end. Well, it is her best single yet, and I did give another B-side. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/04/9e/4f/049e4f41-3054-21bf-2583-12ccb904ea92/source/268x0w.jpg" />Kalafina's new single</abbr></b> is disappointing as usual, but I like to give B-sides which remind me of old Kalafina. Yeah, Kajiura-sensei, talking about you again. I just received <b>Komatsu Mikako's new single</b> which I'm not fond of, so I'll leave that for next week.<br /><br />Talking about next week, I will have to welcome <b>Frederick's new single</b> (even though I don't give the Anime after this week) because it's "safely addictive" to my brain as of today. That's all, I guess. I'm also trying to give a couple of releases more chance so that I'll talk about next week, which potentially includes <b>PHONO TONES recent collaboration with ADAM at</b>, and <b>Cocco </b>which I heard from the live performance not long ago.<br /><br />In new new songs (you didn't see that wrongly), <b>negoto's coming up with a potentially awesome double A-side single</b>, possibly trumping over others which are also releasing at the end of the month including <b>Natsukawa Shiina's 2nd single</b> (music video short version is online) and <b>ClariS new single</b> (pre-release is out on Apple Music), amongst many others.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">I have a feeling my pocket's going to burn a hole again at the end of the month.<br /><br />negoto new single may be too good to resist. <a href="https://t.co/PVdsEMXceV" target="_blank">https://t.co/PVdsEMXceV</a></div>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/896217343725981696" target="_blank">August 12, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br /><br /><br />This is it, I guess.

And yeah, Aoi-chan started that. She also <a href="https://twitter.com/staff_aoi/status/896615439085613056" target="_blank">talked about her lipstick</a> again. Now we just need someone to kiss her.
