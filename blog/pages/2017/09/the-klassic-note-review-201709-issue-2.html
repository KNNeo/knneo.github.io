Hey, guys. It may be TGIF now, but I'm not in the mood for some reason. Okay, I was lying by the time I finished reviewing this single. Thanks, Nan-chan. You'll never know why you've became the new pop idol in Klassic Note haha no you never will I just want to play games with you someday!!!<br /><br />Okay, let's get to it before my inner fanboy gets me. It's leaking out already lol<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Natsukawa Shiina - Fuwari, Korori, Karan, Koron [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70007000/70007955/images/fuwakoro_shokai_web.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70007000/70007955/images/fuwakoro_tsujo_web.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70007000/70007955/images/fuwakoro_kikan_web.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">First Press Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Anime Limited Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Close-ups are better, as usual. Just that there are none. I like the Regular Edition one that I have though) (Please ignore Anime covers as usual too)<br /><br />Origin: I'm sure you could recall about half a year ago that this new voice actress and now solo singer Natsukawa Shiina (Nan-chan) came under the microscope of Klassic Note with her debut single in April, and now she has done it again. Following up on her debut streak she has yet another new release worth mentioning. This time, with Anime credit, with a stronger electronic pop tune. How did she manage to do it with such a music style, just like many other idols before her? Let's find out.<br /><br />(1) Fuwari, Korori, Karan, Koron [Trans.: I honestly don't know!!]<br />It may sound like a lot of sounds from the lyrics, and it may just be beats hitting in the back of your head as you hear it, but that is pretty much it. Total addiction, back from when I first heard it. This ending theme song for Anime "PriPri Chii-chan" is purely just a dance pop tune, and hell yeah did she not dance. The lyrics also briefly talk about music "dancing" around and such, so yeah this song has little reason to it. But it has every reason to dance to it, that's for sure. That is, if she ever did it. Rather disappointed in the lack of dancing in the music video which I shall not review here, but in general this song isn't too disappointing. It's your usual bridge part problems, and the ending may sound a little weird, but otherwise you get a good, short song. And that, I like to give.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Naimono Bakari [Always Asking For (The) Impossible]<br />As usual, the B-side is the deciding factor when it comes to singles, and this one I'm in the category of increased infatuation, I guess. For Nan-chan's new song sounds so much like her and all about singing herself out, is what I think the production is trying to do. But unlike the first track, this one totally talks about her laziness but her search for the impossible and more. For this, I like. And don't you just love the somewhat separated feel of the verses and chorus but how much it can still come back together? I'm saying it in the nicest way possible though. Sadly, this was a deal breaker as this is the kind of music illusion you need to get used to it before it sounds good. Still, this one I'm liking it more as I listen to it, and this, I want to see her dance to it. Okay why is it all about dancing? She's not in the mood to do it already, she just said. The lyrics are cute by the way; I'm just saying.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: I think this is decent for a single, but I struggle to give this release still, but not as much as her first single, so that's good news. If you liked this artist and liked her voice in general, she makes of great "pure pure girl" (thanks Kannagi) vocals for the songs she sings, especially the B-side. This, I must recommend. If you didn't like the music then it's okay; she's better than the music makes of her. And that, I hope you give a listen to this newbie for she is going to break ground with her singing, I'm sure of it.<br /><br />- Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br />(*Just a side note, I actually read some of my older reviews like back in 2014 and noticed <strike>I didn't write that much, and songs are given little reason to put on my list. This might explain how it's so much short than my last review, in case you wonder.</strike>&nbsp;Okay never mind, I wrote a lot anyway haha too much information, huh.)<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1BAHMJfpDBs/WbKFPJvI6fI/AAAAAAAAiAU/82iknlUAqfgCVUQgHN2jsVQRiw_7Ekd_QCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20170908_191224.jpg" width="320" /></div>Okay, this. Well, you may have noticed the plastic above the disc has already been removed as I took this photo because the first thing I wanted to check is whether the application registration link is still available so I can get the free wallpapers (like Aki-chan's best album) and the answer is... no. They shut the doors good on this one. Damn. Then again I should've done it before Sunday (by pre-ordering, I mean), but that's going to be tough anyway. The upside is I get to choose not HMV Japan (soon LAWSON HMV) (or anything through direct delivery) and I kind of regretted that now too. I ended up with two and I chose <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://trysail.jp/s3/skiyaki/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/106848/content_fuwakoro_gamers_0611re.jpg" />the landscape one from Gamers</abbr>. Should've gone for <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://trysail.jp/s3/skiyaki/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/106851/content_fuwakoro_toranoana_0618re.jpg" />the portrait one from Toranoana</abbr>, my current self said. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />[Yes I placed overlays if you didn't notice]<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pqnld8rSqbA/WbKFab_C58I/AAAAAAAAiAY/SHD5QIbNJXEAWfJifdQlfFPLq9GGs2n5wCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20170908_191446.jpg" width="320" /></div>Talking about Gamers, this time... no free magazine, no promotions I assume, but there's this... well promotion poster of a figurine I'll never buy lol, but yeah, minimal stuff. Well, who cares so long as I get my Nan-chan, yes? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> More like <span style="font-size: x-small;">きいろバカリ</span> [Always Yellow] haha<br /><br /><br /><br />This is it then. Cya guys next time, and until then... I mean, we're not getting another review soon, you know that, right? Good. Take care people. The weekend is harsh, and before you know it you'll have to go to that weekday life again. Ugh, thinking about it makes my head hurt. So hard to answer to the people when you know practically nothing haha that's my project progress<br /><br />P.S. Please don't make her future singles be about "the new Nan-chan" please I beg you production needs to get out of it I'm here to avoid the beat generation fever that is chinese pop<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Klassic Note</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
