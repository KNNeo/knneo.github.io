I'll see.<br><br>I keep thinking there's someone else besides me for some reason.

I'm like "I intentionally dropped by contact lenses for him to pick it up!" Volume 1 Omake ladies and gentlemen hehe sorry for the spoilers<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div>The second last episode (11) for this series is going strong, and setting things up for the last episode. As I watch the preview for this week's episode, I remind myself of the realisation Takano has come to be thanks to Kamine's sharing of her love experience (Is itÂ <em>thatÂ </em>similar? I don't know) and what it takes for Chiaki and Kana to come back together again, this time thanks to technology problems. Well, there's human fault too, and she can get the house phone to call Chiaki too ("If you forget my phone number I'll kill you" &lt;= That's what they say in the 90s), but we'll not discuss too much of that here. All in all, it's setting things up for the future with potentially life-changing results, as we clearly see love being a force to change most of their lives, for the better. For example, you get a very studious Ryouko for some reason, but is it too late? That, you can ask me. From experience, dear girl, it may be too late. But what's more important is the emphasis here on the classroom environment. As I'm out of that, I realise I'm more self-confident (which can be a good or bad thing) and thus can approach and communicate with people more. On the other hand you get better pressure from the class (rumours and stuff, which can be a good thing or bad thing) to do certain things in life, like dating, dating and dating. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Hey, I'm liking this show, to be honest, and I can't wait to see if my dad will sleep early so I can watch the first broadcast of this on my home TV hehe I can watch this again all day<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWmOZO82OGyVmo6MOb9QSFF5v9Qq-LgBoTJM1LAQj4kSDoRw2cLtLczYGDJvFVIHlJIWUTcPP64MPtp-9ItOLtJ1r8YpzR1sCP9WexlQVyR4ukvaXIG0MP0dH_zlr3jsuXG0pZCGLTowFH/s320/tsurezurechildren11_ayaka.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is the face of bliss, people. Remember that well.</table>P.S. And that is why, ladies and gentlemen, you should NEVER bring your phone with you into the bathroom. Well, starting from iPhone 7 it's not a problem though, but before that... just don't. Also, do not try this at home too, but hitting your phone is no good, Kana's mother. Electronics don't work that way. I know; I'm an engineer haha<br>P.P.S. Man, do I look like Ryouko-chan (<span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span>) right now. Struggling through math thinking that I solved it... thank goodness life isn't all mathematics. Phew! But getting into college/university though... that's another thing hehe<br>(I don't really want to say this but THANKS FOR THE BATHTUB FANSERVICE!!! haha)<br>[<a href=http://randomc.net/2017/09/13/tsurezure-children-11/comment-page-1/#comment-2301324 target=_blank>My comment on RC</a>]<br><br><b>Aho Girl:</b> Wow if this episode (11) isn't drama packed. I didn't start with a short intro because... every one of them is good. From taking revenge on a dessert to life lessons to a heroic dog... this show's got everything. Well, everything funny, that is. Defying all logic is a girl who can do nothing but try (man it's going to be a problem for Ruri-chan as she struggles to survive in society I guess), fight thugs with bananas shoved up their... mouths haha, and fighting dogs? Really? That's the best you can come up with, author? Really lame though, to be honest. On the other hand, I had a lot of laughs, and a lot of drama feels. Well, as much as this show is relevant though. That idiot is still seeping out of this show from time to time, making me remember this is just a joke show, nothing else.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9RHeVwED5MZ0GhnYrEamaSm38MXb6rK2NsL9UXtIADP870uHS_hswN1jMrkmtBPKXHRorO22HrmZLYWO9hEo6nQjd-VZsWf7BlQsz08c70_p4bHUvMFJE8G3sWBPxoysimkdzm6OpljbJ/s320/ahogirl11_eyecatch1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>So much, <em>so</em> much story in one image.<br>Okay you can ignore the dragonflies mating haha</table>P.S. Hey guess what? We're all better than Ruri-chan. I don't know this is a consolation to anyone, but remember we're doing this at the expense of an 11-year-old. So show some empathy and appreciation, please. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br>[<a href=http://randomc.net/2017/09/14/aho-girl-11/comment-page-1/#comment-2301322 target=_blank>My comment on RC</a>]<br><br><b>Gamers!:</b> Straight off the bat we see Amano's stupidity shining in the light. I mean, you're not that idiot <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span> but you're pretty close bro haha<br>Man, I have to draw that relationship chart myself someday already. Okay, I didn't do that from episode 1, or anything slightly later than that episode, so whatever. This new episode (10) tries to clear misunderstandings, but not really. With the ending, it still manages to achieve that blur we've been getting from the start. Aguri threw off her friend, tries to find consolation with the boyfriend, and ends up seeing him going out with two girls. That's not important though, until she calls Amano and he came to her rescue even though he's out doing the most important thing in his life: purchasing a game! Weird, right? Actually, not really. As mentioned in the introduction, Amano, and the others to a smaller extent, are too dumb to notice they don't explain things properly, which eventually leads to the problematic situation we have now, or every episode up till now. Still, it has cleared the one thing which is assuring Tendou that Aguri is nothing but a brother to her... or did he? I would easily explain this as hearing out a friend over a breakup which can be important even if you're a gamer with friends (I mean, look at Tendou), but yeah, it's not going to get explained. I wonder when it will. Chiaki is still confused about her feeling with Amano, and Uehara still thinks he has got hold of the whole situation. (Spoilers: He has not.) Where will this head to? Your guess is as bad as mine haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJkz55WXoOlNAJrAb2ZKkrjRE4t2nrIEVQ9xmkFjzRlnuUSYGP48XNOAS4vJ-zkwY5PiRe7GRRiO5UHhgp1jobLjTRGF8H-Qtubr9REYiEWcApB2l5k2SIyr4z-WW6FdQZrI9w7f27Sf0c/s320/gamers10_laugh.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yeah, reuse those animations haha Keita looks dumb in this</table>P.S. In the intro here I'm referring to the first thing Amano mentioned this episode which is asking his girlfriend a way to reject someone, for his sake. That second part is really important because this literally makes Tendou feel that you want to learn how to reject someone to reject her. Well that cleared out somehow, right?<br>P.P.S. I would like to bring your attention to the most slice-of-life scene which is the siblings sharing thoughts and troubles with each other. And that's how siblings are. I'm maintaining a great relationship with my sister like this. Not romantic, just... being each other's listening ear. We're both single if that helps haha I'm as dumb as this show<br>(GIF HAKKEN!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> No I didn't "find" it I did it myself.

I like talking about these not-your-usual chapters, you know. The Endou siblings visit their grandmother's in a long time, and discuss about the old sweet that she places on her place every time people visit. So yeah, also weirdest chapter because we don't see Kokonotsu and Hotaru for once, and only hear them on the phone. (I mean, I WANT to see Hotaru-chan haha) What's not weird is the sibling relationship there is between these two, which makes this chapter more interesting than usual. And what's better, their knowledge (or knowledge in acquisition) of dagashi is enough that they know how to speak their minds out well to their elderly.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=291 data-original-width=461 height=201 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTXRtPjcOjjtkFU48goEWaGnkhvxs4lE8gAESzvKPwHyF2JUg9b16Fbndr40xGMFbAgIOsUPw1xC8a2oqgp5mDIzMGeDrcszE7VXeLn11X_KrTENjoYNRRC0mBQpz-o-RBxRNz00Dhi_IO/s320/img000005.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>GRANDMA TRIGGERED</table>P.S. I looked at Chapter 77 cover and then Sayashi's face on the first page and I laughed haha<br><br><strike>Tsurezure Children:</strike> No I just took a peek on the latest (translated) chapters and I saw awesome things. Well, mostly people in couples already which is not yet in Anime so... Takano looks great in a bikini?<br><span style=font-size:large>AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!</span><br><span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Thanks Love Master!<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style=font-size:large><br>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hmm... this week, not many releases, to be honest. But then again, it has been like that before, so let's quickly talk about it. <b>ClariS new single</b> is not impressive as with all their other singles, but out of pity I ended up giving the topic song because it wasn't bad. Hey, if I stay it's because of the style, nothing else. (Then again if it's style means it's Anime songs, uh oh) On reviewing of releases from last week, <b>SID's new album</b> is not interesting after all so I only took a familiar tune, <b>Porno Graffitti's new single</b> was quite a letdown so I also ended up giving only one, <b>Rie fu's new album</b> is okay as I step up to give some of her "artworks", and last but not least I decided to give <b>H ZETTRIO</b> a chance with a couple of songs. Don't know who they are? In a nutshell they're the spiritual successor to PE'Z who disbanded back in 2015, so it sounds the same, but different. You can go find out about it yourself; Me saying doesn't make any sense until you feel the beats of this jazz.<br><br>Talking about next week... there's nothing. Really. I don't remember anything. There's nothing written on the document either. So yeah. *looks at own Twitter likes* On other things though, I finally got a listen to a single track digital release of the still yet unannounced Anime "Koi to Uso" ending theme song by a bunch of girls named <b>"Roys" on their debut single</b>. I don't know why, but make it quick, yes? Plenty of releases are announced for November, so that's another peak season to take note of. <b>yucat</b>'s preparing for a new (I think it's a best) album, <b>Porno Graffitti is also releasing an album </b>hopefully not as disappointing as the recent review, <b>Ayachi's best album</b> new song for her fanclub has been announced (title only, as usual) and <b>Komatsu Mikako's new single</b> is (no surprise there) the new ending theme song for the Anime she was credited with last season. Oh well. You know she doesn't go well with Anime, right, Q-MHz? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><br><br>Ok that's it. I'm burning out liao, as you can see from the typing above. Cya guys next week then, and that's probably when I'll have more time to blog or whatever. I'm still actively giving new songs though, as you notice, to keep up with the pace of my yearly intake of new songs every year haha. Until next time... I hope you aren't as "busy" as me worrying about stuff. In all honesty though I'd rather about work (a 5-day work week one) than school. Although seeing my sis work weekends for no reason I may have to think twice. Then again her clients work weekend so sucks to be her hehe<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
