YYYYYYAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!<br><br>As you might have heard (lol), I'm free. Unemployed, but free. (no pun intended) But hey, at least I got all the time to (Audience: Do up all these posts?) sleep? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay I've slept enough let's get through the stuff I need to enjoy for this week.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:text-bottom"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title><br>ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Alice to Zouroku: </b>frazzle [Ëˆfraz(É™)l]; cause to shrivel up with burning. (If you need the definition, here you go haha)<br>The new episode (7) talks about the twins; remember those two who taught Sana-chan everything? Besides the fact that they got settled down after the incident, they also felt a sense of guilt. A sense of loss, for having taught Sana-chan everything despite their background before they were in the facility. Then again, Sana-chan has grown matured enough to forgive the two of them, so I guess... But still, many things got mentioned this episode. Ignoring the awesome stuff that is Ichijou-san again (hahaha MVP liao this woman), Sana-chan feels unwell. Uncomfortable, for some reason. And as Sanae-chan has mentioned, she is starting to understand the things around her. Which, by the way for us, is the things called life. I may feel somehow parallel to her too when she says math is too easy but other emotional, unpredictable things she cannot get. Because that's probably me when I was young too, being good at logical stuff and sucking at the rest. Regardless, this has given us somewhat a hint of what may come next (we don't need that <a href=https://www.alicetozouroku.com/special/spinoff_comics/ target=_blank>spinoff manga</a> to show us schoolgirl Sana, really), and I'm still waiting for that cliffhanger somehow. Well, better not let our guard down; this show has given us a lot to think about. A comeback, perhaps? But honestly saying, I'm enjoying the lack of action thus far. Okay, there's Ichijou, but... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgye19cbzL5f4rPYTzfiD9lcNb-H5DLucwdugVMCBAuWi_acripPrzAXsSPiribdxXQjAdZ_H0p8jLtE1ceNMI2UHWdqZE7rTC8QzPwBDW9NxyuyxByKoeHdjHbMy48wzxuPuRlfPkiMe1l/s320/alicezouroku07_sana.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when my mom wants me to have lunch with her friends whom I don't know lol</table>P.S. MVP I don't want to choose. The twins had a lot for me to think about, so I say everyone then. Well, everyone female. Sorry, Zouroku. Maybe next episode haha<br>P.P.S. You can make your own profile icon with an overlay of "Dreams of Alice" from the official website! No, I'm not joking. I just noticed my face is too big that the thing will block me so I didn't do it lol<br><br><b>Tsuki ga Kirei:</b> And this is what I call a date! Okay, the area of effect is big, but still.<br>The new episode (7) talks about an amusement park trip, or shall I say, an event deliberately to settle things straight. Let's not talk about what happened, but suffice it to say Koutarou made it clear. Directed at Hira-kun, for starters. And indirecly at Chinatsu and the rest of the group, of course. Needless to say their secret is let out, but then again they got the rest of the day together. Chinatsu was probably more assertive in getting Koutarou to be more informal to her in name at least, but I guess it didn't work on that blockhead haha. Then again, when Koutarou has balls he really does it, like letting the cat out of the bag and stuff. Still, as mentioned earlier, to settle things here is actually vitally important, even though the aftereffect now is that the whole class will know. No really Roman, we don't need an excuse to get lost together haha. On a side note, Akanecchi will no doubt say sorry to her friend, and Hira-kun is right to not be... feeling anything for Chinatsu's arrangement. His infatuation will always stay as so, it seems.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdJLXPcabA2kmt7JzMzcsBcLdimrKuE2wa_m94IdzrWE26F-Gt0BxAQVJKMNXmH21CHcOErfXkEdLFe33-1sfGm1XBW91yJEBsGV1kVh_53-0fbkS3XTuuWhacEyRjrso-rvKjcT3Hy0Z-/s320/tsukigakirei07_hands.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>To not spoil you of the good stuff at the second half haha<br>"Don't take it too hard, Koutarou" I bet he is lol</table>P.S. MVP the couple of course. But then again can we just have a show where it's all dates? Or kisses? Or kids interrupting kisses? Haha when are they going to make out<br>P.P.S. Yes I have to talk about the short stories at the end. Let's see... Sakura's fantasies are like that laugh from Nagahara at the end (lol) and Ryouko-sensei is real popular. Among everyone, it seems. Hey, you can't beat her you follow her, as they say.<br><br><b>Eromanga-sensei:</b> Hey my sensor just detected a tsundere, ladies and gentlemen. Very affirmative signal coming from Sagiri-chan. No mistakes about it. Detection time stamp around when target mentioned "<u>It's not like</u> I asked because I was interested or anything" haha (And that's how you do smart phrase detection people. I'm an engineer lol)<br>The new episode (8) talks about more of the couple, and specifically, what happened after the heck of a confession from Muramasa and the competition result. Then again, all is well, so I shouldn't talk too much about that. The authors hung out for a party at Masamune's place, and it went out well I suppose. All in all, a peaceful episode. Even the ending theme song this episode seem to suggest that. Well, I'll take it, peaceful and everything. I can't take eroticism every other episode anyway haha Elf-sensei is pushing it too much lol<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgusT1AhPpswGtsb-3fQZ_81o153i8PdgpedMXPSCIj3TZME7a8IEjXeFzO5kuo37SeeWgV4bQhB3a-pPDc6oR1wjR_DxhDAE9_ihkeTEUF4RVhkElxXyRNLp9wI91PUFInmCyO-ZmN9TGn/s320/eromangasensei08_kuroneko.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Highlight of the episode, literally.<br>Yes, this is a cameo of Kuroneko from the author's previous work "Oreimo",<br>and voiced by Kana-chan herself. Brings back memories already.</table>P.S. The other author no one cares this week is voiced by none other than Nakamura Yuuichi. Very familiar, isn't it? I thought so too.<br><br><b>Attack on Titan S2: </b>Hell yeah if it's any kind of hell, even if it's mental hell. You two jerks deserve it for ending many human family lines, that's for sure.<br>The new episode (34, two more this season) talks about... talking. Among the human titans. Hey, it's not like they get to do it as seen from their own circumstances, surrounded by titans and injured or whatnot. Still, there isn't much Eren is able to get out of the two considering his temperament, but Ymir. She's using her brain. Then again, she seems to know more about the identities of the monkey-like Titan who is causing trouble, and is at this point pretty much blackmailed by Reiner on Christa's safety. Damn, if I don't give any sh*t about drama, but that was some development to say the least. The others are going to reach by sunset, so fights are going to be inevitable. But suddenly it's going to be Eren against three titans already, so that doesn't sound like good news. Interestingly, it also sets plot for a couple more outcomes from this season concerning Ymir I suppose, but that we shall see. Expect more action next episode; this one is real boring I swear.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiuak9lBqFNzInFH-GTuGWyq4YUDyyJSUXcYyun6JKcUHWHd0pldIL4FO89KL5BslBFEN5UfqimaTP7fF3pR_4llk7kx7X6pXmlkvDTq-I_rJ9pUCF4VuuX7h3PM0MJUa5_hcabAe4uHn5/s320/attackontitans34_formation.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>As everything is too weird to show, let's see some horse formation!<br>Damn, this looks cool lol</table>P.S. Turns out there's an hour before the rest come in, so maybe these four will have to fight it out, I guess. That's next episode apparently. Okay, maybe not fight; the two are planning to run already.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:text-bottom"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span class=head-title><br>MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Dagashi Kashi:</b> The new chapter (61) talks about the soft glider, and if you hadn't played one of these before OR you didn't have a childhood (lol) it's like paper planes, but these are foam ones, fly much further easily and are definitely more durable. I haven't heard of the slingshot version of it before (I guess I wasn't old/young enough), but seeing Tou-kun screw up is a joy haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=651 data-original-width=756 height=275 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgadtbgqSI1xl7NqSnsxqARxz71IljDHsVWlpBCblq68HvLt2EZpnD4buWVmVk43SrZdLHD0d1aLckaa62fqaEB1LUBq5ODQkwFuYmfO1_t80inIZL2CqPEwPkFxBfBGeM4bCOqLa59DBzK/s320/ddsks61_img000002.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Here is an example of Tou-kun hitting it in his face<br>Probably also me the first time I threw one of those things haha</table><b>A Channel:</b> Lol it took me half the chapter to notice it was a flashback haha. The omake chapter (94.5) talks about Yuuko taking care of her sister Keiko (thus the nickname "Kei") back then when they are younger, and Yuuko wanting to make her sis some food. Yeah, I thought it was the sister being bad at cooking, but turns out we're on the journey to seeing Yuuko learn how to make good food, considering she doesn't know anything about it back then. And yes, it's not the usual 4-koma format, which is always fresh considering this is more immersive in some sense, without that much jokes.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=680 data-original-width=314 height=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1WroywHCSo2I3d7mni7xG32ub4n2wV5AYGHtcDaNL4dRVNlnI020EXwhzAxuxp_Z0bc5fQHftwetlW8YFF5qDlqRR7gGWFRc2tyPxoQIYU6TbdbEG1vjLDn6J0upxV5bga2tGC0CuNkso/s320/a-ch945_img000007.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=147><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If anyone can figure out why this is the case please do tell haha<br>Man, kid Yuuko isn't good at cooking</table><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title><br>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>As mentioned last week, this week welcomes a whole lot of releases from this season's Anime theme songs. <b>TrySail's new single</b> is pretty good I guess, and I mean good enough to be on my shelf. Well, it's the B-side as usual anyway, but I'll talk about that next week, yes? Review soon. <b>Touyama Nao's 2nd single</b> is quite okay, considering it's heavily tied to Anime and we know who writes the songs (I'll talk more if I heard of the third track that is the B-side) (yesh it's a double A-side), so... <b>ORESAMA's new single</b> is turning out pretty well, but thank goodness it wasn't enough for me to give all three songs, just two. Actually with some more brainwashing I probably can give, but no I didn't haha. <b>toi toy toi's new single</b> is... I mean, I just took the topic song, so I won't talk more about it. Also yeah, there's <b>Shinsei Kamatte-chan's latest single</b>. But we don't talk about that at all. I mean, did you even watch the live video?<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en>Is it just me or does the vocalist sound... gay? Oh whatever.<br><br>Shinsei Kamatte-chan live though. Quite interetsing. <a href=https://t.co/iB11NjyqtP target=_blank>https://t.co/iB11NjyqtP</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href=https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/868451531078606848 target=_blank>May 27, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset=utf-8 src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><br>And in case you want to correct me from last week, yes <b>Aki-chan's single is next week</b>. I know. It took about... a day after last week's post to notice that haha actually it's like when I didn't receive an email of my order on last Tuesday lol<br><br>Before we talk about next week, let's talk about... two weeks ago? <b>Sambomaster's new album</b> is around but I haven't got the time to review it, so that's next week. Meanwhile, <b>Komatsu Mikako's new album</b> is up for grabs, with me giving songs here and there. But that's it. Here, and there. Not any more.<br><br>Next week (finally) welcomes Aki-chan's new single which I'll be ready to do a review for (it'll not be with TrySail though), so that's that. Otherwise... yeah there's Sambomaster's album. Oh yeah, I also delayed <b>miwa's new single</b> a listen too, considering first impressions aren't great. But still, anything I'll do for a regular artist in Klassic Note, yes? We shall see.<br><br><br>This is it then. Not that I've got anything after this week already, but then I'd like some more time for myself. For exercise (probably), and for my personal definition of freedom: doing whatever I like. So that includes Klassic Note 10th anniversary posts (which I'll do an introductory post soon starting next month, so stay tuned) and APoL (goddamn does thinking through an arc prove quite a task) and many much more. Well, sorting out stuff and playing games are also part of it, so... hehe. Cya guys next time then, and until next time... I'm mentally fine. Well, not without the pressure ahead of course. Still, I got holidays to go through. I'll be making the most of it, for sure.<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
