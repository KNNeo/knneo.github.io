Well, that old freak definitely think Jean's a dick for being honest in front of him. Nonetheless, we learn of some history, how someone's parents died in an accident (ah, so stereotypical), how someone was a district chief before, and how we still don't know what the heck of a coupe is happening at all. In other places, Mauve also called upon other officers of ACCA to check out stuff for her (I mean, "Jean is so useless" haha), despite Jean having lack of any interest of helping in investigations. I mean, up until now we are dealing with an honest guy here, people. I'm still believing in that. Although I may not be so sure. I mean, they hinted how great transport is in the ACCA system, so we shall see for ourselves next week? Oh please don't kill the main guy; Lotta-chan will have to take over then haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UudFPytnD9A/WKRZEJzVmJI/AAAAAAAAeIs/jAZZs8Fttsgh7UyvtcD3BLFH51YVxhRwwCLcB/s320/acca06_walking.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I should just show you guys a GIF of the weirdest animation I've seen ever.<br />Even 3D models would have been better?</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. That idiot thinks an old man wants a piece of Lotta-chan. Really, may he remain an idiot. Also, the prince too.<br />P.P.S. That Lilium guy's got balls, I must say. Well, as one of the Five I shouldn't be surprised. But damn Grossular got hit hard. Then again, it is to find out the truth, so he wins.<br /><br /><b>Sangatsu no Lion:</b> It's sad, in many ways. But hey, BIRTHDAY EPISODE!! Damn, I'm hyped lol<br />This new episode (18) talks about the next Lion King Tournament match. Yeah, Shimada against the legend. And if I said the challenger won I must be joking. Then again, it's the struggle, I guess. It's hard, man. To lose on tournaments. I mean, I'm no shougi enthusiast but I can see it's hard. Harder than what Nikaidou and the other one are fighting about lol. On other things, the teacher is really Kiriyama's saviour and he should be thankful (really I'm like the teacher living off a good life since when I was born haha) for being helped despite being in a survival situation and not progressing much besides school haha. Also, Hina-chan finally popped the question on who's that witch (lol) and got an answer. But yeah, they don't fit as siblings. Kiriyama and Kyouka. Besides, the guy is doing his stepdad a favour, so that is that. (F**king son of a b**ch haha)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4w5OM8furcY/WKkFe-02OtI/AAAAAAAAeJo/wy3FkB4ECSIrCZCrVSBI3hIZ1eL_w7ksgCEw/s1600/sangatsunolion18_teacher.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4w5OM8furcY/WKkFe-02OtI/AAAAAAAAeJo/wy3FkB4ECSIrCZCrVSBI3hIZ1eL_w7ksgCEw/s320/sangatsunolion18_teacher.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Lol the teacher is always to desperate but rejected by students.<br />He is a saviour to Kiriyama btw, helping him skip attendance and all that.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Hina-chan as MVP this episode, I guess. Okay, the teacher gets second in this one haha<br />P.P.S. And I'm like "what should a middle schooler and elementary schooler have as guests" as I looked at what he took out of the fridge, and I was right. Warmed up milk. Another life lesson for you guys living alone out there.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>Êº´Áîª</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>Nah, not watching new movies. Planning to though. Someday. I mean, I rather sleep more, so... haha,<br />Just move on already, would you?<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Okay, this one. This week brings a couple of releases I have been waiting for a while I guess (well there will be more next week), and I start with <b>SCANDAL's new best album</b> (I say "new" because it's not their first) and it's... I'll say I have given one of the two new songs as a greeting (if you get what I mean, and I'm still trying to give a couple more, so we shall see. I've given a good number of songs and rejected some of them too, but hey, that is up to me. <b>Yonezu Kenshi's new single</b> is also here after a wonderful pre-release review spree last week haha, and this one I must say isn't impressive, but I still liked the topic song though. If it sticks well as an Anime theme song then I hope he gets more. This guy can write songs, I would say that much.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Some may say this isn't as good as its predecessors, but I must say I like it.<br /><br />Also Anime Sangatsu no Lion ending. <a href="https://t.co/m7WJCmqG1Z" target="_blank">https://t.co/m7WJCmqG1Z</a></div>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/833122698964316160" target="_blank">February 19, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />Next week brings us another week of album spree, which are namely <b>Goose house, Hanazawa Kana and miwa</b>, and it's not in the order of expectations or hype or whatever. Next week also brings us two other new singles which are <b>amazarashi</b> and that awesome Anime ACCA opening theme song (from <b>ONE III NOTES</b>) that I've been waiting for... Hmph! As you can see, many releases, only that much time to listen to haha. At least I know next week's going to be great. Coupled with the fact that my new monthly mobile data subscription has been brought up a notch I can use the help of Apple Music to help me get a headstart. YES! Klassic Note now is so much more awesome with some form of heads up haha<br /><br />P.S. <b>ONE III NOTES, as revealed early in the week, consists of</b> Takahashi Ryou (composer of the Anime and the theme songs) as producer and composer, PON from ORESAMA (the band's lead singer) as singer, and Foggy-D (this guy is independent) as MC/rapper, as you hear from the rap. I wish I could find a translation of the profile, but you'll have to take my word for it haha<br />P.P.S. Which also explains (somehow, from Twitter) why I mentioned about reviewing ORESAMA sometime soon. I guess so, after next week. Or maybe before the release boom next week.<br /><br /><br />I guess that's it. I've had a wonderful dinner with my family WHICH I PAID FOR (that's what happens when you start working, kids) but I enjoyed myself anyways, so that's fine. Cya guys next week then, and as always, take care. I'm living pretty well considering my colleagues who sit beside me have taken MC and I haven't haha. Oh well, this better last until my internship is over.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
