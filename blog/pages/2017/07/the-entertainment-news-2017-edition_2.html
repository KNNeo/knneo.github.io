Sorry for the last post, guys. I spent too much time on Cities: Skylines that I forgot to get out of it.<br /><br />Oh no one cares? Well, read on then. I don't really care too haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Alice to Zouroku: </b>Wow what an ending. I guess all's well ends well in this fantastic show. I mean, it's magic after all haha<br />The final episode (12) concludes on the two lost in Wonderland (literally). They surface, managed to find that rabbit to contact the outside world, and guess who came to save them. I know, Ayumu was literally cheating right here haha. Then again, the world shows all sorts of insights into an existence of an alternate world, as narrated by the ending of this series. And finally, Naito has decided to allow the government (specifically the police) to announce on Dreams of Alice so that more people can be saved, other than Hatori, to not feel segregated with human society. But of course, Sana-chan probably got it worst because she started with the least exposure to the human world (I mean, the twins aren't even born from Wonderland) because she was created there, and thus is the likely "true embodiment" of Alice, as mentioned. So yeah, Sana-chan may just have seen a figment of her future. Remember that cool woman? All in all, an interesting series and quite an insight to a less conflicting, more consoling depiction of the existence of such a magical world. But hey, I'm even more glad to have watched it. Already soaked in "tearbath" by the time Hatori went home to see her parents. So... if you haven't been watching this show I tell you it's arguably the best new show of the season (ie. excluding sequels), and this really makes me want to know more. Maybe I should read the manga then.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YJ2Gq79TU_I/WVY7hDho56I/AAAAAAAAgdc/Eoc_yVVOWJEm9ofQH52Fv7QJaUrAjrG4wCLcBGAs/s320/alicezouroku12_sana.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I'll leave the ending ending for you guys to guess, so here's kid Sana-chan.<br />Haha she got scolded to not take off her shoes<br />(I mean, it's not even THE entrance) (I know, I'll get scolded hard lol)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Rabbit MVP!!! Yah okay, I'm just joking. But still, that rabbit is stupid haha<br />P.P.S. The real MVP this episode is... everyone, I guess. Hatori threw away her agitated character, Sana-chan saw the light of being human (I guess?), Zouroku reminds us of gratefulness as virtue, Sane-chan is as cute as ever (hehe I just wanted to say), Ichijou is badass even without putting up a fight, and Naito is the hidden hero. Thanks to him, the world might just become a better place. Well, at least, in the Anime. I mean, it's probably chaos in the original work, but we shall see. And I WILL NOT talk about adult Sana-chan over here haha<br />(Edit: Okay so there isn't translated manga after all. BORING!! lol)<br /><b><br /></b><b>Demi-chan wa Kataritai OVA: </b>Wow didn't expect this one, and didn't expect it to be this good. Hehe I'd like you guys to give it a watch yourself to have the best experience.<br />The special episode (13) aired on TV for some reason, discusses about patrolling in summer festival within their area, and yeah, besides Takahashi-sensei who had to be in it, there's voluntary Satou-sensei who just wanted to show the guy in her yukata, the demi-chans who had a blast "pranking" others, the classmates who are indirectly the targets including Hikari's sister Himari, and thanks to the bear suit guy we know Takahashi likes to date with festival mascots lol. All in all a funny episode, and yeah I'll say it here because Himari MVP for sure (I like girls who are scared of ghosts apparently lol), and this makes of a fun yet awesome offset to the seriousness that is the main series itself.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8bvLfHpFrLU/WVZDV8KBZTI/AAAAAAAAgds/RkeEZ8VuETgFZbCjO_i-K1VLRZoL49z-wCLcBGAs/s320/demichan13_mascot.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sure is weird being dragged along by the mascot lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. WHAT THE FREAK was with the ending?? Haha, I mean, you can watch it yourself, but suffice it to say this is no guarantee of a second season of Anime at any point, yes? Takahashi-sensei can only imagine seeing an invisible person after all. (oops)<br />P.P.S. And today knowing who voices that vampire of a girl (Hondo Kaede, thanks to <a href="https://lp.alterna.amebagames.com/character/" target="_blank">the game I play</a>&nbsp;(you can't understand Japanese anyway) she was introduced as a new character) is just making the watch of this episode more tantalising. I mean, between <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20170520/19/hondo-kaede/86/93/j/o0960054013941781955.jpg" />Hondo Kaede</abbr> and <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://demichan.com/assets/img/in/chara/02_hikari/img_main.png" />Takanashi Hikari</abbr> and <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lp.alterna.amebagames.com/pc/images/character/13-body2.png" />Kira Sayuri</abbr> which one will I choose?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span><br /><br />(DON'T LET ME SAY "ALL OF THEM"!!! HAHA <a href="http://randomc.net/2017/06/30/demi-chan-wa-kataritai-13/comment-page-1/#comment-2280095" target="_blank">my comment on RC</a> is literally what's above lol)<br /><br /><b>Tsuki ga Kirei: </b>Okay not to spoil you guys on anything, but Koutarou got in to a public school. With Chinatsu in it. Oops.<br />The final episode (12) concludes on this story (because I just noticed this is an original Anime lol) about the couple, how Akanecch is still stuck with emotions of jealousy and doubting her partner and Koutarou being... indirect as usual, in conveying his feeling to his partner. All in all, what has happened in the whole of this series. Let us be reminded that, despite this being the reality of their relationship, they still managed to pull it off time after time, through coincidences (thanks, God-sama) and everyone around them. I must say, tears will not be able to express how much I liked this series. (I'll never use the word "love" as I have never, so forgive me) That first love feeling and being together is portrayed really well, and it's not like I have any experience to prove it, but seeing as this is also popular unto itself, I expect so. Man, I can't wait to have my own experience. I mean, I failed at the confession part already, so... I guess sincerity is important. And reporting to the wife about things around you too, it seems. Oops, I said too much. I'll leave the show in your hands if you still are watching, because there really isn't another Anime I'll watch that will capture the feel of this show. First time romance, it's awesome. Pity that I'll not be experiencing that again in the future. (I mean, the "miracle" of someone liking you back didn't happen anyway)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y4Af27lVcS4/WVZW_nrbR_I/AAAAAAAAgd8/WBwPqiAUtUQURQdkPAMPu3ceHIT38YGQgCLcBGAs/s320/tsukigakirei12_snow.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Just in case you don't know what after-effects mobile camera app SNOW is.<br />Haha Akanecchi looks so cute in this</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Akanecchi looks terrible when she cries lol I know it's the animation team not her fault it's Koutarou that jerk haha<br />P.P.S. I don't want to blame him personally, but things would have been resolved if he took the step to explain/hear explanations. For example, this episode. He could've chased after Akanecchi to either ask why she feels this way and should he then tell her about everything to not make her worry, or tell her that he doesn't know she feels this way and ask for forgiveness, and most importantly, assurance. I mean, writing it on a online novel is one thing man. This? Ugh. (It's okay I don't have the balls to even ask a girl out anyway haha)<br /><br />And since <b>NEXT SEASON</b> is coming, let's talk about it. (mouse over Anime titles for images)<br /><br />I refer you to <a href="http://randomc.net/2017/06/24/summer-2017-preview/comment-page-1/#comment-2279273" target="_blank">my comment on Random Curiosity</a> (if you still don't know what that is, get out) from a couple of days ago. I don't care if they are late or not or if you had or hadn't checked out the new Anime next season, I'm here to talk about it. As written, <b>I WILL BE WATCHING</b> <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202017%20Preview/ahogirl.jpg" /><b>Aho Girl</b></abbr>&nbsp;(starring Yuuki Aoi making stupid jokes haha), <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202017%20Preview/tsuredure.jpg" /><b>Tzurezure Children</b></abbr>&nbsp;(I see it's a more focused romance story on the individual pairs) and <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202017%20Preview/gamers.jpg" /><b>Gamers</b></abbr>&nbsp;(just because it has games? I don't know). Of course the usual three-episode rule applies, and if I hate it before any of them airs next week I'll be sure to tell. On other Anime, <b>I MAY BE WATCHING</b> <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202017%20Preview/koiuso.jpg" /><b>Koi to Uso</b></abbr>&nbsp;(starring Hanazawa Kana-chan, may feature ecchi scenes but not as extreme as Kuzu no Honkai as I hear of) and I'll not be watching Konbini Kareshi. I mean, the animation's not even good. So yeah, that's pretty much it.<br /><br />(Edit: Hondo Kaede is in Koi to Uso?? I'M IN! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>)<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Dagashi Kashi: </b>Surprise! The new chapter (65) talks about the first part of the last episode of the Anime, and yes it's just girls talk <strike>not yuri love</strike>. Love is bittersweet, they say, and so is that cherry dagashi. Coincidence? Well, for the story of course it is haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="333" data-original-width="435" height="244" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Otbkn-Jano/WVkBKe5mn7I/AAAAAAAAgg0/lZlB-KRC1j0TYu0CX9ytEoyhrLWY_tgYQCLcBGAs/s320/img000003.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">It's as weird as the Anime, I promise haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>So this week we have finally the long awaited release, I'm not joking. <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music127/v4/48/b8/95/48b895e8-29e3-23b1-7ed3-2f9d8d9d53d5/source/268x0w.jpg" /><b>LILI LIMIT's new EP</b></abbr> was... fairly alright I suppose, but not what I expected, so that's joining the first EP they released last year lol. On other things, you should've noticed I have been listening to <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music127/v4/a1/0a/de/a10ade8f-67a8-b0a3-9ff4-0c999dfd58b3/source/268x0w.jpg" /><b>mol-74's new mini-album</b></abbr>, and it actually sounds really good. I'd like to compare it to 'plenty' who recently ended their journey <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> but still, it feels similar. Also, <abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music117/v4/84/88/b2/8488b26c-e46c-4901-32b1-c2de83e65bfa/source/268x0w.jpg" /><b>TWEEDEES' new mini-album</b></abbr> finally appeared, and I did give a song or two, in case taking clothing off mannequins isn't enough for you to take a listen haha<br /><br />Next week? I don't know man. Maybe I need to be reminded of whatever if any, because I really am drawing blanks right now. July is going to be quiet month in Klassic Note, I guess. But I did listen to a live performance from Scenarioart which wasn't great (I mean, seriously), a couple of rock festival videos to top it up (nothing new to pick up there), and I seriously didn't know 'The Floor' had a new release. Which also reminds me I haven't watched Aki-chan's live tour yet. Well, I'm saving that for before the best album. You bet I'm going to have the best experience considering I'll have plenty of time for it because I'm still on holiday-<br /><br />Okay, better not mention too much haha<br /><br /><br />This is it then. Cya guys next week, and until next time... how was APoL Chapter 16? Like it? I know, it's real messy though, but when you try to write your life into part of a created story it's not that easy lol<br /><br />P.S. <a href="http://rq-award.jp/news/1917/" target="_blank">Congrats Tachibana "Futon-chan" Haru for winning the No.1 Race Girl in Japan</a>.
