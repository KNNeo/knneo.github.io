Uh oh: (It's) "Issue 52 liao". Does that mean the year is over?<br /><br />Also uh oh: I'm back from a long day and I don't think I can clear all the Anime tonight. I'll see about it.<br /><br />Good, I cleared it, so here I am. Sadly, this is already going to be late, so sorry to anyone or whatever. Let's do this. And no, the year is not over until I say so. Or at least, until I get the new song rankings up haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Just Because!:</b> So wait, once you get accepted means you cannot change your choice? Or you can take and pass as many entrance exams and just choose one? Haha sorry not Japanese student so I have no idea<br />The new episode (11) is the most cliffhanger of episodes in this series, so sit tight. Almost forgetting that the two are applying for different colleges (universities), I always thought Eita and Natsume will meet each other in the same place, so yeah, I was wrong, and for quite some time haha. The focus this time, after being done with Souma and Morikawa, focuses back on the main trio. From the intro, Komiya clearly doesn't want an answer if she can (even if she wins the competition she wants the other two to be together), Eita wants to pass the exam so he can confess to Natsume who he thinks doesn't like him at all with all the rejection stuff in previous episodes (if you have been following closely), and Natsume wants to pass the exam to the school Eita got accepted into so that... hey, I'll leave the inner tsundere in her, but suffice to say yes this will also lead to confession. Not to go crazy about this, but below is therefore (I swear I thought of this before the ending part) my <u>analysis of this situation</u>, and I'll split them to a YES and a NO, former for accepted/won competition and the latter for otherwise. So, [long post warning] from worst to best ending, if (1) the plot is going for worst ending, it's that all of them are NO, which means all of them won't confess, even Komiya, who desperately want to even if the other two aren't going to. Then if (2) the plot is going for bittersweet happy ending ie. someone's going to feel sad because of the other two or otherwise, is that all of them are YES, meaning Komiya gets to confess, Natsume too, but will find out Eita also got to another different college which will suck, and chances are Komiya will get the jump. And probably with some struggle (if the last episode has that much space for that) Komiya will lose out in the end with the reunion of the other two. And yes, I'm assuming Komiya never gets the win in all cases btw. Lastly, if (3) the plot is going for full-on happy ending with little resolution needed, then the girls are YES, and Eita is NO. This means the two entrance exam takers will be together and Komiya will exclude her need to confess and be confessed. And I'm assuming the same if Komiya is the otherwise too. Whether I'll be right next week? The final episode? Natsume's sister has a better idea than me probably haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VhDMJVEKmSo/Wj38pIaIW3I/AAAAAAAAj2o/xdYXlcPR-bcjalgG0zsXNus0TXCyMqpAACLcBGAs/s320/justbecause11_sister.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The sister's impersonation of Natsume is perfect haha #siblingstuff</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. The animation man, is at its peak worst this episode where Souma and Eita walk down the stairs. Looks like a game glitch with a super-high flight of stairs for some reason lol. On the other hand, the best part is where <strike>the two look (at each other, I guess) out into the scenery seemingly for each other</strike> they write on the exam paper literally the best the animation team can do hehe the soundtrack's amazing btw good job yanaginagi<br />P.P.S. Oh wait, it's 2018 already in the story?? *thinks for a moment* Oh it's so they can replay it until the sponsorship is over? I see... haha<br />[OMAKE!!!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-43MI75W1YZE/Wj3-EUQ0dwI/AAAAAAAAj20/HxjwFtelCKsbDStz8cKAkhwrXKCjfsszACLcBGAs/s1600/justbecause11_bropat.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I need a bro tap like this every once in a while tbh</td></tr></tbody></table>I'll leave the other meme thing for my Facebook feed it's getting empty lol]<br /><br /><b>Houseki no Kuni: </b>"I'm jealous of my old self" To be honest, Phos? I liked your old self. You now is serious as heck hehe<br />The final episode of this series (12) is not an ending. It's an ending, for an Anime adaptation. Because why? There is no resolution. As shown last week, there is a truth to discover, but there's no result. There's conspiracies among the many beings that live in this world and that moon, but there's no conflict. So what now? Of course this is an easy pitch to let you guys go read the original work, but for me who just watches the adaptation I feel cheated, like some other shows in the past. Leaving it dangling, failing to achieve a result or a state of point we all can be happy to conclude on (unlike for example, slice-of-life shows which can just end with a field trip <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Gamers), I feel unsatisfied. Which is not a good thing. I will not mention how lack of content to signify any ending this episode has, but I would still like to compliment what it has shown us thus far. But for the production and animation design to go this far without seeing any future, I feel unfair for them. I don't know if this will get a season two, but if it does, it'll be more exciting than ever. Even so, I'm glad to have taken this journey. So thanks anyway, Anime. I wished it ended on a different note though.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MQ6hXCNo4kQ/Wj-cp-Fu3RI/AAAAAAAAj4I/q3M3-JYki9ILBZYqRo36jCPLxr4MhCZHgCLcBGAs/s320/housekinokuni12_phos.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I miss happy-go-lucky Phos.

Very typical of a slice-of-life Anime series so I won't comment on that further, but we learnt a lot. We actually also reached some form of conclusion of the manager Dino wanting to confess his love to Maika-chan even though I think we noticed he did that in the first episode already tbh. Other than that, I still liked the jokes (original or not, because this can be Anime original) from that ski trip, it's good to know of the story before Maika was in the cafe for sure (I mean, they didn't explain how Dino didn't get caught by police before dragging Mafuyu in lol), and all is well with that cross-dress freak. I mean, did you hear that Anime character song? Uh, just a reminder it'll be with the video release in the near future lol. Anyways, this show is great, I had a lot of laughs, it ended better than I thought it would, and all is well in Stile cafe. I mean, if this show didn't make you laugh I don't know what will.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qaRac4Of7TQ/Wj-mjh4d7qI/AAAAAAAAj4c/ZH-QjaWegE8e0a3B3iNj-g6kKHnolbMywCLcBGAs/s320/blends12_poke.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>"... And then, there was anal."</i><br /><br />(Haha yes I didn't get it wrong Hideri was not a female)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. *saw ending* Okay that is one too much of deja vu from the first episode. We get it Anime, so let it go okay??<br />P.P.S. Last one - one bad and one good thing about this show. Bad, I suppose it's most likely me not getting used to Dino <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_spoken_Japanese" target="_blank">speaking with a feminine Japanese form</a> ie. using "watashi" and "desu" and so on, because it kind of bugged me but still forgiving as he's a foreigner anyway, so whatever. Good, I suppose I would like to thank the newbie cast that is Waki Azumi (voices Maika), Kitou Akari (voices Kaho) and Haruno Anzu (voices Mafuyu) for the wonderful theme songs. You girls are half the reason I'm watching this series. The other half is just the perfect production combo between A-1 Pictures (animation) and Aniplex (music) because they can do any slice-of-life Anime right. Remember WORKING!!?<br /><br /><b>Sangatsu no Lion: </b>"A commemorative match with Souya Meijin?" I mean, you scared, bro?<br />The new episode (33) brings us a lot of joy, something seriously lacking in this show. And I thought they'll just bring me back in the ditch after halfway through the episode, but nope. It went all out. Firstly, Kiriyama wining the Newcomer Tournament. Then again, there's Shimada, the unwanted image of a winner in Kishou Tournament. Hey, what can I say? You have them pros, you get them pros. Shimada celebrates by drinking despite his bad stomach, and Kiriyama... just picked up a new habit of diary writing. But yeah, we always remember the happy stuff, and it's fun to write it down. Like this. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, we bring ourselves more focus on a couple of secondary characters, including bring-you-to-the-mountains-and-win-your-heart-over Gakuto-senpai, the school staff including two teachers, vice-principal and the principal lol, and last but not least, 3rd-year Noriguchi-sensei. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Never felt any more happier in this show, and I hope it'll last a bit longer. Well, not until we're reminded of that match between the main guys and that legend. Hey, gotta face it someday. Besides, it makes of good publicity anyways, so... do your best yes, Kiriyama?<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TgnA3lkJohA/Wj-ucCjUHRI/AAAAAAAAj4w/zWF5pLa2vvso9F-9dXXcxNZB1fT5S7ekwCLcBGAs/s320/sangatsunolion33_BL.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Did I say there was BL in this show? lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Wonder who voiced the most idol-like shougi player Gakuto? Look no further, for it is done by the one, the only, Ono Daisuke. Hey, cannot beat that awesomeness, you know. On the other hand, cannot beat that coolness, that Shimada haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>漫画</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>The new chapter (57) is... man, I don't want to spoil it for you, but yeah, Uchimaki cross-dressed again. Haha, for what reason I'll not reveal to the extent that the thumbnail below will not reveal anything, but I can talk about the recollection, to say the least. The school has a yearly club Miss Heroine contest it seems, and Usami ended up being the victim of her first year in the club, courtesy of the President for some reason. This time round, it's a two-fer, so we know who else will be included. Unfortunately, someone else we know is cheating. Accomplices too? Man, this is turning out to be some interesting competition to be honest. What happens next? Will Usami win the likes of the school faster than Uchimaki? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="207" data-original-width="217" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MzVJR83Lnvw/Wj3o8DfQWYI/AAAAAAAAj2U/sZJsCTXEs28DkK89TyAkPQ58Ezjr80wYwCLcBGAs/s1600/knb00009.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Deep inside me I wished I get slapped by girls every time I say something wrong lol</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Dagashi Kashi:</b> The new chapter (95) besides getting really on time regular, is focusing on a drink I have no idea about. Well, apparently it's some weird tasty cinnamon drink packaged to look good, but hey, I'll leave it to you to believe whether Sayashi or Hotaru is right about its taste and whatever feels that come with it lol I like how the author reminds us that Hotaru gets excited seeing people taste dagashi for the first time<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="258" data-original-width="653" height="157" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hrmKREWplCY/Wj-wKgqgJzI/AAAAAAAAj48/kL7UxrlWN5AlitdvvuVztkhmTNjz2Q1MACLcBGAs/s400/dgs95_sayashi.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="400" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I always liked an image of Sayashi up close, so here you go hehe</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br />(Yep, it's been some time for this segment, and I'm experimenting for next year's news <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span>)<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>映画</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MOVIE</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Kuroshitsuji ~Book of the Atlantic~</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">"2 Days Later" Yeah just in case you didn't notice they said the meeting's on the 19th and they mentioned the date of departure for the ship like, twice haha</blockquote>Hey, it took some time, for many things since the premier of this movie since the last Anime season two years ago, but yeah, I'm glad to have caught it by the end of the year. And what a movie. Firstly, I congratulate on Aniplex (the animation company) for blending 3DCG appropriately (if you didn't notice, the ship, camera angles which they could've done a dozen 2D camera angles of) with 2D animation to a fine degree (and I've watched a 3DCG Anime this season) to make everything from plot to action scenes very palatable and awesome, to some extent. I won't spoil too much on story, but the movie nailed everything possible. Considering this is the second arc I've read the original material of (the circus arc is the first), I'm impressed in the amount of detail they can squeeze in 100 mins of video, and for that, I salute them. Secondly, let's talk about what's fun about the plot. In a nutshell, Ciel receives orders from Lan, his business friend, that weird things are happening in the dealing with medicine in a certain hospital, from a formed occult society famed to create advances in medicine. Problem is, it involves death. It's hard to wonder for anyone who knows of this series (and those who don't as much) whether it'll involve more people who will deal with that, and many deaths are going to occur. I'm not as crazy as those movie death count websites (lol), but be assured no humans are harmed during the making of this animation haha. Lastly, scenes to take note. Since I won't spoil anything much besides telling you what's about to happen, I'll just spoil those that I like. Elizabeth is pretty much MVP in my opinion when she's with Ciel (I'll leave you to figure out, unless I mentioned in a previous Entertainment News long ago already), Undertaker's real identity is the coolest part of this show and is also probably the only thing that got me more excited to remember that this was also an action series (no really, this is not in the mystery/fantasy genre only FYI), and I'm glad the production did remember to give most of the focus (not that I'd like to watch it again because they've done it multiple times in vague) to the history of Ciel and his butler Sebastian. Although I've read the latest of the manga I won't say otherwise. You know, like whether Lizzy actually knows of both of the Ciels. Okay, I said too much. This movie is overall as spectacular as the time the ship "Campaina" left the docks, and ended as beautifully as that very ship sank. Good job, everyone. This is making Yana-chan-sensei proud. Hey, I would if I'm her. She's the Anime version of J.K.Rowling already imo<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KNPvmXoQtbA/Wj4ce2VQlZI/AAAAAAAAj30/1uxdXju_Ohk-SyDiliXSq6ZOwhFAOJc-gCLcBGAs/s320/bookofatlantic_1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Spoiler-free salutes to whoever made this movie possible.<br />Also, whoever remembered to include Tanaka-san haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I've expected it. She has delivered. Thanks Tamura Yukari-san for the role of Lizzy. I never would have guessed you'll do this well. As expected of a veteran, I assume. *giggles like Lizzy* (Also, I pity those who cannot appreciate her role; I just didn't expect Yukarin to get <i>this</i> good)<br />P.P.S. Once again, I hope the production of this movie noticed the potential of cutting all of the original story arcs into movies. Because if that is so, I'll have more epic animation to expect in the future. Also, international release please. I want people around me to know the awesomeness of this show too. (Well it's going to be tough considering Aniplex is under Sony Japan, but still)<br />[Okay, last one. I did mention the word "fine" in the review instead of "awesome" for animation because there are flaws that could easily be missed, and I decided to overlook them. Most notably in terms of time is where (spoiler alert) Ciel was on the rescue boat with Sebastian holding an oar. Yep, the oar wasn't moving up and down (to show floating on the boat) and Sebastian was most definitely not floating on air. So that's that. Otherwise, I'd not comment too much on animation quality. Period.]<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week also pretty much marks the last week of Klassic Note in 2017, so let's talk about what I ended up with. Firstly, I decided to give <b>Roy's first song</b> from Anime "Koi to Uso" because I waited for some proper release and it didn't come and I can't wait for next year with no future date. So, I went ahead this time, like the many other times I did. I mean, could've done it earlier tbh. Then, there's the albums I decided to give another chance on, and so I did. Well, for the most part. I gave up <b>amazarashi's new album</b> because I cannot take his style if he doesn't sing normally, I gave a couple from <b>negoto's new album</b> because I liked the melodies (seriously ignoring music style of course), and I took one from <b>Porno Graffitti's latest album</b> to remember what I really liked about them. That, and including my recent review of <b>GLIM SPANKY</b> will conclude my list this year, standing at a song count of... haha if I mentioned here who will read my report? Well no one does it anyway so whatever lol<br /><br />Talking about report, I'll try to do it ASAP so long as I can push out that Searching Stars Project over the holidays (I regret to report I haven't finished with Part 3 yet, sorry Christmas), and I'll be sure to give you all a surprise for this year's song awards. Not #KN10YEARS stuff, but something else. Be sure to stay tuned, wherever you are.<br /><br />In recent news mostly about new songs in the new year, <b>Taketatsu Ayana's new song preview</b> for Anime "Dagashi Kashi" is sounding fine, <b>my final review of the year</b> will be delayed up to the point of dangerously falling outside of the end date for this year (proposed next Wednesday on the 27th), and <b>SCANDAL has confirmed a new album</b> set to release on Valentines' Day to win back fans lol<br /><br /><br /><br />This is it, everyone. Enjoy your holidays if you aren't doing so, and I'll see you... next week? Yeah, we still have another week to go, nicely placed to end on a Sunday, so be sure to come back. Although next time round it'll be pretty much short because two Anime just concluded this week and I'll be busy doing up Klassic Note stuff so no more movies and... well, you know. Until next time, yes?<br /><br />P.S. To Fujita Akane's Christmas message of telling us to go back to our partners: "I have no one to go to, and you're my only one, Akane-chan." Is what I would like to Tweet in reply, but I better not. Besides, it's on Anime "Eromanga-sensei" Twitter anyway lol<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="ja">🎄メリークリスマス🎄<br />先日の放送後、藤田茜サンタからクリスマスメッセージをいただきました🎁！ <a href="https://t.co/uHzSXpOK3i" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/uHzSXpOK3i</a></div>— 俺妹&amp;エロマンガ先生 (@oreimo_eromanga) <a href="https://twitter.com/oreimo_eromanga/status/944586283828916227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">December 23, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">彼女がいないよ、おまえだけだよ</blockquote>Merry Christmas, everyone.<br /><br />P.P.S. On the upside, the best greeting I've seen (images aside, because everyone's posting selfies anyway) must be from Yuuki Aoi, but this one would require you to have a LINE account and add her as a friend. Because she sent her Christmas greetings "without the staff saying it for her", as mentioned by herself. How cute. Have a merry Christmas, Aoi-chan.
