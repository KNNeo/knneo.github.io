<h2 class="title">The Klassic Note "Searching Stars Project" Part 3</h2>
<div id="hashtags"></div>
<div class="header"></div>
I hope not to finish this during Christmas, so here we are. Happy Holidays, everyone. Hey, if you need an artist or two to listen to, why not try the list below? Try finding on this page for the word 'active' for starters haha<br /><br />Man, scrolling through this must be boring. You must be me in order to read through all this.<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span><br /><br />Okay, never mind. I intend to finish this anyway, so let's get it done and over with. In case you don't know what this is, I explore what all the artists that I've given at least a song to, are doing today.<br /><br />This project will exclude all new artists whom I've given in 2017. The list shall follow the one from Hall of Fame (<u>not in order</u>) (if you don't know that's a thing yet go to the&nbsp;<a href="http://klassicnote.strikingly.com/" target="_blank">Official Website</a>), and shall be done in the following 5W1H format: [unless stated otherwise, in square brackets]<br /><ul><li><b>Who</b>&nbsp;are they, in English/Romaji [in Japanese]</li><li><b>What</b>&nbsp;was their best impression thus far/back then [One Hit Wonder - only impression]</li><li><b>When</b>&nbsp;I started IN KLASSIC NOTE, and with what song/release</li><li><b>Where</b>&nbsp;did it get lost, if I did [Active Artist - constantly giving songs]</li><li><b>Why</b>&nbsp;I still care [One Hit Wonder - don't care; Disband/Retired/Graduated - gone before I can]</li><li><b>How</b>&nbsp;are they doing now: The good, the bad, and whatever applies to them as of 2017</li></ul>Lightning Rounds will only include the first and last point with the second point labelled as "One Hit Wonder" for simplicity. The Hall of Fame list will be updated on their status once each part is done, ie. strikeout on artist name to signify disbandment/inactive.<br />[*Information accurate as of 2017.12.25]<br /><br /><br /><br />HAPPY BIRTHDAY<br /><ul><li>Pop rock singing duo and band, singer-songwriters themselves</li><li>Their best impression is likely from the first single I reviewed "DAIKIRAI-DAISUKI"</li><li>Started from 2012, with Anime "Binbougami ga!" ending theme song "Koi Boudou"</li><li>It kind of got lost after I reviewed their 2013 album, but it's also likely because I couldn't get more (see below) even though I think their style is alright for pop songs</li><li>[Disbanded]</li><li>They have announced their disbandment in 2015, with their last album in 2014 and the total number of releases under major label countable with just one hand. Yeah.</li></ul>ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE<br /><ul><li>Three-piece rock band focusing on alternative rock and punk rock</li><li>Their best impression is likely still their first impression, followed by a close second from their first album "Forever" of the same title as the release</li><li>Started in 2012, with "Forget About It"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because they sing English songs for a bunch of Japanese artists - which is a rarity besides SpecialThanks which I'll touch on soon, and their style is good most of the time. Their punk style also doesn't deter me unlike many similar artists</li><li>They released their 2nd album in end 2016 which was pretty good, they collaborate with other English artists here and there too, they go by their short-handed name "ALT MED" (which is also the album title), and have been fairly active since I listened to them.</li></ul>SECONDWALL<br /><ul><li>(Sort of) indie rock band focusing on heavy styles including punk rock and melodic punk</li><li>Their best impression is from 2015 with album topic song "Identity"</li><li>Started in 2012 with unreleased (as in not in disc form) song "RESOUND"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I sort of care because I think they have potential. Knowing of them as an indie band from the start is encouraging, their album in 2015 is impressive, and now... I'm here and there as I struggle to give their songs. Only time will tell.</li><li>In 2017 they released their 3rd mini-album (which I did not review) and released a limited edition live only single later in the year. They have been fairly active since they announced their first mini-album back in 2013.</li></ul>Team.Nekokan [Neko]<br /><ul><li>Composer duo, sometimes singers, both are guys but write for Anime girls</li><li>Their best impression is likely their first composition (I wouldn't say it's sung by them)</li><li>Started in 2012 with Anime "Kokoro Connect" ending theme song "Kokoro no Kara featuring Amaoto Junka"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I don't really care because it's for Anime. Then again they are just composers, which goes to say their singing isn't as attractive or impressive as we would think. Still, they make good songs to say the least.</li><li>They are an independent composer group just like sasakure.UK and Q-MHz (they'll be covered soon, also they comprise of Anime composers which is kind of different) but focus on doujin works (ie. indie, sometimes rated, in local context) mostly which is shown after their full album release for Anime in 2013. In 2017 they released three separate singles for artists ranging from pop to vocaloid tunes (yes Hatsune Miku included)</li></ul>PHONO TONES<br /><ul><li>Four-piece instrumental group focusing on pop rock melodies</li><li>Their best impression is likely from their first mini-album, even though I'm not biased to any of them</li><li>Started in 2012 with "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION" music "The World Is Yours"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because</li><li>In 2017 they released two singles in conjunction and in tandem with pianist and composer ADAM at, one under their name and the other in his name, in collaboration. Yeah. Confusing as heck. Before that they have released their 2nd full album in 2015.</li></ul>mouse on the keys<br /><div><ul><li>Three piece piano-based instrumental focused on jazz, funk and sometimes electronic music</li><li>Their best impression is likely their only</li><li>Started in 2012 with music piece "saigo no bansan"</li><li>I got lost because I didn't care about their tunes which, in majority, I cannot give. I've gone back time and time again to find something acceptable by my standards to no avail.</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>They are doing pretty well now. I know they have been doing live tours (including where I live in) for many years. Their latest album is in 2015</li></ul><div>eufonius</div></div><div><ul><li>Two piece pop rock group, also music producers themselves</li><li>Their best impression is likely their first</li><li>Started in 2012 with Anime "Kokoro Connect" opening theme song "Paradigm"</li><li>I got lost because of their background, because they write and perform songs irregularly, and their prime activity is not in Anime (see below)</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>Their latest single is yet again - in 2017 - for Anime once more, after their solo album in 2016 which I did review. They mostly write for Anime though if not writing for solo releases which are typically albums or mini-albums as such, which is slightly different from your usual Anime production artist</li></ul></div><br />=======LIGHTNING ROUND!!!=======<br />9nine<br /><ul><li>Idol group comprising of four members as of time of writing</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>Their Wikipedia article (as of writing) provides a great timeline to show how the members came and go, and as of 2012 when I reviewed the one single there were five members on the release cover lol. They are still active with two singles released in 2017.</li></ul>deepNow<br /><ul><li>Three-piece rock indie band</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>As of their Twitter which ended in about 2014, the drummer of the group went on to form three-piece band with two other people "Lazuli" and have been fairly active since. (I will not mention about their short hiatus from May to August 2017)</li></ul>MINAMI NiNE<br /><ul><li>Three-piece indie rock band focusing on punk and melodic rock</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>Today's band feels a little different from before. Their image greatly changed from strong to somewhat relaxed with their first full album in 2016 as you can hear from the music videos. As of 2017 they released two mini-albums</li></ul>room free fall<br /><ul><li>Three-piece pop rock indie band</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>Today they are nowhere to be seen, to be honest. Their official Twitter is in private, and their latest music video is back in 2014. They have not been doing well since that full album, I guess</li></ul>CLIFF EDGE<br /><ul><li>Three-piece pop group, focusing on rap and hip-hop genres</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>They changed music labels in 2014, one year after I've given them two songs (one was collaboration from Lil'B, one was with), and they are still releasing albums (less of singles) till date. Their latest full album was in 2016</li></ul>=====END OF LIGHTNING ROUND=====<br /><br /><br />Neat’s<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter focusing on pop tunes, originated from RYTHEM's YUI ie. Niitsu Yui</li><li>Her best impression thus far was literally the whole of her third album, and of course from her 2nd album topic song "Modern Times"</li><li>Started in 2013 with song "BBB" and also her 1st album</li><li>[Active Artist] (see below)</li><li>I care because I liked her music style. Her subtle pop styles sometimes playing a lot more in style than in melody is precisely the reason I'm still listening to her songs.</li><li>It has been rather rough for her since her 3rd album in 2014 (which I reviewed) because she has been quiet, and until now in 2017 did she announce her return as a musician next year, under her real name Niitsu Yui, which will changer her image (she hopes) for the last time along with an accented pop music style, apparently. We shall see if that works for her again.</li></ul>yucat<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter focusing on punk and gothic rock, originated from RYTHEM's YUKA</li><li>Her best impression is also the first song I gave, and another time in her 3rd mini-album from 2015 "Dr.Code"</li><li>Started in 2013 with <strike>song "505" which I didn't give until in 2016</strike> "Stop Me!"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because apart from her slightly deterring style her melodies work, and I've gotten used to her style over the past five years to be honest. Will most definitely stay to listen for more.</li><li>She has been active every year releasing mini-albums, unlike many artists who release full albums or just a bunch of singles. In 2017 she released her fifth mini-album after her 5th anniversary best album which is basically a compilation of all her releases thus far</li></ul><div>Hikasa Youko</div><div><ul><li>Voice actress, Anime artist singer</li><li>Her best impression is likely from her only concept album topic song "Glamorous days"</li><li>Started in 2013 with single and Anime "Attack on Titan" ending theme song "Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai"</li><li>[Inactive Artist - gone quiet for a long time]</li><li>I care because songs given to her she sings well, and she has a good singing voice, as evidenced even from long ago on her Anime character songs, most memorably as Akiyama Mio from Anime "K-ON!"</li><li>She has gone real quiet since her first full album in 2014, likely signalling her departure from being a solo artist, so that's it I guess</li></ul></div><div><br /><br /></div><div>=======LIGHTNING ROUND!!!=======</div>Teshima Aoi<br /><ul><li>Anime singer, sometimes voice actress</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She is still releasing songs as a solo artist, so that's good, but mostly never without it too. Her latest original album is from 2014 and her latest Anime tie-in single is in 2016</li></ul>Annabel<br /><ul><li>Anime artist, sometimes lyricist, sometimes accompanying vocalist</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She is doing well as far as I know as an Anime artist with her latest single in 2015. She also is in many bands as accompanying vocalist including binaria (yanaginagi's sub-band group) and siraph (School Food Punishment composer)</li></ul>Linked Horizon<br /><ul><li>Anime group run by composer Revo, focusing on symphonic metal style</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>Considering he's been singing often for Anime "Attack on Titan" on their latest movies and recent Anime season, I say he's doing pretty well for himself. His group's new album is based on the Anime.</li></ul>Imai Masaki<br /><ul><li>Solo artist, accompanying vocalist in collaborations</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>If not for Anime "Kokoro Connect" I don't think I'll ever know this guy. His official website shows his activity, including singing with collaborated artists in releases over the years and actively participating in acoustic-based music program "MUSIC FAIR". A calefare for music, if you will.</li></ul>Aso Natsuko<br /><ul><li>Anime artist and drama actress</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She has announced hiatus after an album and final live in 2014, and thus been active in the drama industry, starring in various TV shows, commercials, drama and musicals today.</li></ul>Kitamura Eri<br /><ul><li>Voice actress, Anime solo artist</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>As a voice actress, her roles in Anime naturally get her character songs to sing to, and then for Anime she has regularly been releasing new songs under her name. In 2017 she released a mini-album</li></ul>=====END OF LIGHTNING ROUND=====<br /><br /><br />Komatsu Mikako<br /><ul><li>Voice actress, Anime artist</li><li>Her best impression... I don't know actually, but her 2nd album was still the most I've given her in a release. Also, 2016 single "Imagine day, Imagine life!"</li><li>Started in 2013 with Anime "Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi" ending theme song "Owaranai Melody wo Utaidashimashita."</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because firstly, she has a good voice, as expected for all voice actor based artists today apparently. Secondly, it's because she recently around 2016 changed music label thanks to Anime composer group (will mention in future post) Q-MHz which have since then dedicated to writing her out for a new music career.</li><li>She has became active since her new initiation with a new music label and backup composer group Q-MHZ recognition (see above). Her latest release was a full album in May 2017</li></ul>Iwasaki Ai<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter focusing on acoustic pop styles</li><li>Her best impression was also likely her first song I have given. Also, her 2016 full album "It's Me" (100% recommended)</li><li>Started in 2013 with "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION" song "Hanataba"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because I like her style, if her style has always been from that album I heard. Of course it may not be so, but still, she has potential for me to be watching her release new songs, that's for sure.</li><li>She is still an active artist in the industry, for sure. Her latest single was in 2017 in collaboration for a commercial product I think, and has released music videos to get people into her latest release which is the album from 2016</li></ul>cinema staff<br /><ul><li>Four-piece rock band focusing on alternative rock and hard rock styles</li><li>Their best impression is literally every topic song from their albums (lol), but most notably from early years of Klassic Note was in 2013 "Seiki no Hakken"</li><li>Started in 2013 with Anime "Attack on Titan" ending theme song "great escape"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because they are good. And I think I can acclaim them to be the next generation rock band in Klassic Note. Their new albums every year are hard to disappoint, and even so are still actively providing songs to Anime, drama and more.</li><li>They have been real active, considering they release albums every year since their major debut back in 2012. In 2017 they released their new album "Netsugen" with topic song known as "the continuation of great escape" titled "pulse"</li></ul>Kuso Iinkai<br /><ul><li>Three-piece rock band most infamously known for missing a drummer (lol)</li><li>Their best impression till date can still be the first song I gave, but worthy mentions are all the romance songs they've written, eg. 2016 "Boku ga Yuki wo Kirau Wake"</li><li>Started in 2013 with song "Hadouhou Girlfriend" (music video online)</li><li>I kind of wandered off when they started playing with their peculiar music style which I kind of dislike, but other than that I have been actively giving new songs as much as I can</li><li>They are active in the industry since their initiation with a major label in 2014. In 2017 they released their 3rd full album which I did review</li></ul>Ray<br /><ul><li>Anime artist, sometimes lyricist?</li><li>Her best impression... I would say all of them are fairly good hehe</li><li>Started in 2013 with Anime "Nagi no Asukara" opening song "lull ~Soshite Bokura wa~"</li><li>[Retired]</li><li>I did somewhat care to the extent I've been waiting just to give her new songs, considering how hard it is to give Anime songs not catered for her or my tastes</li><li>She has announced her retirement from music in late 2016, confirming the end of her music career in mid 2017 after her best album</li></ul>fhana<br /><ul><li>Four-piece band composed of three composers, focusing on Anime song composition with vocalist "towana"</li><li>Their best impression is also likely the first song I've ever given</li><li>Started in 2013 with Anime "Gingitsune" (didn't watch) opening theme song "tiny lamp"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I somewhat care for their songs but since they moved on to focus on duo vocals and had inconsistency in melody composition considering it's from three people I wouldn't comment on why I didn't give as much as I should</li><li>They are active in the Anime music industry, with the three composers writing for various Anime considering without towana they are literally a music group. In 2017, they have releases two singles related to Anime and are going on overseas performances starting from 2018</li></ul>yanaginagi<br /><ul><li>Anime singer-songwriter, sometimes music producer?</li><li>Her best impression... can I give her latest single <a href="../../2017/11/the-klassic-note-review-201711-issue-1.html" >which I reviewed</a>? Okay, from 2017 "over and over", and from her album in 2014 "Tetragon"</li><li>Started in 2013 with Anime "Nagi no Asukara" ending theme song "Aqua Terrarium"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because I want to give her more songs that she doesn't write for Anime because her style for Anime is vastly different from her usual style, as many Anime composers do.</li><li>She is active in the Anime music industry. In 2017, most notably she released two singles at the same date for two Anime, and took her first music and soundtrack producer role for one of the Anime "Just Because!"</li></ul><br />=======LIGHTNING ROUND!!!=======<br />sasakure.UK<br /><ul><li>Vocaloid pop songwriter, mainly focusing on vocaloid songs, sometimes pop and Anime songs</li><li>[One Album Wonder]</li><li>He is active as a composer in the Anime music industry, typically writing songs for artists and producing music so he can fill up yearly original album releases. In Klassic Note he wrote for Toyosaki Aki "Flip Flop". Outside he writes most often for GUMI and Hatsune Miku, to name a few.</li></ul>tacica<br /><ul><li>Two-piece rock band which was previously three piece focused on generic rock</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>Since the retirement of the drummer in 2014 they have been rarely active in the industry. Their newest song is from 2015, but they are still actively performing lives</li></ul>earthmind<br /><ul><li>Three-piece band focusing on electronic pop styles</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>They have not been releasing new songs since the single I gave back in 2013, and there isn't much news after 2014, so...</li></ul>Base Ball Bear<br /><ul><li>Four-piece rock band focusing on indie and alternative pop and rock tunes</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>In 2016 their guitarist has retired leaving the current group to release new songs. They have been active in rock festivals and live performances, and their latest album is in 2017.</li></ul>Mary days story<br /><ul><li>Three piece indie rock band</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>I don't know man. No news of them anywhere. I assume they have stopped long time since I heard the one song from their only mini-album release, I guess.</li></ul>mpi<br /><ul><li>Anime artist, supporting vocalist, sometimes lyricist</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>He is low in profile but rather active in participating in Anime songs from time to time. In 2017 he sang for Anime "Attack on Titan" and "Re:CREATORS" soundtracks</li></ul>STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter, music producer most notable known as R.O.N</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>The guy has used this name multiple times to write for Anime and sing too, and outside Anime he performs for band ROSARYHILL as keyboardist and vocalist, way before this name</li></ul>FictionJunction<br /><ul><li>Five piece vocal group singing for Anime composer Kajiura Yuki</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>To avoid confusion, I'll only be talking about the group without Kajiura Yuki singing (she doesn't anyway) and without the YUUKA sub group. The group is also only active so long as the composer has time to write songs for them, but considering Kalafina is a more successful group compared to this, I can guess why it has gone quiet. I reviewed their latest album in 2014, and in 2015 they released their live video performance.</li></ul>FLOW<br /><ul><li>Five piece pop rock group focusing on punk and rap mostly</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>They sing actively for Anime artists outside of releasing original songs themselves, after their best album back in 2015. In 2017 they released one EP</li></ul>=====END OF LIGHTNING ROUND=====<br /><br /><br />[Champagne]/[Alexandros]<br /><ul><li>Four piece rock band focusing on generic and also alternative rock styles</li><li>Their best impression is likely from their album in 2016 "NEW WALL"</li><li>Started in 2014 with song "Namida ga Koboresou"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I kind of care because their music style is strong as well as vivid. Sadly I'm very deterred by the use of English in lyrics as well as speech sometimes</li><li>They are fairly active in the music industry even after having to change their name (you can find out about that yourself). In 2017, they released two singles, a live video release, and a music video compilation</li></ul>Yuuki Aoi<br /><div><ul><li>Voice actress, Anime artist</li><li>Her best impression is still likely the first song I gave her</li><li>Started in 2014 with "VisuMania"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because... Well, initially it was because I see potential in her pursuit in her solo music career, but (see below) now she sings for Anime credit so I just hope it's good</li><li>She has been on hiatus from late 2015 because she can't seem to agree with coming up with a style she can be happy with (a rarity in the music industry), but came back in 2017 under a new music label just to sing Anime theme songs.</li></ul></div><div>Goose house</div><div><ul><li><strike>Eight</strike> <strike>seven</strike> six people singer songwriter composers group mostly playing pop and acoustic tunes for Anime</li><li>Their best impression is likely from the albums I reviewed for the most part, from 2015</li><li>Started in 2014 with Anime "Gin no Saji" ending theme song "Oto no Naru Hou e"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because I see potential in their compositions. Personally I've heard from a couple of them their individual works and I have been impressed and I can see potential for more, even if it may be for Anime</li><li>They have been active even with departure of composers in recent years. Leader d-iZe left in 2015 and Takezawa Migiwa left in early 2017. Even so, they released two singles and one full album in the year.</li></ul></div><div>Tsuzuri Zukuri</div><div><ul><li>Two piece pop band focusing on alternative pop styles and acoustic themes</li><li>Their best impression is likely still their first song given</li><li>Started in 2014 with "Tsubame"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I kind of care because apart from the sub par melodies their style is still one of a kind, apart from being in a more traditional fell it's still okay</li><li>They released an album in 2017 and have been relatively active since I heard of them</li></ul></div><div>Gotch</div><div><ul><li>Solo singer songwriter also known as vocalist ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION Masafumi Gotoh, focusing on pop hip hop styles</li><li>His best impression is likely from his first album</li><li>Started in 2014 with album "Can't Be Forever Young"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I kind of care because his style is still something I didn't get used to, and his melodies somehow are similar to the parent band he was wrong</li><li>He is fairly active in the industry, performing in lives and rock festivals.

Best impression song lyrics was written by Chatmonchy vocalist Hashimoto Eriko</li><li>She is fairly active in the Anime industry.

In 2017 they released a single and their 2nd album since their major debut back in 2013</li></ul>.lady.<br /><ul><li>Five piece Anime voice actress group singing for radio show "A&amp;G NEXT GENERATION Lady Go!!"</li><li>Their best impression is from 2016 "A Little Magic"</li><li>Started in 2014 with first single "Open Tuning"</li><li>[Graduated]</li><li>I kind of care because... they have good songs. I mean, they sing for a radio show, so I won't say much, but the songs are good as far as I've heard, and I've still not heard their only album release</li><li>They have started since 2012-2013 (the radio show), released theme songs starting from 2014, and ended in 2016 with a full album and graduation live to pass on the time slot to the new generation of voice actresses also known from 2017 as "A&amp;G NEXT BREAKS FIVE STARS"</li></ul>d-iZe<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter, previous leader of composer group Goose house</li><li>His best impression is still likely the first song I gave</li><li>Started in 2014 with his first ever album song "sweet lies"</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I don't really care because after the first album released back in 2012 (which I reviewed later) he changed styles and melodies quite differently, so I didn't stick around</li><li>He has graduated from parent group Goose house in 2014 hoping to continue with his solo music career, to some success.

The next one will come earlier though because after Wednesday I'll be busy deciding awards for Klassic Note for this year. So... yes, by Wednesday, and it'll be slightly shorter than the others, I hope. Cya guys then.</div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
