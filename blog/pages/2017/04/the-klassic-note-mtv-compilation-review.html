<h2 class="title">The Klassic Note MTV Compilation Review #55</h2>
<div id="hashtags"></div>
<div class="page-header"></div>
Uh... I don't know how to start this though.<br /><br />Eh, welcome to a new release of MTV Compilation, a regular thing I do for music videos in Klassic Note and yes, this is also how I determine how many songs are counted in the list and which commendations appear in the list every year. As this has been done like, 54 times before, I've decided (for once) to write down my own impressions and how much it has impacted on my decisions to give the associated songs or anything related in general. Although this may be an excuse for me to watch music videos more often, but it's also because they're a couple of them available online that I decided to talk about them here (four of them below are in YouTube FYI) and I thought this might be the time.<br /><br />(Just a brief history, each compilation traditionally fits approximately a 70-minute VCD, ie. around <u>15 tracks not including specials</u>. The track numbers will stay to represent otherwise. Not included in this list are Anime theme song animations, because I typically talk of them in Entertainment News)<br /><br />The format here is just a <u>screencap</u> (yep), a small <u>description</u> of what it is, briefly <u>how it impacted me</u> giving the song (eg. video before audio or the other way round) and <u>how good is it</u>, in arbitrary ratings, unlike Klassic Note Reviews where I give real numbers. You'll get it when you start reading.<br /><br /><br />THE MTV COMPILATION #55<br />(*In alphabetical order w.r.t. Klassic Note)<br /><br />01 Bokura Dake no Toushindai/Goose house<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U2SbRQdz1AA/WQV4D_ZMGpI/AAAAAAAAfc8/qLkwojy3AOwEkKHi2ZuXXagVuLBGncP4ACLcB/s200/goosehouse_toushindai.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>This music video is typical for the 7-man group, but presents itself in quite a different way, with what do you call that... shifting speech bubbles? Nonetheless, it is rather interesting and kind of presents the song well, so I'm not complaining. On the other hand, some emphasis is on Takezawa Migiwa (center) as the departing member after the recent album release in February.<br />Rating: 6 out of 7 speech bubbles, one less for Migiwaaaaaa haha<br /><br /><br />03 Fairy Tale/Sangatsu no Phantasia<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ODtWSw54ae0/WQV6SeLRXLI/AAAAAAAAfdI/HMEFAWWNal8X7ZFLWuzMdi_VbvtLoAA2wCLcB/s320/phantasia_fairytale.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>This group is not famous in revealing themselves (even vocalist Mia only went as far as posted her back on Twitter), but presents then a 2D equivalent, and it's quite interesting as it extends what the Anime represents and adds in its own flavour, with schoolgirls as context, and I think it's quite nice.<br />Rating: 10 out of 12 diamonds, because one for the single and one for the album<br /><br /><br /><br />04 Fighter/KANA-BOON<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WBxZVGUsbvU/WQV7EHntmKI/AAAAAAAAfdQ/_ZQCdKa62aIA2JaKOZvyHsXMmNy-zjYRwCLcB/s320/kanaboon_fighter.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>Every KANA-BOON music video does not disappoint especially in production, and this one isn't an exception. The shifty scenes of kill and escape is rather fresh for a music video, and it fits the song very well. More interestingly are the cutscenes for the end of the video where the band plays around, this time, with fireworks for some reason haha. Always a joy to watch them play around with all this seriousness.<br />Rating: 4 out of 4 firework sticks, just because<br /><br /><br />05 Grapefruit Moon/Natsukawa Shiina<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i6VlM6qZkv8/WQV7kVESPmI/AAAAAAAAfdY/oFoX8B5Ubhk5iLe3k8aSdCCO5utryYytQCLcB/s320/nanchan_grapefruitmoon.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>I think I've talked about this in the review already, but yeah, fanservice fantastic, to say the least. The song itself is mysterious, and the music video easily compliments that with fantasy scenes and a game of love? I guess so since the song feels like it, but we all know we're just here to look at this young voice actress anyway haha<br />Rating: 10 out of 10 close-up shots, not like I've counted lol<br /><br /><br />06 Heikousen/Sayuri<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dR37ntIbjsw/WQV8Do0aEBI/AAAAAAAAfdg/jEsRUp52g3w4keYYBiZroRr4tr4ige8MQCLcB/s320/sayuri_heikousen.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>This is the singer-songwriter's best music video yet. Ignoring the Anime credits they slot in the music videos as usual, there's a lot of Sayuri herself as she presents the various forms of herself as... that image she always wanted to do, and I think this one is reaching an epitome which I will like it a lot. Otherwise, many coolness, very strong music for a music video with some impact, and I think it deserves to be mentioned.<br />Rating: 2 out of 2 forms of Sayuri, excluding 2D forms<br /><br /><br />07 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgal_zCI1VQ&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">Hero/amazarashi</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-28Un9D0_hWI/WQV8r1D06rI/AAAAAAAAfdo/8yajHhx1WeAn5Qjyerr621OHhn83yITMwCLcB/s320/amazarashi_hero.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>The song is fine, and the music video compliments it nicely. amazarashi is also not face-cam friendly, so visuals become important to portray the on-screen lyrics and the general mood of the song, and this one is one of those masterpieces. In between you may see some other things or even the guy himself, but otherwise it's rather linear in terms of quality because it's quite typical in his fashion.<br />Rating: 8 out of 10 originality, because I saw the best album cover<br /><br /><br />08 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEf7p_7MjkM&amp;index=5&amp;list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">Inochi ni Fusawashii/amazarashi</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xfBlCCZvXLs/WQV9LVvGUrI/AAAAAAAAfdw/lcP6F6C3sychneaBxcsjPLSXqt2CpiPYQCLcB/s320/amazarashi_fusawashii.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>Which brings us to a more original production of a music video amongst the many visual style videos from amazarashi, this one is in conjunction of the game credited Nier: Autorama, and it looks quite good. Ignoring the assumed gore scenes of destroying dolls in many ways than other (I mentioned about the eye popping out of one of them), this video presents the game (not that I've played) quite well to the song itself, which makes this video fresh for the artist.<br />Rating: 12 out of 12 dolls destroyed on camera<br /><br /><br />09 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGM-BO0mklY&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">Kouya wo Aruke/ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7MPrVVX8XKI/WQV-IXkmrCI/AAAAAAAAfd4/Fh5dw6Q1zzMg3ClCVHZDXt9McjLxsxpTQCLcB/s320/ajikan_kouyaaruke.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>The music video features the band, but not on set or something but photoshopped on the backs of ladies walking on the streets. Hey, not the most original concept, but still interesting with respect to if you know the credited movie which title is just a walking girl. Otherwise, the tempo of the video compliments the song really well, so I'm not going to complain on the length of the video of using such a technique to make the music video.<br />Rating: 4 out of 4 band members on set, just in one shade of colour<br /><br /><br />10 Lovemageddon/Scenarioart<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y7A4WkieRD0/WQWSAhrazjI/AAAAAAAAfeI/fyVyr80-2GQqYFb2HwFLha4aKVq-HcGhQCLcB/s320/scenarioart_lovemageddon.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>This music video is... weird. Quite stereotypical of Scenarioart videos, but it's okay, this one is as weird as the others. The song itself presents itself as a bold love song, but in the music video is taken to another level I guess, with space and all sorts of stuff in between. From dances to space images, it's no wonder I'll remember this video, even though I'm better off with the song itself,<br />Rating: 5 out of 10 space trips, not including real ones<br /><br /><br />11 Magical Fiction/Chatmonchy<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UhcuUZiBCpI/WQWTAKo4IsI/AAAAAAAAfeQ/CPK_ddY_rlYw1_oce8e1uqd9XPsiQZGZwCLcB/s320/chatmonchy_fiction.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>And you thought we're done with weird videos, this one is going to top the list. Chatmonchy music video have never been normal too, and this collaboration doesn't make it any more normal. Interestingly, the tempo of the song is complimented with this music video, provided you can get over the fact that there's an old man dancing and a fat dude on the guitar for most of the video lol<br />Rating: 10 out of 10 for dance moves NOT done by the duo<br /><br /><br />13 Original./TrySail<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xCnBlwGAEFc/WQWUC-n6b0I/AAAAAAAAfeY/oQ0WvJIPFNApIJa0b2sM7xAjLHrAj937ACLcB/s320/trysail_original.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>Okay, this one. The fanservice music video did definitely help in giving the song, well, at least in Klassic Note. The theme of the music video is not as obvious until you feel for the song and not relate it to the Anime it was credited to, but still, this one is unique in its own way. Otherwise, you'd be glad that Ten-chan looks great, Mocho is too, and Nan-chan takes the front seat again. Well done, ladies.<br />Rating: 3 out of 3 in perfect running speed and posture in winter lol<br /><br /><br />14 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6idlVhWIWAE&amp;list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB&amp;index=1" target="_blank">SHINY/Yoru no Honki Dance</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ozekRrZi44g/WQWU8P6Xh-I/AAAAAAAAfeg/IVraclAkJu8BgtWrMtUY2gmd_29Nt5ENQCLcB/s320/honkidance_shiny.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>This one is the latest in this list, and it's rather impressive. Not because it's just more gay (happy) dancing, but the general mood of the music video suits the song perfectly, in this case, the theme of love, or more on infatuation I guess, but then again it's done pretty well. The little parts of the video (besides the purpose of leeching off the full song online) are also interesting, making this jovial band all the more entertaining.<br />Rating: 10 out of 10 for the main girl if you're into Westerners<br /><br />15 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g8wqbu2gYc&amp;list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB&amp;index=4" target="_blank">Sunny Day/LuckLife</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OdbSGGS7LlM/WQWV3mH7m-I/AAAAAAAAfeo/K-29COMVGY4cL1E9jWzA4xnVxLiJEWcgwCLcB/s320/lucklife_sunnyday.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>It's been some time since I saw a music video like this, and I feel happy about it. On the general mood of the song and also for the video itself. Very lively, heartwarming and a lot of hype. And if you watched till the end someone's birthday is in this video. All in all a beautiful video to watch, and I'm not referring to their first major album haha<br />Rating: 12 out of 12 for birthday party attendance haha<br /><br /><br /><br />16 Special: Zarazara/Hanazawa Kana<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:;" target="_blank" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="120" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8wsT1NawiU8/WQWWSERjKdI/AAAAAAAAfes/5z7vLzdvpisdbLP-j3oNvqf45742oEiCgCLcB/s320/kanachan_zarazara.jpg" width="120" /></a></div>This one may not be this year new, but it's still good. After spending some time sourcing the full video out, it brings out what Kana-chan should have been as a perfect woman, and is what most of us would like to see of her. The music video nicely compliments the mellow mood of the song, from her drawing (or acting like she is) to walking in the rain it all feels too real, or even reminiscent of a recent movie she was in (which I haven't got to watch yet). All in all, a great mood setter.<br />Rating: 10 out of 10 Kana-chan scenes for all to love<br /><br /><br /><br />I think I shouldn't do this anymore. I don't think I can afford the time to do this (it's been half a day already, and Entertainment News is less than this) for future posts, but if anyone likes it I don't mind doing it still (which is just me btw, so I'll see my mood lol) but for now... this is probably going to be a one-time thing. Maybe in the future if I got more to rant about or love about then maybe I'll do it again. This "release" sure has a lot going for it, and just goes to show how lovely the world of music video is, if you liked the songs. Cya guys then, and until next time... yep the real news is next.<hr><h4> Reported in <span class="post-tags">The Klassic Note</span></h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
