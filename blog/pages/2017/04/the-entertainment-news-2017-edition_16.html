Yeah, it's been only Sundays recently huh, this blog.<br /><br />Then again I aim to start a <u>Klassic Note anniversary series</u> soon (I have the list of stuff I want to discuss about out already), and hopefully by next week I'll do up a <u>new series where I talk about music videos</u> because... they deserve a mention. Considering that many YouTube videos are online, it makes of a good time to talk about some of them soon. Stay tuned for those because, I'm going to get a whole lot more lethargic to commit to them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br /><br />Okay, the music video one is okay; I'll probably only do that once in a couple of months.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Alice to Zouroku:</b> How should I say this... It's fantasical, for starters. Then... I keep believing this isn't an Anime.<br />This new episode (2) follows what we have seen in the hour-long premier episode last week. Sana-chan (the girl with powers) ends up living in Zouroku's hospitality. We are also introduced to his granddaughter Sanae-chan. She sounds nice, and is unlike her grandfather to say the least. She tempts the unknown girl with food (not enough to make her full though), and in turn she brings the unknowing human on a tour around the world? Hey, if that's what happens when you're given total freedom I guess that's the case. But thinking like many other superpower shows out there (yes I mean DC/Marvel here) this show is displaying a lot about the action part of this show that I would rather not watch. Sana-chan's brief history of who she became to be was short, but reveals a lot of details. It also reveals quite a lot about her education journey in this world, and that gives a lot of promise. A lot of potential for things to go differently from what I might expect. I expected this show would go towards a lot of slice-of-life elements, but thus far it has shown me a lot more on the action side, extended by the constant appearance of the people of the research facility and the people around them, for example, Zouroku's friend who was with the police who technically is under control of a governmental organisation. Oh well. This show I'm worried not about what happens in the show, but the subtle education it brings upon others, other being not me and mostly kids who probably are interested in this show. I mean, the animation team probably thought of showing the polar differences of Sana-chan's recently gained freedom versus the constriction of freedom from the authority of the facility, but that's where I start getting worried. Because if I had to exaggerate, this show is actually similar to Anime Time Travel Shoujo (from three seasons ago btw), where there's a bad guy constantly at your back all the time. And we do know this is only going to get worse. Not that I'm going to complain about the ending because I believe Sana-chan and her friends can make some decisions (I hope), but more on the process. I actually walked in with an impression of watching their daily life, being able to ignore the bad guys and trying to see a fantasical life. Maybe I was wrong. Only next episode will tell. The bad guy has just called for the woman Sana-chan was fighting in the intro.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6qGd6j0qInE/WPBqxvPUlXI/AAAAAAAAfL4/NpBCAJ6WJ84vtyUeCmcRoi72OrvdC6pxACLcB/s320/%255BHorribleSubs%255D%2BAlice%2Bto%2BZouroku%2B-%2B02%2B%255B720p%255D.mkv_snapshot_09.40_%255B2017.04.14_13.54.57%255D.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">#foodporn<br />No really, this much of a serving would do. Thanks Sanae-chan!</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Theme songs I might just give if I EVER give this show. Otherwise... I'll see ORESAMA; I barely just knew you and you guys just got your major debut.<br />P.P.S. Oh yeah Aki-chan's blog posts have been reminding me and I forgot while watching this and wondering, but she's the granddaughter. Yeah.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Okay I got a reason to watch this show now lol (But seriously, I thought it was Satomi-chan haha) (or actually she would be perfect for this voice)<br /><br /><b>Tsuki ga Kirei: </b>YES! That Hirai can't pick up a chick, but Kotarou sure can haha<br />Okay, I thought this would drag on for quite some time, but it seems there is already some interaction. The new episode (2) starts us with a sports festival which Akane is great at and Kotarou is not (duh), and accidentally lets her toy loose (I mean, it's drama). Yep. Without it she suddenly gets nervous, to the point that her friends actually know about it. We won't know the details for now, but suffice it to say it's likely relieving Akane's psychological stress being in front of people. But hey, guess who found it for her. Weird bedhead, quiet, didn't get enough sleep Kotarou-kun. Now that's what I call a gentleman. Also, if you caught the one thing he said to Akane before I CRINGE until I die, you'd be pleased. This is definitely the show I was looking for, and Kotarou is nothing short of literally myself when I was younger. (I'm not that old yet but still) On other things, developments of secondary characters seem to hold well. Between teacher and student, between people who apprehensively like others (I'm talking about Hirai's bet with Akane), and rumours all around. That's youth for you, people, and I guess it isn't much different in Japan. (Also, what a sh*t job on that band-aid Chinatsu haha) I kind of see the lack of importance of the festival where the teams fight hard to compete in various categories. Well, not enough I guess, but good enough. They even threw in the gossip in the toilet scene for good measure (<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Demi-chan <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>) haha. All in all, a great episode, and one that will truly represent the couple's relationship in the future. Come on, I didn't even have mobile messaging when I was a young lad lol<br />Edit: Also, whoever is looking at Akane's butt is SICK! SICK IN THE BRAIN! TOTAL PERV! GO F***ING DIE IN HELL! Haha but seriously, don't stare at it. I thought this wasn't a Japan thing. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t17ov0L9e8k/WPB0Vag7DuI/AAAAAAAAfMI/ySvKz4CofqE_bWxE1fvUyx0Z5zLKKpcXgCLcB/s320/tsukigakirei02_message.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The episode in summary.<br />Note that it was from Akane and she texted "Thanks for today" to Kotarou.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I appreciate the addition of short stories which I somehow got spoiled from the official Twitter (and that's why you should only follow their accounts after the show ends) (and I pity those locals who didn't get to watch the first airtime in Japan), and they were mostly great laughs. No really, is that how kids get along with each other now? Man, I'm missing out lol<br />P.P.S. Also, I noticed I need an adviser for a story I have been writing for... close to five years now and hasn't taken flight yet. Anyone? <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span><br /><br /><b>Eromanga-sensei: </b>Wow. Just wow. This show, man. Totally nailed jealousy on the second episode already. What's left for the rest of the series?? lol<br />The new episode (2) introduces us to Megumin, middle schooler classmate and class representative of the school Sagiri has to (obviously) attend, but didn't. The girl though, is a lot harder to handle than you think. She knows a lot about getting things done the dirty way, if you get what I mean, and that I guess can stir quite a spur on the siblings couple in some way. Then again, it's not just her I guess, but the brother can take sides anytime he wants. Okay, maybe on the classmate's side since he won't get to wash her stepsister's underwear anymore lol. On other things, Yamada Elf (who is more undisclosed in the novel than in the Anime), famous author of light novels and is actually demanding illustrations from Eromanga-sensei herself. But hey, if it's a request and you're doing it the arrogant way the most you're getting is a whole lot of rejections, to say the least. Although this is also a good awakening for Masamune considering he's a nobody and the other (thinks she) is a genius lol. Then again, this series is real entertaining for starters, but yeah, maybe just the Megumin part maybe too assertive at some points. I mean, is this how she makes friends at school? Thinking she's cute and physical contact (or the illusion thereof) will get her everywhere? Yeah, it's going to be some kind of problem to say the least.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J9hl15DxbSM/WPLWINJD71I/AAAAAAAAfOU/nSO1XdtbBrk5md7TPkBurNwq7xHle1fXACLcB/s320/eromangasensei02_underwear.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Masamune, it's most definitely NOT a priviledge to wash a girl's underwear.<br />Then again if there's only the two of you that's what happens lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. MVP Sagiri I guess (the brother's reactions are fantastic as usual haha), because of her struggling on that bed which I will no doubt make into a GIF and the washing machine ending animation. You cannot ask for any more other than that. Yeah, slightly adult, this series, but still acceptable, I guess.<br />P.P.S. I like how I notice Megumin is the best girl and immediately realise she's actually pacifying you because she does that to every friend she has. That's literally my realisation with idols in the entertainment industry haha. But seriously, I swear her intentions here are just so that Sagiri goes to school, which will mean knowing the truth though. So we shall see.<br />(BTW here's an omake with the link; you're welcome haha)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://gph.is/2ozdtAK" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SI3qCEjin-8/WPLYfcRKnLI/AAAAAAAAfOg/glZyb0dH5ZA0CpH54F4RraBtpuwGqSvQQCLcB/s320/eromangasensei02_sagiriGIF.gif" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b>Attack on Titan S2:</b> Yeah considering this show, thinking that everyone left the village maybe a little toooo optimistic. Then again there's last episode with Sasha's village so...<br />The new episode (28) shows us a lot more stuff than we should be involved in, but that's the whole point lol. They've got a plan to recover from the recent Titan invasion which probably broke a hole in the wall which they cannot find because them Titans maybe able to climb walls anyways? Apparently the priest has talked, but not from himself, as he references someone else who might know of the truth. The mysteries continue though, as we don't get a couple more things. For example, I swear someone's mother has become a Titan and is calling out to his son. (oops) Also, while the squads may have regrouped at night, what's worse for them has yet to come. Titans who are supposed to be asleep now are rather actively getting rid of them, as their "leader" is heading for the walls. Damn, if that isn't one of those crazy attack plans for this gang yet. Then again, I'll not hold my breath. This story has too much that they haven't revealed to us for me to be anticipating more. Still, we need more truth. A wall made of Titan frozen skin and intelligent Titan operations at night to the standard of soldiers level is really absurd at this point, considering we barely know anything about them yet. And it's like, 28 episodes down already, I know.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eDyN1dN-OtY/WPLiAqAVBKI/AAAAAAAAfOw/DAm6vGaBBYU8Pbc093YLjoaZyxpFbcgmACLcB/s320/attackontitan28_sasha.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Because everything else is too gory or too sad, I present MVP Sasha!<br />No really, we need more her in this show haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>I'm too lazy to read Acchi Kocchi, Seitokai Yakuindomo, Bungou Stray Dogs... damn, I need a manga holiday or something.

Now do I know of how weak Apple Music can be as a contribution to Klassic Note considering I haven't gotten a listen to <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/80/b3/07/80b30735-d23a-89a1-f4af-6df6cb32d757/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Kuso Iinkai's new album</abbr></b> and <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/e6/9d/93/e69d93a1-37d4-e204-cc62-b5ca896288da/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Sambomaster's new single</abbr></b>. Yeah. It's real bad. And I'll not talk more about them until I hear them.<br /><br />I've just been listening to <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/33/df/75/33df7561-2f05-3e8a-6016-fc4c988307f3/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Minase Inori's first album</abbr></b> this week and I think I can give a couple of songs despite the whole album sounding plain in style (which means you have to listen to them more to feel for the songs in my opinion), so that's okay. I got the right composers on first listen though; I think I'm pretty impressed with myself for always getting Elements Garden compositions lol<br /><br /><br />...<br /><br />Argh...<br /><br />Okay, I'm saying it. I will be giving <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img loading="lazy" src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/73/27/15/732715c6-fee8-d93a-a010-176a37d777cf/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Natsukawa Shiina's debut single</abbr></b>!! And it's not really because she's cute and she sounds great in this release and I'll never get another one better than this anytime soon (even though there's that too lol), but because I realised I've been giving these kinds of songs and not complaining and now I'm so apprehensive of giving newcomers songs. (Recall I give melodies, not lyrics?) Yeah, so I'm giving it. Expect reviews coming... not very soon. I just made the decision on the spot as I write this haha. *goes to search for special gifts or what's left online*<br /><br />In other news, <b>Nu-chan is releasing her first album</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numakura Manami for those unfamiliar with her) (and for Google search purposes lol) (yeah, with two singles) in June, <b>cinema staff's new album topic song</b> is out on YouTube which somehow follows a similar ending theme song from some titan Anime haha, and I think I'm going to like <b>the opening theme song sung by Touyama Nao</b> on Anime Tsuki ga Kirei because she sounds great! Hey, if you need some JK action&nbsp;&nbsp;(known as "joshikousei", or schoolgirls in Japan) yourself feel free to watch the short music video online for yourself hehe (come on she's young, just not the cute type I like)<br /><br /><br />Yeah, this is it actually. Very sad there isn't much in the music portion of this post, which easily explains why the above shouldn't be in a segment in itself at all. Cya guys next time then, and until next time... I mean, next week? I'm counting down to the end of my internship. Or actually, the day I have to regurgitate out a report haha. Okay, whatever, it's part of the grades anyway. Bye!<br /><br />[P.S.: Yes! Animate Online Shop! I knew Nan-chan's popularity is THIS LOW I can still grab a CD with special gift from your online platform!<br /><br /><span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span><br /><br />Sorry, Nan-chan. Don't feel "under the moon", okay?? Luv you~]<br /><br />[P.P.S. Didn't notice but Fujita Akane (the girl who voices <strike>Eromanga-sensei</strike> Sagiri-chan) sounds so much like Ayachi, really.
