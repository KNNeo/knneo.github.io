Hey with the end of one season comes another season, yes? Yeah, I meant Anime haha<br><br>Don't ask me why I dislike Titans and I'm still watching it. I mean, I'm giving it a chance. Besides, there's the theme song. Not the ending theme song for sure.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:text-bottom"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title><br>ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>ACCA 13th District:</b> Wow now I'm really confused. But I wasn't wrong though. It's either everyone against the royal family and Lilium or everyone against the Lilium family. Turns out it was the latter.<br>The last episode (12) finally reveals more ulterior motives as people already know of Lilium's plans to usurp the royal family throne for his family, only to find out that he has been double-teamed by the whole of ACCA, literally. Mauve paved the path to seek the Prince's understanding of keeping ACCA alive, and Furawau's uprising will never come to light (and also their existence in the kingdom too, after I understood the word "secession"). Such is the shame of the Chief Officers that they disbanded, leaving Mauve to lead the organisation. Damn, quite a normal ending I must say, but a really satisfactory one. This show is good. I really enjoyed it. Other things I maybe confused are why the mystery person behind talking with Nino started all this somehow (maybe Nino's father had relations, I don't know) and the apparent rumour or not about Jean's past. Hey, I don't know that much, but I'm sure his superior knows a lot about him.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijyXi-uFwZDJjSEgjsnV417c5MP67-0HXWJ9zvxOUghyphenhyphenFFTYs8AcadRvwvYUoFW4Gko1uc3l9kJOsBuBq8vPaoWQYpc151wviyfUw7KM_m5ZmswQKwEL5wEk0sGPmnPF2a__DE8HQNHzLB/s320/acca12_letter.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Haha sorry can't help. I swear this trivia is the last one.<br>Damn, Jean really wants to leave and his boss doesn't want him to lol</table>P.S. MVP for this episode, or even this show... Jean's boss! Yeah, who would have known? But turns out it made the most sense, and as I thought about it and as elaborated above, it may have just been a dying wish of Nino's father, who knows? It's good to keep some mysteries unraveled.<br>P.P.S. Nope, not giving the special ending song. Nope. Absolutely no. Yuuki Aira's single was WAAAAY better haha<br><br><b>Attack on Titan:</b> Okay... where shall I start? The show itself or the theme songs? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Damn, this show. Also, an assumption you should take - I've zero knowledge of what happened after the first season Anime, so this is a clean slate where it comes to surprises.<br>The new episode of <b>season two</b> (26) catches up from last time, and when I mean last time I mean four years ago. Yeah. *watches a part of episode 25* Ah, I remember now haha. Up until now we've got Annie, the only abnormal Titan which we have seen (I can't believe I watched abomination of a show four years ago lol) camouflaged in the army, and as she rises and be defeated by Eren, there apparently is more. I guess it's supposed to be continuous but the season ended it and pushed two movies to earn the sh*t out of international box office before coming back, but yeah, it's happening. So more of them Titans are coming in, this time led by smarter leaders supposedly coming to gain intel from these Titan killers they've seen so far. But hey, what's more important is not the story; I'm fine with it. What's else are the elements. I find myself avoiding to watch erotic fight scenes and bloodbaths mostly focusing in this episode, the end of one of the leaders on the field. But then again it's kind of a problem huh, this show. I really wonder how I never stopped myself watching it. By today's standards three episodes and I would have stopped. Nonetheless, this is not going to stop me from watching it than the theme songs for this season. Linked Horizon is still disappointing as usual (which is why you probably only remembered the first theme song just like me) and WTF IS WITH THE ENDING THEME SONG??? Yeah, that's the fury part. Twenty minutes of video has led up to this, huh.<br>I'll seriously consider this and will either (1) give Linked Horizon if necessary (I told myself to give one minimum) or (2) abandon this show after the usual three-episode rule. I'll leave a (3) for this being the first show where I don't give theme songs at all. Stay tuned to see if my patience holds out haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4BznbhR8v7KGV5RghxbprGIPPNKfOLmOYm18ktSE1t5wI7yvwSOICHWGS6yvDmxu6veJr7VRnB2UQeSR5CuXnRL3LjkdxkAuvDuOR3lU-jslZBioKXTW11nscAUL2Rp7l2bwNxbWn3_0s/s320/titans26_mother.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't want to show someone being eaten so... here's Eren's mother haha<br>Sorry, she already got eaten I forgot.</table>P.S. Just in case you're too focused on my rant and not on the situation story, I guess it's like the aliens theory we have of the universe, but just fellow humans aren't rare in the world after all, and fellow human Titans are even less rare. No really, they got a lot. Maybe world elimination should be the solution. I see this show going in the direction of a bad end which I much would not like to witness.<br><br><br>Which also means next week there's the above and... we shall see. Alice and Rozoku is available tomorrow so I'll go take a look.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:text-bottom"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span class=head-title><br>MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Nagasarete Airantou:</b> The new chapter (150) continues on the fun that is the ancestor of the island Obaba. She turned into that nine-tailed fox if you can recall, and is waiting for confrontation from... someone. Well, Ikuto took the challenge, and I think I'll leave the story-telling to you to find out. Suffice it to say the ancestor has youkai powers that when awakened will turn her younger to the extent of being a kid, which explains her form now. Well, if it's more fighting and less nude scenes I'm in! Okay, the latter this manga cannot promise haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 height=252 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEb2soxWZ8h9UGHzhWwRt3CVwKWhhRcj2qfzSibmX9F-Svg57Z2qSmOW89K67_t9TPU5Xr8kaskIHc-qyC1hpdFGW6IXXwNODCJ5LOP3lJ5pnYE53B_RUmlzlDSDDVUfcwbXC6ghFj2hn6/s320/airantou150_026.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I can't show nudes so here's the action haha</table><br><b>Dagashi Kashi:</b> This new chapter (49) is a good reminder that I can buy those can-based candies from shops where I came from. It's short, but still quite entertaining (refer to image below haha) and certainly makes me want to get one of those cans again. The first time I got myself one of those some time ago after I got it often as a kid way back then was just satisfying. I costed a lot but it was worth it. Today I see Japanese specialist stores around the country so it is actually easier to get them, but damn, those things are great. Yeah same here my least favourite is the mint one (white colour), Kokonotsu-kun. You're not alone haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 height=197 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvyGu5BhT13Vm9hGKCvSANBleYv9g5KQUggRiUyqeIee15osdAp46Tm-PAXTC8_FCf9pDHKVPR16DaiTh9tFT0j-vpNRXP2lvkVYknSvuLl_WhTs5Gwy8V7hROM5R2LYlje9JJvS4QvT5h/s320/dagashikashi50_005.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If it was really Ayachi (who voices Hotaru-chan in the Anime) drenched in the rain, I'll be sure to thank God sincerely haha</table><br><b>A Channel:</b> The new chapter (94) talks about the girls outside at night. Haha I know what you are thinking which is why the families are worried about them (Tooru included btw) when they wanted to go visit the Tower late in the day. They enjoyed themselves that's for sure (sorry Tooru if people don't believe you're high school student haha) and it's yet another of those relaxed series of manga I'd enjoy. (Okay not so relaxed for Tooru who's trying to win that crane game and playing drums to de-stress but still) (WTF I keep talking about Tooru damn I want some Yuuki Aoi haha)<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 height=231 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghCuniMiGpOB6rlPI2N9EzNpmf4OzXdW6Vcm_NG_gnaQ8se9YvZ9hvCJqSM3FsRi6Ee86PgZM7soKGVEBPsupT4JyQ8KpQ4DyXG0lkb5pOIqa9np3Ve6ydwrlDuKLQoYmKwiuNLvd4nDqr/s320/img000002.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Guess what? It is scary when you're right-handed and they suddenly tell you to keep left lol<br>It took some time but I got used to it so don't worry about your sis Keiko-chan haha</table><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title><br>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well this week has been brief but a lot compared to last week lol. <b>Ajikan's new single</b> was okay because I wasn't pleased with the B-side sung by the guitarist anyway (sorry), but hearing Gotch write another song that is so staple of old Ajikan is very reminiscent and great, and I like that. I also went out of the way to give the character songs I heard from the recent Anime Konobi release (they like to do that nowadays; It's not K-ON! or WORKING!! already) so that's Colette-chan and Imari-chan's songs respectively. <b>amazarashi's best album</b> came in quick, and I was quite generous to give quite a few. Hey, I guess I really like his style. Not so much for the new song though; Their older songs have a lot to offer.<br><br>Next week brings us one of the busier weeks. There's <b>Natsukawa Shiina's new single </b>that I'll be looking forward to, <b>Chatmonchy's new single</b> which I haven't heard anything of just yet (which will be good?), <b>Kuso Iinkai's new album</b> (more elaborated below) and <b>Minase Inori's first album</b>, if I have the time to listen to her. Initial impressions on previews aren't that impressive. Then again Kuso Iinkai sounds worse haha<br><br>In new songs, there's the previews for Kuso Iinkai's new album for next week, Mikakoshi's new album announcement for next month and new music video and Yoru no Honki Dance's new music video due end of the month. Please do help yourselves to the music videos on YouTube because you be glad they aren't region restricted lol<br><br>On other news, there's the <b>new Sambomaster album</b> (damn the Twitter likes are just pathetic somehow) some news on Anime Eromanga Sensei's theme songs (TrySail in particular), Mocho's new single has a name now, and if you're still reading this I advise you to not and go watch LILI LIMIT on LINE LIVE now. Then again if you're reading this not right after I post this anyway so yeah, their new song is out yesterday, so go check out, yes? (Okay I have a feeling I'm reprimanding myself right now) Okay, check out <b>LILI LIMIT's new song</b> online, yes?<br><br><br><br>This is it. I totally forgot about their live again and now I'm stuck here watching Anime I don't like lol. Cya guys next time then, and until then... I hope you've been enjoying life. I have two months left to go and I'm certainly not enjoying it. Really. It doesn't end there. I've for the holidays to suffer. Argh, my heard hurts thinking about it...<br><br>[P.S. Okay technically I only missed half of three songs (Ajikan cover of "Blackout", A Short Film and the new song LIKE A HEPBURN respectively) so I don't feel so bad now haha. Besides the sound quality is poor and the image quality is worse, so... *double haha*]<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
