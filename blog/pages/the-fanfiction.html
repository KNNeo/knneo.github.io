As we met up and walked the streets towards the shopping district, we saw the beautiful illumination, and the temperature started to drop.\n\n\"It suddenly got cold, isn't it?\"\n\nAkari then started to put her hands up to her face to blow on it. I then realized what a fool I am to not buy her gloves even though I was wearing a pair. As the nearest mall is some distance away, I held her hands up to mine and sent to her fingers a warm breath from my mouth.\n\nShe patted my gloved hands together in embarrassment, and with her face close up and beet red, we held each other's hands even tighter. I told her she could take my gloves, but she said I would then end up with cold fingers like her.\n\nWe happily walked down the streets with one hand holding onto the other person while keeping the other hand warm with a glove."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["KitouAkari","ExGirlfriend","Christmas","NoGloves","BreathOfWinter"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Uesaka Sumire","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl800774.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl800774.jpg","link":"./2023/12/the-fanfiction-20231223.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"I was never a fan of large social interactions, but when I was invited to a party thanks to my stepsister, I could not refuse. With the intention of just staying by her side, I ended up alone in a party with mostly females, making me feel way more awkward than I am used to. I then took a book out some love advice I read online: Find the most attractive woman in a party, chat up to her, and that will make your night.\n\nI looked around and saw Uesaka Sumire in a red strapless dress, and my mind ran wild seeing a body of epic proportions. I approached her as she is drinking champagne alone. I introduced myself to her and we had some chatter. I told a joke about chest and made her laugh, but my real intention was the follow up: I casually asked what her bust size was.\n\nShe whispered softly to me a letter and put her finger to her smiling lips. I stood in the lively party in silence. I felt like I just knew a secret that should never be revealed to mankind."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["UesakaSumire","Acquaintance","ChristmasParty","PickUpGirl","Secret"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Takahashi Rie","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl940090.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl940090.jpg","link":"./2023/12/the-fanfiction-20231230.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"It's always alone for me at the end of the year since I moved into Tokyo, but not this year it won't be. Takahashi Rie, whom I met at my new job? We have been hanging out with each other more often for the past few months. But it was always because we wanted to avoid the rest of our department - the older co-worker crowd who are still living in the Showa Era - that we chose to hang out together.\n\nThis time around, I thought Takahashi-san invited me over to her place for New Year's to hang out with her friends, but as I entered her apartment and put down my stuff, I realized there was no one else. I dared not take a step further into her living room which smelled better than a flowerbed, so I took a seat at a stool near the kitchen. I asked if they have anything planned for this gathering, maybe play some games. She laid down onto a pillow on the cyan-coloured sofa beside me, and looked back at me with a smile and a glint in her eyes.\n\n\"What do you want the two of us to do together?\""},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["TakahashiRie","Colleague","HouseParty","AloneTogether"]}]}}]}]}]
