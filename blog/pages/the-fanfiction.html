Coming back from an overseas workplace, I did not realize how many of them can't speak good English. Seeing as I was introduced alone as a newbie, Takahashi-san called on me to join her for lunch with everyone else.\n\nWe went to an establishment near the office and as we settled down, everyone started sitting in their groups. Some were taking their orders and others were arranging the tables. The ladies were talking about what they did in the weekend, while the guys were mad about the baseball match the day before. I sat down at the end of the table awkward and alone, preparing to take my smartphone out to kill the time. It was then, Takahashi-san handed out an empty plate to me. Our eyes met for a second. For whatever reason, I felt that her sincerity and affection to me was much different as she was to others as she engages me in conversation, I wonder if she is this nice to everyone."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["TakahashiRie","Colleague","Lunch"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Amamiya Sora","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl949088.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl949088.jpg","link":"./2023/07/the-fanfiction-20230708.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"Yesterday was quite a night as it was my first time I had a sleepover with my younger stepsister Natsukawa Shiina and her friends Asakura Momo and Amamiya Sora. Since I lost a bet playing games with them last night, they forced me to sleep on the sofa and wake up early to make breakfast for them.\n\nI heard footsteps from the staircase leading upstairs the following morning as I was in the kitchen. I turned around to see Sora was the first to come down, with unkempt long hair from what I assume was a morning shower, walking out smelling fresher than a bed of roses. We both greeted each other in the chilly morning. She looks around the kitchen I just cleaned up before she sat down across the table. She showed me a grin in her face without makeup as she takes a small bite off the burger I made.\n\n\"Oh wow, so you can cook up something like this now.\"\n\nYes, Amamiya-san, for passively mocking on my cooking abilities. It was because I was rejected by you in high school that I learned how to cook."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["AmamiyaSora","Acquaintance","RejectedInHighSchool","Cooking"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Asakura Momo","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl714977.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl714977.jpg","link":"./2023/07/the-fanfiction-20230715.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"The sun shines into the cabin as I board a train to meet up with my friends a few stops away out of the city. Holding on to the handrail with one hand as I face outwards into the scenery looking into my phone, I felt a tap on my shoulder. Turning around, with both hands holding on to a handrail and returning a faint smile, it was Asakura Momo on the same train with me, who was also en route to meeting her friends. A soft call of \"Aozaki-san?\" melted me more than the hot sun, and we started some chit chat, talking about food and recent TV shows and all. As I went on about my monologue, Asakura-san listened attentively. I felt like she did not just converse with me with a passing smile, but was behaving more like someone who was keen on being a listening ear. To me, the conversation made me feel like she was such a nice person overall. Perhaps and maybe, she was just interested in knowing more about me."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["AsakuraMomo","Acquaintance","Train"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Natsukawa Shiina","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg736844.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg736844.jpg","link":"./2023/07/the-fanfiction-20230721.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"It was a great start to my day off in the Natsukawa family. The light shining into my room was so bright and warm it woke me up late into the morning. Knowing that Shiina also was free today and it has been a while since we hung out, I messaged her if she wanted to join me for brunch. Not long after, we left home together for the cafe downtown.\n\nThe shops started to open in the shopping district as we made our way back after we got some groceries. Shiina then saw the capsule toy machines by the toy store and begged for me to give her some loose change to play them. Surprisingly, she got the prize she wanted immediately without breaking my wallet, but instead gave it to me. I told her I was not interested and she can keep it as a gift from me, but the smile on her face is irresistibly cute (and she was real pushy about it) so I had to accept it. It has been hanging off my carry bag ever since."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["NatsukawaShiina","YoungerStepsister","ShoppingDistrict","Keychain"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Hanazawa Kana","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl109941.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl109941.jpg","link":"./2023/07/the-fanfiction-20230728.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"It was a sunny afternoon where all of a sudden, the sky went dark and it created a huge downpour. After a couple of minutes it did stop, but what greeted me by my doorstep was more amusing than the change in weather.\n\nIn front of my front porch under its roof stood what looked like Hanazawa Kana, drenched from her hair down to her torso. She decided to ask around for directions to a certain bungalow in this hilly area, but did not manage to escape the sudden rainfall upon her despite seeking the nearest shelter. I told her it can be confusing up these parts, felt bad for her so I let her in to dry up lest she catch a cold.\n\nI passed her a clean towel to wipe her hair, and only then did I notice who she was. She looked back at me and we stared at each other for a couple of seconds. She asked if there was anything wrong with her, I said no and looked away in embarrassment. She contacted the owner of the lodge she intended to visit and left soon after."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["HanazawaKana","Acquaintance","MyMansion","Rain"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Minase Inori","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg944193.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg944193.jpg","link":"./2023/08/the-fanfiction-20230805.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"It was the first of many favours I had to repay Minase Inori personally for saving my life some time ago. Of all things, she wanted me to join her in a summer festival outside of town. We arranged to meet nearby and walk the rest of the way there. I was amazed and speechless when I saw her slender body in the yellow-white yukata for the first time, I looked away to hide my embarrassment.\n\n\"What is with that expression\", she said to me while giggling as I tried to explain myself and hold my embarrassment back from her.\n\nAs we walked down the streets en route to the festival, we passed by a playground on which had a pelican-like ride. Minase-san thought it was adorable and went up to it while saying \"isn't this cute\" along the way. She then squatted down, put her finger against its beak, and looked back at me with a pout. I was confused yet adored at this sight, where later she explained that I looked exactly like that earlier on."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["MinaseInori","Benefactor","SummerFestival","PlaygroundRide"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Waki Azumi","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg803405.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg803405.jpg","link":"./2023/08/the-fanfiction-20230811.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"There was this open foot bath that is very popular in the neighbourhood.

She said she was on her way back after visiting the shrine and taking some photos of the nearby festival.\n\nAs I took a seat opposite her after what was quite a long walk, she decided to dangle her feet against mine and I laughed it off in embarrassment. We had some chit chat, and after some time, she stretched her hands up into the air and forwards to me with a smile, and I stared at her in confusion.\n\n\"Pull me up, I sat for too long!\" I let off a giggle as I pulled her up, and she gave me a cute pout in return.\n\nAfter we both got out, I walked her home before going back to my own abode a street away."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["WakiAzumi","Neighbour","FootBath","SummerFestival"]}]}},{"tooltip":"Minase Inori","thumbnail":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg944191.jpg","grid":{"type":"grid","columns":2,"rows":8,"cData":[{"type":"image","rows":7,"tooltip":"","source":"https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg944191.jpg","link":"./2023/08/the-fanfiction-20230819.html"},{"type":"paragraph","rows":7,"italics":true,"text":"After walking around the festival for a bit, I bought some sparklers for us to end the day.

She is enjoying herself though, so it was worth buying another pack.\n\nWe played by the shed around the back nearby the shop where they sold them. The sky is dark enough to light them up but bright enough for me to still see the ecstatic face Minase-san was making while she lit one up. She cheekily brought it to my face without me looking, I squirmed in fear and retreated a few centimetres. Her beautiful smile immediately turned into a giggle but also quickly turned into a face of worry.\n\n\"I'm really sorry for scaring you. Are you alright?\"\n\nShe moved up to me as I nodded in embarrassment.

But instead of listening to me, she pointed at the dessert store which drew her attention. I did not hesitate to buy her what she wanted, and she walked to the bridge behind the stalls to eat. I stood by her with an awkward silence until she smiled at me and offered me a serving.\n\n\"I-I wasn't that mad at all.\"\n\nI swallowed down all my worry and anxiety along with its sweet taste. Thank goodness she understood the situation as I have explained. Or did she...?"},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["KogaAoi","Girlfriend","SummerFestival","ShavedIce"]}]}}]}]}]
