Coming back from an overseas workplace, I did not realize how many of them can't speak good English. Seeing as I was introduced alone as a newbie, Takahashi-san called on me to join her for lunch with everyone else.\n\nWe went to an establishment near the office and as we settled down, everyone started sitting in their groups. Some were taking their orders and others were arranging the tables. The ladies were talking about what they did in the weekend, while the guys were mad about the baseball match the day before. I sat down at the end of the table awkward and alone, preparing to take my smartphone out to kill the time. It was then, Takahashi-san handed out an empty plate to me. Our eyes met for a second. For whatever reason, I felt that her sincerity and affection to me was much different as she was to others as she engages me in conversation, I wonder if she is this nice to everyone."},{"columns":2,"type":"tags","prefix":"#","values":["TakahashiRie","Colleagues"]}]}}]}]}]
