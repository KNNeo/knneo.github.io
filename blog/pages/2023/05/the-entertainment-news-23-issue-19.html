Well, this was quite a week. For starters, you may have noticed the crazy number
of blog posts that I have not ported into the anniversary site which I may just
do next week or something I still have stuff to catch up on including the next
announcement which will come... hopefully by next month. And then there's the
#KN15YEARS compilations which now that I have put in the teaser in one of the
posts I can't go back now haha not that I will, so I'm thinking of what should I
credit this time around. Not gonna top ABCDs in 10th year though; That was such
a good idea I can't even
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Also, fixed up the Entertainment News posts in the past years (manually, by
  the way) to fit with the new post contents: the hashtags on top, the headers
  in each segment, fixing links and popups- That popup text thing though I still
  have no idea how to replace that so that might be legacy code for all I know.
  Not that I put a boring list of stuff in a hidden segment now anyways I either
  spill it out or I don't. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Also also, unlike the last time I took work leave and was sick half the time
  and was in a tube scanning my abdomen in the other half lol, this time the
  doctor was also on leave (lmao) so I took the time to learn that this issue
  anyways has been a long running problem and controlling one's diet will be the
  best solution anyways. Then again, I can always spend more money in investing
  in my future or my haircut or whatever renewing of passport and identification
  card since this is a thing for this particular year. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Not going
  overseas anytime soon though but you know, who knows? Maybe I go Japan to see
  MaiMai-
</div>
<div><br /></div>

  ANYWAYS, too long of an intro, we have plenty to talk about for music but
  Anime first!!<br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Yeah true competition over not exams is cringe. Only in the best of schools do
  we only compete in academic results. I mean, look at them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this
  new episode though (#SkiLo05), we have some Egashira lore?? Ooooo haha then
  again at some point we gotta do the character focus episodes. It's
  slice-of-life series, after all. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> This time around, we focus on not the
  exams because who really cares about studying at his place lmao we will get to
  that I swear, let's talk about the school sports festival! It's not your usual
  run on the tracks, but this is also rather exciting, as the new class decide
  to give themselves the task of trashing all competition out there and win in
  as many sports as possible. And thus, in a world of competition, Mitsumi
  started to get worried for real for not picking up an easy sport so you can
  lose alone lol Kurume I see you there, so after talking to Shima he got
  Egashira to help her out to play volleyball. You know, that girl who likes
  Shima so bad she wants Mitsumi dead? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, no deaths here only
  dead hearts in love lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, we gotta train Mitsumi so she could be useful
  in the matches afterwards. And come on Egashira please, training Mitsumi isn't
  as hard as
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen"
    target="_blank"
    >that other Anime</a
  >
  which is basically devil's run and he still can fail, so relax. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also,
  training for yourself to slim down probably is a bigger ordeal- Moving on
  haha, she then realized how different and tryhard she is compared to people
  around her. Specifically on Mitsumi we will not talk about Yuzuki for now I
  bet she has her problems, but it's all about viewpoint. In dealing with the
  senpais who are using the court for the wrong reasons, Egashira will imprint
  those guys' names in her blacklist lol, while Mitsumi was thankful the good
  senpai was here to help her. Not Kanechika, not that one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah,
  that's pretty much it Egashira: You learn to hate people, but she learns to
  like people. Too real, girl, too real. Also what is too real is her flashbacks
  where she was in middle school I assume? When she probably got bullied being
  called a PIG (lol) (I mean, I would too so I can't imagine everyone else who
  is male and isn't a piece of sh*t when they were a kid), she tried her best to
  keep her image and change herself for the better in high school, as Mitsumi
  has noticed about how much she tries even just getting to Shima-kun, yes? But
  yeah, no lying, girl, we don't condone those in here this is a safe space
  about friendships and friendships only. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Then again, the matches that
  followed on the actual day really made you feel that this isn't just
  friendship when classmates cheer on for you doing stuff, specifically here on
  the battlefield on the sports field. Yeah, remember those days when you were
  kinda popular and girls looked at you? Those were the days. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Hey, I
  didn't dream of it, okay? I just didn't have smartphones to take photos to
  show you. Also there was the bunch of us- DAMMIT!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on haha so
  that was my first half of middle school don't ask about the rest thanks lmao,
  we all see a different perspective of everyone who worked hard. Kento also got
  praised by his crush oh goddamn, so that's the stuff I strived for in school
  back then, eh? Maybe. Don't think it worked though I'm still single- Hey
  Egashira if you don't mind you can take me. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also Mitsumi if you
  don't mind can you just take Shima-kun? Despite his popularity with the girls
  most of them only want to take a photo with him. Really, that's it. To
  actually be with an
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> all
  around? You need a <em>real</em> friend, and you might be that one for him.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... yeah Egashira will get laid by Episode 12, mark my
  words. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Or I guess if no one wants her then I'll take her. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> The
  characters in the cast have such a diverse portfolio, I can always get back to
  them either way or another. Which is good, this kind of dynamic is what you
  want to see in such a series. I'll look forward to next time, and maybe then
  we can find someone who will fall in love with Egashira. As in her during her
  middle school days HAHAHAHA I'm done

  is expanding faster than the universe is lol (#ToniKawaS205), but actually if
  you studied Astronomy you know it's shrinking instead so don't mind me if we
  introduce more characters to ruin their day. Okay maybe not this mom just gave
  us tickets to a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onsenryokan" target="_blank"
    >hot springs hotel</a
  >, we good. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Good mom there haha, as you can see, Kaname's mom which
  is also Aya's mom if you can recall, has came back on her pity run as I would
  like to refer to these things because this is their fallback apparently which
  no one cares to be honest, but we do care about the pair of tickets she won
  that she wouldn't use anyways haha, so might as well give it to the main
  couple. Heck, do we even need to move to somewhere else to stay? We getting
  benefits by the episode, dude! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, they get to go play around
  by themselves (hehe) while no one is stalking them especially Chitose because
  we know she has cameras all around the country lol or at least she has the
  maids, is staying back to study just like Aya-chan, but we all know who is
  studying more between the two even if they all hanged around to clean the
  bathhouse in their swimsuits. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yes, turns out Kaname is the smartest,
  we get it dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on from these losers haha, let's talk about
  what happened in the hotel then. No sex yet lol, but we did start with some
  reflections in each of the public baths I guess. Tsukasa is just enjoying the
  bath, and Nasa-kun is so chill he forgot he had to plan the trip ahead of time
  or else they will be just wandering around which honestly saying is good
  enough for me if you date me so any takers? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> No? Oh well. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> He
  rushed out of the bath early only to be blocked by an old woman who is lost in
  the hotel, just DRAGGING his time away to do research and/or scouting to
  whatever extent he needs to do so, and is then stopped by the wife because
  damn, ever met the guy who was the witness on your marriage papers? Me
  neither. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Introducing Tsukuyomi Tokiko, in surface let's assume she
  was the one who raised her up after what seems to be like her husband passed
  away in the war probably leaving her so damn rich she owns the largest room in
  this very luxurious hotel alone. They introduce themselves to each other
  formally, we get to see Tsukasa embarrassed for like half the episode haha
  nice that's the title of the series in action she's just cute, and Tokiko
  thought Nasa-kun did the very crazy thing of asking this Tsukasa... thing of
  her hand in marriage. Hmm what could that mean... All in all... I'm going to
  leave you with the lore as they have left us this week. From Tokiko, yes. AND
  THEY ARE LEAVING THE GOOD STUFF NEXT WEEK?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, not like they are
  going to drop on the lore of Tsukasa that quick haha this old woman knows a
  lot by the way, but you know, we can keep it at this pace. We are halfway
  through this second season after all. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Again, not that I know of the
  backstory I've only seen the manga cover art lmao, but I think that this
  episode might be quite enough. So, next week then! You think they going out
  for sights or are they going to take in the sights of each other's- Oh, from
  the trailer it's both. NICE haha see you then

  Wow they really make you wait for the photo, huh. Also screw you,
  mosquito-kun. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we comparing against Nakami
  but as a female lmao Kanikawa you cad (#KimiSomu04), yeah we aren't even
  halfway through and we be talking about love now?? NICE. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, it's
  not only me that's enjoying this, we can just start with the girls along with
  Isaki-chan, isn't it? The exams are just over, the girls are hanging out doing
  girls' talk things like Kanikawa being envious of Nakami somehow and I promise
  you it's not his insomnia that's shining lmao, and you know, walking the
  bridges and falling in love. Gotta agree though? If a boy and a girl can walk
  the bridges together without anyone noticing that has GOT to me a romance
  plot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still though, watching Kanikawa tryhard is kinda adorable (hehe
  voiced by Lynn-san btw), but not when Nono-chan there realized that Isaki-chan
  actually has someone to refer to in doing whatever stuff they were thinking
  of. Please, taking photos in the fireworks festival only, bro. Nakami isn't
  interested anyway. The fireworks, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> And so is Isaki-chan...
  maybe. At this point even Shiromaru-senpai here probably saw this thing
  between them and Ukegawa already knew he was in the way haha, maybe Nakami is
  more aware about his relationship with this girl than anyone else will ever.
  But the girl is nice and adorable even complimenting his photos of the night
  stars despite the literal dunk fest from the senpai, still isn't enough for I
  guess anyone to notice what's up. Well, not yet anyways we will get there.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And I guess we have to talk about the school trip incoming. The
  weather's going to be in the way, we have a tight schedule that no one is
  technically interested in, and instead of letting the newest Most Boring
  Teacher Award sensei decide on the groups to have dinner together lol, let's
  see if we can violate the rules throughout this class trip, yes? Haha we gotta
  do all the wrong things in school, isn't it? Hanging out at night after school
  at the convenience store, or even cycling out at night with a huge bag of
  stuff... bro, you are just as suspicious as he is anyways, this Rui. Not that
  it's a problem we only talk about this stuff in the toilet anyways, until that
  dumb teacher is in one of the cubicles. Welp. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah as you can see
  this is the stereotype old-fashioned thinks-he-is-smart-because-he-is-ripped
  type of man which is <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> at this point in time at least haha, could not
  realize that his advice for letting these kids sleep at night would be so much
  more useful being used to wipe his own b*tt when he was in the sh*tter <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
  because damn did Nakami piss him more than I would have ever done myself.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Isaki-chan you will never understand... how great you are to be in
  Nakami's life by his side. I know this is win-win situation with the heartbeat
  therapy as collateral at this point but you know. All in all... can we give
  the sensei the award already? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, the I-Don't-Get-Insomniacs Award
  too? This dude doesn't care about students anyways. Either way, what an
  episode, setting up to stuff that will really require basically the whole
  class to know of his condition in order to clarify all misunderstanding, but
  heck. Why do that when your only assurance is Kurashiki and Isaki-chan who are
  all females?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ok I'm not the misogynist here this story is doing it.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Moving on though, I can see the drops happening as fast as the rain
  can carry them into the school trip, and I can't wait to just do buckets of
  tears so we shall see where this goes.&nbsp;

  So next week, I did see a few releases I might have missed so I'll be looking
  into
  <b

      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%9C%E6%98%8E%E3%81%91/1676803712?i=1676803713?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >seven oops' new song</a
    ></b
  >
  from March I've not heard anything yet and I may have missed more(?) so I will
  look into it. Also in the list is
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E4%BF%AE%E7%BE%85%E3%81%AE%E5%B7%B7/1683093838?i=1683093842?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >Kami wa Saikoro wo Furanai's new song</a
    ></b
  >
  in view of their new album in September which I might just give a listen then
  so I'll talk about it when it draws closer. With respect to new releases
  though, I will try not to miss
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/line-of-sight-single/1674689751?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >SCANDAL's new single</a
    ></b
  >
  which as I said did not get me two months ago with the one song so let's see
  if we can try again. *shakes head*
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%82%E3%81%A6%E3%82%82%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8F-special-edition-ep/1681073102?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >Aimer's new single</a
    ></b
  >
  is also for next week which probably is more hopeful so I'll focus on that
  instead I guess.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  The next thing I might do for my personal gain?? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Probably a
  relationship table for all the voice actresses I follow. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That's all
  you are getting by the way haha OR I can write a DOAXVV manager's diary.
  Basically like, a short write-up featuring anyone ON THE DAY THAT I have
  rolled SSRs of them within the week. For this week it was only Kokoro-chan so
  maybe she dropped by my room to ask me for some advice. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Cya guys
  next time then, and until next week if I don't know what to do with my work
  tasks maybe the new package will help me out when it arrives HAHAHAHA bye<br />
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Note to self Anime "Kubo-san" actually "returns" in 2 weeks after its
  hiatus from 3 months ago so don't forget, me, that I'm watching FOUR shows
  this season lol haha why
