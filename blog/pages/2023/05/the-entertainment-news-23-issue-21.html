I like how Sakura Ayane yesterday is like "my next Instagram live is next
Saturday which coincides with an Anime event so I might do it before the event"
which will be her in a makeup room. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> She did say this might not be
archived because she can't keep the before part of this transformation process
lol we all know everyone is going to praise her
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/suppin" target="_blank"
  >without makeup face</a
>
anyways haha how old is she again? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  Ah hey, welcome back. Another week, another I don't know my Friday was pretty
  busy especially with company event covering all the other stuff I would rather
  enjoy like
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJKIefQQ1yI" target="_blank"
    >Nan-chan playing a rhythm game</a

  and squealing (lmao dude if this is imouto power) or even the new DOAXVV
  update which usually is on Thursdays-

<div>
  Anyways, music and animation galore! I feel like I should change up the intro
  parts but seeing that I STILL do not have any idea on how to upgrade this blog
  to make it easier to maintain... maybe not we will stick with this hehe okay
  watch shows let's go "Kubo-san" is back dude<br />

  </blockquote>
  FINALLY we can stop talking about academics. I know, right? We got more
  important things to do. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> In this new episode hehe hey congrats
  Mitsumi on actually being in the Student Council as a secretary (#SkiLo07),
  looks like we have a lot of things going before we even start on the summer
  vacation. Well, for starters, the Student Council. Yay Mitsumi for being in
  one of the members, nay for Takamine... not being the leader. Easy summary of
  this is basically popularity, someone sniped the elections due to his crazy
  popularity in the school, that other senpai. Won't help Takamine in her case,
  so she can only be No.2, and we don't really need any longer to know whether
  this new guy is of any use, seeing that just a casual talk with his friends
  already revealed that he's just here for the seat. Oh boy, this guy is going
  to be useless. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sadly, Takamine takes offense to not being in
  position, but just as Kanechika-senpai showed the guys his first ever drama
  featuring himself as himself lmao, ambitions are far, and sadly, not
  everything will go your way. One can only do their best and see if the future
  accepts them for who they are. Or maybe Takamine can open herself up so maybe
  in the next elections she will have chance. Oh, they are done after their
  third year in school? Welp. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, it's that time of the year
  again, summer vacation, and some girls can't wait to pick their love doll for
  the season lmao no really that's pretty much it they only want your body
  Shima-kun, so he was just hot-headed enough to repel as much of them off as
  possible. Hey Mitsumi, don't take offense, alright? Can't stop them girls from
  asking me out, you know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Not me, him. I'm like Kenta and the others,
  bro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hmm should I fake this as if this part forwards is a tabloid or
  not... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah in a nutshell, Mitsumi did it too haha but not
  intentionally she did want the others to join since she was only trying to get
  souvenirs from the Tokyo zoo back to her hometown for Fumi-chan, but you know,
  slip of tongue Egashira can confirm on that lmao, she said
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/futari" target="_blank">the two of them</a>
  so I guess Egashira was right in not waltzing into the empty classroom at this
  time of day. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Who did waltz into the school though, was probably more
  of Shima-kun's concern because I swear all the girls he has met and/or
  rejected so far won't comapre to this... I don't know, she already looks like
  an arrogant b*tch so I will reserve my comments for next time, but looks like
  we might have more Shima-kun issues to deal with going forward. All in all...
  I'm so glad this school has Takamine-senpai to lead it. You know, as Vice
  President. We know Presidents of the Student Council are useless. Just ask the
  President of my home country. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Also <strike>Egashira</strike> Mika-chan
  you want to rat Mitsumi out? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If this girl here is not sinking in some
  deep&nbsp;<a

  no one will. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> While we ponder on these problems though, hey new
  character I guess! I don't know her though I'm not into fashion. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Well, sounds like a Shima-kun problem from the start he likely has
  acquaintances from when he was in the showbiz as a kid *deja vu "<a

  the b*tch will show us the way. Either way, spicy drama coming up!! YOU
  THOUGHT any of these guys will stir drama? Not even close. Haha see you then.

  P.P.S. "It's happening, guys! This pre-summer-break popularity rush is here!"
  *shakes head* Nuh uh no idea what this is but it's interesting lol "You will
  not see them during summer vacation... so a lot of people will ask for contact
  info or straight up ask them out" I like to know the backstory of those two in
  their seats as Kenta talked about this by the way <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Are they like

  </blockquote>
  You know the problem about the heat? Is that no one knows until you told
  everyone about it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yes I don't mean the marriage thing but also in
  this new episode (#ToniKawaS207) we are buying a new air conditioner so
  maaaaybe we drop in the marriage news to some of the new characters we will
  meet, yes? Not delivering invitations though, sadly, these guys are not doing
  a wedding dinner or anything. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, about the new girls in town. Well,
  they are in town we just did not know they were related to Nasa-kun. Well, not
  family kind of related. For starters, the couple wanted some air conditioner.
  Just a good reminder to tell you that they aren't in that apartment which got
  burnt down lol so they are in the spare room in the bathhouse, and well... not
  like we maintain the aircon in the spare room so I guess we are getting a new
  one!! Oh Kaname, don't worry about finding people to install it we got
  resident engineer Nasa-kun here. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, that isn't a problem.
  Problem is likely getting the tools to do so. And so, the couple take a visit
  to Nakiri-san's place, looks like this girl(?) runs a repair store themselves
  and will have the right tools for the job. Again, manpower not needed we are
  just here for the tools. Also they are kind slow so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And bam! The
  husband got it fixed fast enough for them to enjoy the night... in heat lmao
  hey no one said the thing was useful in curbing their emotions. Sure, it can
  cool them down but if they want to get horny this is not a technical issue.
  Haha moving on, we got more random stuff happening. I gotta say, it's still a
  surprise how little this social circle here is despite knowing quite a lot of
  people in this series so far, so this one's for Kaname. Some girl dropped by
  the bathhouse asking for Kamae (who we know) but talked about asking for
  advice which involved Shiba-kun (who we don't know) and yada yada you get the
  idea, then confusing the heck out of probably also us but mainly Tsukasa on
  whatever she wants advice from I don't know dude anyone get the signal from
  this alien yet? Where's context, even? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Context dropped by the
  doorstep real soon after don't worry everyone, and it's Kaname asking why
  Kyuuma-chan here did not attend school for the day. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah, apparently
  it's not the holidays but this girl here sure thinks she is in one. Also, how
  do you know about Nasa-kun? So many questions haha. Nonetheless, new girl,
  anyhow she's cute lol title drop, and as random as this girl can be I suppose
  dealing with her as Kaname should not be a problem considering we have a gamer
  nutcase in the house so this should be a walk in the park. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in
  all, kinda simple days in the story so far, nothing special besides people
  getting shocked at the marriage news... about a few more moments later than
  they heard of it lol did we mention this new episode is about dorks? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyhow, don't ask too many questions lest you can't answer them yourself or
  maybe the Anime production can't too haha, so let's see if they can confuse me
  any further even if I hesitate to ask about Nakiri's gender. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See you
  then lmao

  Yes, it's the subtitles, dude. Just... I don't even care though, I can make
  fun of it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though looks like we are in the summer
  heat (#KimiSomu06) and are not sad. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> That's good, I was about to make
  a Nakami getting sad about his sleep again joke. Haha since that is not the
  case it's fine by me, because we got a lot more to talk about. Summer is
  coming for this school also what a surprise everyone is on the same page at
  this part of their series haha, so let's get the bad news out first. Well, the
  photo, for starters. Despite the couple (hehe) sleeping out on the beach at
  night and illegally sleeping- I mean, taking photos of the stars without the
  teachers' permissions, still failed to take a good photo to impress Shiromaru,
  so welp. Thanks for the praises for part of the photo though, gotta give some
  positive motivation to the guy every once in a while just like for me too.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on haha, I will praise Ganta "<a
    href="sukekomashi"
    target="_blank"
    >Lady Killer</a
  >" Nakami (lol) for his photos of Isaki-chan though lol Ukegawa also knows
  anyways haha. Like, why is she offended, though? It's not like we took photos
  of other women- Oh, just between the two of us, got it. Dammit. Well Nakami,
  just like the Chirihama photo, you can try again next time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Do we
  have enough next time though?? Ah-) But yeah, since they screwed this attempt
  up for the contest their next chance is to organize a training camp - yes just
  the two of them - to try again at this opportunity to
  <strike>sleep together</strike> take photos of the stars well enough to submit
  something and hopefully get some school pride along the way. Haha imagine the
  school pride is a photo of them sleeping lol I don't think this series will
  take it this far also everyone is busy including Shiromaru who rather be busy
  then join in this lover's trip lmao, can only hope that they will do this
  properly this time around. Also things that they have to do properly for the
  Astronomy Club is to host a viewing party, if you can recall that's just a
  thing for the school, Ukegawa is ready to put them posters up for them, but
  uh... we can't use Isaki-chan's drawing. Since it's hard for the girl to ask
  her friends, Nakami did the asking around instead, also as helpers for the
  event. Firstly, Nono-chan. She'll be glad to help, but her favour in return is
  then to complete her Art Club assignment. Or I guess draw Nakami topless haha
  did I mention he was a Lady Killer? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She then drew the couple (hehe)
  dancing together or something I don't know what has that to do with
  stargazing? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, she was easy lmao, but the others were harder.
  Kanikawa, for starters. Real reluctant to help out a classmate especially not
  helping out a male classmate who pisses her off haha I know right literally
  girls when I ask them for help, so Nakami asked the other one who was into
  baseball instead. Her favour in return is likely just helping her out in her
  baseball pitcher practice, and just like Nono-chan, she was already in to
  help, and she advised the guy to leave Kanikawa alone and eventually she will
  join. And she is right, just like Kanikawa's mom mentioned too, "fear of
  missing out" was it? FOMO? Yeah, that's a term. So spoiled, maybe this is the
  easier way to get her to help after all. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All I knew was the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/okonomiyaki" target="_blank">okonomiyaki</a>
  store that was featured in the Anime because

  >
  dies? Please? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We can but hope. Seeing that this is a sad drama, very
  unlikely. Oh damn. Maybe we confess to her sooner than later, bro. Or if she
  is no good then maybe we move on to maybe Kanikawa? She is voiced by
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/10929/Lynn" target="_blank"
    >Lynn-san</a
  >
  but at least this one won't die. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay jokes aside we should not make
  fun of the deceased, this is VERY ominous and I rather not think about it THIS
  IS IN THE REAL LIFE DRAMA THOUGH?? Haha okay I better stop. I like the sadness
  drop at the end though, so yeah Nakami, if you worry to live to expectations
  of others then DON'T disappoint. Speaking from experience haha let's see how
  well the summer goes, yes? Mine though? Not much. I don't have a girl I know
  who I can sleep with to take photos at night lmao

  Kana-chan is back, baby! Haha I know right, what is with the hype, me.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode we have missed 3 months of (#KuboSan07), I hope
  you did recall what... uh... Kubo-san got for White Day. I was trying to say
  the dude's name but I forgot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, Shiraishi, yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And damn,
  did we pick up the pace real quick just coming back, because damn did Kubo-san
  get him real good just from sharing an umbrella in the rain, dude. And I like
  how Shiraishi's logic just realizing that he looked like a pimp has dropped to
  the level of Kyuuma-chan in "ToniKawa" haha ah hey who can I blame for that
  but just this genius of a girl, eh? I mean, it runs in the family. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Dude, we got him so good in just 5 minutes I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay okay
  story. It was raining, Shiraishi forgot his umbrella and I don't think the mom
  noticed it yet haha so yeah we have to share umbrella with Kubo-san who you
  know, still is the only one who will notice him especially when he did not
  being his umbrella with him. So yeah, she offered of course, he said no for
  many reasons than other even if this is an experiment (lmao) this is also a
  bad idea...? I mean, you guys went the narrow street ie. longer route so what
  do you mean this was a good experiment? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow haha this is so many
  levels I can't even, I like how Shiraishi's mom asked what happened to him
  without the umbrella. Oh yeah, the mom doesn't know. Not the same for the Kubo
  family though. We're better off just giving the umbrella to the dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Well, not like the sister Akina is going to rat on her I think we are good.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> No really, because next up, even the other sister Saki-chan knows
  what's up with these two. Oh yeah, this is actually the first time Ten-chan
  has talked at length, yeah. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> She was carrying some (extra) groceries
  from the supermarket in case someone screws up their lunch *points at Nagisa*
  haha but damn is she so act strong there are visible marks on her arms, so
  Shiraishi offered to help the poor girl to carry the heavy stuff like a
  gentleman. On the way to their place, Saki-chan did muster up her little
  courage to ask about his relationship with her sister and boy the guy was just
  sweatin'. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From carrying the goods, please. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, not
  even friends? Can't even call by first name? CLEARLY Saki-chan didn't know
  about formalities between opposite genders- Who cares, right? Just call her
  Nagisa, you chode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not least, we are celebrating what is
  left of the school year. Shiraishi is alone as usual lol the new class will
  make him invisible once again so that sucks, but on the girls' side it's
  probably worse since Tama-chan can only cry about how they might not be in the
  same class again!! You know, just being in the same class will help in
  building relations, isn't it, Kubo-san? Doing all the class stuff with
  everyone. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> This b*tch already betraying our dear Tama-chan with a boy
  haha BAN HER!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> BAN HER FROM THE GROUP FOR BETRAYING HER FRIENDS lol I
  mean what do I know. Oh by the way can I have some rice with that sweet
  thought? Thanks. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... we don't know who lost, but someone
  lost. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe it's Saki-chan. Maybe it's Shiraishi. Or maybe both, we
  aren't too sure. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also, and that's why this is better than "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san"
    target="_blank"
    >Takagi-san</a
  >" even though that's three seasons (and a movie) in, because this is 100%
  more shame on the girl. Like, right?? Of all the good stuff and positive vibes
  happening in this series though, what a great change from the depression that
  is "KimiSomu" haha I know right that is not that bad anyways, but you know.
  Love, innit? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> For whatever reason, change is about to happen in the
  new school year, so you want to take a guess what will happen? I dare you to
  make it so real <strike>the couple is in the same class</strike> Tama-chan is
  in another class because she failed one subject. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Wow okay me as
  Satan, calm down. It's all happy stuff in here, so damn, can't wait for those
  two to be in the same class again haha see you then
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "How close are you and Nagi-chan?" OOF haha hey Saki-chan ask your sis
  why don't you lol also he didn't carry the bags all the way to your place
  that's a hint tbh]

  it didn't haha the B-side wasn't that great and so is the topic song despite
  her promoting it being composed by someone she adores, it didn't work for me
  even with the

  which I'm not that impressed to be honest it just sounded great so I'm giving
  the leeway for them here, but still again they are still great despite only
  releasing one album last year. They be running the creativity fuel up crazy,
  so no reason to not listen to more of them.<br />

  NEWS TIME!! Hey, if it's from Twitter this week it's not going to be a lot,
  thank goodness. But seriously, we are EMPTY for June releases so that's a
  problem.

  in years is kinda disappointing as I could not find anything good about it and
  shout out to it being a "Sword Art Online" series credit so whatever we will
  deal with it when the full single comes out end of July.

  which surprisingly doesn't have a title so I shall guess from the upcoming

  so congrats for another tie-in she doesn't get that too often though I would
  argue her stay in PONY CANYON has been stellar so far so maybe it is the music

  Well, I definitely did NOT target to finish all the stuff I want to do over
  this weekend, sadly. Mainly because I was distracted by a certain... AV...
  actress lmao and more importantly, I had to clear up space on the PC it was
  running out haha fap fap, but also because I've also been listening to more

  this weekend in view of my regular Twitch streamer taking time off. More of
  the latter so excuse me while I listen to more of their indie albums since I
  haven't covered them all. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I did get some nostalgic 1st anniversary
  outfit SSR for DOAXVV so I guess Luna-chan did lie on my bed to wait for me to
  come back and we were MOST definitely not on top of each other haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> See
  you guys again I guess, and until next time... trust me, I want to revamp this
  site's design very bad but at the same time I rather not. We shall see how in
  about a year's time when it happens. Probably not see you then lol but yeah,
  next week I guess.
