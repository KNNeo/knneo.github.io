Another week, another I don't know my Friday was pretty busy especially with company event covering all the other stuff I would rather enjoy like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJKIefQQ1yI" target=_blank>Nan-chan playing a rhythm game</a> and squealing (lmao dude if this is imouto power) or even the new DOAXVV update which usually is on Thursdays- <a href="https://twitter.com/doax_vv_staff/status/1659492876462723072?s=20" target=_blank>THERE IS A MONICA UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENT IN A LIVESTREAM NEXT WEEK</a> lol I'm living the life pretty much- Was that a gravure idol as a guest?? Haha will report if I nosebleed lmao</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, music and animation galore! I feel like I should change up the intro parts but seeing that I STILL do not have any idea on how to upgrade this blog to make it easier to maintain... maybe not we will stick with this hehe okay watch shows let's go "Kubo-san" is back dude<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SkiLo07><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Skip to Loafer</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Are you guys in Ikajima doing well?" Yes, the people in Mitsumi's hometown, all of them are haha</div></blockquote>FINALLY we can stop talking about academics. I know, right? We got more important things to do. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> In this new episode hehe hey congrats Mitsumi on actually being in the Student Council as a secretary (#SkiLo07), looks like we have a lot of things going before we even start on the summer vacation. Well, for starters, the Student Council. Yay Mitsumi for being in one of the members, nay for Takamine... not being the leader. Easy summary of this is basically popularity, someone sniped the elections due to his crazy popularity in the school, that other senpai. Won't help Takamine in her case, so she can only be No.2, and we don't really need any longer to know whether this new guy is of any use, seeing that just a casual talk with his friends already revealed that he's just here for the seat. Oh boy, this guy is going to be useless. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sadly, Takamine takes offense to not being in position, but just as Kanechika-senpai showed the guys his first ever drama featuring himself as himself lmao, ambitions are far, and sadly, not everything will go your way. One can only do their best and see if the future accepts them for who they are. Or maybe Takamine can open herself up so maybe in the next elections she will have chance. Oh, they are done after their third year in school? Welp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, it's that time of the year again, summer vacation, and some girls can't wait to pick their love doll for the season lmao no really that's pretty much it they only want your body Shima-kun, so he was just hot-headed enough to repel as much of them off as possible. Hey Mitsumi, don't take offense, alright? Can't stop them girls from asking me out, you know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Not me, him. I'm like Kenta and the others, bro. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hmm should I fake this as if this part forwards is a tabloid or not... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah in a nutshell, Mitsumi did it too haha but not intentionally she did want the others to join since she was only trying to get souvenirs from the Tokyo zoo back to her hometown for Fumi-chan, but you know, slip of tongue Egashira can confirm on that lmao, she said <a href=https://jisho.org/search/futari target=_blank>the two of them</a> so I guess Egashira was right in not waltzing into the empty classroom at this time of day. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Who did waltz into the school though, was probably more of Shima-kun's concern because I swear all the girls he has met and/or rejected so far won't comapre to this... I don't know, she already looks like an arrogant b*tch so I will reserve my comments for next time, but looks like we might have more Shima-kun issues to deal with going forward. All in all... I'm so glad this school has Takamine-senpai to lead it. You know, as Vice President. We know Presidents of the Student Council are useless. Just ask the President of my home country. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Also <strike>Egashira</strike> Mika-chan you want to rat Mitsumi out? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> If this girl here is not sinking in some deep <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en" target=_blank>j-j-j-jealousy</a> no one will. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> While we ponder on these problems though, hey new character I guess! I don't know her though I'm not into fashion. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, sounds like a Shima-kun problem from the start he likely has acquaintances from when he was in the showbiz as a kid *deja vu "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/43007/Osananajimi_ga_Zettai_ni_Makenai_Love_Comedy target=_blank>OsaMake</a>" main guy*, so maybe we give him some chance to explain himself. Or maybe the b*tch will show us the way. Either way, spicy drama coming up!! YOU THOUGHT any of these guys will stir drama? Not even close. Haha see you then.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF-iOQTQSReteZsLuZxbzIywz0rTyYsLrzFWHa6-Qahq2tb4oY22mu3vuwM4z5_ocPcNYyF2_Tf5QU8Ufhu5WbRPAUM_fCTaDNejngrTkP5GfnnaPvMKj_RSM1Y9kz41FNMJPV6fDMQE9LMs1kwBZJ3I2SycNwM0jgDGjB4x3Bcya5cMozQaVd4LjG/s320/skilo07_memories1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>THIS is how you know there will be no swimsuit episode in this series<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijbnODSxK3YibSllMPrZXeMkcnvV1sgc5NMdIA4dp0ZHBKM346rOntEKq_azBslDHM0sqHEA7SGkBAAlsUFebV7r9N9H0wYQy9mF3h0jXMrgKGjpzHsmiPZO3ZWVLR2nufIvxkorzosxRXDXcpquSGdolvbfnAhHkBYEQ0mGVf40tsudSZNJlqNr5o/s320/skilo07_mitsumi3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me as a kid every day after school be like</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Without context Nasa-kun can install anything anyways so technically he's right</div></blockquote>You know the problem about the heat? Is that no one knows until you told everyone about it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes I don't mean the marriage thing but also in this new episode (#ToniKawaS207) we are buying a new air conditioner so maaaaybe we drop in the marriage news to some of the new characters we will meet, yes? Not delivering invitations though, sadly, these guys are not doing a wedding dinner or anything. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, about the new girls in town. Well, they are in town we just did not know they were related to Nasa-kun. Well, not family kind of related. For starters, the couple wanted some air conditioner. Just a good reminder to tell you that they aren't in that apartment which got burnt down lol so they are in the spare room in the bathhouse, and well... not like we maintain the aircon in the spare room so I guess we are getting a new one!! Oh Kaname, don't worry about finding people to install it we got resident engineer Nasa-kun here. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah, that isn't a problem. Problem is likely getting the tools to do so. And so, the couple take a visit to Nakiri-san's place, looks like this girl(?) runs a repair store themselves and will have the right tools for the job. Again, manpower not needed we are just here for the tools. Also they are kind slow so... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And bam! The husband got it fixed fast enough for them to enjoy the night... in heat lmao hey no one said the thing was useful in curbing their emotions. Sure, it can cool them down but if they want to get horny this is not a technical issue. Haha moving on, we got more random stuff happening. I gotta say, it's still a surprise how little this social circle here is despite knowing quite a lot of people in this series so far, so this one's for Kaname. Some girl dropped by the bathhouse asking for Kamae (who we know) but talked about asking for advice which involved Shiba-kun (who we don't know) and yada yada you get the idea, then confusing the heck out of probably also us but mainly Tsukasa on whatever she wants advice from I don't know dude anyone get the signal from this alien yet? Where's context, even? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Context dropped by the doorstep real soon after don't worry everyone, and it's Kaname asking why Kyuuma-chan here did not attend school for the day. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah, apparently it's not the holidays but this girl here sure thinks she is in one. Also, how do you know about Nasa-kun? So many questions haha. Nonetheless, new girl, anyhow she's cute lol title drop, and as random as this girl can be I suppose dealing with her as Kaname should not be a problem considering we have a gamer nutcase in the house so this should be a walk in the park. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, kinda simple days in the story so far, nothing special besides people getting shocked at the marriage news... about a few more moments later than they heard of it lol did we mention this new episode is about dorks? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, don't ask too many questions lest you can't answer them yourself or maybe the Anime production can't too haha, so let's see if they can confuse me any further even if I hesitate to ask about Nakiri's gender. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> See you then lmao</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgX0j3OTPHp6eL1jL7O1ABge6ezlJKBPRf04t_hl3PIUWD0kEJZyk84O7a1pWlBFP7tVqJpqc34j2RecFUGTAiioouK-qrvDEnbIc8MbLh6jjcV7y__iHoYmtiYEP8QAV46sYscdWE8vW4-4hBUwJIrQVfb209NYsqYzLpzBVGkCfF9YfEb3lVoztj4/s320/tonikawaS207_aircons.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Shout out to the fake aircon brands lmao "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/doushita target=_blank>doshita</a>" and "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/daiken target=_blank>daiken</a>" they should have went with <a href=https://jisho.org/search/daikon target=_blank>daikon</a><br>(And if you are asking that's Toshiba and Daikin, both Japanese aircon makers)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSSJI3T37uLy4-nDtp-KsASNIVqmwFMc5_VUTqLPdrll32ao8OYaYnD5C8dHZlGq8fyIrYUuZuhjyAP1RBWINN1TIS_OW1JPd1VozV5FEMY8-eDzsP3Hv02cwElH8t43el_TdEjkvp_Wpa8rgoWai8YQAhww3d75gMAC2JUm0fxaq6U7Xr0-2OK-T6/s320/tonikawaS207_shop.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Oh yeah there's "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/hatachi target=_blank>hatachi</a>" lmao how old is Nasa-kun again?<br>(Hehe so Hitachi)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJJ7OlwbpHmSHcdzDs4hEJDPhzq-AaI5LHa9BXRt3mY2PI_y5-2Dkssrn4-9yAUO0tiyvByVNGiNN-mz1GxjK71_aSX5cy7JJKmQhEbrykA91w4xFPilumrzYuqmZ3kivXS91-ggMFm4eyoy8FwzP7jQXz6xTPy5FMN4wtRP7WYLavizd8CSZdmmQa/s1600/tonikawaS207_what.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is such a good reaction GIF I just gotta</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha since that is not the case it's fine by me, because we got a lot more to talk about. Summer is coming for this school also what a surprise everyone is on the same page at this part of their series haha, so let's get the bad news out first. Well, the photo, for starters. Despite the couple (hehe) sleeping out on the beach at night and illegally sleeping- I mean, taking photos of the stars without the teachers' permissions, still failed to take a good photo to impress Shiromaru, so welp. Thanks for the praises for part of the photo though, gotta give some positive motivation to the guy every once in a while just like for me too. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha, I will praise Ganta "<a href=sukekomashi target=_blank>Lady Killer</a>" Nakami (lol) for his photos of Isaki-chan though lol Ukegawa also knows anyways haha. Like, why is she offended, though? It's not like we took photos of other women- Oh, just between the two of us, got it. Dammit. Well Nakami, just like the Chirihama photo, you can try again next time. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Do we have enough next time though?? Ah-) But yeah, since they screwed this attempt up for the contest their next chance is to organize a training camp - yes just the two of them - to try again at this opportunity to <strike>sleep together</strike> take photos of the stars well enough to submit something and hopefully get some school pride along the way. Haha imagine the school pride is a photo of them sleeping lol I don't think this series will take it this far also everyone is busy including Shiromaru who rather be busy then join in this lover's trip lmao, can only hope that they will do this properly this time around. Also things that they have to do properly for the Astronomy Club is to host a viewing party, if you can recall that's just a thing for the school, Ukegawa is ready to put them posters up for them, but uh... we can't use Isaki-chan's drawing. Since it's hard for the girl to ask her friends, Nakami did the asking around instead, also as helpers for the event. Firstly, Nono-chan. She'll be glad to help, but her favour in return is then to complete her Art Club assignment. Or I guess draw Nakami topless haha did I mention he was a Lady Killer? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She then drew the couple (hehe) dancing together or something I don't know what has that to do with stargazing? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, she was easy lmao, but the others were harder. Kanikawa, for starters. Real reluctant to help out a classmate especially not helping out a male classmate who pisses her off haha I know right literally girls when I ask them for help, so Nakami asked the other one who was into baseball instead. Her favour in return is likely just helping her out in her baseball pitcher practice, and just like Nono-chan, she was already in to help, and she advised the guy to leave Kanikawa alone and eventually she will join. And she is right, just like Kanikawa's mom mentioned too, "fear of missing out" was it? FOMO? Yeah, that's a term. So spoiled, maybe this is the easier way to get her to help after all. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All I knew was the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/okonomiyaki target=_blank>okonomiyaki</a> store that was featured in the Anime because <a href="https://twitter.com/kimisomu_anime/status/1658131931089842178?s=20" target=_blank>it was tweeted</a> I can remind myself to show you one of them easily. All in all... hmmmmmmmm... <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I mean... <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Can we not have another "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/36098/Kimi_no_Suizou_wo_Tabetai target=_blank>KimiSui</a>" plot where <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/157117/Sakura_Yamauchi target=_blank>the main girl</a> dies? Please? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> We can but hope. Seeing that this is a sad drama, very unlikely. Oh damn. Maybe we confess to her sooner than later, bro. Or if she is no good then maybe we move on to maybe Kanikawa? She is voiced by <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/10929/Lynn target=_blank>Lynn-san</a> but at least this one won't die. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay jokes aside we should not make fun of the deceased, this is VERY ominous and I rather not think about it THIS IS IN THE REAL LIFE DRAMA THOUGH?? Haha okay I better stop. I like the sadness drop at the end though, so yeah Nakami, if you worry to live to expectations of others then DON'T disappoint. Speaking from experience haha let's see how well the summer goes, yes? Mine though? Not much. I don't have a girl I know who I can sleep with to take photos at night lmao</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQHQyE2lsBAcCXPvjDewMZ6BePNwoM4xK70bRmTYdmU1s07qDEBmccG99uFbSzfdQzHlAfl2p5JimbhCLoZMq8LHK-Ce2lnHxikdvlvApipH4R0A-awJPTNN2_HOPx3yX4YUm0HU79FNRlJDuaRqobnzBejdo_0yh1n3ThMZS7puVRV_QMiG7SoyeA/s320/kimisomu06_bike.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Shout out to the minibike to the train on the countryside, wish I lived that life<br>(I am a city boi FYI)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjMS3lVjIG1opFPPT44xk3glVIDA3H_xBsJ41QEu9S2kKUcKIzqDr5jedUsLW9OOgWjOQEBfF44eg07-KZ-Hhi987kbgJn9USUBbHqHIOAvziyZ5GsmYcKA-f4oVnkObezutDKUG0Xy_3TGiZFH6eUikT7JkMbDQ_eIftrNEZiDRefPQCAZ85QkSIm/s320/kimisomu06_couple5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Oh yeah I saw this on the Twitter thumbnails lol this is no SHAFT-ing of the neck but close</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=2040 height=113 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhIvMJJioxZGO_grMbxFeCAZzj8OM53VoQAahUXgL0YUaJbCLkNnI40Dax9JFpW4Vfc3jXEPagb9NVAOPZ_oRhN0cHixRhcA1eIK2NMNF41aWhv9pdjkcEu66ZDjjyefDW6AmvLEDBmahoq1OEwg9WHPh0zYXPw-xNfUvBPT7mPuS2LYHAhjB4d7ZNu/s320/kimisomu06_girls3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Poor... who's that face with the smallest portion haha maybe that's why</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha I know right, what is with the hype, me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode we have missed 3 months of (#KuboSan07), I hope you did recall what... uh... Kubo-san got for White Day. I was trying to say the dude's name but I forgot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, Shiraishi, yeah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And damn, did we pick up the pace real quick just coming back, because damn did Kubo-san get him real good just from sharing an umbrella in the rain, dude. And I like how Shiraishi's logic just realizing that he looked like a pimp has dropped to the level of Kyuuma-chan in "ToniKawa" haha ah hey who can I blame for that but just this genius of a girl, eh? I mean, it runs in the family. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Dude, we got him so good in just 5 minutes I can't even. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay okay story. It was raining, Shiraishi forgot his umbrella and I don't think the mom noticed it yet haha so yeah we have to share umbrella with Kubo-san who you know, still is the only one who will notice him especially when he did not being his umbrella with him. So yeah, she offered of course, he said no for many reasons than other even if this is an experiment (lmao) this is also a bad idea...? I mean, you guys went the narrow street ie. longer route so what do you mean this was a good experiment? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow haha this is so many levels I can't even, I like how Shiraishi's mom asked what happened to him without the umbrella. Oh yeah, the mom doesn't know. Not the same for the Kubo family though. We're better off just giving the umbrella to the dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, not like the sister Akina is going to rat on her I think we are good. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> No really, because next up, even the other sister Saki-chan knows what's up with these two. Oh yeah, this is actually the first time Ten-chan has talked at length, yeah. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> She was carrying some (extra) groceries from the supermarket in case someone screws up their lunch *points at Nagisa* haha but damn is she so act strong there are visible marks on her arms, so Shiraishi offered to help the poor girl to carry the heavy stuff like a gentleman. On the way to their place, Saki-chan did muster up her little courage to ask about his relationship with her sister and boy the guy was just sweatin'. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> From carrying the goods, please. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, not even friends? Can't even call by first name? CLEARLY Saki-chan didn't know about formalities between opposite genders- Who cares, right? Just call her Nagisa, you chode. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, we are celebrating what is left of the school year. Shiraishi is alone as usual lol the new class will make him invisible once again so that sucks, but on the girls' side it's probably worse since Tama-chan can only cry about how they might not be in the same class again!! You know, just being in the same class will help in building relations, isn't it, Kubo-san? Doing all the class stuff with everyone. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> This b*tch already betraying our dear Tama-chan with a boy haha BAN HER!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> BAN HER FROM THE GROUP FOR BETRAYING HER FRIENDS lol I mean what do I know. Oh by the way can I have some rice with that sweet thought? Thanks. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... we don't know who lost, but someone lost. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe it's Saki-chan. Maybe it's Shiraishi. Or maybe both, we aren't too sure. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also, and that's why this is better than "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san target=_blank>Takagi-san</a>" even though that's three seasons (and a movie) in, because this is 100% more shame on the girl. Like, right?? Of all the good stuff and positive vibes happening in this series though, what a great change from the depression that is "KimiSomu" haha I know right that is not that bad anyways, but you know. Love, innit? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> For whatever reason, change is about to happen in the new school year, so you want to take a guess what will happen? I dare you to make it so real <strike>the couple is in the same class</strike> Tama-chan is in another class because she failed one subject. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Wow okay me as Satan, calm down. It's all happy stuff in here, so damn, can't wait for those two to be in the same class again haha see you then</div><div>[TL:DR; "How close are you and Nagi-chan?"

And last but not least, maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/lantis_staff/status/1660269748930908161?s=20" target=_blank><b>LUCK LIFE's new music video clips trailer</b></a> for their upcoming best album will make you think of them enough to listen to them in 2 months. I know I will <a href="https://twitter.com/lucklife_info/status/1660269712046190594?s=20" target=_blank><b>LUCK LIFE will be singing for Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" again</b></a> for the 5th season coming so you bet I will. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Maybe I should go to their Singapore live hahahahahaha I seriously do not want to listen to STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION though!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br> And next week shall be our review bomb season for the month, where I deal with <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%83%8E%E3%82%AA%E3%83%88-ep/1685611480?l=en" target=_blank><b>miwa's new single</b></a> which I've not been involved too much of even after the topic song music video, which I'll likely set that aside for <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ghost-pop/1678746630?l=en" target=_blank>Suda Keina's new album</a></b> which by the way is for Anime "SkiLo" so let's hope I can get something out of it, or else <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/shepherd/1681984345?l=en" target=_blank>SHE'S new album</a></b> will make up for it I'm sure going from the album trailer video online. Either way, this is gonna be good to end the month, so let's see that through, yes?<br><br><br><br><br> Well, I definitely did NOT target to finish all the stuff I want to do over this weekend, sadly. Mainly because I was distracted by a certain... AV... actress lmao and more importantly, I had to clear up space on the PC it was running out haha fap fap, but also because I've also been listening to more <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sabaku-no-kimi-he-girls-single/1526095034?l=en" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku</a> and <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sale-of-broken-dreams/1106279017?l=en" target=_blank>Homecomings</a> this weekend in view of my regular Twitch streamer taking time off. More of the latter so excuse me while I listen to more of their indie albums since I haven't covered them all. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I did get some nostalgic 1st anniversary outfit SSR for DOAXVV so I guess Luna-chan did lie on my bed to wait for me to come back and we were MOST definitely not on top of each other haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> See you guys again I guess, and until next time... trust me, I want to revamp this site's design very bad but at the same time I rather not. We shall see how in about a year's time when it happens. Probably not see you then lol but yeah, next week I guess.<div><div><br></div><div>P.S.
