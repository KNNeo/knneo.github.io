  <span><span>Hey, and welcome back to another series of posts where I talk about
      Klassic Note IT HAS BEEN 15 YEARS!!! #KN15YEARS Haha no really, I have

  </span>

  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <span><span>First up, we will focus on talking about artists and how they influence
      me in the songs I listen over the years, and how some of them in
      particular have made great contribution to not just song count, but in
      making me view songs differently over time.</span>
  </span>

<div>
  <span><span><br /></span>
  </span>
</div>
<div>
  <span><span>In the post below, I will talk about 5 artists of each "era" I define
      haha basically 5-year periods to talk about how much my music listening
      experience has been influenced by them, I was glad they pointed me in "the
      wrong direction".</span>

  <span><u>Ikimonogakari - The Ballad Song Veteran</u></span>
</div>
<div>
  <span>
    I would accredit this to also <b>YUI</b> to be frank, but thinking back I
    think most of the time it was Ikimonogakari's albums from 2008 to 2010
    (every year) that made me more than immersed into their melodies, and have a
    deep feel of what constitutes a ballad song. I can tell you, I hardly know
    how this works, the song structure, the tempo, into the lyrics especially
    when I hardly know Japanese at the time, but even so it attracts me to them
    time and again, I can't believe I can identify to a subgenre of songs in
    mention this well.

  <span><u>Lil'B - Duets Never Sounded This Well</u> </span>
</div>
<div>
  <span>
    When I started with Klassic Note, I never understood the appeal of rap duos,
    and I think these guys MIE and AILA-san showed me the way. From the rapping
    of AILA-san to the smooth transitions into melody for MIE-san, and every
    other song singing about love so nonchalant, it only makes its impact true
    and well when it's tied altogether nicely. Others like
    <b>HOME MADE Kazoku</b> also made me feel this way, to let me know about
    keeping pace in a song, and how the melody can be further enhanced by
    changing tempo.

  <span><u>AZUMA HITOMI - Starting Definition of Electronic Music</u></span>
</div>
<div>
  <span>
    I hated electronics in music. Synthwave, technopop, you name it. They are
    very fake, they do not have strong expression in music as compared to using
    instrumentals even with the piano with key notes similar to how music was
    synthesized, but this singer-songwriter in 2011 showed me how through the
    simplest of melodies these can sound as powerful as they are touching. And
    of course throughout the next decade onwards I have softened my approach to
    music genres, which in turn brought me to more artists with great melodies
    to impress despite specializing in this genre of music.

  <u><span>QUATTRO - Quirky Meets Cool</span></u>
</div>
<div>
  <span>
    I do not have much reason as to why I liked this band. Trust me, it wasn't
    until a bit later do I have the answer. But I truly believe these guys may
    have set the standards. From quirky melodies, beats to dance to almost to
    the extent of cool, and feeling gay (happy) in the process... It was hard to
    describe why I was drawn to this feels even back then. And this is still
    Rock music! Trust me, I've given my own taste of Rock music over the few
    years when I started with ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION and Sambomaster, but
    nothing comes close to this feeling. And that's why I think they deserve a
    mention. This will hit me back in many ways than other as I continue to talk
    about the ones below.

  <u><span>VELTPUNCH - My Alternative Rock Bias</span></u>
</div>
<div>
  <span>
    Ah this, my favourite music genre back then. I was an emo person, not really
    now to be frank. But back then, I was definitely searching for something to
    be depressed or escape from, and VELTPUNCH definitely delivered on that.
    From their old classics to their 2010 album and 2011, they have only been
    making waves to be slightly that much different from others, they are as
    indie as they are masters at their game. A shout and a cry and suddenly all
    my worries have been blown away by music.

    <span><span><u>LILI LIMIT - Where Male Vocals Excel</u></span>
    </span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <span><span><span>We all have our stereotypes when it comes to vocalists in music. Our
          gender is already our first bias for admiring the singing of the other
          genre, so in my case I'm much into female vocals since I started. Not
          surprisingly, with Anime and the many solo artists out there this is
          far from what mainstream has to offer. Cue artists who try to break
          the line with songs to dance to... by male artists and vocals - Yoru
          no Honki Dance, THE ORAL CIGARETTES and SHE'S you guys are also a part
          of this - they make me utterly change my mind on what it means to like
          music. Yes, frantically twerking in the shower. Because it really
          doesn't matter. The potential of walking away from artists catered to
          the female audience is such a waste, and in the first time ever, the
          ratio of male to female vocals reached its highest in 2015 when I
          tried to search for more of these, and I was not disappointed. Many of
          them still are in my Collection too.</span></span>

        and boy do they make sure their style stays that way. It's the

        also felt so much more from them: Their&nbsp;</span>imperfections is the reason why they sound so good. Their melodies are
      simple and memorable, and their lyrics continue to catch my heart. It was

      It all started with giving the one song for Anime. If I recall it took
      about a month to give that song? Probably the longest period of time from
      listening to it for the first time to putting that song in my song
      library, their mixed vocals is likely the only reason why I would give
      them another chance. But after that it was all history. They went from
      major to indie, I've given their albums time and again, and even till
      their end I've missed listening to how imperfect and simple these guys
      make their tunes. It hit on me real hard each time, even if it wasn't that
      impressive.

          they have chosen the path of writing their own songs, so guitarist
          MAMI-chan and drummer RINA-chan sat down to create their first
          impression of what it means to be a girls idol Rock band about 6 years
          after they relied on music producers, threw my mind into the abyss
          with each year upon year of songs to remember, and I can still recall
          how much I have liked what they have made, truly fantastic, my cousin
          even told me to buy a copy of their 2016 album for him. It's that
          real, seeing these girls grow up to what they want to be, even till

    <div>
      <span><span><span>No joke, ORESAMA was truly the ones that got me into giving more of
            Dance Pop genre, and what it truly feels. I would not have chosen
            another artist to understand this, and between PON-chan and her
            singing to what makes this band special in its own, I'm very sure
            they have influenced many just with their contributions to the Anime
            music industry. They may not have made grounds in their
            achievements, but to me they have produced so many songs for other
            artists like Ueda Reina, their style rubs off on me I can only wish
            for more, wherever they appear.</span></span>

        <span><span>These bunch of teenagers were meant to break ground, and they were
            so keen on it, I can see their potential even when I started on
            their indie times. Not every song will hit, but with their major
            artist debut, suddenly every single song is a hit. People liked
            their music, I liked their music. There was no stopping them as they
            make ranks inside Klassic Note and in everyone's minds. Truly a new
            generation of influence, these artists make their music generic yet
            still be able to make grounds, it's truly a sight to behold.</span>

      <div>
        <span>Have you heard of Shizuku-chan? If you know of this band, she should
          be called the mascot than just the only female member and vocalist of
          this Rock band. What separates these guys from the rest is really the
          crazy amount of production value they use upon their major artist
          debut around the same time I knew of them, and I cannot express more.
          Music videos time and time again put Shizuku on the spotlight, the
          others are just part of the backdrop, and that is what makes this
          group stand out. They also made plenty of songs to remember, which is
          probably why they deserve a mention with my heavy female vocalist bias

        I've appreciated indie artists over the years, and I cannot emphasize
        why artists like Tsuzuri Zukuri will make me like them naturally, and
        these guys are not any different. Their compositions also have reached
        far and wide into Anime and mobile games, and it's hard to think what
        would have happened if I did not give them a listen just because I heard
        of them through Chatmonchy. They create songs like any other, but
        somehow I can remember theirs more.

          Okay and we have our idolism solo female artist drop. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I feel
          like Mocho can be mentioned about in here mainly because it's
          ironically hard to find a theme with solo artists. Unlike the
          mainstream which are persistent in their style and as you can see some
          of them had to break themselves into an acoustic branch in order to
          differentiate away from their original identity, I feel like the
          production's focus of this particular voice actress in pursuit of
          romance songs over the singles leading up to her 2nd album and a
          little more beyond has been rather successful, at least, in my
          opinion. Without much Anime influence, she has single-handedly
          captured the hearts of many not by appearance I would say, but more of
          defining a set of feels about love only she has managed to capture. It
          did not last long because production saw through that and eventually
          changed direction, but boy was that such a trip.

        <span>Wow that was quite a list of artists to talk about, yes? Of course,
          this is not my entire opinion of all of the artists I've given songs
          to, but man, was touching on these a joy to think about after all
          these years, especially the early years too. Nowadays I don't even
          know whether I'm doing things right, or where my direction should be
          for Klassic Note moving forward. Maybe more of these posts will make
          me think of something soon. Next up, we will talk about artists who
          REALLY stood out among the others. Yes, this list of artists do not
          count. If they were here they are likely not the best. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Find
          out who they are in the next post then!</span>
