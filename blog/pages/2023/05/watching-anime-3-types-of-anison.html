  And welcome back for likely the final time! For this special
  <i>special </i>#KN15YEARS Klassic Note 15th anniversary special where we talk
  about specifically, the artists themselves which made this song library of
  mine possible to have lasted this long. This time around, I'll talk about how
  watching Anime has influenced what I listen to, for this is not just a
  coincidence. We definitely all started with watching these Japanese-made
  animations and it changed our lives. Well, at least it changed mine.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So let me take you on a journey, and show you just how at this point to be
  frank, ANYONE can be an Anison artist, and I can define for you, three types
  of them. Let's see if we can wrap ourselves around this!
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE ANISON ARTIST AND WHY IT CAME FROM ANIME</div>
<div>
  So for starters, let's define what I will later describe as "Anison" or aptly
  known as "Anime song". Problem is, the industry recognizes this term as
  basically anything related to Anime. Yeah,
  <b>if you as an artist sang a song for Anime you can be an Anison artist</b>.
  And that is clearly not true. In my definition of this term then, it's to
  describe those artists/singers who have been created solely for the purpose of
  the Anime. Yes, you can then say Kalafina is made from Anime, but that can
  apply to many cases today. So as you can see, the lines to define this are
  blurring with every passing year.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  We do not know for sure what constitutes the theme and insert songs for every
  Anime though, it doesn't seem like an absolute decision. If the voice actors
  have much talent or are even just newbies then getting them to sing might be a
  wise choice nowadays. If credibility is assure for the series then making sure
  mainstream artists take the helm might be better. And I guess everyone else
  can be just done by a solo artist, whatever. Regardless, it's what made Anime
  today, and it sure has influenced me into thinking what they represent so far.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE THREE TYPES OF ANISON ARTISTS</div>
<div><u>[1] Mainstream Artists</u></div>
<div>
  This is basically the way we all knew of Anime when it exploded in the early
  2000s. Horie Yui isn't exactly the most popular music artist out there, and I
  would assume song production for Anime is still kind of a high bar, so
  outsourcing (literally) to mainstream artists related to the associated
  (major, so never indie) music label (each Anime is normally tied to one) and
  let them draw on a canvas relevant to the theme. This obviously has its
  drawbacks as it's most suited for action series which can have a broader scope
  of theme especially for the endings, so Anime back then with a specific theme
  will not be able to capitalize on this power. When it does though, it would
  have a greater impact like none other, showing the flexibility of the artist
  to blend into the Anime's theme. Sometimes, even the artists define the theme.
  Nonetheless, it made many of our childhood, and brought us even further into
  some of their legendary music and what it means to listen to J-Pop or J-Rock
  back then.

<div>
  <div><u>[2] Anime Character Artists</u></div>
  <div>
    I would normally like to bring to you guys the attention of not just single
    Anime characters, but groups of Anime characters, and even worse, were given
    names just because it sounded better for the theme of the Anime itself. I
    can list any number of them if I want, but you get the idea. This is
    probably what I refer to as the "actual Anison" because this is where all
    the acting happens: voice actors go out of their way to not voice in Anime
    they were casted in, but sing songs that have to sound like their
    characters. Blending those in (get it?) will give you a more immersed effect
    for music in the series itself, I would argue, and that's how it's also a
    great idea for genres and/or presentation not like the usual, and it easily
    represents Anime production trying to make this as much of a package as it
    is possible. Still, it likely depends on the compatibility of singing voices
    in the cast which in most cases will be interesting enough if given a
    variety of characters in the main work.

<div><u>[3] Solo Voice Actor Artists</u></div>
<div>
  This is not just a recent trend, as it's more like it happens more than often,
  also more like a production decision where they can get any of the above to
  happen, and it's easier to promote a voice actor in the process on their solo
  music career, it's just smarter to let the relevancy of song composition be
  determined by the Anime music producers but let the voice actor artist sing
  them. It's a win-win situation especially in cases where the voice actor is in
  the cast of the Anime, making it more compelling usually for the audience to
  watch because of the theme song. This really depends on how you view Anime I
  know people who don't care about music in Anime, but nonetheless, as scheming
  as it seems, it has taken the industry by storm, and neglecting mainstream
  artists in the process. Still, they present the Anime producers' visions while
  further promoting the voice actors themselves. (Don't worry, I don't really
  give male idols here so rest assured the gender bias is heavy at this point.
  Not like it changed with respect to Anime character songs too but you get the
  point.)

  Okay, the following table only summarizes solo artists (because filtering
  people like yanaginagi and YUKI-san from voice actresses is a pain lol I don't
  have a condition for that tbh), but in general, this is what theme songs I've
  given over the years with the Anime I've watched, with respect to 2022:

  Wow surprisingly still overwhelming in the mainstream artists- Maybe it's just
  me rejecting all the Anime artists haha I can tell you I am not fond of male
  voice actors which are counted in here which is none <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> and Anime groups
  so we did not include the single Anime characters in these which aren't many
  anyways. Again, I wish I can prove my point by putting the whole "K-ON!" and
  "OreImo" cast of character songs but then what is the point even. Shout out to
  2017 though, proving my point. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  Well, at this point I could've concluded this week's talks about artists in
  Klassic Note by announcing a compilation or two, but instead, I'm going to
  leave you a little teaser on what I have planned next.
</div>
<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><b></b></span>
  <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-size: large;"><b>#KN[10+2+2+1=15]YEARS</b></span>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div>
  Yes, I'm still referring to the compilations by the way, with relation to
  artists. Not necessary related to the posts I've done so far but find out what
  these mean NEXT TIME!! ON-
