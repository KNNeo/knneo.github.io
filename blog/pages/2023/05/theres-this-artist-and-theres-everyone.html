    >Welcome back to the series of posts where I will focus on the 15th year
    (#KN15YEARS) in Klassic Note theme: Talk about the artists themselves. The
    backbone of the song library I have. How they made me know I am not alone.
    But truly, there are ones that stand out and I swear that applies for every
    listener out there, so in the myriad of songs I've listened to, I would just
    like to point out on who they are, because subsequent ones will never be as
    good as what they have done.</span

<div><br /></div>
<div>HOW SOME OF THEM HAVE COME TO BE</div>
<div>
  The segregation of such artists exists for all of us for good reasons. They
  can be the first you have heard of they truly got you. They may have been a
  great memory in your life, say, when you watched that credited drama or Anime
  that came with it. For me though, I think it's mostly the same as the norm,
  just that because I take melody so much more seriously, whether a song is good
  or not truly depends who ends up having the good songs. And we know these
  cannot be controlled: Mainstream artists typically write their own songs and
  that defined their image, solo artists have songs written for them so it
  depends on whether the producers can understand their vocal range and/or
  style.&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  The metrics below is just a summary of what the artist has contributed to
  Klassic Note: Releases reviewed or listened to, production-wise distributions
  ie. who did the songs themselves, singing voice preference, etc. I will base
  them on two main criteria - ability and quality - to show you the differences
  between mainstream and otherwise, on the objective and subjective opinions I
  have of them. So if quality goes over ability means my bias is heavy.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  But yeah, overall this is still based on my personal bias, so if you hate what
  you see after the next paragraph you are free to come back next time where we
  talk about more of stuff I like. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So! Let me take you on a journey... (which is basically just a summary of
  first 5 years again up till 2012 so don't mind me haha)<br />

  But me, this woman has already moved on since 2012 so her band and that wasn't
  doing too well, so why still her name in place? Well, because precisely that
  her name has been set in stone in Klassic Note, that it's still worth
  mentioning.
  <b
    >I cleared the majority of her singles, quite a lot of albums including the
    best albums</b
  >
  with my high minimum clearance of at least 85% songs in my library... what
  else is there to say? miwa may have already passed her in song count at this
  point in 2023, but that is not the point:
  <b>She started my motivation to listen to more Japanese music</b>, and I
  cannot thank her enough in this regard. She also taught me of listening to
  songs with just a guitar.
  <b>Probably also what spawned me to take up guitar</b> in high school (junior
  college) even if I didn't go as far as she did.

    allow me to do this once more so I can actually be happy with this. So sorry
    to all the bands out there, yes even Chatmonchy and ASIAN KUNG-FU
    GENERATION, because <b>no one makes songs like these guys do</b>. The
    fast-paced singing, the beats that will never die, the emotional feels of
    ballad songs but done their way... there are just too many classics to talk
    about even without comparing to anyone else. This is no longer about song
    count; This is just a matter of preference.
    <b>I don't know if I can find an adequate replacement for these guys</b>,
    and I don't even know if they will ever be replaced, but they hold a special
    place in my heart.

    should not forget other Anime characters who sang plenty of songs to
    remember and I think the record holder is still Kousaka Kirino in the crazy
    attempt to <strike>create</strike> outsource the laundry list of ending
    theme songs for Anime series "OreImo" (two seasons worth of it), not all of
    them are masterpieces, and not all are as well done as what PONY CANYON has
    set out to do with "K-ON!" from the start. That and how it changed the Anime
    music industry, is probably what made it stand out in Klassic Note.

      heavy ground for example back then when SCANDAL was technically also just
      idolism and I disgust on that <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤®">*pukes*</span> but nowadays
      <b>I can see the pureness on these unison of voices</b>, and I must say
      that MusicRay'n has managed to do so in their first attempt to make this
      happen. It's not perfect, I did not like Takagaki Ayahi and her singing
      voice for years until I listened to her solo artist songs,
      <b>but them together is what makes them different</b>. With also an easy
      influence at the end of the 2000s when the industry in Japan isn't
      overwhelmed with such content, they excel and shine with every Anime
      credit they were in, it's hard to forget about them. They may not be what
      they are back then, but it's hard to talk about ClariS, TrySail or even
      Earphones without remembering who started this trend in the first place,
      in my little world of music.</span

    most of them. Many other voice actresses have done so too to me, but this

    >Yeah, I feel like seniority plays a big part of the mentions above, but I
    gotta say that it's also because it has been this long, that I've not
    forgotten about my roots, even though I have already moved on from then.
    This is probably my final tribute to them all since many of them are pretty
    much done especially Anime and idol groups, can't expect them to be dancing
    forever. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We will proceed from here, and onwards we shall discuss
    about the only thing I did not care about after all these years: music
    genre. Yes, the only genres I have in my song library is just Pop and Rock,
    by the way. Okay maybe Jazz but still. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> We will talk about proper
    genres in the Japanese music I listen to at length, next time!</span

    >TL:DR; Come on, many of these charts for most listeners out there is just
    one song and I love this artist until the day I die. Pft, please. I beg to
    agree, not without listening to more of them, and more that are like
    them.</span
