It is SO DAMN HOT TODAY this weekend and my sis made the right choice of going
to Australia (ie. it's 16 degrees Celsius there now) while I make my mom sweat
with the heat here so shout out to Mother's Day where that politician who
dropped by our doorstep to drop a flower AND to also gave one to her downstairs
by the way, did more than what I would EVER have done for the past 3 decades on
this day. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, she got two flowers already she doesn't need more lmao
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Still kind of sad overall this week after having such a great break last week
  but damn did that package make me so happy that was all I was looking at at
  work. On break times haha I did not slack off at work- ANIME!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And
  music if I'm not suffering from a nostalgia trip run and feeling bad for not
  giving new songs even if they aren't bad. I mean, I can still go by the melody
  thing... right?

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Well, at least they can share their guys around once they reunite the hometown
  again- Okay that sounds wrong forget about that actually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new
  episode though screw you Mitsumi lol (#SkiLo06), say this isn't a romance
  series. I dare you. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, I really am envying the rainy season
  this series is going on so far, and I don't mean just the weather before the
  exam period is coming up but it is super duper hot in here lol, since I don't
  think the rain stopped these tensions happening between the lot of them, so
  let's talk about it. Firstly, Shima-kun skipped school for the day. Hey, we
  all kind of do that, maybe just fake a reporting sick but maybe have to answer
  to the teachers especially if it's just literally for no reason haha, but you
  know, there are such times. But for Shima-kun here I suppose it's most of the
  time going from what he told Mitsumi later, but suffice it to say this does
  NOT go well with obedient and ambitious Mitsumi-chan over here, because you
  know, exams be coming and you <em>gotta</em> take in the first info about what
  in the syllabus is in the papers. (Spoiler alert? It's all of them so just do
  revision on all of it, yes? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>) She's going to do the Takamine-senpai
  approach and tell Shima about the news in school including the rumours because
  how else you gonna stay popular without them fans talking sh*t about you lol,
  but yeah, in his words and I agree completely, he simply does not care. Like
  really, I care more about my work than he cares about school lol. Moving on,
  and I don't think this hurts as much as to me than it is to both of them,
  because they are class representatives and don't forget the teacher's a
  slacker haha the true Shima-kun right here, they gotta hang out to prepare
  handouts. And that's where it went down, but yeah in focus we are talking
  about the weight of such events with respect to the individual, isn't it?
  Shima doesn't care about school or even exams to this topic, and Mitsumi
  doesn't care if she offends her first friend in Tokyo. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But I guess
  she did, she didn't sleep well, and Shima-kun technically was troubled over
  this he had to talk to his buddy about it. So what do you think? Is he going
  to chase up to her or is she going to drop to his level? Man, but that will
  ruin her life isn't it so maybe we be the nice guy...? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Problems I wish
  I had. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nonetheless, this needs to get resolved, and I'm glad one of
  us is doing it, so good on you, girl. This guy does not even care- He does
  though. On their own private conversation, Mitsumi does care if Shima-kun is
  in school so she can hear more rumours and then clarify with him lol, and
  Shima apparently is more concerned about his... rather tarnished image in
  front of this girl. Hmm... <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> All in all... oh boy is it getting hot in
  here. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, not just the weather here, I tell ya. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No wonder it
  hit the Twitter trending when it aired earlier this week, damn. Yep, the part
  we are waiting for it finally dawning upon us. So uh... you think Mitsumi can
  study for exams now? Haha or you think this is a Anime "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen"
    target="_blank"
    >Kaguya-sama</a
  >" situation where it won't matter? Dude, if she crashes ie. maybe drop out of
  Top 10 in school that will be AWESOME haha remember kids, school isn't all
  about studying. Sometimes you
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38778/Midara_na_Ao-chan_wa_Benkyou_ga_Dekinai"
    target="_blank"
    >just can't study</a
  >
  or you gotta skip school once in a while lol don't do that please maybe do
  that after exams or something haha okay maybe also don't do that lol obedient
  me can we stop? What we can't stop is this development though, so let's see if
  next week is the swimsuit episode- Okay who wants to see Mitsumi in one
  anyways...? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also one last thing, I'm fairly amused how the author of
  the series can make the main couple feel awkward yet be able to carve out a
  resolution from their conflict, if you get what I mean. Top notch drama
  writing, I aspire to be that hehe
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I haven't made up with someone else this dramatically since I was in
  elementary school!" I don't think I did it since middle school lol TMI also

      bath scene works lol<span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Okay okay NOW I gotta shout out to Anime series "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/189/Love_Hina"
    target="_blank"
    >Love Hina</a
  >" most of their romcom antics must feature an open bath just because they are
  in one. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Open bath, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, this series' author
  didn't pay me enough to feature "Hayate no Gotoku" talk though I believe there
  is such things in there too lol&nbsp;(#ToniKawaS206), but yeah it's hot
  springs trip Part 2 sponsored by Kaname's mom of all people, but heck, I think
  the only thing I've learnt from all of this is that Nasa-kun wants to bathe
  together with the wife, DUDE!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's some honeymoon alright if we did
  that, and just forget about the guardian Tokiko and LET'S GO... before that,
  maybe just spend the day outside for a bit. Wife says this kind of thing only
  happens after dinner. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And as Nasa-kun prepares himself to man
  himself up to talk about this to the wife I suppose, they went out, took
  pictures of each other and I assume mostly the wife who cares about the photos
  of Nasa-kun he's not cute anyways <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, they had a great dinner in the hotel
  because damn did we mention about how luxurious this
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onsenryokan" target="_blank"
    >hot springs hotel</a
  >
  was anyways? The rooms have their own open-air baths? Yeah, that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The
  husband wants to make full use of that somehow. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So blah blah
  Nasa-kun FINALLY gets his own courage up to tell the wife of his bold, selfish
  desires and the wife... let's just say approving of this action already made
  her embarrassed ten times over Nasa-kun internally bleeding mostly because of
  not the bath. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I guess they did do this naked we can't prove on the
  guy's side though but I'm pretty sure Tsukasa didn't stick any n**ple pads on
  so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, if it's a sight for us to see, then it's not this Anime. Or
  any Anime series actually if you can see them then I'm pretty sure they can't
  air on national television. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... man it was a great shame
  fest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All he remembered was her naked body though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But
  seriously when can we see
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/34951/Akari_Kitou" target="_blank"
    >Kitou Akari</a
  >
  nak- ANYWAYS haha, it's your usual fanfare of the embarrassment train you can
  hear the horn on it too lol, and you know, besides Tokiko getting in the way
  lmao we really should just leave the lore as is, the couple had a great time.
  No Chitose to spy on them lmao, no Aya-chan to talk about whatever she wants
  to talk about, no Kamane-chan to try out whatever her stereotype is of
  lovey-dovey couples... it's just fantastic. "It's just cute" haha title drop.
  Next episode looks like it will bring us more new characters I can finally
  talk about the cast lol, but heck, let's see what their role is in this... I
  guess then finding out how one can be married this young lmao I'm sad now I'll
  stop here

  I really think this Anime series is really trying to set us in the mood.
  Because... right? You can't always walk in with this mood unless you see
  Nakami's sad life as he wakes up. Oh, I meant him in the morning we don't know
  if he was waking up. Yeah. Also, the friendships in this class because they
  are effectively none. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#KimiSomu05) let's
  see how the class&nbsp;<strike>enjoys</strike>
  <strike>goes through</strike> burns through the three days outdoors, yes?
  Also, never suggest such things ever again this is boring af and I agree with
  Kanikawa we can do without sleeping outside and sitting by the fire. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  But sadly this is a class trip, so heck, might as well go along with it like
  Nakami is doing for that piece of sh*t classmate probably just because they
  both know their nighttime secrets and so does the ripped sensei lol, but more
  like Nakami is also capable of setting up the tent AND cooking curry all by
  himself destroying all stereotypes of popular people haha like no sh*t dude
  how can I aspire to be like him? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not that I'm that classmate though,
  just bragging about not his own abilities to the girls afterwards, but
  whatever, if you are here for all this campfire bullsh*t drama you can watch
  another
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a> Anime I
  don't care. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What is great about this other world though, is what
  happened, if I didn't count wrongly, at Night 2. Night 1 was bad, the guys
  wanted to see the girls' tents but obviously someone was standing guard so
  don't ask me why these guys didn't try again the next night when the teachers
  are not outside lol, but Nakami did. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay not to the girls' tents he
  doesn't go to the girls, girls come to him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And so they did gather,
  as promised to Isaki-chan herself, Night 2 was clear on the night skies which
  is also probably why Kurashiki-sensei made sure the teachers slept well with
  the dose of alcohol hehe good job, Nakami took this brave step and prep his
  camera and tools to head out to the beach to see if he can take some shots..
  of the night sky. Oh yeah, of course also of the girl, but heck, even without
  both of these, he was already having a great time. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Man, if I go
  through all the Hell these few days especially with the MORNING F**KING RUNS
  just to get Magari Isaki... haha I guess that's the whole point of falling in
  love, huh. Oh look at me, you lonely f**k- Moving on haha, maybe just like
  elementary schoolers holding hands, we should just let high school kids of
  different genders sleep together next time- Okay maybe not this also haha, but
  honestly saying though? This sleeping thing? It's kind of a sort of therapy.
  If we can exclude morality and social norms of course. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> That aside
  though, thank goodness they woke up on time around 5am hopefully the teachers
  are still dead as a rock haha hopefully the students are too <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, so the
  couple (hehe) of students here can make their way back after taking maybe a
  ground-breaking photo of <strike>Isaki-chan</strike> the stars- Seriously
  though, can the real life drama adaptation even make it look this good??
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> *looks at trailer and shakes head* All in all... I was just thinking
  of when will be the drop. When we had to wake up from the dream I am currently
  witnessing. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But hey, nothing bad happened which I assume they are
  fine I guess I mean Kurashiki-sensei did put them teachers nice and drunk
  lmao, and then again she as advisor of the Astronomy Club should be supporting
  what they are doing which is NOT sleeping with each other at night haha I know
  right, but for the photo-taking of the stars at night as training or even for
  the upcoming contest. I'm pretty sure if the storytelling this episode is on
  par then we definitely have a photo to please Shiromaru when we get back. Oh
  damn, this is just turning out to be as condescending of a series than it's
  also the best secret you wish people know about this Anime, this is serving up
  to be real good for the season. Let's see what happens next haha it's going to
  be that ripped sensei at the crossroads oh come on it's 5am they can make it
  <span class="emoji" title="🤞">*fingers crossed*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I ask myself this sometimes at 30 (lol) but ask yourself this, when
  was the last time you had a good sleep? Without anything stopping you, 1x good
  sleep best conditions possible, waking up totally refreshed even better than a
  cup of coffee? For me? Around when Nakami lost that too, honestly. But I don't
  have insomnia I can sleep it's just my battery capacity is just ridiculously
  low lol I miss the days I can sleep till 1pm already haha yeah]

  For real, why are songs for these few months so hard to give? Am I stuck in a
  rut now? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Anyways, this week on Klassic Note I've managed to clear my
  additions for yuiko's new and best albums so that's good.

  is the winner here if you consider winner as in cheating lol, but also that
  they didn't get me more than I would expect, as I let one pass because of the
  guitar riff, and another for the mood COMPLETELY ignoring the melody aspect of
  the songs, I will say. This year in Klassic Note is not a good year.

  and yes this is a new song in two months and it's motivating enough for me to
  like this and I tell you I rather listen to this 26-track release than go to
  their upcoming live here in my hometown in Singapore so <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> haha I'm
  sorry&nbsp; guys this will have to do you guys will only sing Anime theme

  as expected after they became an independent label their first thing to make
  impact will likely be this but we are about half a year later into the party
  to let's see if it can hold up after the two digital singles.

  with left than 2 weeks into the release date with a SONG COUNT OF 45, still is
  too many songs to talk about with my meagre knowledge about this group so
  maybe I'll take this time to fill myself up with old songs instead of
  Homecomings lol.

  is for their new album and is earlier in the week as digital single for the
  get-go and I think it's okay, I hope they really have more to offer in their
  new release next week, I really missed last year. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  for her upcoming single due end of May is mellow in feels but not as emotional
  mainly because it's a song for the new spring season, and I would also call
  this my feels for the new year as in it's rather plain so let's see if her new
  EP can impress me compared to the Valentine's Day one earlier this year.

  after a decade since the band formed, and that will bring themselves down to
  only 2 members, mainly the vocalist and their regular guitarist. Oh boy,
  <b>they also announced a hiatus</b> to re-evaluate the band's direction going
  forward. Man. We are so screwed- And I just praised you guys on the KN15YEARS
  post earlier this month!?? Dammit, now what. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well let's hope for the
  best then, we lost so many artists already it's a matter of time before they
  join the ranks- The EP from earlier this year is already an indication lol

  which was in a year and three months after their previous? Damn, these guys
  also printing out songs. Not that they will hit the legends we created here in
  Klassic Note almost a decade and a half ago, but heck, they are the most
  promising so don't disappoint me too much, RyokuShaka. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span><br />

  I was trying to finish the video game "Mail Time" while Ayaneru was doing her
  Instagram live so priorities first I finished the game before dinner yesterday
  haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> It was a fun game I thought, indie game where you 3D-platform (and
  that is likely my only complain, the controls) around the world to essentially
  do fetch quests for cute animals eventually delivering mail to the one animal
  which... spoiler alert in case you want to play,
  <span style="font-size: x-small;">is in hibernation.</span> <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Welp,
  maybe try next time, Emma. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you guys next time then, and until
  next time... I got a lot done this weekend and will be testing my own projects
  if the work projects are still in pending stage at this point lol maybe I
  should ask for more work it sucks to look at slackers in the office when you
  are one too-
