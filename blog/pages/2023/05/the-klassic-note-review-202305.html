  that one. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oh well, let's see if this can update my impression of
  her.

  This was on the mailbox last night when I saw my dad open it (lol oops) and
  apparently it can fit in there but there is no way I could have done that AND
  published a post yesterday <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, so here we are a day later with another
  Klassic Note Review! Hey, we almost got a post each day for this week. Almost.
  Still, I feel like this will be a thing to talk about a month later, so let's
  get to it!

  (Oh come on, artist cover art for sure Suzuki Airi is a beauty who even cares
  about Shinomiya Kaguya)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: Well, it has been a long time coming, but to be honest, this might be
  her last time coming. With the end of Anime series "Kaguya-sama" and her from
  being featured in the Anime opening theme song with "Anison's newbie artist"
  Suzuki Masayuki to now singing her own songs with her major label debut which
  we have reviewed a year ago, and now this. She has come a long way as long as
  the Anime series itself. As I ponder how these artists can hit me time and
  time again, I then realized I got tired quickly of the opening theme but focus
  myself more on the insert and ending theme songs which is where this Suzuki
  here comes in. With one last chance to impress, she puts forth an emotional
  song for us to remember.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>[1] heart notes</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Always as lost (as I am)</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(I) chanced upon (you)</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">All of this became</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Only (of) my very own feelings</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">My heart notes</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">The sweetness and bitterness</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(I) will embrace it all</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">All of it"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  How should I feel about this... firstly, emotional. It represented the end of
  the Anime series it was credited in, so of course we will feel that way. But
  more importantly, was what I came out feeling listening to it. The lyrics
  spell an easy tale of company, in the form of synchronization of heartbeats of
  sorts and thus the song title and as it was mentioned throughout the song,
  it's a song of strong feels as it is of a confession. To be with and accept
  all that they are without holding back, it draws similarities with the
  conclusion of the animation itself, and you can take my word for that. The
  melody is an easy-listening tune without much quirks, and of course suffers
  from the usual bridge issues in this case for being rather long in my opinion,
  but that is very typical of Anime theme songs, so I am not going to complain.
  Enough to please, not enough to remember, would be my impression.
</div>
<div>Rating: Touchingly Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This is just a single-track single to rip me off, and that is
  though the harshest thing I can say, I have given quite a lot of thought about
  how to like this. It is still a great emotional ballad I can't deny its
  greatness, but as much as it has proven its worth, it did not touch my heart
  more over the Anime it was featured in. Nonetheless, I still think this was
  worth a listen, and fans of the series will appreciate this as being the
  conclusion of what was romance.

  Okay relax, don't be too surprised by this, this is not a
  buy-her-single-get-a-stack-of-whoever-that-is-bromides kind of offer (lol),
  but thanks to CDJapan's proxy shopping service and my failure of getting the
  latter into the package I'm shipping in soon basically next week hehe, so I
  had to add it to this since in this case, they could get the product for me.
  So ignoring that!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's talk about how awesome this solo artist's
  physical packaging of just a single song is, shall we?

  For the special bonus though, I chose to take the same one from all the other
  stores (which should have been

  of the cover but I guess not?) instead of any of the usual ones like

  since the bonus is actually a selection of

    >three random photos</a
  >&nbsp;(plus one rare but we don't talk about our chances at that lol)
  regardless of your purchase from which store and also for the above reason,
  but also that not like the others are exactly that great or is worth an
  incentive to make me get them through other places considering the charges, so
  don't mind me if I'm just taking a simple bromide photo of Suzuki Airi
  here.&nbsp; I mean, I got two of these and NONE of Kanno Mai?? I'm a disgrace
  lmao

  It's all solo artists, huh. I could've dumped in

    target="_blank"
    >Fuchigami Mai's new single</a
  >
  if hers isn't Limited Edition only which I have stated I will never simp on
  solo artist music video Blu-Rays haha good for me on keeping this record
  going, but that is what happens I will just miss some of these. You can blame
  my 2013 self for skipping that one miwa single back then for all this.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, hopefully we can get more mainstream listens in here soon
  but unlikely haha, I can actually make a statement about how much I love
  Japanese women singing. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See you then. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. IRL update lol because I will say it tomorrow again, just Kanno Mai
  Instagram live is a joy. You should watch it live someday. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> It's like
  a long distance call with my not girlfriend, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
