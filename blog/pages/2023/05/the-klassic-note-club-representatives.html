    >Welcome back! In my series to talk about artists in the #KN15YEARS Klassic
    Note 15th year anniversary special!!! This one is going to be rough, we
    shall talk about artist genre. Yes, not song genre. Because it's hard to
    recommend an artist that is purely something these days, so maybe through
    this, we can figure something out.</span

<div>
  For starters though, yeah, this is where we can ONLY talk about mainstream
  artists because if you look at a solo artist and tell me they only focus on
  one genre I will-

<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So let's! Let's... see how many music genres I actually know after so long
  haha *shakes head*

  I mean, as I sit down and think about how this works, and I could not fathom
  if I could do this properly considering music genres in itself is kind of
  ambiguous these days,
  <b>I will try to find those who stay true to their style</b>... for most of
  the time, enough for me to not think of them as multi-genre artists, I
  suppose. Otherwise, it's just
  <b>more songs the more chances it can be in this</b>, right? Representatives
  are also selected based on popularity, after all. And if any genre is more
  gender biased than others don't blame me, I am still a male listener anyways.

        Well as you can see, it's not a lot, I can't define all the in-betweens
        to be honest a lot of them are diverse in many ways than other if you
        listen to enough of them, and yes that includes solo artists so a lot of
        them aren't in this. But that's the point, to show the diversity in
        genre of music I listen to or you may potentially find out there in
        Japan's music industry.

    I don't know about this genre to be honest it kinda crosses with Ska in my
    opinion, but yeah, if you want Jazz Jazz from like the Western side then
    this is not what you might find in Japan. I've only heard of actual Jazz
    bands I think the last time was from Audioleaf I forgot who they are lol,
    but yeah I've only heard of PE'Z and think they are the only ones who carry
    the feel and are still the most popular. Even when they moved on and formed
    H ZETTRIO the feels did not go away, and that's a good thing.

    Well, it used to be them. This genre set has been around in Klassic Note too
    much and too often, but only appearing in and out too much that it has
    caught my attention. Little do I have the chance to encounter artists who
    sound good and sound entirely different from their Pop and Rock counterparts
    to allow them to have a place in the music industry. Maybe Rap has to be a
    genre in here too, since it's hardly anything if not combined with this
    genre set, in my opinion. I don't give Pop/Rock with Rap because it's kinda
    lame, and these guys are enough to make me interested. That's pretty much
    it.<br /><span>Other Members: Kroi, Creepy Nuts, CLIFF EDGE, Suchmos</span>

        Ah, about this. I have to say Electronic music is around in my life
        probably as long as Klassic Note itself to make me notice, but that
        doesn't mean it's the most dominating genre out there. Many artists have
        suffered at the hands of dropping out of mainstream using this genre,
        and we have seen its repurcissions of artists who disbanded.
        Nonetheless, the best songs I've heard of often come from this genre
        itself, and more than ever they make a better impression than other
        genres will ever.&nbsp;

          Ah yes, where all uncertainty exist. I mean, I look at the official
          genre list for ID3v1 specification and you can see that like so many
          of these "Alternative" genres are like they don't want to be with
          their main counterparts... I understand, genres that do not like
          popular mainstream? That's half the reason why Klassic Note even
          exists! Jokes aside, I have my selection of artists I like over the
          years also overlapping the Rock genre, no surprise, but to determine
          whether they stand out of their genre is another thing altogether, so
          I won't mention too much but touch only on the ones I know that are
          uniquely different.<br /><span

          Okay, we are at the most popular genres now, this is going to be
          rough. *ahem* In an attempt for me to talk about what J-Pop generally
          should be, and in between what Pop genre itself should be represented,
          I chose to not talk about the former because damn that's every artist
          in the list, but instead let's talk about artists who hardly use the
          fusions to other genres to achieve great music. From mellow tunes to
          the most hype of feels, not playing with drums is probably the easiest
          way to talk about how these artists stand out. It's hard to define,
          but it's all out there. What Pop music have you not heard of, really?

        And because I'm old, here's the only music genre I can get behind: The
        drum beats, the guitar riffs, the strong feels of wanting to ROCK the
        genre itself has become a verb in itself... I can only define as much as
        talk about the many songs that came after it. Decades old as a genre,
        many artists in Japan have come back time and time to either relive the
        classic genre or add new feels to it while preserving what essentially
        makes it great, inside every song they sing. And that is what is truly
        in it for me to be frank, for now and forever. It's a timeless genre,
        isn't it?<br /><span
