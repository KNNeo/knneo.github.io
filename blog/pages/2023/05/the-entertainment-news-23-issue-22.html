And... we are already at the end of the month and weekend huh, how fast. Oh
yeah, gotta cancel my idolism for Marinka haha maybe I do her for another year
lol it's just the subtle negativity after her recent recovery that is bothering
me to be honest (I promised myself to be happy~ I guess not anymore)
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Speaking of idolism, literally was out with my sis buying dinner (lol) when I
  remembered that Sakura Ayane's Instagram live was at that time too haha so I
  am just glad I took out my phone to screenshot (sadly not video lmao) all the
  times where she just do the boob(?) slip on camera by bending over to show us
  her face when they was doing her makeup for an Anime event. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> I mean,
  it's not &lt;insert list of voice actresses I will jerk off to&gt; so I'm not
  aroused in any bit. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, felt bad for her similar to some of her
  fans who (1) let her notice that she is just flashing online lmao and she did
  realize that eventually, and (2) told her maybe not archive that live at all.
  Like, don't even consider at all since it's just us remembering your flat
  chest-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways haha, I think this front part <span class="emoji" title="*dabs*">😎</span> will take the intro of this post
  I suppose lol trust me I did not type the above immediately since last night
  lmao no I really didn't it just left such a memory on me it wasn't hard to
  forget about these screenshots I sent to my bro <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> but yeah, Anime and
  music I guess!! I feel like recently I don't even want to play video games
  anymore. Making a new image gallery is more of my passion lmao okay let's
  start<br />

  </blockquote>
  Oh damn, had to ask guardian for advice but they will be the only one
  suspecting you going out with someone of the opposite gender? MOM PLEASE haha
  in this new episode though (#SkiLo08), hey (sorry Touyama) Nao-chan? Don't
  worry. Like, I can assure you that much. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Which is why you SHOULD NOT
  NEED TO visit them in the zoo too lol hey you want to guess if the aunt has a
  husband? Hey, if this series is any indicator let's just assume the "uncle" is
  also her, okay? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, why is Egashira Mika here? <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> This girl,
  she's just jealous of Shima being asked out for a date(?) because it's not
  her? Poor girl. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Like, Screw the main couple, man. I'm just into this
  girl now. (Hehe crazy deja vu on how I treat romance series) And Nao-chan is
  so on point throughout the zoo trip too, observing nothing wrong with the main
  couple but can't help poking into the shy, shy tryhard girl who has such a
  huge desire for love, yet still needs to be offered some advice so she can
  really not think like a jealous b*tch sometimes. Hey, you think she's going to
  change anytime soon? Not if you are Shima-kun you won't. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Because
  damn, despite Mitsumi wanting this date (lol) to last longer than it should
  have, and Shima-kun being so considerate about her condition under the heat
  maybe coming back another day where it isn't burning our skin would be better
  haha, still refused to think that what Mitsumi does to her family and friends
  ie. buying them souvenirs regardless of what they are, will make them happy
  nonetheless. Again, can't be happy about gifting gifts if you haven't been
  happy receiving them. *taps brain* Moving on, and I learnt about this
  recently, it's all about updating your self model, Shima-kun. Not that I would
  pique into your life with that Ririka-san in the past and whatever you did
  with her after that karaoke session lmao, sometimes it's time to really move
  on... maybe that's a little harsh to talk about to be frank considering this
  model thinks its all his fault for whatever she is going through now haha
  really you think so? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, this woman is irritating, so I rather
  deal with Yuzuki, who is right to think that hanging out with this bunch would
  be way better off than in her middle school days, probably cemented by the
  fact that she is so high spec and people rather dunk on her than be friends
  with her the moment she talks to another dude yes including the school janitor
  lol, did go around to learn that maybe resetting her social life again would
  be good. I mean, Egashira also did that, isn't it? She transformed into this
  whatever beautiful girl right now in high school also. Just, judgemental.
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Way too much, she can't learn to be herself. Logical as she is, it's
  not until Nao-chan told her to go back to the gang and say her family dinner
  is postponed that she actually gets to enjoy some girls' time with the lot
  where hopefully, we don't talk about guys they like. I mean, at least Yuzuki
  won't do it. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... I think that with anyone having Shima's
  experience, that it's precisely because you have been a women's man that you
  would think otherwise, isn't it? Not like I know what it feels like to enjoy
  doing that, but we know Shima-kun doesn't. Also, he is <i>practically</i>
  getting blackmailed, we aren't talking about that?? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well,
  Shima-kun you do you dude. Maybe when Ririka-san here settles down with not
  you then you will be spared. Hopefully. Fingers crossed, everyone. Otherwise,
  you'll be glad to know the rest of the episode is great! Nao-chan is MVP even
  though damn I wish Egashira is my
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/waifu" target="_blank">waifu</a> hehe
  imagine simping on side characters in a romance series in 2023 lmao, and man,
  the drama's cooking up. Well, if it's for the sh*t to hit the fan we have a
  couple more episodes so let's at least ensure Mitsumi won't be dragged into
  Shima's problems. I'm coping a lot here by the way we know it's going to
  happen where we will have to accidentally push Ririka off a cliff-

  Wait Kaname, so women are like cats? Hmm... <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh, it's a test from a
  website.&nbsp; <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, everyday problems you know, dealing with your
  girl reading some personality quiz or love test or stuff and then making your
  reaction determine how much they will get mad? Everyday event. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> In
  this new episode (#ToniKawaS208) we learn about exclusivity in articulation.
  <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Well, not like certain vocabulary are banned, but I think Kaname is
  not wrong when it comes to Nasa-kun not giving a damn since he's married
  already, but yeah, reassurance. Bro. You need to do that more often to your
  girl. So uh... about that. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> I think we have watched two seasons worth
  of Anime to know this, but yeah, Tsukasa doesn't have this problem with
  assurance haha I mean we all know even including her that Nasa-kun loves hear
  dearly (damn you
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">normies</a> lol),
  but you know, that just got the guy thinking. Hey, if he does, at least he is
  trying to keep this relationship going by reading comics, to say the least? My
  parents don't even- Moving on lmao, and that's basically what this series is
  about I suppose, talking about stuff like this maybe is also a reminder to all
  couples or even married ones to think about how to love each other instead of
  thinking of this as a chore. Speaking of, don't you think it is a chore to go
  to the bathhouse just to bathe every day? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> I know right, where's that
  new apartment even. But yeah, not happening anytime soon, and Kaname KNOWS
  this married couple is in desperation of some lovey-dovey action, so yeah, you
  bet this is the least we will see in real life married couples in an empty
  bathhouse. Okay, not really empty because somehow the male side sauna is still
  occupied LMAO I am SO GLAD Aya-chan is the one receiving the end of this
  romcom plot, or else I think Tsukasa screaming as the two inside with Nasa-kun
  walking into the sauna would not have been this funny. Or high, depending on
  who you ask, because I'm pretty sure I'm with Nasa-kun standpoint here, too
  hot so I'll just leave in a few minutes. But according to the wife, you gotta
  battle against the heat? So... yeah I guess? I don't really know much about
  this but damn, is it getting hot in there. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes, and I meant both
  sides' sauna. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... maybe I should try the sauna sometime.
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> No I really haven't, not even the one time I went to some condominium
  (I don't live there btw) and they have that by the pool. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> Anyhow
  haha, things are getting hot in here and I don't mean the weather at this time
  of the year that is a given, but think about this series as like, a case study
  of talking about love stuff when you are married, yes? I know right, and I'm
  still single. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, maybe this is just prep school for me since
  what do I even know. What I do know is, as much as this is not content heavy,
  it does give off a sense of vibes that Tsukasa is cute lol yeah just like
  Nasa-kun thought haha no what I meant was, that this just gives off some chill
  feels, to think about relationships in general. No drama, no hype, just
  between the two of them. Okay maybe talking to the mother-in-law is important
  too but let's leave that for next week, yes?

  But do you know? By taking one more off their hands they can end their shift
  ever so slightly earlier? Yeah, doing a service, why don't you. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  Anyways, enough about being nice lol, we can be selfish and talk about this
  episode (#KimiSomu07) and how much we want some yukata on Isaki-chan and we
  DID NOT GET ANY!? WHY THOUGH??? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah okay we did, please, she felt
  bad. So, about the marvel that is this episode which deserved its own special
  ending song. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Well, we had the summer festival downtown, but for the
  Astronomy Club, it's the opportunity for them to tell people to go go the
  viewing party in school in the near future. Of course, reality check in case
  you wonder how this works, it's not just to spread the word, but you know,
  this is the only real way they know how. Come on, we don't watch ads on the
  Internet. Maybe slapping it in your face just like what Isaki's friend Anamizu
  did would help you get interested to you know, maybe bring your partner or
  family along to "dance under the stars". Yeah, probably should've reworked on
  that flier artwork to be frank, who even does that nowadays. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways,
  it's probably not much, Ukegawa also knew of this as much as that a**hole
  classmate of Nakami, so I don't think all the fliers are given out at least
  not the stack his buddy was holding, but you know, Nakami did promise to watch
  the fireworks on the roof with Isaki-chan, so he gotta. And so he did. What
  happened afterwards I think really you should watch for yourself because damn,
  we have gotten so close every time. Hey, that's the whole point of this,
  amirite fellas?? Falling in love with someone, that sort of thing. Yeah don't
  miss that too much me, you didn't have this life. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> What happened
  afterwards when the other girls left was even better though actually, and yeah
  did I break a sweat hearing Isaki jinx herself into climbing up the edge of
  the Observatory and boy I thought this was it lmao, but yeah maybe her luck of
  not dying in these ways and of a heart condition is better off, with people
  around her saving her every time, don't ya think? <span class="emoji" title="*wink*">😉</span> Thank goodness
  though, we don't have to change your heart out at 17 or something, right?
  Good, good. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> (That was a "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50709/Lycoris_Recoil"
    target="_blank"
    >Lycoris Recoil</a
  >" reference I thought we have another

    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/204621/Chisato_Nishikigi"
    target="_blank"
    >Chisato</a
  >
  here lol) But yeah, as Isaki has told her side of the story in the new lore
  drop, she is fine now, but had a hospitalized childhood where she had to visit
  the doctor many times to get her heart working enough like a normal person.
  Not surprising, I'm working backwards right now to be frank, but yeah, hearing
  that heart stop for a bit is definitely worrying. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> I need to see the
  doctor lol, but suffice it to say, maybe it's just the right time too, that
  Nakami then I swear you could've done this many episodes ago, suggested to
  talk to her at night if she can't sleep, because ironically, Isaki's insomnia
  issue is psychological. And so, they found some middle ground where Nakami can
  just broadcast himself talking at night something like
  <a
    href="https://twitter.com/kimisomu_anime/status/1660676643076345858?s=20"
    target="_blank"
    >this Tweet</a
  >
  which they did actually record one haha if you have been following their
  official Twitter account you would have known, recorded for you know, maybe
  not just Isaki-chan who can't sleep at night. Yeah, ASMR maybe, but I want
  &lt;insert idol name here&gt; to do this can we have that also? <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Oh,
  <a
    href="https://twitter.com/3rdMR_staff/status/1661854662138695682?s=20"
    target="_blank"
    >they are only two minutes long</a
  >? Dammit. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, lovely episode right here this might be the
  best we have seen so far actually, where they finally knew of each other so
  much more haha Isaki has an elder sis Nakami is interested in lmao, and they
  talk their hearts out, literally. And that's the thing, right? Sharing of
  burdens between friends. Well, probably more than friends at this point but
  who cares, dude. The flower is blooming and I can't wait for it to blossom!

<div>
  [TL:DR; "I mean, it would be pretty scary if every person we come across
  looked cranky and miserable, you know?" But they are though haha well this is
  Anime for starters so this can't happen <i>too </i>often]

  OH GOD THIS KID IS GOING TO CRY!! EMERGENCY PROTOCOL WHERE IS THE KNIFE- In
  this new episode haha I'm so sorry I won't joke too much on the other series
  but I will joke the heck out of this one (#KuboSan08), hey Seita-kun is the
  most obedient kid I've known in the Anime universe already.
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/25275/Momo_Kawamoto"
    target="_blank"
    >The one from "SanLion"</a
  >
  doesn't count. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really, Seita-kun is MVP. Every. Damn. Episode.
  Which happens that he is in this one so let's talk about what he did.
  <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Mom got son to get groceries and I guess Seita-kun wants to join in
  the fun haha and that's why I say this is great for my unhealthy sit-in
  lifestyle lol <span class="emoji" title="*sigh*">😩</span> And on the other camp we have the Shiraishi foretelling
  gang over here. We got Nagisa the main girl <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>, we got Saki-chan who can
  predict what is happening, and Akina who then realized what is happening.
  <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> AND SO THE HILARITY ENSUES lol okay me, relax. Of course there is
  only the one supermarket around haha don't be too surprised it's not like
  where I live where you have a couple of those within walking distance, so yeah
  of course both families will meet up at some point, and here is when Akina,
  above all else that is happening between the guys lol, asked them out to join
  them in viewing the (<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sakura" target="_blank"
    >sakura</a
  >) flowers the next day. And of course now with them invited, Nagisa will have
  the motivation to do some sort of cooking to impress her boi, no? <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  Yes Akina, all is going according to
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/keikaku" target="_blank">keikaku</a>, as you
  expected. I mean, she had to patch Saki-chan and her sister up (which makes me
  wonder, they don't live under the same roof??)&nbsp; after the latter screwed
  up her usual cooking but still definitely absolutely wanted to make some great
  hamburger steak to her boi, did still make some by herself with some help
  because she knew the guy would like them. Not wanting to lose somehow,
  Saki-chan chose to taste test first and thus, stole that first whatever thing
  that lovers do to their cooking. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah Saki-chan here is EVIL haha oh
  well you think anyone cared? It's just different seeing <i>the </i>guy you
  like eat your cooking- MOVING ON haha we are finally at the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hanami" target="_blank">flower viewing</a>
  event. Wow, so much lore I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Because yeah if you aren't
  basically Akina over here haha apart from her being drunk and laying her own
  body over the only man in the group lmao (do they even have parents to take
  care of this woman?) (haha so many questions), probably served to piss off
  Nagisa real bad but seriously though, did she need to be this mad considering
  we know that this is already coming? I mean, we didn't expect Seita-kun
  falling in love with Saki-chan for some reason lmao, but seriously, Nagisa
  being jealous over what she wishes she was drunk so she can do what her sister
  did to her boi?? I mean, you are underage so no alcohol for you but <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  And I think you get the idea, and that's why Seita-kun is MVP because apart
  from just not throwing tantrums at anything haha I guess he has no reason to,
  he is also a expert mediator in this situation probably even in any situation
  I would argue, that made Shiraishi equally as confused as Nagisa feeling bad
  for being mad at the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">elder sister</a>
  just crawling all over her boy. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Seriously though Akina you can crawl
  all over me anytime just don't ruin the main couple alright? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in
  all... ya, even if I don't drink beer I know this is a great episode to drink
  beer with. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Unexpected secondary character plot over there thanks
  Seita-kun much obliged haha, but yeah, this was just a fun episode as it is
  with the other ones mainly because Nagisa isn't teasing Shiraishi so much so
  as to just get teased by I don't know, and also Saki-chan because her cooking
  is so much better for some reason. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Hey, great opportunity to learn
  how to capture the guy you like with your cooking, yes? So let's make sure
  that works for Seita-kun- haha like anyone wants a sequel featuring how did he
  fall in love with some girl older than her? <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> Haha dear author you
  just blew more of my mind in this episode than the petals flying around by the
  way

  This week on Klassic Note should be the... second best one so far in this
  month alone, and that's good. It's rather expected even more than what I
  thought, but yeah now that I think about it this probably can't win last
  week's list. This is because

  is actually surprising to me until it wasn't because he did self covers for
  his own indie artist profile (yes, he major debut under his own name, a common
  thing in the music industry) from like a decade ago so I don't know if I
  should be happy that I didn't like his most popular song so far. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span>
  Well, most popular song in this album would do, for starters. Also, I can stop

  even though the topic songs are the last to be on my list and not all of them

  impressed by the album this time around. So yeah, overall great week, really

  to shame lol I did give the B-side so I guess this is a trend now haha, but
  really makes me think about whether any of these will be worthy to talk about
  by the end of the year. We shall see about it.<br />
  <br />
  Well we suddenly got an influx of news on Sunday this is today (lol) so maybe
  we check out all the latest stuff that is on Twitter and that is music, yes?

  so I guess we can start from that, it has been a while since they had new

  of Anime comes by I guess, plenty of them are slated in July by the way even

  SpecialThanks and Porno Graffitti, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> There really isn't going
  to be a lot coming next month so maybe I should look back on the rock
  festivals now, a good time to listen to older songs that hopefully aren't a
  decade ago like those two we listened to previously. HUWIE~!!
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh yes, for next week also, announcement on the
  #KN15YEARS site so stay tuned for that, still doing preparations for that to
  be honest but I will make it happen on time now that I've said this twice on
  this post lol<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />Next week is going to be a short week here so at least the DOAXVV update
  did make this month end AWESOME!!! So yeah, about that beach volleyball

  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/re-sukui-n" target="_blank">RQ</a> special

  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, see you guys then, and by the time we reach the next month I
  should be ready to unveil the next announcement for #KN15YEARS. Or if I don't
  then maybe I'll do up a blog post to make up for it since I'll have a day off
  from a public holiday in-lieu AND another public holiday to make up for it.

  did this but I thank whoever in the staff for putting her in haha I did not
