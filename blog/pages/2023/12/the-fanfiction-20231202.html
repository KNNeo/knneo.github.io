<div>I don't know how deep is my love for you, Minase Inori, but I promise you, I love you a lot. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know Uesaka Sumire also loves you but did she ever write weird fanfics about being together and being cheeky? Oh she just does it in real life. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Welcome back to another episode of the losers corner lol, where we celebrate Inorin's birthday in the best way possible: By writing yet another story to continue on our lore of benefactor relationship, in case you need a reminder. As usual, I will only write her in a cute image just because as I stare at my phone wallpaper, I just think sexy Inorin just <em>isn't </em>my thing. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Or is it...?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Minase Inori sitting on a wooden table holding on to a white covered book with its inner binder against her chin" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=355 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl513698.jpg title="Minase Inori" width=139></div><div><br></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>Minase Inori and I met up once again after what seems to only be a few weeks since she saved my life. Ironically, she wanted to meet up near my place. I did not find it strange until she arrived and told me she wanted to go to my place!</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>The people in my house were surprised I brought a woman home, as I quickly shoved her into my room. I then told her I'm getting drinks for us and closed the door behind me. When I came back, I saw her about to open a large white book. She told me she saw this inside a closet, which I meant to keep all my personal stuff!</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=へ、なになに、これ？なんでそんなに緊張するの？>"Oh what, what is this? Why are you so anxious?"</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>She flipped over some pages and then covered the book to her chest to stare at me. She then placed the book faced down. We sat at different ends of the room for a solid minute, in silence. She then decided that going outdoors might be better, and we left the house for the afternoon.</i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>No, nothing about s*x, people. I just want a good, embarrassing time and that is not on the agenda. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Trust me, I had a hard time thinking between this and another one I have prepared which heck, I might as well save that for Valentine's Day. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah so next year, we are ending this year soon already. This is what, season 2? Hell yeah I like to do sequels just like every other Anime now <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, and unless I can find new images from my current source (thanks Suruga-ya as usual), we will have more lore to talk about the women around my fictional life right now. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you then.</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. To not keep the suspense or else there won't be a next time lol, she's likely flipping through like, my bromide photo collection or maybe a photobook? Yeah maybe I put a white cover on it so no one will know? Wait, maybe I should do that haha ah</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. Oh, I intentionally wrote "the people in my house" were surprised because I can keep that lore in place since, as you would recall, I *sometimes* live at the Natsukawa abode. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> SPICY DRAMA ACTION GO haha you think there can be such a thing going on with Nan-chan and Inorin just like Ede-chan and Miyu-chan did in Anime "Hyakkano"? This can only happen in Anime-</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
