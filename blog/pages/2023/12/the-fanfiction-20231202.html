  I don't know how deep is my love for you, Minase Inori, but I promise you, I
  love you a lot. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I know Uesaka Sumire also loves you but did she ever
  write weird fanfics about being together and being cheeky? Oh she just does it
  in real life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Welcome back to another episode of the losers corner lol, where we celebrate
  Inorin's birthday in the best way possible: By writing yet another story to
  continue on our lore of benefactor relationship, in case you need a reminder.
  As usual, I will only write her in a cute image just because as I stare at my
  phone wallpaper, I just think sexy Inorin just <em>isn't </em>my thing.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Or is it...?

      Minase Inori and I met up once again after what seems to only be a few
      weeks since she saved my life. Ironically, she wanted to meet up near my
      place. I did not find it strange until she arrived and told me she wanted
      to go to my place!

      The people in my house were surprised I brought a woman home, as I quickly
      shoved her into my room. I then told her I'm getting drinks for us and
      closed the door behind me. When I came back, I saw her about to open a
      large white book. She told me she saw this inside a closet, which I meant
      to keep all my personal stuff!

      She then got even more curious and flipped over the pages. She then
      covered the book to her chest and went silent, as we sat at different ends
      of the room for a solid 10 minutes in silence. We then decided that going
      outdoors might be better, and both left the house for the afternoon.

  No, nothing about s*x, people, I just want a good, embarrassing time and that
  is not on the agenda. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Trust me, I had a hard time thinking between
  this and another one I have prepared which heck, I might as well save that for
  Valentine's Day. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah so next year, we are ending this year soon
  already. This is what, season 2? Hell yeah I like to do sequel bait, and
  unless I can find new images from my current source (thanks Suruga-ya as
  usual), we will have more lore to talk about the women around my fictional
  life right now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you then.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. To not keep the suspense or else there won't be a next time lol, she's
  likely flipping through like, my bromide photo collection or maybe a
  photobook? Yeah maybe I put a white cover on it so no one will know? Wait,
  maybe I should do that haha ah
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Oh, I intentionally wrote "the people in my house" were surprised
  because I can keep that lore in place since, as you would recall, I
  *sometimes* live at the Natsukawa abode. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> SPICY DRAMA ACTION GO haha
  you think there can be such a thing going on with Nan-chan and Inorin just
  like Ede-chan and Miyu-chan did in Anime "Hyakanno"? This can only happen in
  Anime-
