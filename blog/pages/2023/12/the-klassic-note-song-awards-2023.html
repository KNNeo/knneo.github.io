    🎊WELCOME TO THE KLASSIC NOTE SONG AWARDS 2023!!🎊
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  I'm Aozaki Shouhei, Klassic Note's only listener and judge. It's that time of
  the year again, where I sit down in front of my PC at the end of the year to
  commend and rank the songs I listen over the year. This year is a year of
  change, but unlike what was with 15th year anniversary last year, I have
  marked this year as a year of more drastic change. Following artists I've
  liked over the year but have not performed well will be shelved over time, as
  many have announced their hiatus or even brought their music careers into an
  abrupt end. On the other hand, I am more focused on giving new, prominent
  artists which I would have not followed just because of a hit or two.
  Nonetheless, we will find more artists to listen to, as I continue to branch
  out even further towards styles of my interest, being more strict in reviewing
  releases and avoiding subpar songs here and then. This will hopefully help to
  bring forward a paradigm shift towards melodies I would prefer more regardless
  of presentation, its lyrics, or even its style, following our new motto of
  "Searching For The New Classic".
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  As usual, I will state this every year and I will state it again, the results
  below do not fully represent the many songs I listen to for the year. Past
  year songs are typically suppressed since recommending them is not as trending
  as the ones who are presented for this year, so I will withhold in promoting
  them, though when they are, it's always because they have made more than
  impact in my life. New artists are still sprouting as they seem, sadly being
  critical of them unlike how the earlier artists I listen to, would not help in
  their cause, but as to stay with my motto and criticism, I will continue to
  find ones that I like, if they still stand to impress. Overall, this is just a
  fraction of what is to come, and what I think of them songs and artists for
  the year.

    The results below will be split into six segments, with the first two
    covering statistics and analysis of the songs given this year and how they
    fare. Diagrams will be shown in some segments to give a better overall
    picture rather than just displaying tables of data. Other segments include
    commending artists and songs that have stood out among the crowd, and awards
    for recipients who deserve more attention. Finally, I'll conclude on with
    The Top 20 and an audio edit of them by yours truly, so to give you a better
    idea of what songs truly represent the year around when it comes to music I
    listen for the year.

<div>
  This year, I have given a total of <b>246 songs</b> over the past 12 months.
  I've spent more time on each release longer compared to past years in
  recognition of their efforts even listening to them the second time in a year,
  and find comfort in giving familiar artists and new artists I picked up alike.
  The Internet might have helped with exposure even more, and with music
  streaming services it has become easier than ever to give any recommendation I
  see them on YouTube and/or Apple Music, hopefully providing than enough
  bandwidth to listen to classics of newly found artists and their new songs
  too. It definitely did not stop the momentum of giving new songs though; I am
  just giving more songs per release, more often than ever.
</div>

      Firstly, I break down the songs to who sings them and sort them by artist
      composition and gender, giving a good look into a usual heavy bias of
      female solo artists singing good songs, also known as the Vocals
      Popularity Survey. For this year, Female Solo vocals have risen to the
      yearly average of 1.3 to 1 against Male Solo vocals, which shows a nice
      balance of mainstream artists against female solo artists for the year.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Then, we have the Song Rating Integrity Survey. Initially taken as an
      experimental analysis in Klassic Note to fix my biased opinions of what is
      a good song, now it is used as a guide to follow past years judgement
      criteria so my judgement don't go too far off the perpendicular. As I give
      further detailed analysis to the many songs defaulted to the generic
      4-star category, this survey then is an attempt to give a better insight
      into how most of the songs are rated. It is also became the new benchmark
      in recent years in pushing me to give more 5-star songs which were then
      based on early impression which is not possible now with maturity of my
      song judgement bias. As you can see, there is higher tendency to give more
      4-star songs as songs are rated slightly above average instead of
      promoting them to 5-stars.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Thirdly, we have the generic statistics of the songs of the year. These
      include language (for those with a vocalist), year of release (old songs
      can appear in the list as far as 2005 for the year), Anime songs (because
      when I say "sometimes" on Twitter I meant this) and B-side analysis for
      singles which is a direct representation of proving that songs which are
      good need not be their release's topic songs, and we should give more
      criticism and praise to songs not under intentional spotlight.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Last but not least, we have the Song Appetite Report. The chart represents
      how many songs I've given every month, and show peak and trough periods
      typically based on release month dependent on the music industry or
      periods of time where I just want to give more or less songs. I would say
      despite the difficulties and therefore delays in releasing new songs this
      particular year, many still were released in due time, and therefore did
      not miss much in terms of leaving an impression in Klassic Note, and I am
      thankful for that. Exceptions do apply though, where certain releases are
      still out of reach with the return of love event-only releases.
    </div>

<div>
  Every day is unique as it is special; Songs that surface in our minds will set
  us in a mood and drive our everyday lives. From waking up to going to work,
  arriving home and going to sleep, there's always a different melody that will
  pop up in my mind from listening to the huge amount of songs within and in
  past years. I would confidently say that my mood for the year could be
  summarised with the songs I'm listening to every single day.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And that's why we have a tie this year so congrats <b>Kitou Akari</b> and
  <b>Kroi </b>for being the most memorable Songs of the Year in 2023!!

      The first two tables below show what are the most popular songs I've
      listened for the year and for each month. The last two tables show the
      most popular songs to wake up and sleep to to give a different perspective
      as to how they potentially can feel if you start and end the day with
      maybe. Criteria are subject to conditions in sleeping habits, mood, and
      mostly due to songs I've listened recently during certain times of the
      day.

    <div>
      Starting from 2019, Song of The Day has been transformed into a rank-based
      system, where every mention pushes you up one rank so that rank sharing
      will make sense. The results shouldn't show much of a difference though,
      but it will more accurately reflect on the position of songs within.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Starting from 2023, multiple Songs of The Day have been reintroduced ever
      since the start of the Song Awards 15 years ago, defining vital points of
      the day where if criteria are met (eg. without listening to songs, songs
      will appear in one's mind), they are worthy of record.

  Klassic Note may be all about the songs, but what is with songs if they aren't
  released in some form? I say that though, but with the rise of digital singles
  and how music is distributed more often through digital platforms in smaller
  doses instead of coming up with physical releases, it's always in my comfort
  to listen to albums every once in a while then be committed to their constant
  promotions. Many releases performed better than ever as I spend more time with
  them this year, and I continue to give more songs beyond the one or two topic
  songs with a music video. Many artists are going for more than one good album
  in the year with the world opening up, and we do see this year some are adding
  a couple of singles and/or new songs from time to time within the year.
  Regardless of their approach, I will still give them due attention as long as
  I know of them. Limited Edition Only singles are great but sadly does not meet
  my requirement of Review, but I will still talk put them in just because they
  are worthy of mention.

    In Klassic Note, top singles are determined by (1) whether they are in
    Klassic Note Review ie. all songs of the single have been given and is not
    digital only release and (2) how good they fare in impression, so ratings
    come to place. Details for giving these singles shall not be discussed
    further since there is The Klassic Note Review for your reference. Top
    albums are determined mostly by how many songs have been given in it, so
    best album have a natural advantage if I've been listening to the artist for
    years, and mini-albums tend to get an edge on these due to low song count
    too but they have been put lower in priority to allow full length albums to
    shine.

  <div class="content">
    From Klassic Note 2023, I will also annotate special features of these
    releases (Limited Edition Only, Digital Only) in order to better represent
    their prominence in the ranks, and that smaller releases in albums, for
    example, will get smaller priority over full album which require more effort
    (subject to the amount of new songs added) so the latter will be considered
    first.

  In Klassic Note there are Awards; And then, there are Commendations.
  Commendations are thing that are worth mentioning but not necessarily in
  competition since it can be unique in circumstance. That, or I want to credit
  them as many of them as possible and it doesn't exactly qualify as a regular
  award. Many listed may be repeats, but this is the place where I give proper
  recognition to certain things that stood out among the others.

  Congrats to <b>Amber's</b> for giving me music videos to remember I wish I
  could put them in more, also <b>Omoinotake</b>, I can't believe these love
  stories made me more than interested in their songs more than ever. This and
  many others easily show the power of music videos which are all the more
  important at a time like such a medium and the Internet are the best
  conditions to promote new songs today.

      Commendations are generally given to topics which stand out on their own
      with unique features (eg. terrible English, same song title) known as Song
      Commendations, releases that I reviewed and/or are outstanding known as
      Release Commendations, artists which may or may not be singing this year
      also known as Artist Commendations, and honours for (promotional) music
      videos which excelled in impressions also known as Video Commendations.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Instead of giving them as awards, Klassic Note here compliments videos
      which stand out better than their music, sometimes better than not, in
      order to give better representation and thus impression to their audio
      listeners. And so, I commend and also criticise (a bit) on those, as you
      can see below too. Many of the music videos can be found online too, so be
      sure to check those out for yourself. I'll post the links to get you
      started.

  One of the most important things that built the foundation of this Song Awards
  are of course, the Awards themselves. They have also been historically the
  toughest to decide every year apart from the Top 20 itself, which shows how
  much thought is put into figuring out the distinct feels of all the songs I
  give for the year, and how important they are compared to all of the others
  above. As with previous years, it has always been a challenge to get the right
  songs to fit the Awards and what they should represent, and as much as I try I
  still hardly feel for some of these songs which are worthy of their titles,
  especially pertaining to certain emotions and moods. Regardless, I have made
  my decision, so here are the results.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Congratulations to
  <b>Homecomings for THE CONTRIBUTOR AND THE ARTIST</b> awards because damn,
  have I been immersed too much in their songs for the year, especially from
  their indie days.
  <b>THE MUSIC award also met its strongest competition</b> for the year, as
  immersion into Jazz Funk group Sai have made me intoxicated on occult styles I
  normally would not give despite PHONO TONES and SPECIAL OTHERS releasing
  albums to please for the year.&nbsp;

  Last but not least, we have the song rankings. Every year, I try my best to
  showcase Klassic Note in the most diverse way possible, hopefully with a good
  balance of what I truly love and representation of what the year means for
  Klassic Note in 2023. And in these songs I recommend, many have left an
  impression, some I cannot miss putting them in just because, and others I
  think they are genuinely worth a mention. It was hard to come up with the list
  as usual, as there have been many dramatic changes to when I initially thought
  of this, but now that the results are out, I'm not going to think too much
  into it and hope this is adequate to show what Klassic Note 2023 is after a
  year in the making.&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Congratulations to <b>Homecomings</b> once again for changing my year for the
  better or worse, that I must put them up to be the #1 song in Klassic Note!
  Emotional is still my drill for the year, nothing much has changed, but the
  rankings did put in more lively and positive tunes to remember, and that is
  still what is growing inside me, I assure you, for the better.

    In Klassic Note, The Top 20 will include certain conflicts in rank number as
    some of the songs have to share the same rank due to my lack of criteria to
    differentiate between them, but is also a ingenious method to show certain
    trends or similarity within topics and timeframes, to a smaller extent. So
    do not be surprised to see up to 25 songs every year on this supposedly "Top
    20" list depending on my preferences.

    Here are my thoughts about this year's Top 20 as elaborated from above, in a
    nutshell:
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        Homecomings position in the Top 20 list has already been cemented since
        February with me deep into their indie releases, and the new album
        definitely helped in topping up that fuel I would have never expected to
        deal with. Still, they deserve every bit of it, they have the unique
        emotional feels that no other band can achieve, it has been a few years
        since their last and I have been wanting to give them something, and I'm
        glad I can get into this over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        The next few ranks are my tribute to the artists who made an impression
        this year alone, including now regular mol-74, Kroi, and even Kodama
        Hikari is in the ranks.
      </li>
      <li>
        I would have thought of putting Ikimonogakari in a better rank
        preferably above my own bias Natsukawa Shiina who killed it with the new
        album this year, I still think the latter deserved to be up there purely
        because they gave us a rather simple melody to satisfy, I will say that
        much.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ryokuoushoku Shakai dropped real bad this year considering their overall
        assessment even including their rather unimpressive though unique new
        album this year, I was even struggling on considering what to give them
        this year because seriously, even the summer song did not manage to
        impress me for that long. The same is to say for regular artists in my
        Collection including SHE'S and LUCK LIFE who have been downplayed, and
        cinema staff who have been left on the lurch this year just because.
      </li>
      <li>
        This year's double ranks are for fanservice I did not want to leave
        Fuchigami Mai alone so I slotted in Kitou Akari (or maybe it's vice
        versa), and I don't know if putting miwa long with emotion giant and
        veteran aiko-san would mean anything but hey, both respectable artists I
        would put my finger on, so you are welcome, ladies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ironically because of the awards above, one would think otherwise I
        would put Uesaka Sumire with Kitou Akari but my biggest concern about
        giving her more recognition after I presented her the best single award
        for the year, is that is a very average release and because of the
        single containing more tracks (and I gave them all), that her subpar
        singing would otherwise take shape in the ranks. This is as far as I
        will praise herm honestly.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And that is all for Klassic Note this year; I hope you enjoyed looking through
  these results, giving some of them as listen, and enjoyed as much as I did. If
  you were here to give yourself a chance and listen to the above snippet of
  what I've listened to in 2023, you're welcome for the glimpse into my music
  listening experience for the year. If you have given any of them a listen
  afterwards - even just one of them - it will make me happy. The legacy of
  Klassic Note has moved ahead once again and with the world outside changing in
  perspective, I'm still happy to be able to share my thoughts about music every
  year, how much I have experienced in the world of music by the week, and
  dedicating the time and dedication to make all of this happen once again.
  Also, do not forget what I did for
  <a href="https://kn15years.mystrikingly.com/" target="_blank">#KN15YEARS</a>,
  Klassic Note's 15th anniversary project, so do check that out.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  See you again and have a happy new year! And I will ever, as I will always be,
  "Searching For The New Classic".
