  Due to circumstances earlier in the day (like, way earlier) that I woke up to,
  I knew I joked about this because it featured my hometown, but I think I
  <em>may</em> have to buy that

  for my birthday next year. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe I should just do a fanfic of her
  instead? Haha this is so last minute I can't possibly come up with something
  right now-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I shall not deviate from my plan, no, so let's talk about someone else! No,
  not the Anime "WORKING!!!" opening theme song we aren't reminiscing that far.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We are though (haha), continuing my fantasies of actually having a
  younger sister since IRL me can't have one anyways <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>, and I just thought
  of something good to satisfy this and completely make me forget about my dream
  last night so let's!

      It was a chilly morning in the Natsukawa household. I woke up late but
      thankfully, I still had time for breakfast. As I waited for the water to
      boil so I can make my morning coffee, I see a lethargic Shiina walk
      towards the kitchen in a large, purple sweater. She laid down her face at
      the counter towards me and the kettle as I placed her mug in front of her.
      Time slowly passed as we patiently waited for the kettle to boil. After a
      minute of silence and me staring at my adorable younger stepsister
      distraction free (because I left my phone upstairs), she blurted out a
      yell while staring at me.

      The kettle sang right as she called it. I took her mug and served her a
      cup of her usual hot chocolate with my heart beating as if I drank a whole
      kettle of coffee. This was - I promise you - the first time I've heard her
      refer to me not by my old family name or "Hey". Is she alright, or was she
      just acting out her lines? I will never know.

  This is just for me, right? For me? Haha then again if you know of "IDOLY
  PRIDE" you would have known of Okuyama Sumire in which she voiced and yeah,
  this is kind of that too. It's like they knew. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I just want that, but
  it's with real her. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oldest sister in the family, by the way- Oldest
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> in the
  family, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah, I love my older brother life. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>

  P.S. Which reminds me, I should stop playing that mobile game by the end of
  the year. Haha why though? I mean, CyberAgent just killed my first and
  favourite Japanese mobile game and THEN asked me for money on 7th anniversary
  goods?? I could've quit last year lol <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>
