<div>Ah, the final fanfic of the year.</div><div><br></div><div>Honestly saying, I did not expect to go this far with what I humbly started to celebrate this blog running for I don't know how many years depending on where I started, and Ten-chan as my phone wallpapers is really edging me to write more about the interactions between her and fictional me but heck, I gotta end this year with what I started, right? Which is a great excuse to put this girl again on the table? Man, I wish I can put her on the table <em>if you know what I'm sayin'</em></div><div><br></div><div>Anyhow, let's end this season like how fictional me would end it... and spend the new year with a woman I love?? I WILL NEVER lmao <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Takahashi Rie dressed in a white T-shirt with a yellow headband, laying prone on a cyan-coloured sofa" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=355 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl940090.jpg title="Takahashi Rie" width=139></div><blockquote><i>It's always alone for me at the end of the year since I moved into Tokyo, but not this year it won't be. Takahashi Rie, whom I met at my new job? We have been hanging out with each other more often for the past few months. But it was always because we wanted to avoid the rest of our department - the older co-worker crowd and are still living in the Showa Era - that we chose to hang out together.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>This time around, I thought Takahashi invited me over to her place for New Year's to hang out with her friends or acquaintances, but as I entered her apartment and put down my gifts for the visit, I realized there was no one else. I dared not take a step further into her living quarters which smelled better than a flowerbed, so I took a seat at a stool near the kitchen. I asked if they have anything planned for this gathering maybe play some games. She laid down prone onto a pillow on the cyan-coloured sofa beside me, and looked back at me with a smile and a glint in her eyes.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=私たち二人で、何がしたいの？>"What do you want the two of us to do together?"</abbr></i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Imagine if that sounds <em>exactly</em> like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/123699/Takagi target=_blank>Takagi-san</a> though lol, but I don't know, Rieri. I would love to cuddle, maybe watch a movie together. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Yeah, the movie was secondary haha) Oh well, guess I will never be with a woman and be alone forever, and all these will just be in writing or dreams if the ones this year aren't enough of an indicator of my sad, lonely life.</div><div><br></div><div>Moving on though, I will take a break for the new year. This series will come back, I don't have much confidence to do more now considering my mood swings just in the past few weeks, but I will be back. I want to write more of these just because (and we must not forget about Ten-chan lol), so I will come up with something. <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span> See you then and have a happy new year! With Rieri though? I mean, only one man can be with her and it's Aozaki Shouhei- Or her dad, yeah, her dad back in her hometown haha <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span></div></div></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. This story is better represented by the <a href=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gachigasm-gachibass target=_blank>GachiBASS emote on Twitch</a> I can tell you that much haha and this isn't even about getting a boner- But seriously though, the reality is more like I'm surprised she didn't prepare anything (or anyone else), I said we can go out but she wants to stay inside so we just awkwardly sat on both ends of the sofa and watched a horror movie or something. Damn, would that also be a treat hehe Rieri you scared of ghosts like Akarin does? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
