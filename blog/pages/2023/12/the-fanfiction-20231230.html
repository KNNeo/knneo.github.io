<div>Ah, the final fanfic for the year.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Honestly saying, I did not expect to go this far with what I humbly started to
  celebrate this blog running for I don't know how many years, and Ten-chan as
  my phone wallpapers is really edging me to write more about the interactions
  between her and fictional me but heck, I gotta end this year with what I
  started, right? Which is a great excuse to put this girl again on the table?
  Man, I wish I can put her on the table <em>if you know what I'm sayin'-</em>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyhow, let's end this season like how fictional me would end it... and spend
  the new year with a woman I love?? I WILL NEVER lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

  <i
    >It's always alone for me at the end of the year since I moved into Tokyo,
    but not this year it won't be. Takahashi Rie, who I met on my new job? We
    have since started going out for the past few months, but it has always been
    because we both want to avoid the older co-worker crowd that make up our
    department who are still living in the Showa Era, that we chose to hang out
    together.</i

  </div>
  <div>
    <i
      >This time around though, I thought Takahashi invited me over to her place
      for New Year's to hang out with her friends or acquaintances, but as I
      entered her apartment and put down my gifts for the visit, there was no
      one else. I dared not take a step further into her living quarters which
      smelled better than a flowerbed, so I took a seat at a stool near the
      kitchen. I instinctively asked if they as a group have anything planned
      for this gathering. She let out a laugh, laid down prone onto a
      cyan-coloured sofa beside me, and looked back at me with a smile and a
      glint in her eyes.</i

      Imagine that sounds exactly like

        >Takagi-san</a
      >
      though lol, but I don't know, Rieri. I would love to cuddle, maybe watch a
      movie together. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Yeah, the movie was secondary haha) Oh well,
      guess I will never be with a woman and be alone forever, and all these
      will just be in writing or dreams if the ones this year aren't enough of
      an indicator of my sad, lonely life.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      Moving on though, I will take a break for the new year. This series will
      come back, I don't have much confidence to do more now considering my mood
      swings just in the past few weeks, but I will be back. I want to write
      more of these just because (and we must not forget about Ten-chan lol), so
      I will come up with something. <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span> See you then and have a happy
      new year! With Rieri though? I mean, only one man can be with her and it's
      Aozaki Shouhei- Or her dad, yeah, her dad back in her hometown haha <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>

  P.S. This story is better represented by the
  <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gachigasm-gachibass" target="_blank"
    >GachiBASS emote on Twitch</a
  >&nbsp;I can tell you that much haha and this isn't even about getting a
  boner- But seriously though, the reality is more like I'm surprised she didn't
  prepare anything (or anyone else), I said we can go out but she wants to stay
  inside so we just awkwardly sat on both ends of the sofa and watched a horror
  movie or something. Damn, would that also be a treat hehe Rieri you scared of
  ghosts like Akarin does? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
