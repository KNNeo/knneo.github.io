Wow did I just spend a morning just coming up with the most useless things
possible haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Hey, if you are a fan of
  <a href="https://doax.cc/" target="_blank">DOAXVV bromides</a>, tell me what
  you have and liked because goddamn it was hard trying to convert those into
  actual data because they (yes I don't own that site) don't technically have a
  way to export all the SSRs you've gotten or you can even mark them out, so I'm
  just mapping them myself. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay creepy stuff over we can talk about
  the acrylic stands I got this week!! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also 2 days MC but we don't
  talk about those lmao
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, new shows coming up and probably this will be it along with
  "Kubo-san" which I'll watch in a month to continue on the second half but
  uh... maybe we aren't watching too much exciting stuff in the most popular
  Anime season of the year. Oh well, who cares what is life anyways (lol)<br />

  </blockquote>
  Yeah, if you haven't gotten wind of this wonderful series yet, it will remind
  you to relax in life. Not for Mitsumi though, no way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new
  episode where we watch perfection melt in front of your eyes haha nooooo
  (#SkiLo02), I mean, we know Mitsumi is born to lead. That or her jokes are
  terrible. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, mine aren't any better have you seen the view counts
  on this blog? It's just from me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, we start with introductions
  in class and boy is it already cringe to stand on your seat in class to be
  honest, and I have to stand in front of the class? Boy, kill my past self,
  please. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But the guys in this class are doing pretty well, I like
  Kenta-kun over there haha same bro I want to be popular with the ladies but
  <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>, Shima is basically me if I did it perfectly, and I'm realistically
  probably more of a Mitsumi who just screws it up either way she goes even if
  she thought of it for the night. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All is in a day of school we are
  just barely starting, as neighbour Egashira reminds her of how Shima-kun
  looking like a ladies' man haha yeah he's the one bro, and more likely to you
  know, deceive innocent girls from out of town like Mitsumi right here haha so
  you know, just making sure she takes the hint. Yeah, don't think he's just
  nice to her this b*tch wants him to be nice to her first. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Remember what
  I mentioned about being cautious about city people's thoughts? Mitsumi-chan,
  be careful alright. Soon though, the main girl herself realized how much she
  has to deal with after of course taking on the class chairperson role (I like
  how this school has gender bias straight up lmao I want to talk to a female
  representative as a dude or else how am I going to be popular lol) and also
  joining in the karaoke session with all the students after school because why
  not. Everyone is invited, so naturally everyone had varying levels of interest
  in singing whatever Mitsumi-chan sang in front of the class lol really reminds
  me of "Kannagi" haha that girl sang like the supermarket theme song dude.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> At least people knew what Mitsumi was singing, kids show theme song
  so that's alright. Class beauty Yuzuki did remind her about how poisonous
  Egashira might be in person though, using Mitsumi to get closer to Shima which
  you know why not, just please don't kill me because he wants to be with me
  thanks, is probably more heightened now in worry seeing that she doesn't have
  to read minds that much in her hometown compared to the capital city. People
  man, I wish I never had to deal with any of them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What was in less
  worry though about Egashira, is how Shima-kun also saw through her. Yeah like
  how he knows you want to be with him so bad, he saw that from a mile away. He
  saw that from Mitsumi's hometown, that's how far. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So Mitsumi-chan we
  might be good for now. Maybe. Hey, we want this to be a happy place for
  learning, so let's not ruin the mood in class, yes? Leave your relationship
  problems for later when I'm done with clubs or whatever. Speaking of, the guys
  had to decide which club they go, to you know, enhance their high school
  experience. Shoutout to the boldest who said "none of the above" haha girl I
  admire your bravery, and maybe Mitsumi is smart to ensure her leadership
  skills are honed in the student council, but what is definitely more
  concerning is from Shima-kun who watched the drama club's performance and
  immediately left without talking to Mitsumi who was also there watching on the
  front row. Shima-kun is basically me in high school, that is, if I looked this
  good AND got dragged into drama club. Again. Yup, I had that history, if you
  don't mind. And he had to warn the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> to keep
  his mouth shut and take a hint. Yup, spicy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... I see a
  lot of drama ahead of us. Like, A LOT. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From digging out Egashira's
  very not assertive personality to knowing about Shima's
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kurorekishi" target="_blank">dark past</a>
  with drama, and I swear this is only scratching on the surface, but yeah, this
  sounds like fun already. It's high school, dude. You can choose to be in a
  club AND be a ladies' man. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yup, basically NOT me in high school lol.
  Man, what did myself in high school look like... Without much fanfare? Yeah
  watching "Seitokai Yakuindomo" lmao I did join the "Guitar Ensemble" though so
  that's rad. Haha I guess we can talk about more of all of this next time.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I tell myself that the things I'm undecided on were never that
  important anyway" TRUE THOUGH haha but we can't really think like that all the
  time, not for everyone]

  </blockquote>
  Hey, I wish I was that smart like Nasa-kun. I won't be in the slew of tech
  layoffs. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, I wasn't in those numbers so maybe I'm better
  off...? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Heck, too much education might not even do you that good to
  be honest. Haha okay bad life advice aside in this new episode
  (#ToniKawaS202), why is every side character in this series basically like
  Aya-chan?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, we need more backstory, don't ask why people are
  shocked at this wedded couple. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Heck, just the news of getting
  married is enough to kill people out there including virgins like me.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on, let's talk about them! Firstly, we have the middle school
  teacher. Boy, where do you think Tsukasa's middle school teacher is now? In
  the Edo period, maybe? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways don't think too much into that, for we
  are talking about Nasa-kun's teacher. If you would recall he missed high
  school, middle school is the last time he had to go to school to piss off his
  teachers lmao, and he is now making a living as a freelance coder already
  earning more than what you paid for your university education. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> So
  yeah Yanagi-sensei? He doesn't need a future he has a wife and that's all I
  need too anyways but I don't have one, so screw certificates and your
  education because you are the opposite of his wonderful life, girl, living on
  cup noodles and stress as you struggle to juggle between work and... well work
  because you have no life you can't even go to the amusement park with that
  male teacher who invited you because he wants a chance to have a wonderful
  time with you. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> I know that's too much of life in a nutshell haha you're
  welcome, but I guess Yanagi here did put her nose up Nasa-kun's butt here and
  thought that he might be delinquent because he managed to throw off her mind
  and make her performance bonus go up in the years he was pulling up class
  grades, that it would make you believe he's living worse off than he is in
  school?? BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, she was just bossy and wanted to catch up, so
  Nasa showed him his wife Tsukasa. Apart from the deep backstory we aren't
  allowed to spoil now haha, there is NO WAY you would think this wife is any
  sort of bad in any way, especially with the love-filled cooking I can only
  envy. *sigh * Moving on haha, we have Ginga-kun. I don't really want to retort
  a joke but goddamn is the Anime wanting me to here, but don't let his image
  and everyone else's around him make you think that's part of the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yakuza" target="_blank">yakuza</a> or even
  running one, so let's just say they are all doing cosplay in a high school
  student council, that's right. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Don't narc or I'll kill you, ahem,
  send you to detention. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He picked up a cat lmao, and thought Nasa-kun
  would be able to deal with it. Apart from Nasa-kun being so scientist to bring
  the cat to do a check-up seeing picking up wild cats isn't technically
  hygienic but what do I know, this family now has a new member that can stop
  them from being all lovey-dovey. Apart from Kaname-chan that girl just comes
  in at the wrong times lmao. All in all... maybe we just do the wedding.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not enough people know the news about this wedded couple anyways.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But heck, looks like it's just set up to the future episodes it
  seems, giving them a cat to take care of so this couple will NEVER need to
  think about having kids lmao modern society joke, and letting more people know
  about what Nasa-kun is up to with his wife... really makes you forget that
  they don't have a permanent residence up till this point. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next week
  though looks like we are ALL going to the amusement park because Yanagi-sensei
  is going there and I hope we aren't crashing her date with the other teacher
  but hey I hear <strike>Koko-chan</strike> Chitose maybe she will be involved
  somehow haha how is this still not touching on Tsukasa's backstory

  </blockquote>
  Oh dude, don't tell me the girl is an illusion or a ghost. Please don't.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Before I start to cringe, let's talk about what this new series
  (#KimiSomu01) has to offer. For starters, a sleepy boy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/nakami" target="_blank">Nakami</a> here is a
  sleepy boy, and not like my kind of sleepy because I'm old (lol) or because
  he's weak or anything but I guess he is kind of, he has a bad case of
  insomnia. Hey, it can happen at any age so don't be too surprised, and hearing
  him talk to the nurse's office teacher who knew him too well, it's definitely
  affecting his high school life, making people think he has problems haha you
  know how mean kids are to weird things in people? Even though a more loving
  society should be pursued, but things like being tired might not be great for
  daily activities, for example, PE lessons when you missed the soccer ball for
  your team's own goal. Yeah, kind of a bummer and I did that just being wide
  awake lmao, but as you can see this is an issue in itself. There is also a
  rumour going around in school on why there is an observatory in school yet
  there is no observatory club no more, about a girl committing suicide and
  other members being caught in a loop of seeing her ghost leading to the school
  closing the location for good and treating it as a storeroom as such. You
  know, just that this rumour is NOT real. Not like we need to know the reason
  why, but as Nakami makes his way in to find out more cardboard boxes for the
  class and had to enter forbidden territory per se... he finds himself alone
  with the ghost of- Who are we joking? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He found a girl deep in sleep
  in broad daylight inside the observatory. She introduces herself as Isaki, and
  wants the guy to keep mum about her "slacking off" because she has insomnia
  and this is the only time she can sleep, during the day- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
  case you haven't figured that out, deja vu to Nakami here, she has the same
  problems as him. Yep, you can figure out where this is going now. You spread
  rumours about a haunted location in school, you keep it locked so you can
  sleep inside, and now you've found your pillow?? What a great- Haha poor dude
  you think he checked if Isaki-chan here drooled on his pants? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey,
  let's just say that was a great nap. Haha some would even argue that is the
  BEST nap anyone has had in years, but yeah as you can see, insomnia problems,
  people. Isaki then decided to let this dude into her secret world behind the
  "haunted" observatory (little do you know the lock passcode is also her
  birthday- I said it here first haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>), and asks if he wants to hang out
  at night since you know... we both can't sleep and not like they let high
  schoolers take night shifts at the convenience store so... WHAT CURFEW??
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, welcome to the next "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50346/Yofukashi_no_Uta"
    target="_blank"
    >Yofukashi no Uta</a
  >" reference haha but hey I like the idea of not having vampires so this is
  already better, the couple (hehe) took a ride on the night scenes while never
  feeling tired at any moment even though if you brought me along I'll be
  sleeping BEFORE they even meet up, this "Night Enjoyment Club" or whatever the
  girl decide to name this haha. (Almost wrote "Enjoying Night Club" lmao
  <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span>) With Nakami's camera and taking of photos making good use of it
  which he didn't because he rather play video games haha SAME DUDE, to hiding
  from the cops because yeah do remember Japan has this thing where they made
  sure minors stay at home after 10pm and these guys are out at like 4am haha...
  these guys are totally enjoying themselves... at night. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in
  all... this is the secret creepy between-us type of love story I've adorned
  and missed, and I like that. Okay okay, let's talk about what hit me that was
  good. Firstly, the secret. Boy, imagining having such a thing with another
  person in school. Okay, doesn't have to be of the opposite gender, but you
  know, why not right? Says the author. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah next up, this
  Isaki-chan?? You know how in life there's everything that sucks but there's
  this girl? I would DIE for her, I tell ya. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She is so lively and
  positive and caring for people around her despite her weak constitution...
  (ugh no "KimiSui" please, no) she's gotta be the best thing this season.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Lastly, the relationship between these two. As Nakami has pointed
  out, what will this be? He's just her pillow and she's just playdate at this
  point so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Trust me, I can make dirty jokes the whole night I can
  sleep on it and these two will still be awake. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, I'm in, this
  sweet not yet romance of a relationship I can dig, because damn, how else are
  you able to be together nowadays? Girls nowadays don't even care about-
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "The observatory is a a great spot to hideout a bit, but I'm not sure
  how to deal with girls..." EHHHHH you'll get around to it brother just take
  the bait now while you can hehe ah]

  is for her new single in two weeks and it isn't bad at all to be frank. Anime
  singer, by the way. We shall see how the single holds up then, this along with
  that dating simulator of a music video if you would recall.&nbsp;<b

  as you would recall they did audition for one and it's YOSUKE-san and don't
  ask how young he is just like how we don't ask the ages of our new staff.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'll give chance again, if they can manage to impress

  will be good to listen to even without the credit for Anime recently haha see
  the above segments, will still be better off than
  <b>FictionJunction's new album</b> which damn if you have no idea of Kajiura
  Yuki-sensei and her own produced album long before Kalafina was a thing, maybe
  you can listen to this one it has Aimer-san in it, among many collaboration
  songs with other artists haha no surprises there no one knew of this group
  much anyways. Or maybe <b>Minase Inori's new single</b> will stand out, who
  knows. I gotta say though, my confidence level is only going down with each
  week this month haha

  tarot cards in front of you and gives you a little something if a special card
  is drawn? Damn, have release events evolved a lot since the last time I heard
  of it- Hey I missed an online release event last year you think I give a sh*t
  about this? Haha <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>
