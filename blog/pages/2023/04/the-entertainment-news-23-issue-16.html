Oh well, who cares what is life anyways (lol)<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SkiLo02><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Skip to Loafer</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Anyways, I want to be popular with the ladies! But I'll be faithful if I have a girlfriend" Bro, are you me? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Yeah, if you haven't gotten wind of this wonderful series yet, it will remind you to relax in life. Not for Mitsumi though, no way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we watch perfection melt in front of your eyes haha nooooo (#SkiLo02), I mean, we know Mitsumi is born to lead. That or her jokes are terrible. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, mine aren't any better have you seen the view counts on this blog? It's just from me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, we start with introductions in class and boy is it already cringe to stand on your seat in class to be honest, and I have to stand in front of the class? Boy, kill my past self, please. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But the guys in this class are doing pretty well, I like Kenta-kun over there haha same bro I want to be popular with the ladies but <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span>, Shima is basically me if I did it perfectly, and I'm realistically probably more of a Mitsumi who just screws it up either way she goes even if she thought of it for the night. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All is in a day of school we are just barely starting, as neighbour Egashira reminds her of how Shima-kun looking like a ladies' man haha yeah he's the one bro, and more likely to you know, deceive innocent girls from out of town like Mitsumi right here haha so you know, just making sure she takes the hint. Yeah, don't think he's just nice to her this b*tch wants him to be nice to her first. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Remember what I mentioned about being cautious about city people's thoughts? Mitsumi-chan, be careful alright. Soon though, the main girl herself realized how much she has to deal with after of course taking on the class chairperson role (I like how this school has gender bias straight up lmao I want to talk to a female representative as a dude or else how am I going to be popular lol) and also joining in the karaoke session with all the students after school because why not. Everyone is invited, so naturally everyone had varying levels of interest in singing whatever Mitsumi-chan sang in front of the class lol really reminds me of "Kannagi" haha that girl sang like the supermarket theme song dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> At least people knew what Mitsumi was singing, kids show theme song so that's alright. Class beauty Yuzuki did remind her about how poisonous Egashira might be in person though, using Mitsumi to get closer to Shima which you know why not, just please don't kill me because he wants to be with me thanks, is probably more heightened now in worry seeing that she doesn't have to read minds that much in her hometown compared to the capital city. People man, I wish I never had to deal with any of them. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What was in less worry though about Egashira, is how Shima-kun also saw through her. Yeah like how he knows you want to be with him so bad, he saw that from a mile away. He saw that from Mitsumi's hometown, that's how far. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So Mitsumi-chan we might be good for now. Maybe. Hey, we want this to be a happy place for learning, so let's not ruin the mood in class, yes? Leave your relationship problems for later when I'm done with clubs or whatever. Speaking of, the guys had to decide which club they go, to you know, enhance their high school experience. Shoutout to the boldest who said "none of the above" haha girl I admire your bravery, and maybe Mitsumi is smart to ensure her leadership skills are honed in the student council, but what is definitely more concerning is from Shima-kun who watched the drama club's performance and immediately left without talking to Mitsumi who was also there watching on the front row. Shima-kun is basically me in high school, that is, if I looked this good AND got dragged into drama club. Again. Yup, I had that history, if you don't mind. And he had to warn the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> to keep his mouth shut and take a hint. Yup, spicy. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... I see a lot of drama ahead of us. Like, A LOT. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> From digging out Egashira's very not assertive personality to knowing about Shima's <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kurorekishi target=_blank>dark past</a> with drama, and I swear this is only scratching on the surface, but yeah, this sounds like fun already. It's high school, dude. You can choose to be in a club AND be a ladies' man. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yup, basically NOT me in high school lol. Man, what did myself in high school look like... Without much fanfare? Yeah watching "Seitokai Yakuindomo" lmao I did join the "Guitar Ensemble" though so that's rad. Haha I guess we can talk about more of all of this next time.</div><div>[TL:DR; "I tell myself that the things I'm undecided on were never that important anyway" TRUE THOUGH haha but we can't really think like that all the time, not for everyone]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCyGASG-uE25fsl5B36f121qqCqRnYviNjl9AGjgPf4E8Lf_lRnfGP2tckDtuxsvr20EhkMS8fnT3Ac-xTed5QLoDZC2_q1kbMULAoGlc-O1zZ3eFqLvesTncD2KsbMc9Pys0vO5K22zdeTzntTvV8gZLW74kPSrmfCm68Dk3D-aH6_tzvVV6gSQy0/s320/skilo02_envy.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This series in a nutshell haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUoE3fgT0R6LtdGqR3ZaQB2rbtS7swvCIC1kdEY7PblPXUBzXK88F2040J7Dt-1_XFQjAXFEFI_igHnLFCFvEf55ERSN6SP36BattTzCILNOls5DCiUlPZXnie42Q2rsO-cGf9auN7lwZEXMgoeHsLuVyhvRY6azc2nqrifQs1lHBqMmzPH_OlCRXj/s320/skilo02_hair.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Just homesick so might as well pet your Tokyo dog lmao<br>(Bro, the difference between you and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/95629/Shizuru_Shirosaki target=_blank>Kawaisou's Shiro-kun</a> is you aren't masochist...? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>)</table></div></div><div>P.S. "Are those two just hitting it off?" This series in a nutshell lmao</div><div>P.P.S. "I kinda didn't want to invite a beauty queen like her" Don't do that. It's bad for mental health. And class health. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh did I nail that for Egashira? Haha oops<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=ToniKawaS202><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Tonikaku Kawaii Season 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I bet you gave your teachers a hard time at school, right?" Haha Nasa-kun when you are too smart you will offend an educator or two</div></blockquote>Hey, I wish I was that smart like Nasa-kun. I won't be in the slew of tech layoffs. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, I wasn't in those numbers so maybe I'm better off...? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Heck, too much education might not even do you that good to be honest. Haha okay bad life advice aside in this new episode (#ToniKawaS202), why is every side character in this series basically like Aya-chan?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, we need more backstory, don't ask why people are shocked at this wedded couple. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Heck, just the news of getting married is enough to kill people out there including virgins like me. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on, let's talk about them! Firstly, we have the middle school teacher. Boy, where do you think Tsukasa's middle school teacher is now? In the Edo period, maybe? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways don't think too much into that, for we are talking about Nasa-kun's teacher. If you would recall he missed high school, middle school is the last time he had to go to school to piss off his teachers lmao, and he is now making a living as a freelance coder already earning more than what you paid for your university education. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> So yeah Yanagi-sensei? He doesn't need a future he has a wife and that's all I need too anyways but I don't have one, so screw certificates and your education because you are the opposite of his wonderful life, girl, living on cup noodles and stress as you struggle to juggle between work and... well work because you have no life you can't even go to the amusement park with that male teacher who invited you because he wants a chance to have a wonderful time with you. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> I know that's too much of life in a nutshell haha you're welcome, but I guess Yanagi here did put her nose up Nasa-kun's butt here and thought that he might be delinquent because he managed to throw off her mind and make her performance bonus go up in the years he was pulling up class grades, that it would make you believe he's living worse off than he is in school?? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, she was just bossy and wanted to catch up, so Nasa showed him his wife Tsukasa. Apart from the deep backstory we aren't allowed to spoil now haha, there is NO WAY you would think this wife is any sort of bad in any way, especially with the love-filled cooking I can only envy. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Moving on haha, we have Ginga-kun. I don't really want to retort a joke but goddamn is the Anime wanting me to here, but don't let his image and everyone else's around him make you think that's part of the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yakuza target=_blank>yakuza</a> or even running one, so let's just say they are all doing cosplay in a high school student council, that's right. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Don't narc or I'll kill you, ahem, send you to detention. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> He picked up a cat lmao, and thought Nasa-kun would be able to deal with it. Apart from Nasa-kun being so scientist to bring the cat to do a check-up seeing picking up wild cats isn't technically hygienic but what do I know, this family now has a new member that can stop them from being all lovey-dovey. Apart from Kaname-chan that girl just comes in at the wrong times lmao. All in all... maybe we just do the wedding. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not enough people know the news about this wedded couple anyways. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But heck, looks like it's just set up to the future episodes it seems, giving them a cat to take care of so this couple will NEVER need to think about having kids lmao modern society joke, and letting more people know about what Nasa-kun is up to with his wife... really makes you forget that they don't have a permanent residence up till this point. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next week though looks like we are ALL going to the amusement park because Yanagi-sensei is going there and I hope we aren't crashing her date with the other teacher but hey I hear <strike>Koko-chan</strike> Chitose maybe she will be involved somehow haha how is this still not touching on Tsukasa's backstory</div><div>[TL:DR; "How am I supposed to believe your love's for real when I never hear any moaning at night!?"

Yeah dude you just love the teacher there, I got it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Oh dude, don't tell me the girl is an illusion or a ghost. Please don't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Before I start to cringe, let's talk about what this new series (#KimiSomu01) has to offer. For starters, a sleepy boy. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/nakami target=_blank>Nakami</a> here is a sleepy boy, and not like my kind of sleepy because I'm old (lol) or because he's weak or anything but I guess he is kind of, he has a bad case of insomnia. Hey, it can happen at any age so don't be too surprised, and hearing him talk to the nurse's office teacher who knew him too well, it's definitely affecting his high school life, making people think he has problems haha you know how mean kids are to weird things in people? Even though a more loving society should be pursued, but things like being tired might not be great for daily activities, for example, PE lessons when you missed the soccer ball for your team's own goal. Yeah, kind of a bummer and I did that just being wide awake lmao, but as you can see this is an issue in itself. There is also a rumour going around in school on why there is an observatory in school yet there is no observatory club no more, about a girl committing suicide and other members being caught in a loop of seeing her ghost leading to the school closing the location for good and treating it as a storeroom as such. You know, just that this rumour is NOT real. Not like we need to know the reason why, but as Nakami makes his way in to find out more cardboard boxes for the class and had to enter forbidden territory per se... he finds himself alone with the ghost of- Who are we joking? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> He found a girl deep in sleep in broad daylight inside the observatory. She introduces herself as Isaki, and wants the guy to keep mum about her "slacking off" because she has insomnia and this is the only time she can sleep, during the day- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In case you haven't figured that out, deja vu to Nakami here, she has the same problems as him. Yep, you can figure out where this is going now. You spread rumours about a haunted location in school, you keep it locked so you can sleep inside, and now you've found your pillow?? What a great- Haha poor dude you think he checked if Isaki-chan here drooled on his pants? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, let's just say that was a great nap. Haha some would even argue that is the BEST nap anyone has had in years, but yeah as you can see, insomnia problems, people. Isaki then decided to let this dude into her secret world behind the "haunted" observatory (little do you know the lock passcode is also her birthday- I said it here first haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>), and asks if he wants to hang out at night since you know... we both can't sleep and not like they let high schoolers take night shifts at the convenience store so... WHAT CURFEW?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, welcome to the next "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/50346/Yofukashi_no_Uta target=_blank>Yofukashi no Uta</a>" reference haha but hey I like the idea of not having vampires so this is already better, the couple (hehe) took a ride on the night scenes while never feeling tired at any moment even though if you brought me along I'll be sleeping BEFORE they even meet up, this "Night Enjoyment Club" or whatever the girl decide to name this haha. (Almost wrote "Enjoying Night Club" lmao <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span>) With Nakami's camera and taking of photos making good use of it which he didn't because he rather play video games haha SAME DUDE, to hiding from the cops because yeah do remember Japan has this thing where they made sure minors stay at home after 10pm and these guys are out at like 4am haha... these guys are totally enjoying themselves... at night. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... this is the secret creepy between-us type of love story I've adorned and missed, and I like that. Okay okay, let's talk about what hit me that was good. Firstly, the secret. Boy, imagining having such a thing with another person in school. Okay, doesn't have to be of the opposite gender, but you know, why not right? Says the author. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah next up, this Isaki-chan?? You know how in life there's everything that sucks but there's this girl? I would DIE for her, I tell ya. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She is so lively and positive and caring for people around her despite her weak constitution... (ugh no "KimiSui" please, no) she's gotta be the best thing this season. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Lastly, the relationship between these two. As Nakami has pointed out, what will this be?

After <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kimi-to-no-mirai-invisible-stars-ep/1679690296?l=en" target=_blank>Waki Azumi's new single</a></b> which was kinda meh so I just gave the topic song which was for an Anime I've also given the opening song of from her 3rd single back then, I did bother to give some rock festivals a listen instead of opting to listen to other new releases for the week. As such, I've given some listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%9C%E9%96%93%E9%A3%9B%E8%A1%8C-single/1536269144?l=en" target=_blank>Ishizaki Huwie's single from 2013</a></b> which damn is this is a weird artist name to talk about haha *kid Anakin going yippee*, but more importantly, I've given some listen to uh... reverse acoustic band <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/follow-the-dream/899519375?l=en" target=_blank>OAU's album from 2014</a></b> instead of listening to <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/albm/tradition/1677273492?l=en" target=_blank>their new album which releases this very week</a> too, is not going to get me more because I feel like Murder By Death can do better. Sorry, guys. Also, getting <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%9C%9D%E7%84%BC%E3%81%91%E3%81%AE%E6%AD%8C/899519375?i=899519395&amp;l=en" target=_blank>an English-speaking vocalist to sing Japanese songs</a>? I only approve of Rie fu so stop stealing ideas already just sing English songs since those are better to be honest. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Okay I totally regret in not doing this in chronological order from my Twitter like feed so now I'm doing it in reverse so don't mind me if you see also appearing earlier in the paragraph like I'm not using my brain lol. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1645386140029952001?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new teaser</a></b> is for her upcoming single and I only see references so old it makes me young haha it's about the superhero movies she likes. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1645592501867388935?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new teaser</a></b> is for a new song releasing next month and it sounds nice so let's hope we can actually give something this time around- What is with all these teasers haha welcome to 2023 by the way. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/staff_azumi/status/1645803897821208577?s=20" target=_blank>Waki Azumi's new music video</a></b> is for her new single this week and it's adorable so be sure to check it out and take screenshots so <a href="https://twitter.com/azumi_waki/status/1647530252720283648?s=20" target=_blank>Ajuju herself can talk about it on Twitter</a> haha I did not do that don't you worry. Maybe I should. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1646117421177257987?s=20" target=_blank>cinema staff's new live video</a></b> is a song I did not give but hey, just a reminder that they exist I guess. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1646453176797925378?s=20" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's new music video</a></b> is for her new single in two weeks and it isn't bad at all to be frank. Anime singer, by the way. We shall see how the single holds up then, this along with that dating simulator of a music video if you would recall. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPYAIRSTAFF/status/1646475862232154112?s=20" target=_blank>SPYAIR has confirmed their new vocalist</a></b> as you would recall they did audition for one and it's YOSUKE-san and don't ask how young he is just like how we don't ask the ages of our new staff. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'll give chance again, if they can manage to impress hereafter. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/_kanaboon/status/1646800460714774528?s=20" target=_blank>KANA-BOON's new music video</a></b> blah blah I already don't like the song the video won't change my impression to be frank. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1646831710599004162?s=20" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new music video</a></b> and song is impressive until the chorus so that kinda sucks I really wish they would stop doing that so Mia-san next time I guess. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1647540339815911424?s=20" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new live video</a></b> is something I've given Top 20 in last year's Klassic Note so be sure to take a listen it's an instant classic, better than <a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1646090792128368643?s=20" target=_blank>the one they released earlier this week</a>. Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1647540586524864513?s=20" target=_blank>her new music video premiere</a> will be out the day of her new single release so if you want a visual experience (which I don't haha) be sure to be there. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1647194305168285701?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new live video</a></b> is for a song I didn't like but I'll just share it here anyways maybe you'll like it. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1647228081428664322?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's new single has been confirmed to release in May</a></b> and we now know something from her EP in February is joining the tracklist haha yes it's the Valentine Day song. </div><div><br></div><div>Well for next week this is likely the peak season for the month for new releases in Klassic Note which even though I think <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/new-neighbors/1678908421?l=en" target=_blank>Homecomings' new album</a></b> will be good to listen to even without the credit for Anime recently haha see the above segments, will still be better off than <b>FictionJunction's new album</b> which damn if you have no idea of Kajiura Yuki-sensei and her own produced album long before Kalafina was a thing, maybe you can listen to this one it has Aimer-san in it, among many collaboration songs with other artists haha no surprises there no one knew of this group much anyways. Or maybe <b>Minase Inori's new single</b> will stand out, who knows. I gotta say though, my confidence level is only going down with each week this month haha</div><div><br><br><br><br>Yeah you bet I watched Sakura Ayane's Instagram live just now- Hey, how many of them voice actresses are even doing this now that they have their own radio shows and/or YouTube channels? I mean, look at Kanno Mai and Kohara Konomi. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys again real soon like next week soon because I'm ignoring weekdays now haha, but until then <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/58722/Konomi_Tamura target=_blank>Tamura Konomi</a> can you not look so much like <a href="https://twitter.com/pompomknm/status/1645446979986804736?s=20" target=_blank>the main girl in the Anime you are voicing in</a>? I'm not interested in this voice actress haha you can't fuse <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/27/Yukari_Tamura target=_blank>two</a> <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/43279/Konomi_Kohara target=_blank>names</a> and tell me she's cute, alright? Geez. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> New girl, by the way. Already making waves being on two roles this season and one of them is main? HOW?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right WHEN IS KANNO MAI GOING TO BE MAIN ROLE IN A ROMANCE- Bye haha<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. On more interesting things, you should have seen <a href="https://twitter.com/staff_azumi/status/1647122998254772225?s=20" target=_blank>the video for Waki Azumi's release event</a> this weekend where (instead of the usual signing or talk event) Ajuju draws tarot cards in front of you and gives you a little something if a special card is drawn? Damn, have release events evolved a lot since the last time I heard of it- Hey I missed an online release event last year you think I give a sh*t about this?
