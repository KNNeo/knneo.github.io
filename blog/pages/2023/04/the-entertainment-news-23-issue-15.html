I feel like I should just watch Anime and/or talk about music instead even
though the latter might be rather disappointing also this week because it all
attributed to how I spent the rest of my work leave this week. And boy, do I
have lots to share with you that I don't want to put in the intro. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  In short, the new package did not appear because goddamn Friday is the public
  holiday so plan successfully failed haha which means it'll arrive tomorrow
  earliest, the doctor told me to spend money on a high resolution scan of my
  abdomen and found nothing weird so we're back to stomach infection and not
  like the meds are working, and I also caught some throat infection somehow
  which is making me sleep on the bed for half the week even if I don't want to.
  <span title="*silence*">😐</span> What did I say about this week being the worst- I'm better off just
  working!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />
  <br />So yeah, sad stuff aside, or maybe happy stuff if I
  <strike>have</strike> want to take MC again tomorrow <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> so I can review
  the package <span title="*wink*">😉</span> then maaaaybe that will be better than the stuff I'm going
  to talk about below! Don't narc okay? No one can know about this it hasn't
  happened yet lmao<br /><br />

  </blockquote>
  "My middle school only had eight students that year" So yeah, as you can see,
  someone came from a rural area to the city to study. Kinda cringe when you
  hear of Japan's shrinking population and how they are closing rural schools
  haha ANYWAYS in this first episode of a series I decided to pick up because
  I'm a romance seeker in drama (#SkiLo01), I expect this to be just pure
  romance again, by the way. No crack or whatever, just
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kyunkyun" target="_blank">kyun kyun</a> and
  bam, new couple. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> (The struggles thing in some of these series is
  driving me NUTS lol) So for starters, let's set up the scene, like what this
  episode did. Meet Mitsumi, a country girl who is now studying in a high school
  up in the capital city of Tokyo for very obvious reasons we will get to in a
  minute, and she has to say goodbye to her family, childhood friends of course
  she has the one, and of course saying goodbye to her hometown to come to the
  city to study. Her dad's sibling so ie. aunt is taking care of her uptown as
  she starts her new school life right, but what is perfection in school if we
  didn't screw up pretty much everything else in the process? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Ironically, the aunt's concerns were real as with the family's, Mitsumi is an
  expert in getting lost even with instructions on her palm, as she takes the
  express trains which, if I didn't understand this wrongly, skips stations
  and/or routes to filter the peak hour crowds. So sadly, she missed her stop,
  and now lost, has probably no idea how to go to school to attend the entrance
  ceremony. She then meets Shima who saw her by the toilet because, hey this
  girl is my friend already, anxiety got to the better of her as she takes a
  puke in the ladies' room to relief herself of her current plight. Chill dude
  Shima guides her to school seeing her wearing a similar uniform as his, even
  running to school to make sure she makes it on time... to deliver the student
  body's representative speech. Yup, that also means she's the highest scoring
  student in the entrance exams, also why she has to go to school on time, and
  why she left her hometown to pursue a better education. It's all making sense
  now. She also revealed her life goals which damn I'm already different from
  her haha who has life goals at 15 lmao, she is to become a lawyer to help
  fight for the rights of her rural hometown. How nice, this girl, and be
  reminded of how pure this series is, because moving on, this is ALL going
  downhill. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> She forgot the script for the speech which was not in her
  parson, she still did it without referring to it what a chad, but the anxiety
  build-up caused her to proliferate at the first person she saw which
  ironically, is her new homeroom teacher. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh yeah, keep the "puke
  girl" nicknames coming, thanks. Hey, I guess that's how you make a name for
  yourself. Probably bad for first impressions though, but you got the handsome
  dude's phone number so who cares. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All in all, as Mitsumi prepares
  her first impression... speech? For her class tomorrow, as you can see,
  country girl coming to study in the city takes things way more seriously, she
  excels at them, but we are pretty sure the guy will show her the way to
  knowing when to curb her anxiety when she needs to. So yeah, IQ is all she
  needs, dude. The guy here will brush her up on her EQ, no worries. But yeah,
  if you desire a chill series of maybe love but more of living in the city and
  stuff, this is definitely up anyone's alley who wants a great time of high
  school storytelling that never gets old...? We shall see about that. I'm more
  invested in the opening than the ending theme hopefully that will change, and
  I'm liking the feels of this series, definitely a move from dealing with all
  the tension we get from such drama series as of late. Also, definitely not
  going to talk about country bumpkin and them not knowing the true intentions
  of city people. Not yet anyways haha let's just take things when they come in
  like Mitsumi-chan here, yes?

  [Okay, I find familiar names in the cast:
  <strike>Kotobuki Minako was the first girl Mitsumi met in class, and</strike>
  Toyosaki Aki of all people is the teacher. Very well blended though, between
  cute and her matured voice, as expected of a veteran. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>&nbsp; Okay I'm

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  So not real, bro. So not real. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, the opening sequence. Too real,
  bro. Too real. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah not going to spoil too much let's just say
  that's some Tsukasa samurai cosplay right there lmao but in this new season of
  the series we already know what happens to the couple because they are married
  (#ToniKawaS201), they want to hold a wedding ceremony?? Well, what Nasa-kun
  knows isn't exactly wrong it could just be that and we would be done, but
  society has made sure that this won't be the case so let's do a round-up of
  what I know about weddings after seeing so many of them that don't feature me
  as the groom. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> In summary, weddings are a way, ahem, THE way to brag
  to your family and friends and colleagues that you have a partner, and they
  are to give you money so you can show them how lovey-dovey you guys are while
  using up their money and most of your savings which could've been better
  keeping it for the next time your house is on fire. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Yup, they dump in
  season one references too so don't mind me, if you would recall they are
  staying in the bathhouse because previously they got their little apartment
  where Nasa-kun stays alone and suddenly has to house his wife lol, are not
  thinking of weddings even though they can't even afford an abode? Yeah,
  remember when Nasa talked about getting a home for them? That. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Even
  then though, it didn't take too long to figure out that for starters, weddings
  cost a lot of <strike>time</strike> <strike>effort</strike> money. In the
  millions of yen so yeah at where I live you can pay off a good fraction of
  your housing debt lmao, and who really cares about colleagues appearing at
  your wedding my damn CEO probably won't even appear at my wedding ceremony if
  I invited him lol, but suffice it to say and they are still relevant on this,
  youngsters choose to keep their weddings private or even inexistent so to not
  have to go through the process of... well getting drunk from toasting too much
  from your friends or something. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Don't worry, I've seen all cases from
  my cousins recently, so I know what's up. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Man talking about me is
  getting dry, so let's not talk about myself or the Yuzaki couple. Because we
  also see the appearance of all the other characters we all know and love, from
  people in the bathhouse so hopeless romantic Kaname with her sister Aya-chan
  haha thanks Sumipe for the nerd talk, to people in the mansion so Chitose
  training to kick Nasa-kun's butt I suppose lol and her maids who don't tell me
  to recall their names I barely even recall Conan lol, there's a lot of people
  to like in this series just in general.&nbsp; All in all... we starting out
  simple, peaceful, even blissful at this rate, remembering how Tsukasa and Nasa
  deal with everyday life... kinda differently compared to a lot of us. Well, we
  know that this will not last for long or else you might as well package this
  as an OVA and be done with it lmao, but yeah, keeping things simple so people
  get reminded how happy of a married couple they are and I'm still single.
  Heck, this series will end with them in bliss and I'm STILL going to be
  single. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Anyways haha, great introductions back in the alleyway,
  leading up to what looks like new characters in the next episode preview, so
  I'll look forward to that. I don't have much expectation from this new season
  though, so I really have no idea what to expect besides the story, I only know
  that much.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "The way things are now is peaceful, and that's a relief." Hey
  Tsukasa, I expect just this for another 12 episodes. Possible? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>]

  Well if you have read the intro to this post, then you will believe that I'm

  them next week if I can.

  is basically not an album but a artbook with an album sold physically so they

  not impress me at all with the new songs so I just took some of the digital

  because despite it being a two-disc release with the later one featuring his
  indie songs because why not KamiSai did the same thing too with me, definitely
  did not give me new songs to give. Like, how are the ones I've given from last
  year his best? Hmm... maybe I'll try giving one of the new songs.<br />

  is for her new song out of nowhere but for Anime, is pixel art and not that I
  care because I didn't like the song anyways so don't ask why not give the
  video. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>

  thought it was a new music release.

  so be sure to listen to what songs you liked from her from her rather mediocre
  singing live. Hey, what can I say, I've heard of better.

  so let's just move on.

  is kinda meh in my opinion thought it's short so people will get into this
  real quick. As I said, looking for melody, multilingual subtitles on the music
  video won't help.

  is hot off the shelves the talent company's fastest push of new songs yet, and
  not like it got me because damn it's so heavily video game themed unless I'm
  ambivalent to the Japanese language the lyrics is enough to put me off let
  alone the melody.

  is a classic to behold and boy we need more of these and really tone down on
  the fast-paced lyric ones I don't know how to define that to be frank. Last
  but not least but definitely last,

  following hospitalization about two weeks ago and boy is this is the saddest
  way to tell me we will have no more of this band no more, for he is the pillar
  of this band's unique style and recent revival since I knew of them around
  2012. Yeah, just sad. I can't say much. They have classics to remember, and I
  can't imagine how they will move forward without him so this might be it. RIP

  (Trust me, it's just sad writing about this)<br />
  <br />
  So next week, maybe I'll revisit some of the releases from this week, and more
  importantly <b>Waki Azumi's new single</b> releases next week. Man, it has
  been a while giving Ajuju songs considering I rejected the heck out of her
  concept mini-album last November, I'm not looking forward to this one

    >from the music video preview</a

  I've listened so far. So... unless I'm giving
  <b>UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's new album</b> if you would recall they are even
  weirder than the stuff we listen to for the past month, then maybe I'll take a
  listen to <b>FINLANDS' new song</b>. Yes, that single member band. Oh,
  apparently also based on the re-releasing of an album for their 10th
  anniversary. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Japan's music industry is weird lol and I'm deep in
  it<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  As I reflect on the week of my work break, I wonder what have I gotten myself
  into so far this year alone. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Not to trauma dump or anything, but
  honestly saying? I've never gotten so deep into anything that's... um, this
  long-lasting in effect? And that's not great? I mean, work is something lol,
  but health issues? BRUH. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I guess it's just the beginning if I don't
  start to exercise, huh. Might have to start to look into bone conduction
  earphones and handphone straps or something lol. See you guys next time then,
  likely it's that box haha and we will have more of those coming in soon, so
  unless I intend to do this on my bed during the day instead of during the
  night then I should just go see the doctor again tomorrow. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Bye.
