  Hmm... maybe we not do an intro, spice things up. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Maybe you can catch
  up on the new package I talked about earlier this week because damn I thought
  they will appear next week onwards which will very align with my another set
  of work leave but <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> On sadder news though, I thought of getting the
  "Toshitai" mug after the end of the radio show series which ended last month
  and... it's sold out. Could've spawned up a series of items from other stores
  where I have to consolidate to pad this specific order with some Rikachimalu
  and MaiMai bromides but I guess not anymore! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  ANIME!!! Haha I'm just tired with life honestly I can't even sleep on it-
  Maybe I'm getting the insomnia too lol uh oh haha the MUSIC is holding my
  sanity though that's why I started on that journey 15 years ago hehe

  Okay what is with that intro I thought we are showing what Mitsumi looks like
  when she's 80 or something. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> She might as well be haha in this new
  episode (#SkiLo03) we ask if we can join the Student Council. Hey, just ask,
  right? Like the other clubs? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> No? We just don't, I guess. Who would
  join that anyways? Oh, no slots? Even better, see ya- Oh dammit Mitsumi.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Besides writing the summary for the first part, let's talk about what
  happened with the new character that got introduced. Well, many characters if
  we were to include the President of the Student Council, eh? For Kurume-san
  though... she might have a lot of ideals. Like,
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/132503/Doppo_Kunikida"
    target="_blank"
    >"Bungou Stray Dogs" Kunikida</a
  >
  level of ideals. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> From dunking on most of the student population which
  started from her class, to still wanting to be involved with others somehow
  and not worry of being called a nerd just because she looks like one,
  Kurume-san has a lot to work on coming into this high school class where
  everyone is nice. Besides Egashira. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, nothing wrong for
  wanting to go into a club to find things out instead of them coming to you not
  every school has that resources and/or people to promote their clubs
  especially if you are the new member in order to hit the minimal club size
  count haha been there with Anime, so yeah, you can NOT be in the way of
  Mitsumi who is determined to join somehow even if this sounds like some
  satellite support group because what are the chances she will take over those
  two up there especially the one who planned her schedule to the minute.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I'm no future leader so I live my life carefree, dude. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> And
  so should you, Kurume, hanging out with the main couple (lmao) and seeing
  Mitsumi screw up taking a wefie lol girl you can use the front camera by the
  way, should already realize faster than the country bumpkin haha I'm calling
  her names too it's for the write-up I promise, that you have a less hostile
  environment in this class now, so opening up really matters. And so she
  thought, as in the second part, she got Mitsumi to join her to watch movies,
  ones that were featured in their upcoming assignment too, no reason to not go,
  right? Just that you know, everyone else is somehow invited I guess. Boo, they
  don't know this was meant to be ladies night- NOT YOU EGASHIRA lmao we can get
  Yuzuki in I suppose. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But we all know this is just a date for the
  main couple to bond their relationships haha&nbsp;why does Mitsumi sound all
  cutesy like her outfit now? Haha you naughty girl, you trying to get
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a>?
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Soon many little things start to happen as Shima said, that will
  change how people think about you and otherwise, and I would say Mitsumi is
  handling it way better than whatever is going on with telescope Yuzuki and
  kaleidoscope Kurume haha I think I'll call them that now, mainly because
  Kurume is awkward doesn't mean she doesn't want to hang out, and Yuzuki might
  have noticed that and dropped on it on her too soon. Hey, it's hard to explain
  this, but you know, it's difficult realizing stuff AND having to deal with it,
  okay? I mean, look at 3G-network Mitsumi figuring this out in the cinema way
  later and just pouring down the two flavours of popcorn down her throat.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... screw you, Egashira. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah apart from her
  being a real try hard which you really should relax a bit Shima-kun can see
  right through you as in you don't even matter <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, everyone else has their
  own story to share in this slice-of-life series, and I like it. Drama maybe?
  But most definitely, stories to warm the heart. And I think that's what this
  whole series is going to be about. So yeah, "love"? Maybe we leave that aside
  for now, we got high school life to talk about. But yeah not going to read
  Shima's mind if he does fancy the country girl haha, but hey, that's for
  later, yes? We can play around for now and THEN maybe we see if this one
  counts as a date. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>

  Yeah alright the amusement park is better- That's why everyone's going in this
  very episode!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where m*ffy gets all the spotlight
  lmao (#ToniKawaS203), because of trademark reasons lest S*nrio sues this very
  blog post haha trust me they have done it before, we shall talk about this
  amusement park at length without talking about the name of the rabbit
  whatsoever. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So, let's! In case you have not realized from the
  previous episode trailer, everyone is in the park. As to why though, we have
  Ginga-kun to thank apparently. Bro thought it would be a great idea to give
  the couple some amusement park tickets to go play around with not each other
  <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, so yeah at least Tsukasa is excited Nasa-kun is already done with it I
  guess also he probably knows how everything works inside the park so it's not
  that exciting anymore I guess. Hey Nasa-kun may not be interested in the rides
  because he has seen them, but he hasn't seen
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rabukome" target="_blank">romcoms</a>
  before so I guess we can be excited about his wife because SAME <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also
  not joining them is actually Yanagi-sensei and Taniguchi who invited her of
  course, and even though they bumped into each other, is probably trying to
  avoid this potential couple because you know, not to be a huge light bulb out
  there but uh... we gotta go we gotta go <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also joining in the light
  fest lmao I don't think anyone will get this joke this is a Chinese joke to
  associate light bulb with being between a couple's time with each other, we
  have Chitose and the gang. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Why is she even here though? I guess she
  is rich kid she can go to this anytime so why not, right? Just that for
  starters... it rained. Nice. Best park experience ever 0/10. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But as
  they say, can't control the weather not even for those who are here for
  wedding photos haha RIP that experience, still are doing better than
  Yanagi-sensei's run with this bloke who can't get himself to confess to...
  well, anything. And likely Yanagi will notice so... according to Tsukasa's
  professional analysis haha we better leave them to bloom alone if they will
  ever, yes? Moving on haha, and that's why Chitose is here, apart from having a
  great time which she did she is just more bothered about her sister going out
  with another dude though she is married lmao that's just normal man, is just
  laughing at Nasa-kun failing even though Tsukasa won't even mind if you served
  curry at the buffet in front of her. No really, it does not even matter but if
  you serve me vegetables means you love to see me suffer and I don't like that
  so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, I am open for this I don't have to be the sadist in the
  relationship haha what <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> ANYWAYS lmao and yes the maids haha can you
  guys stop with all the wrong references please I have to censor if I have to
  talk about any of these, I think this is just good setup to whatever is at the
  celebrations at the end of the day, the parade and fireworks with Taniguchi
  probably being able to slap a line from earlier which I would start with
  something like "You remember you asked why I invited you?" and <span title="*wink*">😉</span> you get
  the idea, but turns out Yanagi realized something was amiss (lol) when she did
  come here to have a great time with a nice guy teacher she knew in school.
  Hmm... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... to quote the not Charlotte aka Aurora-chan...
  must be tough being
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a>, huh.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> From Chitose to Taniguchi, they all had a hard time realizing they
  should face relationships more directly instead of you know, beating around
  the bush like it owes you money, still is better off than any of my
  relationship advancements because why would I even buy tickets to an amusement
  park and THEN think of how to invite a girl to it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah Taniguchi
  and the maids from Chitose's place, you did a good job achieving your goals
  and letting the other party have a good time. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> And Nasa-kun is just
  here for the ride haha remember this Anime series is about admiring the wife,
  ladies and gentlemen.

  Ooo why are there two bento on the kitchen table, Nakami? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> In this
  new episode where how is Nakami wide awake in the morning lol what happened to
  the insomnia (#KimiSomu02), you see, if this is a secret this means we can do
  all sorts of hints and stuff in class, right? Like a porno- And then one of
  them proceeds to sleep in class haha ah hey no one said all this is any fun
  with this problem in the way. Still, sleeping in class or in the library is as
  much cringe if not worse than sleeping at work- Yeah you tried that before?
  ALWAYS get laughed at, trust me, been there done that. Sleeping, not laughing.
  Only girls laugh at guys who doze off. <span title="*sob*">😢</span> Anyhow, let's talk about what
  happened this time around. Oh yeah, just a reminder that this is also an
  educational series right here, where we teach you many other ways to sleep
  soundly in bed every night. Please, all you know is that you need a good bed
  and silence. There's more to that. But we know the secret can't last for long,
  the hideout, but not like they are trying to keep it mum. Like, Isaki was
  totally going to talk to Nakami in class and not think that the girls will be
  thinking these two are a pair but hey not like the PA did anything better for
  them lol we will get to that later I guess, but more like, the guys are
  definitely trying to make the observatory their second, uh, third home. Second
  is the school, and then third is the red couch they stole before it was being
  abandoned. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, same as second is the cat which dropped by the
  building now that third is Nakami lol where is the male power in this even.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> It probably got worse when they eventually got found out by the
  sensei in the nurse's office if you would recall last week she was chasing
  down that cat who kept taking a fancy to her sandwich lol this cat is too
  smart, then found the hideout Nakami and Isaki have been at mainly because
  Isaki let the cat in without fixing the door knob in which Nakami is trying to
  fix of course, and then the cat trying to run to a safe place lol ie. this
  observatory which then led the sensei to the truth. Hey, it's not the cat's
  fault. Totally not possible. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> The kids got a real scolding out of the
  teacher, she will decide their fates the next day, and I guess this fun little
  secret is over then, things will go back to normal. Or so we think. Because
  damn if this is how it ends like how everything is in real life this wouldn't
  be Anime lol, my guess is likely Kurashiki-sensei here told the vice principal
  of all people, that there are people interested in joining the Astronomy Club
  that have been disbanded all these years, and in interest of the school's
  reputation they can actually revive this club, and in turn, the location for
  these two insomniacs will stay intact. At night too, so that's just overall
  convenient to be honest. By the way, all thanks to the rumour that, even with
  the scope of the secret narrowed, is still a thing only these two will keep to
  themselves from here on out. The hang out at night because can't sleep thing.
  All in all, I'm still impressed with this series just in general. We had the
  laughs, the other classmates and the teacher are still too real I can't even,
  but this relationship between Isaki and Nakami is even more real, the guy also
  won't believe it himself. Also, you thought twice about what Isaki mentioned
  at the end? Hmm... let's not think too deep into that, so let's look at the
  moon! It's just a reference of
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kaguyahime" target="_blank"
    >a woman who resides on the moon</a
  >, don't think too much okay? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>

  for Anime "KimiSomu" right now so let's move on from that I've already given.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> This week though, we do have a lot of releases to listen to, but not
  surprising at this point this month didn't really bring us better songs, so
  I'm settling for songs I can like which is just back to not promising myself
  to give melodies I like anymore. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Let's start with why this is the
  case with
  <a

      target="_blank"
      >Homecomings' new album</a
    ></b
  >
  because damn did I anticipate this too much and got real disappointed even if
  initially I gave chance to the newer songs in the release, I still ended up
  not giving them but give the topic songs that have appeared as digital singles
  over the past year. Ironic, isn't it? But yeah, moving on I may listen back to
  a couple of their indie releases which I was more keen somehow starting this
  year alone. Yeah, when they sang exclusively English. Man, they gotta have
  made a music video for the Anime theme song, right? Homecomings for their new
  ending theme song credit- Oh yeah&nbsp;<a

  which basically doesn't feature the current members at this point already
  since Kajiura-sensei did manage to get so many other singers most of them you
  may know I know Aimer and

  which then I also realized some of them are

  is uh... okay? But as with digital singles I won't really care unless it hits
  me more so impressions just had to go sky high to give chance from my
  standpoint, and I don't think this song flew that high. Thanks to YouTube
  recommendations,

  it isn't a bad song I guess. As a surprise to no one,

  won't get me more into her new single, rest assured, since I really don't feel
  much from the song anyways.

  and honestly saying? It's definitely fitting of the cover art, very Egyptian
  feels there I didn't even notice the brass instruments. So, uh... I don't
  know. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh this one I think it might matter to me where I live,

  with STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION of all people and honestly I couldn't care about
  the latter artist but they put them together but also the former is likely
  only going to sing those songs that matter but not to me so... probably not?
  The tickets are probably also a bomb so no thanks. Try SPECIAL OTHERS, dude.

  for her upcoming new single next month is as fast as it is a meh but I think I
  will definitely give more on this than her previous single since this has more
  feels to me, I suppose.

  is currently her most popular song yet and I think we know why it was for
  Anime 2 years ago, still isn't great for her live performance skills since man
  you can notice how not great it is lol but this is also her first live tour
  with a live band so I'll close one ear on that. Last but not least,

  so that's rad and I'm glad to see them back in the Anime scene.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />So for next week, we only have <b>Fuchigami Mai's new single</b> which I
  might give a little something here and there and we might just be reviewing it
  depending on how the impression goes I'm not too sure even after watching the
  music videos, and if that fails I will give a listen to

  released a couple of weeks back. And if this fails also then I will go for
  more rock festivals, if you would recall previously I stopped at Huwie~!
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And OAU, those guys, so maybe we can find something better than them
  after this week. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span><br />

  for FIVE MINUTES lol I literally saw the notification to know I WAS THAT LATE
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, just her talking again resting her chest on the table sometimes
  lol, showing the script for this live haha that, and people just sending in
  joke mail because you know, she's the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/boke" target="_blank">boke</a> role so she
  will laugh at it anyhow. Man, isn't life with Ayaneru every week just a joy?
  Haha what am I even saying now. See you guys next time then, another week of
  work before I can stop thinking about it again and think about what blog posts
  to do for the week after when I'm on another break HOPEFULLY not on the bed
  and on meds lmao please don't my body you can't keep doing this to me
