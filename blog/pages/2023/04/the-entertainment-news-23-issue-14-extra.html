  </blockquote>
  So hey yeah we are finally going to conclude this haha in case you don't know
  this was supposed to be a movie and finally got broadcasted on not the
  cinemas, let's talk about what this conclusion (#KaguyaSamaFirstKiss) is on
  about. This is about a kiss. That's all. Ironically, not the one they just
  experienced at the end of season 3 of this Anime series but technically it's
  stemmed from that very event, under the heart-shaped balloons of a spectacle.
  Yeah, any normal woman would have kissed the dude. I thought you weren't
  normal, Kaguya-sama. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, we got reversed on this lore, Hayasaka.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Kaguya thought it's fine though haha obviously it's not, this really
  got to her, and somehow, next day her was transformed into the most adorable
  thing in this universe- She's like
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/182009/Teruko_Okura"
    target="_blank"
    >one of those Hunting Dogs</a
  >
  right there with the age transformation Ability haha wrong reference here, but
  yeah, what happened?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Even
  <strike>Koko-chan</strike> Chika-chan (lol forgot 2D, only remembered 3D)
  right here only saw this her once in a blue moon, so yeah can see how much the
  main girl is affected by her very own actions (Haha I like how they didn't
  censor but just said se&nbsp; &nbsp; x like they separated it lmao) and how
  she is debating against herself about her feelings for the guy, somehow still
  can't get around the fact that she likes the guy but can't tell him straight
  and has to make him do the deed. Why does this sound like my work clients haha
  ANYWAYS- Looks like ice queen won the debate in her inner self. Uh oh.
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yabai" target="_blank">Yabe</a>! And thus
  starts her turn in reverse of asking for something she wants once again in her
  own typical fashion: By telling the guy to take action first. But who can read
  the mind that is Shinomiya Kaguya, we just witnessed the perfect blend of mood
  for her walking into school and you want &lt;insert any man's name here&gt; to
  figure you out? Bruh, try asking your dad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From not wearing gloves
  and asking for warmth with the guy walking her home, to intentionally escaping
  him until the perfume on her neck is right to smell lmao, our dear girl is
  making her advances in the worst way imaginable to mankind. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe
  Hayasaka was right, kissing was a mistake. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And when that all doesn't
  work, we had to consult love master <strike>Maki-chan</strike> Kashiwagi with
  her reputation of being the only one having a boyfriend here lmao, even then
  did not kiss or get kissed by some dude for real to Kaguya's extent and then
  went into bangin' in 40 seconds flat. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But as it goes, Kashiwagi did
  realize how much smarter she is already KGY-4 is already better than KGY-3 at
  reading the mood lol that's an AI chatbot joke right here you nerd, as I guess
  Kaguya did notice not telling anyone about her relation with the dude is not
  helping much anyways as the ice queen gets to the point. And so did Shirogane
  our main dude that I've just mentioned his name right now lol, also could not
  wrap his head around this woman (I feel ya dude haha) and had to ask someone
  related to her maybe with the same personality to see if he can figure her
  out- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't think it helped either, because above all, she is
  still really unpredictable in her advances and getting what she wants.
  Remember the basis of this series anyways? Go back and watch the very first
  episode, it's the same thing. Also, recall that to 1x Shinomiya Kaguya,
  kissing is basically, BASICALLY s*x. So yeah, title should have been "first
  sex or-" Ahem, excuse me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Since it's not, I wonder when we will get
  the real thing to happen. Hmm...
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Could it be that...?" I think Shirogane is getting it! "I have no idea what
    is going through Shinomiya Kaguya's mind!" Oh welp
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  So now that we got the formula in, you think we can tip this off to Shirogane
  so he will know and all is well? What is this, not the "Kaguya-sama" series?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I think we all know this already probably even the President at this
  rate, but now we shift our focus to how this relationship still hasn't been
  greenlit. Even just as a simple task of giving away his lunch to the girl
  though obviously we all know her trying to fend off all the other boxes is to
  make sure she doesn't get fat eating up to three
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bento" target="_blank">bento</a> haha we can
  NOT be fatter than Miko-chan lol, would then throw Shirogane off his
  determination to do such a simple deed as in you know, giving her a bite of
  that <a href="https://jisho.org/search/wi-na-" target="_blank">weiner</a>-
  Okay shaped like an octopus I meant food alright!?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, this
  stress was enough to send him to hospital, where the doctor then diagnosed him
  collapsing over being&nbsp; lovesick (F**king lmao the same doctor again,
  listening in to the same problem) and I highly doubt the assistant did
  anything to convince the dude besides throwing the old doctor's past and
  reputation as love master down the trash bin haha, will probably also not be
  able to give more advice to Shirogane himself because he will only think of
  his success so far attributed to him working hard. Working very hard. All the
  way enough to kill him, to achieve his goals. That's how he won Shinomiya's
  heart in the first place, with his grades. I don't know if the Christmas party
  would have changed anything with the Fujiwara family around lol what is with
  the handcuffs the younger sister as a possession issue, and between the gift
  the guy did not want to present to his girl, and the girl thinking of how to
  get this guy to reveal his true self... it truly was a great time at the park
  at night without anyone looking. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> That, I guess is probably what is
  needed in their relationship: the lack of overseers. Yeah, stop with those
  public eye opinions, dude, these two just want to fu- Okay for these two
  probably kissing will suffice, but Kashiwagi&nbsp; with her boyfriend in the
  hotel room?? MY MAN haha your granddad would be proud <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To conclude,
  Kaguya chose to end this series (as she dictated lol) with a date, and boy I
  would've thought of getting her a set of casual (actually normal) set of
  clothes to blend in to the crowd so they don't have to kabedon to avoid
  acquaintances, and I could be Shirgane's dad being the fortune teller to
  Tsubame and judge everything just by looking lmao, I could only say this is a
  fantastic conclusion to somewhat a long-drawn romance story.
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "But it's a blessing to be able to love someone so much that it turns your
    brain into mush; You should try it once" Yes Anime I would like to
    experience that someday... not in an Anime lmao
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  All in all... let's do a TL:DR; before we talk about what I think about this
  ending, alright? Firstly, our reference for all of this somehow besides the
  final part of course, was Kashiwagi-san. Yes, that b*tch
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/26543/Momo_Asakura" target="_blank"
    >Asakura Momo</a
  >
  kissing her on-screen boyfriend and ruining ALL OF THIS lol, making this
  series receive a rating in cinemas here?? Jesus f**king Christ WE HAD TO RATE
  THIS THING- Okay, relax. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From the actual deed that started it all to
  literally being asked for advice (Kaguya though like, what about your parents-
  Never mind haha), Kashiwagi has just waaay too much screen time on this final,
  in my opinion. Which isn't bad, I guess. I preferred the drama we saw in
  season 3 if you would recall. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Then, Kaguya is me. I am Shinomiya
  Kaguya. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Wow that sounds dark all of a sudden but I swear the joke's
  around the corner, I'm neither female or from a rich family so... I also
  cannot relate to Shirogane so we will move on with that haha but the idea is
  that, seeing her reminds me a bit of myself. Of how I did not want to hurt
  others by being with others because I'm weird. That, not many will accept, but
  for Kaguya herself to be able to find someone who will appreciate her for what
  she is -&nbsp; cold, serious, maybe even heartless - is what fills the heart.
  I hope for myself on this someday too. Someday. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> And finally, allow me to
  bring in a quote from Kaguya herself, "doesn't everyone want the person they
  love to see their true self?" is probably the most appropriate summary for
  this series. And just with what happened in the confession or technically all
  the two need is just some time together so they can be honest with each other
  which even then required Kaguya's oppression on Shirogane, is probably the
  best way to end this, can't argue with that. The narrator also dropped the
  main topic into this too, to use your brain in relationships to know if they
  last. She asked for the ordinary, but you wanted to live up to her
  expectations. So when do we draw the line? The answer is you don't. That's how
  people love and hate each other in the first place. But of course drawing us
  back to this series, we gonna use our noggin', dude. Lest we figure out that
  Shirogane can be a cheating bastard and Kaguya can be a horny- Until then we
  can still laugh it off with all the jokes landing on this final story, but
  take the rare click of a romance between these two ladies and gentlemen, a lot
  more seriously than Shirogane will ever in his life. With that, I wish them
  happiness. And we're done! They knew how to end this, they knew.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Gotta say though, maybe the author also got me, that putting that red
  handkerchief tying her hair up made Shinomiya Kaguya how adorable she is
  today. Imagine that did not happen, <strike>I myself</strike> Shirogane
  wouldn't have bothered amirite?? Haha]

  So yeah, that is all if you are wondering, we just missed the hype right about
  now, about four months after the cinema premiere in Japan, and about two for
  it appearing in my local cinemas. Also not going to take this time to binge
  watch "Heike Monogatari" though; That Anime is dead to me now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What,
  you want to know about what happened to the doctor visit? <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> Sure, just
  skip this part, future me. Anyways, long story short, I need a clearer picture
  of what's happening in my abdomen, and have requested the highest resolution
  of scans (they call them "CT") to see whether drinking lots of water or
  putting a pipe through me will help solve this. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I would hope it's
  neither or even just the former, but I'm 30 and I promised myself to be
  happier and it has failed catastrophically so far so... let's hope the package
  will arrive by the end of this week if it delivered this fast the last time.
  Fingers crossed, folks! I... can't my middle finger has eczema it hurts when I
  rub my fingies together- I'm done haha stay happy folks
