Yeah it's just me regenerating the images and never satisfied anyways because how can you even create variations of perfection? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span><br><br> Well, my finger is still stopping me from typing at my usual speed but the peeling is definitely making this easier- What am I even saying <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> On the upside though, nothing much has happened which will hopefully change as I embark on a journey from tomorrow onwards to figure out what the heck happened to recently 30-year-old me- Don't ever turn old. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><div><br></div><div>Jokes over folks, let's talk about Anime and music! <strike>Okay we have the "Kaguya-sama" final over here</strike> Uh... We'll talk about that afterwards lol</div><div><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KyokouSuiri24><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kyokou Suiri</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"... just setting foot in a place like this tends to demand a certain age or level of experience." Or just be rich, dude. If you have money you can walk in a high end restaurant with slippers haha</div></blockquote>Oh come on, Kotoko-chan has experience. She has done the whatever v** sucking thing with her boyfriend. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this final episode of a series they are already taking a break out of (#KyokouSuiri24), I guess no mysteries to solve for now unless you want to bring Rikka-san in lmao, but hey, we gotta end with at least one more, isn't it? So let's. Story goes that <strike>Akarin</strike> Kotoko-chan walked into a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/unagi target=_blank>unagi</a> shop to have some you know what, and is spotted by two guys talking to each other. Besides the obvious overlooking at what looks like a high schooler eating eel alone lol, they were talking about some guy's death of his wife and how it has traumatised him for a long time at this point, and his buddy is like "oh hey I think you might be the murderer" of his own wife. Hmm... that's very suspicious to come to such a conclusion, but before you think otherwise how this buddy is basically what Kotoko-chan has been doing all this time haha just that of course she has youkai for assistance and can reason her way though which is the title of this series by the way, he is totally right about his friend though who thinks he's just saddened by the wife's death because why wouldn't anyone. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay jokes over who is covering for this serial mugger anyways haha, so the buddy is actually right about all this. But for starters he's a friend, he can't rat him out, so he will never. But more likely, the friend might have taken hints from a certain someone that is not Kotoko-chan by the way haha we will get to that in a bit, but also unlikely that the criminal here will kill his friend in order to seal his mouth considering he doesn't have evidence to get him anyways. So yeah, all is well until of course this would not be a mystery series if we don't talk about why Kotoko-chan is around. She is not God mind you but I guess she is in a way lol or else how can you curb a demon such as Kuro-san hehe WITH EEL MEAT LMAO okay can we stop with the jokes, but she can see the ghost of his departed wife. Of whom he killed. Or else why would he experience sleep paralysis every night? The wife was hugging and not leaving his side, dude! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, you wanted her to be with you forever, and you gonna get it! <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Anyways, this is the conclusion apparently I really thought I would get some romance action in here lol I guess we won't know what happened at Kuro-san's place lmao, but yeah, if you are here for the mystery talk, then I hope you have enjoyed. For me though? I don't know. I have hardly had my fill of mystery series, even the normal ones, ever since this one came by a couple of years ago, and I doubt I will emkark on another at some point, but the appeal of this series still continues to deliver, and the idea of talking about the spiritual world being involved in real world events is still gaining my interest, and how they had to be segregated in order to co-exist. Or be fused together, in this case. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Either way, sorry for not believing in ghosts even if one were to possess me now haha oh no did I find myself out, but watching this series has been entertaining despite the long-running dialogues to be honest. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Not asking for another season of this animation though, unless you reaaaalllly want to talk about the two of them doing something together lmao okay we are done here</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqlMLXRhcjxbRaCR7ngdMjuP_awWtfyI_B3F4mmP4N8O8G42Oi5-72R3VlZ9W0HDze2rsNiGq700SFuQx6m9HP6LL1rkFYpw_--VCq6a5teZp8sdX4giVdPACHdCqCIxURUy3jMvrz5UAfCQsJTbM_rSHj-Ve0vHh5nvVR6IlTJxgsgCJDPsAfzXMP/s320/kyokousuiri24_god.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>And so, the propaganda continues haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpg0Nx0u3cVyNwAy_4TW5AHMuiFBxbGb4UFdBJ1HR57etW8Sgxhn2c_DLqMJXgWWBZQxucU0ORH-GsPahcdlgTTJeBuAVo4VKCDQzhuRn4GaWQ3usLz-SCF5UJjDAXxyGdDP2tEEcZhxxHYaXb4hJTqv9CX24qYeCgXgYIK_prb-uOVC3JgZRc2x1q/s1600/kyokousuiri24_drop.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How I feel about this series lol<br>(And I'm sorry for this)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Then the waitress at the cafe is the strongest ever; She always forgets my order" Dazai burning women even in prison lmao</div></blockquote>Hey, no regret killing innocents, amirite Teruko-chan?? *raises hand for high five* No? Haha okay not me I have no power to fight I'm no Ability user anyways. In this final episode of this season haha we are promised more by the way (#BungouStrayDogs50), YEAH WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT SIGNMA BEING CREATED BY THE BOOK?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Call me <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/132504/Ranpo_Edogawa target=_blank>famous detective</a>, thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'll run through this episode a bit faster mainly because I wrote a conclusion longer than a fall from the Sky Casino lol, so let's briefly touch on everything that happened. Previously, Sigma made the two Hunting Dogs have to deal with innocent visitors coming for their bounty, so and I'm sorry for finding out Teruko's Ability last week lol I guess I can narc now, she transformed into an old woman and stayed in one of the hotel rooms to look like she's just one of them who is hard on hearing. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And even better, Tachihara is a kid hidden in a carrier so she can walk around with as a crutch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I am just talking about of my mouth at this point lol, but yeah, Teruko can transform people (and herself, yikes) into their younger/older selves by the way, and I would love to tell her to make me into a coffin right now lol AHEM, but yeah seeing her Ability in action is as scary as awesome, though I gotta say that her dealing with the anti-Ability user gun from Sigma is kinda bs but then again she did mention about their bodies being modified every month lol so Tachihara too apparently- Please, the doctors will only get off operating on the woman. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or girl, we don't know what actual Teruko age is anyways, she can lie all she wants. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She even is smart enough to pluck out her ears to not suffer the effects from the Dazai gun which relies on sound- Haha this sounds familiar (get it?) who stole this from "BLEACH"?? Hey I'm also borrowing this idea? Thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then, Teruko tried to push Sigma down only to be saved by Atsushi, but Sigma must die according to Fyodor anyways so he can't reveal the final page's location, and so some random dude appears to finish him off. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> But yeah, technically they screwed up here especially Margaret who fell for the same trick again getting someone tied by the bad guy so he can join in the room where these two are going to- All in all... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Firstly, let us talk about why Dazai will win in the end as they talk behind the scenes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, no surprises, it's the limitation of writing in the book. Finally we are at the precipice of their argument in prison lmao, because the idea is that we are dealing with humans. Unlike the "human" created by the book lol poor Sigma, and even then one's ideals can change haha looking at you Kunikida in <a href="https://twitter.com/bungosd_anime/status/1641086525462163457?s=20" target=_blank>the new season trailer</a> hehe, though Fyodor believes in things going according to plan, he can't plan everything OUTSIDE of the book. And I mean <em>everything</em>. All can go according to the narrative, but as we even just compare this light novel series to the animated adaptation of the original work, fans can already criticize on the lack of detail on the work thereof, and thus if we relate that to God creating the world to the book which is basically a subset of the world... I hope you get the idea I can't explain like Dazai but you will get it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also just means Fyodor doesn't get humans haha ah hey same bro but that doesn't make me a villain. Speaking of which, next up, our current arc's first liability. It was, and will always be, Tachihara. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Because in case you didn't understand, if you are a spy, you work both sides. If you are a TRUE spy, you will side both sides so real, no one can catch you for it. But what if there is a conflict? Tachihara is the true exhibition of all this, seeing him spare lives (Gin!! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>) in exception to finding out if it's worth just killing the organization's people you were spying for. Hey, Fyodor didn't watch enough Hong Kong spy movies, what can I say? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Refer to first point haha, but suffice it to say that, this will be the first of many attempts to override the book, and seeing that the final page is full, we can only depend on what Dazai believes to change this course. Last but not least, we are hinted of Sigma's fall from the Sky Casino. With Nikolai at the ground though, I can think of both fates he can take, and I don't know what Fyodor would want in this case. He's also an Ability user himself isn't he, this Sigma? So yeah, maybe we cross paths again next time. So, so much lead-up by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So in case you don't know, <a href="https://twitter.com/bungosd_anime/status/1641085305104236544?s=20" target=_blank>5th season has been announced</a> and yes this is the 4th if you have been counting, and will air in upcoming July (thank goodness) along with other series like "BLEACH" so see you in three months where I ONLY watch sequels haha no new shows for me. We will continue on this crazy train ride which I gotta say, is making me grab the edge of my seat and I LOVE IT!!

Oh hey, welcome back. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, let's move on and talk about new songs from this year haha so in this case we have <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/magnet-ep/1676469396?l=en" target=_blank>Kroi's new mini-album</a></b>. It's alright, not going to get me with their usual style though they kind of did so I gave the short song which sadly I wish it was longer, and probably the chill song I have listened to the music video before I knew of this release. I could use more chill songs at this point so I didn't go out to find more songs because Anime is probably going to in the next couple of months lol</div><div><br>So okay time for more new stuff on Twitter I've seen this week, are you ready, me? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I don't know, sometimes my old self really doesn't want progression, but we gotta move on. Didn't notice this so this is for me because <b><a href="https://twitter.com/TOWER_Online/status/1641405913390280705?s=20" target=_blank>Ueno Daiki major debut album releases next week</a></b> following <a href="https://twitter.com/ueno_daiki/status/1588865001242361856?s=20" target=_blank>his major label debut announcement</a> back in November last year how did I not know of this I listened to 2 releases already. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/KroiOfficial/status/1640368088343543810?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi's recent live audio is now in music streaming</a></b> services where I can listen to the... 2 songs I know of them haha okay maybe 3 after this week. No really, <a href="https://twitter.com/KroiOfficial/status/1640368327347556353?s=20" target=_blank>my first song from them</a> is a wonder to listen to, trust me. Also almost missed <a href="https://twitter.com/KroiOfficial/status/1641032810214436864?s=20" target=_blank>their mini-album release live</a> which I guess listening back I only knew the last song so I technically did not miss anything lol. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/TatsuyaKitani2/status/1640534174334345222?s=20" target=_blank>Kitani Tatsuya revealed an Anime "BLEACH" animation music video</a></b> which if I'm not wrong featured a new song from his recent album which I did not listen to, but listening to this I might just have to hehe that's how they get you. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1640732979101327361?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new song</a></b> is not going to get me to like her now so I'll skip that unfortunately. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1641004250145894400?s=20" target=_blank>miwa released a couple of live videos</a></b> which sadly aren't my thing because I didn't like those songs so don't ask me why not it has been 13 years. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'll not talk about April Fool's Day jokes because it's Anime and nothing of them is about music so don't ask why they aren't mentioned here.<br><br>For next week though, looks like if I search I will find a lot of stuff released from people I know of, so I guess we will listen to them to start the month. <b>yorushika's new art album</b> is meant to be physical only though it's art blended in with music but they promised a <a href="https://twitter.com/nbuna_staff/status/1603313975663693824?s=20" target=_blank>digital music release</a> also so I will be listening to that then. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%AF%E3%81%AA%E3%82%88%E3%81%A9/1671154977?l=en" target=_blank>Nisshoku Natsuko's new mini-album</a></b> is also something I can get into considering I did give her a couple of times, so let's see if her rather unusual style can hold up to my tastes again. Last but not least though, since I've discovered this in due time, I will listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%96%B0%E7%B7%91/1672972737?l=en" target=_blank>Ueno Daiki's major debut album</a></b> by the way so congrats I might have helped him reach this ever since I knew of him through Miyawaki Shion's appearance in his music video from last year- That was a lot to say at once. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, I will give a listen, he is the chill mood I might need now because I highly doubt the other two releases will be doing me that favour so we shall see if I can praise him more by the end of next week.<br><br><br><br><br> So the plan for next week is... I ask to be referred to a specialist... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay can I stop with my real life trauma dump as a joke and so should you Kouno Marika haha <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> and let's hopefully be able to spend some time here also fixing the blog thumbnails and stuff I've only standardized since... 2 years ago actually I checked, so everything before dating back to 2018? Those are probably not in the format you see today, also probably not as long.
