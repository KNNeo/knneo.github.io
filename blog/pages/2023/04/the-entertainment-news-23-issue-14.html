Hey, I would like to do a &lt;insert joke here&gt; April Fool's Day joke so why
not let the AI trend continue while we are at it, making fun of how terrible it
made my real profile pic technically worse (or better, maybe I'll actually get
ladies if I put this on Tinder lmao), or how it turned Ten-chan into a Korean
idol for some reason. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm not into Koreans so Ten-chan always, thanks.
Yeah it's just me regenerating the images and never satisfied anyways because
how can you even create variations of perfection? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span><br />
<br />
Well, my finger is still stopping me from typing at my usual speed but the
peeling is definitely making this easier- What am I even saying <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> On the
upside though, nothing much has happened which will hopefully change as I embark
on a journey from tomorrow onwards to figure out what the heck happened to
recently 30-year-old me- Don't ever turn old. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
<div><br /></div>

  Jokes over folks, let's talk about Anime and music!
  <strike>Okay we have the "Kaguya-sama" final over here</strike>&nbsp;Uh...
  We'll talk about that afterwards lol

  </blockquote>
  Oh come on, Kotoko-chan has experience. She has done the whatever v** sucking
  thing with her boyfriend. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode of a series they are
  already taking a break out of (#KyokouSuiri24), I guess no mysteries to solve
  for now unless you want to bring Rikka-san in lmao, but hey, we gotta end with
  at least one more, isn't it? So let's. Story goes that
  <strike>Akarin</strike> Kotoko-chan walked into a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/unagi" target="_blank">unagi</a> shop to
  have some you know what, and is spotted by two guys talking to each other.
  Besides the obvious overlooking at what looks like a high schooler eating eel
  alone lol, they were talking about some guy's death of his wife and how it has
  traumatised him for a long time at this point, and his buddy is like "oh hey I
  think you might be the murderer" of his own wife. Hmm... that's very
  suspicious to come to such a conclusion, but before you think otherwise how
  this buddy is basically what Kotoko-chan has been doing all this time haha
  just that of course she has youkai for assistance and can reason her way
  though which is the title of this series by the way, he is totally right about
  his friend though who thinks he's just saddened by the wife's death because
  why wouldn't anyone. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay jokes over who is covering for this serial
  mugger anyways haha, so the buddy is actually right about all this. But for
  starters he's a friend, he can't rat him out, so he will never. But more
  likely, the friend might have taken hints from a certain someone that is not
  Kotoko-chan by the way haha we will get to that in a bit, but also unlikely
  that the criminal here will kill his friend in order to seal his mouth
  considering he doesn't have evidence to get him anyways. So yeah, all is well
  until of course this would not be a mystery series if we don't talk about why
  Kotoko-chan is around. She is not God mind you but I guess she is in a way lol
  or else how can you curb a demon such as Kuro-san hehe WITH EEL MEAT LMAO okay
  can we stop with the jokes, but she can see the ghost of his departed wife. Of
  whom he killed. Or else why would he experience sleep paralysis every night?
  The wife was hugging and not leaving his side, dude! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, you wanted
  her to be with you forever, and you gonna get it! <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Anyways, this is
  the conclusion apparently I really thought I would get some romance action in
  here lol I guess we won't know what happened at Kuro-san's place lmao, but
  yeah, if you are here for the mystery talk, then I hope you have enjoyed. For
  me though? I don't know. I have hardly had my fill of mystery series, even the
  normal ones, ever since this one came by a couple of years ago, and I doubt I
  will emkark on another at some point, but the appeal of this series still
  continues to deliver, and the idea of talking about the spiritual world being
  involved in real world events is still gaining my interest, and how they had
  to be segregated in order to co-exist. Or be fused together, in this case.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Either way, sorry for not believing in ghosts even if one were to
  possess me now haha oh no did I find myself out, but watching this series has
  been entertaining despite the long-running dialogues to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Not asking for another season of this animation though, unless you reaaaalllly
  want to talk about the two of them doing something together lmao okay we are
  done here

  Hey, no regret killing innocents, amirite Teruko-chan?? *raises hand for high
  five* No? Haha okay not me I have no power to fight I'm no Ability user
  anyways. In this final episode of this season haha we are promised more by the
  way (#BungouStrayDogs50), YEAH WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT SIGNMA BEING CREATED BY
  THE BOOK?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Call me

    >famous detective</a
  >, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'll run through this episode a bit faster mainly because
  I wrote a conclusion longer than a fall from the Sky Casino lol, so let's
  briefly touch on everything that happened. Previously, Sigma made the two
  Hunting Dogs have to deal with innocent visitors coming for their bounty, so
  and I'm sorry for finding out Teruko's Ability last week lol I guess I can
  narc now, she transformed into an old woman and stayed in one of the hotel
  rooms to look like she's just one of them who is hard on hearing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And
  even better, Tachihara is a kid hidden in a carrier so she can walk around
  with as a crutch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I am just talking about of my mouth at this point
  lol, but yeah, Teruko can transform people (and herself, yikes) into their
  younger/older selves by the way, and I would love to tell her to make me into
  a coffin right now lol AHEM, but yeah seeing her Ability in action is as scary
  as awesome, though I gotta say that her dealing with the anti-Ability user gun
  from Sigma is kinda bs but then again she did mention about their bodies being
  modified every month lol so Tachihara too apparently- Please, the doctors will
  only get off operating on the woman. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or girl, we don't know what
  actual Teruko age is anyways, she can lie all she wants. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She even is
  smart enough to pluck out her ears to not suffer the effects from the Dazai
  gun which relies on sound- Haha this sounds familiar (get it?) who stole this
  from "BLEACH"?? Hey I'm also borrowing this idea? Thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then,
  Teruko tried to push Sigma down only to be saved by Atsushi, but Sigma must
  die according to Fyodor anyways so he can't reveal the final page's location,
  and so some random dude appears to finish him off. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> But yeah,
  technically they screwed up here especially Margaret who fell for the same
  trick again getting someone tied by the bad guy so he can join in the room
  where these two are going to- All in all... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Firstly, let us talk
  about why Dazai will win in the end as they talk behind the scenes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Okay, no surprises, it's the limitation of writing in the book. Finally we are
  at the precipice of their argument in prison lmao, because the idea is that we
  are dealing with humans. Unlike the "human" created by the book lol poor
  Sigma, and even then one's ideals can change haha looking at you Kunikida
  in&nbsp;<a
    href="https://twitter.com/bungosd_anime/status/1641086525462163457?s=20"
    target="_blank"
    >the new season trailer</a
  >
  hehe, though Fyodor believes in things going according to plan, he can't plan
  everything OUTSIDE of the book. And I mean <em>everything</em>. All can go
  according to the narrative, but as we even just compare this light novel
  series to the animated adaptation of the original work, fans can already
  criticize on the lack of detail on the work thereof, and thus if we relate
  that to God creating the world to the book which is basically a subset of the
  world... I hope you get the idea I can't explain like Dazai but you will get
  it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also just means Fyodor doesn't get humans haha ah hey same bro
  but that doesn't make me a villain. Speaking of which, next up,&nbsp;our
  current arc's first liability. It was, and will always be, Tachihara.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Because in case you didn't understand, if you are a spy, you work
  both sides. If you are a TRUE spy, you will side both sides so real, no one
  can catch you for it. But what if there is a conflict? Tachihara is the true
  exhibition of all this, seeing him spare lives (Gin!! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>) in exception
  to finding out if it's worth just killing the organization's people you were
  spying for. Hey, Fyodor didn't watch enough Hong Kong spy movies, what can I
  say? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Refer to first point haha, but suffice it to say that, this will
  be the first of many attempts to override the book, and seeing that the final
  page is full, we can only depend on what Dazai believes to change this course.
  Last but not least, we are hinted of Sigma's fall from the Sky Casino. With
  Nikolai at the ground though, I can think of both fates he can take, and I
  don't know what Fyodor would want in this case. He's also an Ability user
  himself isn't he, this Sigma? So yeah, maybe we cross paths again next time.
  So, so much lead-up by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So in case you don't know,

  three months where I ONLY watch sequels haha no new shows for me. We will
  continue on this crazy train ride which I gotta say, is making me grab the
  edge of my seat and I LOVE IT!! Haha see you guys then.

  I mentioned last week, what of it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm not expecting myself to listen
  to the whole album again to be honest considering I need a break from these
  songs in the first place. Oh hey, welcome back. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, let's move
  on and talk about new songs from this year haha so in this case we have

  of did so I gave the short song which sadly I wish it was longer, and probably
  the chill song I have listened to the music video before I knew of this
  release. I could use more chill songs at this point so I didn't go out to find
  more songs because Anime is probably going to in the next couple of months lol

  So okay time for more new stuff on Twitter I've seen this week, are you ready,

  get you.

  which sadly aren't my thing because I didn't like those songs so don't ask me
  why not it has been 13 years. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'll not talk about April Fool's Day
  jokes because it's Anime and nothing of them is about music so don't ask why
  they aren't mentioned here.<br />
  <br />For next week though, looks like if I search I will find a lot of stuff
  released from people I know of, so I guess we will listen to them to start the
  month. <b>yorushika's new art album</b> is meant to be physical only though
  it's art blended in with music but they promised a

  also so I will be listening to that then.

  is also something I can get into considering I did give her a couple of times,
  so let's see if her rather unusual style can hold up to my tastes again. Last
  but not least though, since I've discovered this in due time, I will listen to

  by the way so congrats I might have helped him reach this ever since I knew of
  him through Miyawaki Shion's appearance in his music video from last year-
  That was a lot to say at once. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, I will give a listen, he is
  the chill mood I might need now because I highly doubt the other two releases
  will be doing me that favour so we shall see if I can praise him more by the
  end of next week.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  So the plan for next week is... I ask to be referred to a specialist...
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay can I stop with my real life trauma dump as a joke and so should
  you Kouno Marika haha <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> and let's hopefully be able to spend some time
  here also fixing the blog thumbnails and stuff I've only standardized since...
  2 years ago actually I checked, so everything before dating back to 2018?
  Those are probably not in the format you see today, also probably not as long.
  Cya guys next week then, and next time might be an Anime Extra or just Extra
  at this point, where I gloriously screwed up watching something "Kaguya-sama"
  too early without the second half lmao so we will not do this here but talk
  about it at length in the next post! See you there I suppose<br />

  P.S. Well, I would rather not do an update post for my Third Candles Plan
  which includes listening to the equivalent of voice actress podcasts in Japan
  so here's a summary with tuned in as highlighted:
