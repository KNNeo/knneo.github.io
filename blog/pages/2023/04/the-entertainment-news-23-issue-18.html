I mean, I feel happy right now from basically many factors happening this week
that have proven my point because (1) DOAXVV
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/gacha" target="_blank">gacha</a> SSR <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> I
got one using event tickets which have the worst odds lower than gems and the
free 10-roll I'm getting every day, (2)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-or_D-qNqM&amp;t=313s" target="_blank"
  >this YouTube video</a
>
reminded me of indirectly pursuing happiness and specifically to alleviate
stress is to take work leave and (3) in Sakura Ayane's Instagram live yesterday
someone reminded me that even if you don't live in Japan you can get NINE DAYS
BREAK from yesterday to next Sunday during the Golden Week break, where we will
meet here again.
<div><br /></div>
<div><span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Now that my happy times are just starting lol, let's keep it going by watching
  Anime and listening to music! The latter I may want to take a break I don't
  know haha<br />
  <br />

  Okay, noted, Kanechika being the bad guy this episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey bro you
  can't blame on innocent girl and that's why they need to be protected in this
  new episode (#SkiLo04), boy is some guy is going to accidentally join the
  drama club for no reason. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Don't worry, not happening anytime soon,
  and as Mitsumi almost killed herself over just doing a quiz in school and
  spacing out while getting hit with a volleyball lol, it's pretty obvious even
  to the blind that someone is distracted about something, and she talks to
  Shima about what she heard of Kanechika-senpai's plans to rail him in. Of
  course, he still rejected on all grounds, now stating that when he was child
  acting and appeared on television, he was doing it all for his mother, and
  thus did not gain any further interest in pursuing the career. Same bro,
  literally same story, but mine was more of a standstill because it set me to
  the biggest challenge in acting of my kid life: love. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on
  haha, Kanechika got shot down real good, with Mitsumi refusing to tell him the
  reason, just like a good friend. I mean, Shima may not have any goals in life
  now but it's definitely not acting with you dressed up as a woman in that skit
  we saw before. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Though I&nbsp;gotta say? Mitsumi-chan has more life
  goals than we have. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Spiritual fulfilment, you know. I guess this is
  part of it but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, second half is probably what took the
  spotlight this time around, where apparently lazy teacher told Mitsumi that a
  certain student council senpai is more capable than her (the teacher) (lol) in
  terms of discipline and so Mitsumi chose to follow Takamine-senpai for a day
  in her tightly scheduled life. Hey, Takamine-senpai? I can see your ego
  shining from another galaxy now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Turns out, if you can believe it,
  Mitsumi ended up dragging her feet all the way into the sunset, from
  suggesting the idea of looking at someone's farm even though we are just going
  to their place to give handouts for the day, to missing the bus and letting
  the cat pass the time with them... yes I know these are very countryside
  things to do and or experience otherwise considering everyone has a house
  visit rule longer than the time Takamine would've set, and 15 minute intervals
  are uber fast in city bus schedules... once in a while it's just great to take
  a break out of that pace and you know, hand in an empty quiz answering sheet
  once in a while haha Mitsumi you think this will drop her grades? Even the
  sensei isn't worried in a bit she doesn't even care. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all...
  Takamine-senpai is cool, isn't she? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, not going to be too biased
  on this, but hey between Shima taking his life as a joke now and people like
  Mitsumi and Takamine having goals and setting themselves straight all the time
  even at their teens... don't worry I am not even close to these guys. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Then again, as you can see, they are teaching each other stuff here and there,
  and that's what makes this slice-of-life drama good, isn't it? Yes, and so it
  is. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also, definitely first time heard of so much Tsuda Minami that
  does NOT sound like her. Yes, you heard that right, Takamine is voiced by her.
  Seriously, this series blows my mind every episode, and I can't wait for more
  stories to cry to or be happy about.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "What does having no regrets even mean?" Yes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, look at
  me. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>]

  Okay ominous intro summary drop, what is going to happen from here on? Haha I
  doubt anything just yet, but in this new episode (#ToniKawaS204) it's all
  about kissing apparently. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I didn't come up with this
  storytelling, go ask the author and the scriptwriter for the Anime. Anyhow,
  let's talk about what happened. For starters, the couple are complimenting
  each other again. Nasa-kun was so capable of anything he helped fix the vacuum
  cleaner for Kaname, and even went out of his way to create high school study
  material for Aya-chan who of course, in her record of failing tests and
  procrastination skills, will likely not pass the exams yet again but that's
  not our concern lmao, is still able to do all this while working on this
  coding stuff which honestly is impressive- My ideal life will be Yuzaki Nasa,
  honestly. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> On the other hand, we have the caring wife who is scared
  of doing anything in public lol not assassin or swordswoman lore drop, is kind
  enough to give a massage to the husband for working long hours in front of the
  computer which is known to cause a number of problems which is basically where
  I ache all over right now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nasa-kun is as usual thinking of all the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">pervy</a> stuff, but
  not as pervy as Kaname-chan who seriously needs a partner so she can stop
  searching online for stuff about how to kiss and where to kiss. Or maybe we
  buy her a sex doll, I don't know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, she kindly listed all of
  them and gave it to the guy in hopes of him doing something about the wife?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Can this series not be less straightforward lol thanks Hayate for the
  example kissing literally everyone knew about the author of this series having
  to write the "Hayate no Gotoku" series in their past when we are all kids. Now
  that we are married lmao, I guess upping the game isn't too hard, the kissing
  haha, but I guess doing all this in public is still kinda embarrassing but not
  for the Yanagi-sensei couple so we will ignore that lol that kiss is so long
  they have time to hide in a bush, so they decide to just do it at home. Or
  when Kaname-chan also printed a copy of the list for Tsukasa lmao f**king why
  Kaname go get yourself a man or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, they kissed, many
  times, on the chest too but with clothes on and that's why this is not a porno
  haha Nasa-kun you don't think too far in, and that's probably what this is all
  about. Marriage. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, entertaining episode as always, next
  time stop with the introduction summary if it's not about Tsukasa's lore drop
  haha seriously though, and boy Aya-chan is beyond hope just like me. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  It's simple how this series has been so far even with new characters, and I
  know this is still before the drop, and likely next week too looks like we are
  going to the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onsen" target="_blank">hot springs</a> even
  though we kind of live in one lol... but hey, not that I'm complaining, but
  the budget for this second season seems low. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If it can still deliver
  then I'll still see it till the end just like how I dealt with "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/44204/Kyokou_Suiri_Season_2"
    target="_blank"
    >Kyokou Suiri</a
  >" last season that also wasn't as ground-breaking as any would have hoped.
  Mediocre, I guess. It's still funny and stuff as long as these two stay in the
  hot springs, so that's good enough married life story for me. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  Oh hey yeah now we have the Astronomy Club, things are heating up! Not at
  night though, we can't with just the two of them lol. In this new episode
  though (#KimiSomu03), we introduce another loner- Hey me, don't call people
  loner like I'm not one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, because this "club" thing still
  needs to run like one in this school who touted themselves to have one of
  these clubs some time ago until it's revived by these two, the sensei and
  advisor Kurashiki told them that in order to fulfil the requirements for
  presentation in the upcoming September meeting club president Nakami will have
  to attend, they will have to come up with some event and/or some achievement
  to show that they have been using the observatory and not use it to camp
  indoors- What the- <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, Kurashiki only knows of the "last" member
  of this club Shiromaru (who is voiced by an embarrassed
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/890/Haruka_Tomatsu" target="_blank"
    >Tomatsu Haruka</a
  >
  I'M IN lol it has been 15 years dude, relax) who of course is an alumni
  working now in the countryside, so the two have to track long enough to
  find... it's a her apparently, working at basically an arcade. Hey, who
  doesn't desire this life, innit? She invited them in to her small abode which
  is basically a container haha what's the difference between this and living in
  an apartment nowadays, she whipped up dinner for them and told them a story
  about her sad high school life. Basically, it would have been more cool if
  these 3 were in the club at the same time, but sadly she is left alone after
  all the senpai graduated, leaving her really having all the rights to be in
  the observatory without having to do anything, unlike these two. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Then again, the times have changed I don't know for how long Shiromaru here
  doesn't look that young lol, but these kids really do not know anything about
  even taking photos of the stars (and the girl Isaki-chan hehe don't tell), so
  the senpai gave them a crash course and sent them on their way. Including her.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If you recall earlier in the episode also, she did come into school
  to find the observatory likely only to think that the Astronomy Club has been
  disbanded and the location being used as a warehouse... until now. So yeah,
  why not, everyone has memories of this location, and no one is actually
  willing to let it go not with this cute girl around lol I'm talking about
  Isaki-chan <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> so might as well make the best out of all of this, yes? Yeah
  basically thanks to Nakami's efforts Isaki will be able to get more comfort
  items in the observatory to aid their sleep together- Ahem, just pitch your
  tent in already, Nakami. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nakami's plan for now, is to aim for an
  upcoming meteor shower coming into the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ishikawaken" target="_blank"
    >Ishikawa Prefecture</a
  >
  where they are at (yes, it's real), use the summer camp to find a good spot
  and also learn to take photos of the stars by then since there is a popular
  spot to do so maybe better than the one photo Shiromaru sent to them at night
  haha, and hopefully take good photos enough to submit to the nationwide
  photo-shooting contest later in the year. All in all, wow that is a lot of
  things to expect just within the school year alone. We solved our sleeping
  problem with Isaki-chan, we chanced upon the observatory (lol), and now we are
  actually doing photo-taking stuff in school at night. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, can't be
  peeping in the day when you are indoors in the observatory and taking photos
  of sleepy main girl, amirite?? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah Shiromaru, I would like you to
  not tell anyone about this? Haha she won't just take pictures of her and she
  will leave lol I'm liking this dynamic already to be honest.

  was that good as I gave BOTH SONGS in the single but thank goodness not have
  to pay for anything further out of my own pocket as I do not review Limited
  Edition only releases. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't know why this idolism did not make a
  Regular Edition but who knows they don't want my money I suppose. The songs
  are actually great though, accented by Mai-chan's lyric-writing it only got
  better if you understand the words. Yes,

  Now that I realized this segment is purely dedicated to music news on Twitter
  that I can relate to because I can only care about new releases and/or new
  online music content since I don't live in Japan and cannot enjoy the live
  they had over the weekend or something. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I like how we are closer to

  for Anime "KimiSomu" takes a lot of references from the animation itself
  picturing a couple walking alone in the night streets, so not much and as I
  said I let the Anime bring the impression of this song to me anyways.

  is probably their best so far leading up to the new album in October but not
  enough for me to give a thumbs up. Hey, maybe they do have something prepped
  up at the back that is good, who knows.

  is of a song I know too well, and if you have not seen them on the streets of
  Shibuya lol not that I have but I've watched them live on YouTube,
  SpecialThanks' new live video on the streets is a familiar song from a few
  years ago which easily can rock the paths out there even now. And to end this
  I feel like I want to talk about this,

  <br />For next week though, after probably giving a listen to
  <b>Ikimonogakari's new song</b> which damn I'm already so over with them lol,
  it has been 2 years since the last time I did this too so I may take this time
  to visit <b>Hololive solo artist music</b> again. Yes, not the group ones
  because I legit do not care. I'm already starting with

  Wow am I just rushing the above so much I barely have time to think of
  anything else mainly also because I spent too much time just this weekend or
  the weekdays also fixing my GitHub Pages site without much reward besides
  self-gratification? Yeah, that'll be enough. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you guys next week
  then, we are going to start May real strong with a bunch of posts for
  #KN15YEARS which... I've not done much of and that's why I'll have to cram
  them tomorrow so I can start this off right haha so see you then for more
  random talk about my life of music, and until then... I think DMM Point Club
  gave me a reason to go clock walking steps now. 6000 steps for a chance to get
  10 yen? I'M IN lol will report progress if any next week lmao don't expect too
  much though I probably will not go anywhere <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
