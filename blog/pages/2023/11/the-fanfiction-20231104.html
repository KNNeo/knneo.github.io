  I was just reminded today is "great (idol) support day" so I guess

    >not you Akarin</a
  >
  haha also I decided on this yesterday not knowing any of these so not you also
  Ayachi though I would argue I'll support the latter more than who we will be
  talking about today. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Speaking of which, we have a new story to tell, this one's a sequel, still
  featuring a married woman which will be the theme for the rest of the month
  haha it's ok if you haven't figured out by now, so let's proceed with another
  episode in this 2nd season(?) of a series where fictional me encounter and
  interact with women I adore. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

    <i
      >A few days after I helped a certain lady seek shelter in the sudden
      pouring rain, I have been contacted by someone who said they are the
      talent manager of Hanazawa Kana, and they would like to meet up in thanks
      for my kind act back then. Upon noticing what opportunity I have created
      for myself, I agreed to meet up the following afternoon.</i
    >
  </div>
  <div>
    <em><br /></em>
  </div>
  <div>
    <i>
      We met up in city center, and with some egging from Kana-chan, we
      eventually settled for a famous bakery which they frequent. They ordered a
      table's worth of bread and a couple of drinks to go with, it was quite a
      spectacle. Kana-chan held up a piece of bread which looks like a human
      face and smiled at me. I pointed a finger towards my face, and she burst
      out laughing while attempting to apologize.</i
    >
  </div>
  <div>
    <em><br /></em>
  </div>
  <div>
    <i
      >Since then, it felt like between Kana-chan saying
      <abbr title="食べて、食べて！">"Eat up, eat up!"</abbr> and her talking to
      the manager, I think she might have been embarrassed from her behaviour
      earlier. This was such a treat in many layers, I skipped dinner that
      evening.</i

  So yeah, some proper conclusion(?) to this weird relationship between
  fictional me and Kana-chan, by the way. Isn't she some famous Japanese voice
  actress? Really, me, this is it though?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, at least they returned
  the favour despite all the formality, I guess this is just a reason for me to
  be elusively involved in
  <a
    href="https://x.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1230298398135242757?s=20"
    target="_blank"
    >her bread addiction</a
  >
  as I would love to point out as one of her attributes. Still, we have seen her
  being rather improper on camera (lmao) so I thought seeing her being shy and
  demure and so pure (lol) will probably do me good on my heart. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Kana-chan is a lovely individual, isn't it? <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Boy am I still frustrated at my dinner out just now because not only did
  my food take up to 45 minutes to serve and I don't want to even question why,
  but also all this time I have been sitting beside the table of a rich jerk who
  is (vaguely and incorrectly) explaining to someone on the next table (by the
  way) about investments and doing big things in life, I want to beat him to
  show him what's up. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe I'll sleep this out and tomorrow will be
  better, eh? <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S.Perhaps the only consolation was the group of Japanese girls (you read
  that right) queuing in front of us, and they went "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/yoshi"
    target="_blank"
    >Yoshi</a
  >" when it was their turn. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah, I'll have sex with any one of them.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
