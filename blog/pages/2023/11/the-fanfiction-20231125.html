  Oh, SHOULD I talk about Singapore's AFA this weekend? <span class="emoji" title="üòê">*silence*</span> Can I not?
  <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span>

<div>
  Yeah yeah blah blah my bro got on a ballot to see Uesaka Sumire (yes, the one
  and only) in person and got her to sign... whatever it is with his real name
  on it. I mean, I would've just signed up for Kouno Marika's fanclub but <span class="emoji" title="üòé">*dabs*</span>
  so you get it, I'm a passive fan. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> It was interesting seeing him
  message me on the whole thing though I would argue I should be able to
  understand everything better than him including carry a conversation with
  Sumipe <span class="emoji" title="üòé">*dabs*</span>, but overall as you can see why I am alone and sad because I
  can't deal with women in real life- Oh, female colleagues are a different
  thing your anxiety goes away if there's work on the line lmao

  Speaking of which haha I don't think this has anything to do with any of the
  above, remember we are still in married women month so to conclude this! Haha
  I promise I will avoid this next week, let's talk about someone who is missing
  from the party thus far! She is...

      This may not sound important to anyone, but considering I have been with
      Ayana since we were kids really makes this sadder than I would have
      admitted. I thought I was fine, but after having dinner with the family
      and I stood outside the store, I could not take the next step, to her
      surprise. I told her the emptiness I felt on the days in the future
      without her around, and that we cannot do "all those things" together
      anymore.

      She grabbed my hand with an adorable smile on her face. Our hearts skipped
      a beat. We held hands swinging as we took a stroll (the long way) back to
      her place, and I take my leave on the night train once more. Next time
      though, it will not be the same.

  So, my relationship with Ayachi. <span class="emoji" title="ü§≠">*giggles*</span> Period accurate, by the way, this
  was half a year before she got married to Kaji Yuki. <span class="emoji" title="üòÜ">*laughs*</span> I personally
  actually fancy this one but not this, because apart from being relatives means
  I can ALREADY be in a relationship with them even if it's a step cousin
  relationship for this isn't lol this is actual cousin, which also means I have
  many more layers of this relationship stuff BECAUSE I just changed families
  and we can effectively talk about 3 families worth of cousins? I don't know if
  this makes sense to you though haha. I mean, just because my dad/mom changed
  their partner means I can't be in contact with my relatives from the previous
  marriage. <span class="emoji" title="üòê">*silence*</span> Let's not say that is so haha I also don't comprehend half
  of this either. I just know this is the way to do, to flirt with a married
  woman because I can-
