  No no no I meant Anime selections for the season because everyone is watching
  like, "Frieren" and being normal and I'm thinking whether I should even drop
  "Under Ninja" after coming this far. It's an adequate end to the flashback
  arc, right? And then I don't give a damn about the worldview? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  We have a lot of shows to deal with this week so let's hop on to them and not
  think of the lack of new songs for the week, yes? Also yesterday because
  f**king- ("see yesterday's post for details" lol)

<div>
  Oh yeah girls, Shizuka-chan is weird alright. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
  where we can take a break from getting new girls once again hehe
  (#Hyakkano04), I guess breaking the fourth wall just because this is the
  fourth episode is not surprising anymore huh, dear author. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah
  refer to Episode 3 too for details, but blah blah blah we got another girl
  added to the list. Of people he can't reject. Haha you think that's new? Ask
  Rentarou how he feels now, he's probably in heaven. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also in his mind
  is likely how to get the girls together now that we are 4P- Anyways haha, this
  episode. We just hang out on the rooftops for lunch, and as Shizuka introduces
  herself, we then figure out that she also wants some romantic action on the
  guy she likes. So uh... you wanna kiss? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, did they
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/seppun" target="_blank">kiss</a>? Did we
  kiss? That last question I ask myself every day how much I want to kiss any of
  them voice actresses lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, but heck, pretty much every episode is like
  we bring a new girl in and ask if she wants to kiss the guy, very fresh ideas,
  people. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But at least Rentarou did come prepared to help break the ice
  between the girls because in case you didn't realize this is just a series of
  girls getting together and this has practically NOTHING to do with the guy
  because assumptions ahead of all of you, everyone loves the guy and will do
  anything for him. So
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/babanuki" target="_blank">Old Maid</a>.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, we know Rentarou is going to lose this game of Old Maid. We
  just don't know who is going to win. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, predictable jokes are good
  jokes, remember that. Or that he just keeps winning because everyone wants to
  lose. You know, predictable jokes are <em>also</em> good jokes. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Looks
  like though, we are doing both because where is the creativity in only doing
  part of it did you even calculate the permutations and combinations of these
  interactions? I mean tickling, kissing is up next. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, every girl
  took turns to (lol) lose to Rentarou so they got to enjoy some fine tickling I
  swear this is not a porno and it's mostly because Shizuka had to giggle
  silently and let the e-book do the talking so <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> haha but when it came
  to Shizuka doing it to Rentarou (lol), uh... she just poked him? Yeah, rather
  disappointing actually, we need to satisfy the meagre number of female fans
  with the guy's laughter from them tickles. Anime director and scriptwriter
  Inda Karane was most displeased with this behaviour lmao, and Rentarou did the
  smart thing by leaving the premises, leaving them to settle their differences
  between themselves. Then again, in my personal opinion, it's not like Shizuka
  doesn't want excitement out of this relationship, nor is she just not prime
  and third or whatever order is in this case, but more of, as Hakari said, she
  is just like a small animal. Small animals don't go tickling others. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  So yeah, maybe it's Karane not understanding this new girl not being as
  aggressive or passive-aggressive as them lmao, or maybe Shizuka is still real
  scared of... well everything, but it's good to see them talk it out. And yes,
  this will be important going forward, as this is effectively a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/toranputawa-" target="_blank"
    >house of cards</a
  >, we keep stacking them on but we need to keep it going overall so it doesn't
  crumble. If you understand that, you will get the drama when girl number 26
  joins in the fray. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't think we are going that far especially with
  Seto Asami-san voicing the next girl, but we shall see, I don't think if this
  one falls in love with Rentarou she will have much trouble asking for a kiss
  she might just jump on it without asking LMAO I have no idea what character
  type she is though there's gotta be one sadist in this series, right?
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> RIGHT?? Oh Karane. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

<div>
  Bro, you think Shino is interested in asking why the guy didn't kiss her when
  you have TWO girlfriends, dude?? Yes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, complications for
  later let's get back to reality, because in this new episode after the
  fireworks festival where nothing new happened (#KanoKano17), I'm pretty damn
  sure Shino-san wants in after she has seen all that Nagisa has done with her
  boi in the previous episode, I promise you. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Ah, a role to envy
  others, huh. How cruel. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, I guess we continue to talk about
  how everyone is enjoying themselves but only Shino is suffering. I don't know,
  actually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What we do know though, is that their newest trip outdoors
  is not just a coincidence, it's as if everything is staged. You know, like how
  could SakiSaki with her luck win a full set of camping equipment and not think
  of the first season where someone just showered in a tent in front of their
  front porch? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, it's hard connecting the dots, but it isn't hard
  for Shino-san who still believes that everything she has seen so far is just
  so wrong, she might not even have a solution to them all. We will talk about
  how that is going to be stacked up in a bit haha, but perhaps we should be
  talking about why SakiSaki thought feeling up her friend's chest is the best
  way to console her. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And uh... maybe I don't talk about how
  good/awkward it must have felt in the recording studio on the g r o p e scene
  HAHA no really, I should just not just go watch it for yourself. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Ignoring that very thing lol, we are reminded once again that Saki-chan is
  kind of oblivious to Naoya and Nagisa being together instead of Naoya with her
  and that's why Shion volunteered to take the water so Saki can stay with her
  boyfriend, but heck, it's just hard to not be nice and also respect her boy's
  twisted honest opinions, isn't it? Remember guys, Naoya is as green l frank as
  he is also super nice as a person, and those things don't normally go
  together. Look at me as an honest person and ask how many people I offended.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> And that's why I offend Anime characters now SPEAKING OF THAT WE
  HAVE THIS DUMB BITCH MILIKA who just surfaced and explained all her intentions
  not forgetting that she is trying to hook Naoya in somehow, despite having two
  girlfriends. Yeah, Risa-chan, we didn't tell you that? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So uh, and
  this is how we ended up having to hear dear Koga-chan rage at this bunch? I'll
  take it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, there is a difference between a Pokémon attack that
  does no damage or the opponent is resistant to it, Naoya, so stop admitting
  that you are weak to everything women (lmao) and just... uh... sleep well? Uh
  oh, didn't expect that coming alright. So you are telling me Milika-san
  already planned to not just show off them food that isn't drugged to tempt
  them, THEN made food for them that are drugged? Boy, this is rather spicy
  drama right here though. Can't stop the rich from being powerful, amirite
  fellas? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I like how we are doing all the wall stuff in
  references to two walls Milika is looking at AND celebrating the final episode
  of "Attack on Titan" series- Oh, they not hitting on walls in the latter by
  now though.&nbsp; You also need to remember Shion is a genius dealing with a
  bunch of idiots. You can't fix them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, Naoya is just slightly
  smarter than SakiSaki, he knows to doubt Milika-san. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So you see
  Shino-san, Nagisa isn't the problem here. But yeah, this is quite an episode,
  isn't it? They literally flipped it on us on Milika-san's intentions just like
  that G-cup campfire steak. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nice, I'm actually surprised at this plot
  twist, so yeah as expected, we have reached a point of no return it's history
  repeating itself since the kidnap, so let's see who is up to stop her.
  Hopefully Naoya, but who knows, he can barely pitch his tent up-

  [TL:DR; "You fell in love with a two-timer?" Oh yeah she did lmao "He's a
  two-timer! That's bad enough!" That's actually true haha]

<div>
  Oh that's middle school me if you don't mind, when I was somewhat popular and
  was hanging out with the cool guys in class. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Not in contact with
  them now though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just like Kuro in this new episode where I rather be
  a loner wolf (#UnderNinja05), more flashbacks, huh. I guess this is how this
  series runs now, I'll see how it goes. So, story, or flashback, actually. We
  go back to when Kuro-san had to disguise as a transfer student to go into some
  high school, and after dealing with that foreigner, things have been going
  quite differently. For starters, he has to deal with that kid playing with
  drones instead of going to school, his name is Eita, and if he isn't a better
  representation of me getting bullied in school, I don't know what is.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways haha, Kuro has to also deal with Noguchi, who stumbled on
  Kuro's first day at school, where he has to come in to take some tests before
  admitting into school which obviously he isn't good at, so apparently, Shion
  with that teddy bear who popped into his place and gave him the answers
  covertly, disguised as coloured beads pinned to the ground, in the middle of
  the damn classroom. Some ninja he is, because apart from looking like
  colourful bugs which Kuro-san had to try to convince the teacher and Noguchi
  who was taking her supplementary lessons that they are poisonous and to not
  touch the, uh... cheating materials lol, he did end up securing his admission
  by peeing himself and somewhat negotiating with the teacher to get a passing
  grade due to his whatever condition. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> What condition he is in though,
  is probably hero at this point as he tries to juggle his relationships with
  his newly found classmates and deal with whoever Hibi is on the stairs. So to
  recall, Katou and the fat dude (lol) sitting in his van were two different
  ninja teachers, under them are students whom we have seen since Episode 1 and
  they just did a quick recap of that in case you forgot, are likely on odds
  from the start, as we have seen them independently and not cooperatively deal
  with a foreign threat. So I would assume that Kuro-san listening in on the
  students here especially whatever is going on with the school's director with
  telepathic skills <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> and blending in while finding out what is happening
  with competing ninja and their reasons to be here, is probably gathering a lot
  of attention from people who can understand a walking set of pants on the
  rooftop walkways (lol) including I assume the school's management who likely
  sent out some "government officials" to deal with them. Whatever it is, all
  this is still speculation in my opinion, but I think we have a good idea what
  will be happening from here on. Though honestly speaking... How am I enjoying
  the mess of Kuro-san trying to blend in (literally) into this school? *laughs
  like Kuro-san* Kudos to everyone for chipping into this masterpiece I would
  like to call now, though I would say the bullying is too real so if someone
  could give me a full ninja suit to blend in with the surroundings when I was
  15 that'll be swell. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, this is enjoyable to watch every episode
  even though I'm very perplexed about the plot and how it keeps using
  flashbacks so I hope it's useful in the present day plot, we shall see where
  this heads to form our worldview as described in the previous episode. Again,
  if jokes can get me going, you can put the most attractive girl in school and
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kabedon" target="_blank">kabedon</a> her
  with someone who looks like me? I don't even care. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (I actually care
  though can I be the one to do it? Asking for Eita-kun lol)

  In this glorious, <em>glorious</em> final episode of all that started this
  journey more than a decade ago oh boy it sure is we are all a decade older now
  since April 2013 and that makes all of us sad besides Eren lol
  (#AttackOnTitanFinal02), it's been a long time since I've watched a movie LMAO
  so let's take a bit and talk all about how the story ends. Well, how THIS
  story ends, it will never end in this worldview just like in real life. *sees
  credits* That association is too real, so let's keep in context to just this
  one, shall we? To keep this hopefully short haha shout out to future me
  predetermined writing paragraphs long enough to make people leave lmao *taps
  brain*, I will talk about the three main things that happened, because rule of
  three.&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Firstly, we talk about why the tides of The Rumbling have changed. Apart from
  the obvious thing of "invading the titans" <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> which we have done to the
  biggest structure the world as ever seen because skyscrapers aren't invented
  yet lol, the Scouts had to decide where to locate Eren and/or Zeke in order to
  stop them. Armin is technically right: If there's the whole minefield and we
  don't know where each of them are, we just blow all of them up. Process of
  elimination, dude, Armin has the Colossal Titan power. But ironically, instead
  of dealing with them which they are safely hidden even if they aim for the
  front neck(?), they are actually dealing with Ymir herself who has now sided
  with Eren because he gained her trust, on something we will discuss in a bit.
  Well, she is a real problem, because considering she is the Founder, she can
  summon all the historical Titan holders (though not as real as the current
  ones) to fight alongside her, which is as scary as you might imagine. But all
  of them eventually found out, to fight these cusks especially when it reminded
  of the comrades they killed (RIP Berthodt) (did I spell that right?) (dammit
  haha) is a waste of time, since they are all controlled by some weird titan
  form who is leaping around and being a nuisance lol. Pieck (*umph* haha) The
  Cart Titan did manage to lay down the charges to blow down the structure's
  neck (and boy seeing her come back time and time again like a pilot with their
  ejection seat only gets me hornier lmao <span class="emoji" title="🍆💦💦">*fap fap fap*</span>) (sorry if I need
  something to jerk off to here lol), Reiner The Armored Titan did a lot of work
  to keep the defences going and preventing themselves from being dropped into
  the chaos below (Jean too I guess lol), and we did save Armin once again, but
  only after Armin met Zeke in (if you are surprised why are you) the Titan
  world I forgot the name, where he then explained to Zeke the meaning of
  living, essentially. To treasure the moments in life, like what I am doing
  now, to experience our own freedom. It apparently got all of the Titan holders
  in somehow, and together they managed to stop the tide.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
      "I felt that these insignificant moments were incredibly precious." Armin
      could not be more right, why seek larger experiences when just watching
      this Anime matters more lol
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, we talked about the end of this disaster. What actually caused The
    Rumbling, prevented many more deaths form happening but we will talk about
    how far this went later shout out to all the guys on the edge of the cliff
    climbing back up instead of just going into the sea lol, was likely done by
    Ymir's control of the titans but now that they are in control and shocking
    her mind, dealing with her with respect to how she viewed the world since
    the time she was "alive" serving the king and dealing with his relationship
    problems (lmao). But more importantly, we all know that Eren had to be
    stopped. For he knows the past and future, for he knows what is going to
    happen. The prophecy, dude, apparently more mind-bending than you think. I
    think this is where the ambiguities began so let's not touch too much on
    those, but we shall talk about a few things that led to the end of Eren's
    control of this situation. On the brink of death, Falco turned into a winged
    beast which means what was supposed to be him escaping with Gabi and the
    ambassadors on that ship which was destroyed so I guess diplomacy isn't an
    option now they are still alive though, even that was supposed to be their
    last catch. People are still scared of Eldians being used to fight as Titans
    as is what that giant parasite still did in response as it is struggling to
    reunite with Eren to restart this nightmare again, and the options were to
    gauge whether the Attack Titan OR that parasite was to be killed, both
    having survived from that explosion Armin did to transform into the
    Colossal. Yes, this means we have to disappoint Mikasa and you know, make
    sure Eren bites the dust. Thanks to Mikasa FINALLY getting over her feelings
    for Eren and vice versa hehe that's gross <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, and probably because she
    knows to confess to Eren about wanting him to not do all this despite its
    inevitability, I guess this is a decent end to whatever she is doing kissing
    the skull and burying that after all this has ended, even if we are
    disappointing Ymir who has to witness this again lol. Mikasa left alone to
    not disappoint the human population, and the Scouts survived (even Levi by
    the way) to tell the tale. Yeah, the after incident report was that Eren was
    defeated, by Armin. Yup, you didn't see that wrong, and he will be the hero,
    just as Eren expected. Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  <blockquote style="text-align: center;">

  </blockquote>
</div>
<div>
  So lastly, we talk about Eren and his meaning of existence. Gotta say though,
  probably influenced by the dad because why not his dad is also kind of a
  nutcase lmao gottem, but Eren, as he revealed all of this eventuality to Armin
  years ago when they were kids just to erase them, has done much to see if
  there is a resolution to this mess. Turns out, not much, not surprising, but
  also bear in mind that Eren has done much of what Armin would have done if he
  were in his shoes, preventing the Eldians from being recognized as evil, maybe
  even try out the euthanization plan that Zeke suggested, ALL to then find out
  that whatever has been set in stone by... something, which cannot be
  prevented. That's why the ideal of "slave to freedom", where you think you are
  free but you are acting within... someone's expectations, if this makes any
  sense to you. And that's why the only thing he has done, and that's possibly
  the worst thing he had done so far, is to prevent everyone from knowing what
  he did, since as he can access everyone's minds as sort of the Founder, with
  his death now everyone can access his. Which is why I feel like Eren doing all
  those things in their dreams and then wiping them out is like me with people:
  I pretend to talk to myself and then hope that they will get what I mean
  someday. The things is bro, they don't. They will find out someday in this
  case though, so it's still alarming for any number of them to know the
  wholesome truth, regardless how bleak that sounds. As such, we know that this
  final fight is impossible to avoid, Eren would have wiped up to 80% of
  humanity as it stands so RIP to all of them we don't know how many of them
  there are but I think this is record-breaking even in Anime history lol, and
  that as childhood friends they eventually have to face each other to settle
  what Eren really wanted to avoid after all. Did he though? Did he even prevent
  anything? And that's why possibly, that even now as we sit on the boat to go
  back to Paradis to talk to the now Eldians behind those taken down walls, I
  wonder if the Scouts will ever be successful to see themselves through after
  their race has eradicated pretty much everyone else in existence in order to
  stop their kind.

<div>
  All in all, FINALLY we are done haha and looking back at the key visuals for
  all the Anime adaptations shown last night on their official social media
  account including movies which I obviously didn't watch I only watch canon
  (lmao), I feel like we have come a long way. I always say that, but this is my
  furthest dedication to a popular Anime series which started more than a decade
  ago, not until "BLEACH" showed up but this is a league on its own, isn't it? I
  still think the animation for this was done so well I cannot ask for more this
  isn't ufotable anyways <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, the story is basically stemmed from a parasite
  which can live forever which is in retrospect funnier than any Resident Evil
  video game plot lmao, and I've seen shows more questioning of humanity and
  life and death and had sadder endings than this. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I still think this
  is worth the journey, and as much as I'm tired and sad that it's over, it's
  also with great relief I can be done with this but not yet, there is more.
  Because of all the songs you've heard so far, this will mean that&nbsp;<b

  many fans don't understand that tbh. Till then, I think we have well "offered

  again because it hurts, <em>Eren</em>. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  which was for that two-cour Anime and man, was it still hard to try to give
  the title song even thought I've listened to it on her radio show for the past
  few months. And one of the B-sides for another few more months. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Maybe I give the previous song she released in April. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, still
  on the fence on this, Kitagawa-sensei still isn't impressing me at this point,
  that is why I am doubtful of these melodies now. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>

  isn't too bad considering it's a pop tune anyways.

  doing this to show off how many songs they have been in Anime since they

  and boy this is ever what I envisioned but it's full animation which is the
  hype these days without needing artists themselves to appear in them, and for
  less popular songs like non-title songs. Oh heck, I'm not an illustrator
  anyways I have no talent for art. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Shout out to when I was praised my
  people who liked my art, as abstract as they may have been.

  We will OFFICIALLY have nothing on the agenda next week, so don't worry, I got
  more rock festivals I will check those out, unless I'm that bored once again
  and refuse to give more songs, then I will take a break once again which is
  also good time since I get to prepare for some #KN15YEARS stuff I have
  prepared. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Maybe we do that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or maybe we deal with
  <b>the "Attack on Titan" final soundtrack</b> with all the rad songs I heard
  from the final episode earlier today. Yeah, maybe we do that and give them one
  last chance. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> When even is the last time I gave an original song from
  their soundtrack anyways? TEN YEARS AGO?? This is going to be hype, I'm sure.

  Ok thank goodness I offset my frustrations from being outdoors yesterday so I
  can keep this for something else. Uh...

    >I got Ayane again on the latest event gacha in DOAXVV</a
  >, that's rad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But I did promise myself to not roll more if I got her
  and I did (which, welp) so I'll save for the anniversary event in a couple of
  weeks. I am also hating the secretary game I've picked up recently and played
  for what, a month and a half now? Yeah, mainly because their ultra rares based
  on event objectives are impossible(?) to achieve without using gems and I
  screwed it up in an attempt to get the current one so that just makes me sad
  even now, so I'll deal with this until the end of the year to kill my time...
  sometime end of the month when I have to see green again. No, not for my eye
  care, though I guess that works? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's not think too much into that,
  eh? I don't want to be sad after all. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See you guys next week then I
  have enough of this outro now haha, and until next time... how is Kana-chan
  featured in yesterday's Fanfiction post and I <em>still</em> haven't given her
  new single? Wake up, me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also happy birthday, marupi-chan! I'll look
  at your photobook as it reaches my hands next week. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
