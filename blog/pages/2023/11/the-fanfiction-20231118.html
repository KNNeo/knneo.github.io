  What if I told you I LITERALLY JUST FORGOT ABOUT THIS haha but heck, this
  might be better because apart from keeping in the sadness that is the new
  DOAXVV anniversary event where I'm chasing Hitomi as Cinderella out of the
  palace which if you know the girl in the main series that will be impossible I might as well
  break my legs lmao, it's quite timely for this week's theme... if I chose
  <a href="https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg740540.jpg" target="_blank">the right image</a>
  to talk about it at this time of night. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  We are not doing that one though, but we are still on the married women
  special as I would like to call this series for the whole of November if you
  don't mind, we did some rather... indecent things last week already we shall
  not talk about it again hehe, so this week, I'll do like what I normally do as
  a man: Just look at women on the streets and never talk to them because I'm
  not going to talk to women, they gotta approach me. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay okay let's do this quick I feel like I'll hit midnight soon and all this
  will be a mist just like the spell casted on Cinderella-

  <i><blockquote>
      Before I worked at a café near where I lived, I had to be an apprentice at
      a coffee shop a few streets away. I ended up being in charge of everything behind the
      counter, which means I hardly dealt with customers face to face, unlike
      what most baristas would do. Not like any customer caught my attention
      some were even rude to the patron, but as I walked into the café on my
      afternoon shift, I saw a woman sitting by the windowsill, looking into the
      distance. She then turned left to look at me, I'm pretty sure our eyes
      met. Stunned by her beautiful facial features and long brown hair, I
      looked away immediately in which she took a giggle. The barista then
      served her drink as I went behind to change. I did ask around if anyone
      knew about her, and looks like she was new around here. Her allure was
      such a high standard though, people around her ended up calling her
      "Rika-sama". I also found out she was married to a baseball player, which
      is kind of rare.

<div>I wished she was my Cinderella. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, no relationship with Rika-sama whatsoever. Not even close. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well,
  I'm a member of her fanclub if that counts. At least in this case, IRL me is
  having a better time then fictional me, so suck it loser. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
  Anyways, I thought of such a concept for Mikakoshi last week too until I realized the prospect of NOT doing that lol, but for this one I can be conservative, I don't think I know Rika-sama enough, but I think, just like her many fans, that I like her. She presents herself with a bubbly personality which I'm thinking of how to present here but heck, doing the opposite and showing how she is more perfect and unattainable than Amamiya Sora (lol) would be more interesting in my opinion. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I think we are near the end of the month, so at least we can look forward to who is ending this theme. See you then.</div>
