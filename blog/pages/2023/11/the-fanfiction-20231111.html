Okay how wrong can I write my fanfics here? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well anyways...<div><br></div><div>Haha alright maybe this might go too far as to how much I can fantasize this, but heck, this is married women month I will write something that makes zero sense just because romancing them now is a mistake and all this doesn't matter because it's fictional me and I CAN WRITE WHATEVER THE F**K I WANT-</div><div><br></div><div>Oh, happy birthday Komatsu Mikako. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, my love for you is not enough for you to <em>just</em> fall in love with fictional me. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>More off-the-rails stories to match my courage in writing these for fictional me to experience, I guess! I'm doing this earlier so I can go have dinner with my family and not hers-</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Komatsu Mikako in a dark green top, with her hand against her left side jaw, in a café" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=366 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl921455.jpg title="Komatsu Mikako" width=143></div><div><em></em></div><blockquote><div><i>I did not fancy working an office job, so as recommended by career agencies and with a bit of luck, I landed a job at a neighbourhood café as an apprentice barista. The training might be tough, but my perspective changed when I met Komatsu Mikako who lives alone nearby and is a regular of this establishment. We have been acquaintances since then.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>But last weekend, to my surprise, she brought her husband in and delighted the owner about their marriage news. The husband went into the toilet, leaving Mikako sitting at the bar table in front of me. I was starting at her and wiping the cups on my hands the whole time, she hesitated to look at me.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=あんまり見つめちゃ...>"Don't stare at me too much..."</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I put my left hand by the side and leaned in towards her. Our hearts thumped real hard for no reason, fixing our eyes against each other. I then placed the cup of coffee which was on my right hand in front of her. She did not directly look at me for the rest of the session.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>So, my relationship with Mikakoshi is somewhat like friends? Yeah, more or less. It's like some close maybe intimate <strike>childhood friend</strike> acquaintance thing? Yeah, but she's older than fictional me which is same age as me lol, I don't view her as an elder sister (you should have asked my elder sis who is older and she just points at me lmao), and your husband doesn't matter. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Alright this might be borderline doing <a href=https://jisho.org/search/netorare target=_blank>NTR</a> stuff (if you don't understand that don't worry about it) (or just watch Anime "KanoKano" lmao), but no, I'll <em>never</em> go that far. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Maeno-san doesn't know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> </div><div><br></div><div>I'll go take a nap now to forget about all this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Love you, Mikako. *<a href=https://jisho.org/search/chuu target=_blank>chu</a>*</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I feel like I also cornered myself on my career prospects because damn I still want to write more stories with Rieri after <a href="https://x.com/taka8rie/status/1722948877916291259?s=20" target=_blank>she just re-opened her fanclub</a> and made me so high just seeing her new photos. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Yes, I signed up again already, thanks for asking. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
