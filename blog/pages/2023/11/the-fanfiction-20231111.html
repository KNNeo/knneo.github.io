Okay how wrong can I write my fanfics here? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Well anyways...
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Haha alright maybe this might go too far as to how much I can fantasize this,
  but heck, this is married women month I will write something that makes zero
  sense just because romancing them now is a mistake and all this doesn't matter
  because it's fictional me and I CAN WRITE WHATEVER THE F**K I WANT-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Oh, happy birthday Komatsu Mikako. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, my love for you is not
  enough for you to <em>just</em> fall in love with fictional me. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  More off-the-rails stories to match my courage in writing these for fictional
  me to experience, I guess! I'm doing this earlier so I can go have dinner with
  my family and not hers-

      agencies and a little bit of luck, I landed a job at a neighbourhood café
      as an apprentice barista. The training was tough, but my perspective
      changed when I knew Komatsu Mikako lives alone nearby and is a regular of
      this establishment. We have been acquaintances since then.</i

      toilet, leaving Komatsu-san sitting at the bar table in front of me. I was
      grinning and wiping the cups on my hands the whole time, she hesitated to
      look at me while touching her face.</i

  So, my relationship with Mikakoshi is somewhat like friends? Yeah, more or
  less. It's like some close intimate
  <strike>childhood friend</strike> acquaintance thing? But yeah, but she's
  older than fictional me, I don't view her as an elder sister (you should have
  asked my elder sis who is older and she just points at me lmao), and your
  husband doesn't matter. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Alright this might be borderline doing
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/netorare" target="_blank">NTR</a> stuff (if
  you don't understand that don't worry about it) (or just watch Anime
  "KanoKano" lmao), but not, I'll <em>never</em> go that far. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Maeno-san
  doesn't know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I'll go take a nap now to forget about all this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Love you, Mikako.

  P.S. I feel like I also cornered myself on my career prospects because damn I
  still want to write more stories with Rieri after

    >she just re-opened her fanclub</a

  and made me so high just seeing her new photos. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Yes, I signed up again
  already, thanks for asking. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
