Yeah, so screw you "Alternative Girls", the honour for longes playing goes to "DOAXVV" now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Games aside though, I wish I have more time to optimize this blog (and GitHub) so hopefully I have spent more time over this week to do it. You know, programming stuff that people expect to be paid but I just like to do it just because. Also content, as you will see below the amount of effort I would go to do dumb shit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, girls just never got to see me working this hard, they just don't know.</div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of women lmao, we will get more of them below in each of the Anime I watch AND the music I listened to this week so let's talk about them! Thanks Sambomaster for balancing this up by the way, as little as their contribution was haha ah hey</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Hyakkano06><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na Hyakunin no Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Why did Hakari have to suggest a pool out of nowhere?" Well Karane would you have preferred a love hotel? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yes haha</div></blockquote><div>Man, you know how much bad it has done me to wait a damn week AND know that the damn official not Twitter account keeps spamming me on GIFs and clips I can't even?? I wanted Karane's one to be a surprise too... haha in this new episode where if the intro isn't obvious enough (#Hyakkano06), yeah yeah it's not like we want to see them in swimsuits or anything so blah blah pool episode. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh come on, we knew this was coming. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In the transition episode between introducing new girls, this time around since we all have played Old Maid already lmao I guess not Nano-chan, Hakari suggested they all go on a date... at a pool. Didn't know Hakari was the series director here haha perfect timing anyways, that doesn't mean everyone is prepared for it. I mean, Rentarou doesn't have to prepare he just wears a speedo and ogles at his girls. Haha normally he'll ogle at other girls but he has too many. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We start off strong by showing TWO RACKS haha I haven't even witnessed one IRL though, but yeah, that's it, right, we're done? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah I know Shizuka is offended because she thought this was another day at the school's pool lol it's still so cute that I have to call the FBI on me haha ah, and Karane is offended just because. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Rentarou is probably right on saying that the girl is just not winning the competition, but hey, not like Shizuka was worried about that, she is only worried about her legs not touching the floor on the lazy river and drifting off without anyone holding on to her floatie. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, we each have our strengths and weaknesses, and of course in this one we will still explore more of them from the girls. You know, like Nano-chan literally letting Rentarou grab her melons (lol) (not porno btw) and so did Hakari and yeah I gotta say the winner is the latter lmao Nano-chan please don't gouge my eyes out, these are already some things that will get any guy going and I don't even mean those strangers at the pool because damn did Rentarou lose more blood than ever but not as close as Ikuto did in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou target=_blank>"Nagasarete Airantou"</a> for like, half an episode. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, he's not that strong he did faint because I probably will do, and it's funny for that expected drama bit where none of them can do the CPR thing because you know, what is airflow if mouth-to-mouth is the selling point? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But alright fun time is over, because damn look at who is the MVP this episode. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> It's not Rentarou who decided to save his girls in trouble as he was lying down there after losing all the blood from them boobies lmao, it's not Shizuka who put her voice out at such a specifically high frequency only bats can hear and I didn't know Rentarou wasn't human lol, not surprisingly, it's Karane. And boy did that feed my desires so much (thanks to voice behind Tomita Miyu-chan you have been of great help hehe) on this damn <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsundere target=_blank>tsundere</a> because damn, holding on to rack is stressful and I don't like little girls and even though they say being average is an issue, Goldilocks still had the best porridge. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> All in all though, great episode once again I feel like they are doing the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> themes a <em>little</em> too much (especially with the hugging on Karane hehe) but that is to say I haven't watched <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/53040/Kanojo_mo_Kanojo_Season_2 target=_blank>"KanoKano"</a> this week yet lmao so we can't be too sure, but the violence is on point I guess. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, I like such romance Anime with all the damn jokes and stuff it never gets old, I feel like the series definitely made it worthwhile before just dumping you on the fact that none of the girls will be interested in you because we only have one male character and it's Aijou Rentarou. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Hey if there be a chance I can take one girl away from him, don't bother asking who- Hakari. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCOb2D6Q67pLnUE0b96JB0nO7lItf7uZPH3jCwTm3S4jwjdDKhlMvrO32GJzHk2T5ZgIV5r44pjdWdGpNXwFo4NFso2wzOI82-PslB9HrEl4Qtj3grdqq1vjliP9BJ8pejd4tI_HIxdBlhroJayr-wr8PPeEnyVL5eelsqxc76TtodAMbsUZc6TYtev1Y/s320/hyakkano06_rentarou1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me after watching this episode lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6_PbUexWOOUMamrH-FPCswDAjNDZS7pbcYKMWyo8b0-x2KrFw2g6CY7D42C9sh_2aUMKcD7LwI0J9iPbpuS4co2jy0_VIcWT8I3Vgj3wLERNuEu09ca0QHQmzNnd17miUg-qPa3OOOrpu3NxCES5x8J_GoJ2ByUlvjnSeqqwIAAouMbCHhnWHZaiaSEw/s320/hyakkano06_girls1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Which type do you like?<br>I don't know but DEFINITELY not the middle one lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgr1qqse0wA6oV6DCqNhBAOK2mWj7gy_F8Yvql5rxL_Kbfy6D7O8TnBJR7T-iF_54zM7nINn0VUvv_jTfb-dlHDgTuuSLyyG5bS36PH7I2ulgx5gaxQc1f7MLpQmbka11E1ZYMcnp845gbWJAsZVLJr4WqIfx67hUG_BXxD8WVUXm9mhMbEWuhAbWj84zs/s320/hyakkano06_touch.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Not a porno, by the way</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM7vx-Egtzqed3bAd1CcRJev575ir4m81V1b24ek_2JR-y9-T2HfU_DT2tkmPjxdvukbTpm6MA74auct7A8URI2YimXfLAvYo5ts-ryzh2rj7bid3_QgG0L1hj-fxnCEQa4BiyAbWncj0tcIUdgSFa3WZqPw55tFjmh_y1bmItn8V_bj1gxceYU6aPa8Y/s1600/hyakkano06_slapping1.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Sometimes I wonder if anyone did this to my ancestor such that I look like who I am today<br>(lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Oh, Naoya did. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, it's his land now with all the damn women at his place so he wins, I guess. Haha in this new episode where I was promised fanservice <em>especially</em> of a certain woman who claims she doesn't like the guy <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (#KanoKano19), I am seeing a pattern around here as Milika-san forces herself into their lives effectively bending all the damn rules on the planet. Because you see, just because Naoya is okay with everything she does to him or around him, doesn't mean all the girls in the house will be. Bro, for this, you might need to consult on their opinions too. Shion included. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> For this time around though, we start with sleeping. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, as one might expect, the others are already having an opinion about this. But ironically, Naoya did not say no to Milika wanting to sleep with her new boi. Conversely though, Saki-chan decided to set a rule on this, that they also get to do the same thing too, which actually makes sense now that I think about it on this whole stayover thing. Basically, the girls don't have to say no to whatever Milika-san wants to do with Naoya, besides the limits of course. All Naoya needs to do is to do the same for the others. Shion included. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (I know right, when has she joined in the party-) This is like the newbies in your company protesting about incentives and all of us benefit. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Yeah we just went from Shikai to Bankai to Limit Release in Karakura Town- No one will get this <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach target=_blank>"BLEACH"</a> joke. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on lol I'm sorry about these analogies, of course every single one of them had to have a try at doing this with Naoya every night. Shion included. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Shion first, actually. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Order is important apparently, as I really thought Shion was horny (lmao) but she was wearing... you can watch it for yourself haha, as instructed by Saki-chan her friend, to seduce her boyfriend? This can only work in this Anime. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Remember, the fringes on Shion-san is the top half of a heart. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> I nosebleed as much as Rentarou did but with just the one flat chick <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> but nonetheless, Naoya wasn't faltered in the least. Maybe also a good reminder he has seen her just, full on n*ked for like, twice. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, we testing how far we can go right? <strike>Before it's too late</strike> And then it's too late?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Naoya is going to bang Milika-san FOR SURE. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She was worried about getting laid too quick though lol we have 5 months dude and she's pure so that will never happen to say the least, is ironically wanting more of his verbal affections than... you know, whatever that &lt;insert insult from Milika to Shion here> did to Naoya the night before. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, thank goodness that was a real bummer, because apart from all this nonsense doing a number to Naoya's physical and mental health (though the latter is probably an improvement lol), it got even better and/or worse depending on your perspective, when Nagisa ensured her potluck (by winning Saki-chan) and made sure Naoya slept. Just slept though, no kinky stuff or anything like this. Because she knew he wasn't sleeping well (I mean, duh) (Haha), so she had to do the nurse's role (literally) by taking care of him for once. Hey, ain't anyone giving him a rest day I know Milika-san won't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And Saki-chan just uh... gave him magazines of flat chicks? Yeah, gotta take lessons before we do all the stuff people do while sleeping with each other. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Don't have to scrimp on those though. Paddings, I mean. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all this is as much of a mess as every other episode in this second season, I don't understand how Naoya can be so calm so far up till now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, looks like we are picking swimsuits for a (they cannot not have) promised beach (or pool) episode of sorts which will lead us to the scene we saw in the opening theme maybe, so I'll look forward to that. Hey, what can I say, I'm not into rack. Haha who am I lying to I'm just not into huge racks Nagisa-chan would do enough for me-</div><div>[TL:DR; "Let's <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha target=_blank>flirt around</a> a lot so that Milika-san doesn't get more than you two!"

Okay, it's not just some old hag if she was an ex-instructor in a ninja school, but this sure is suspicious. Let's trace our tracks to see if I got this right. Woman was killed by a ninja, specifically one in a full suit, so can't be Kuro-san or Suzuki or that weird old man with a invisible top built-in. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ironically, this one might be Saruta which the kids know of, because he managed to speak to a cat in whatever cat language Nekohira is speaking to, both now we finally knew of their identities as they met Suzuki on the streets obviously waiting for a showdown to happen. Saruta here is a killer by day and by night, you know. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways haha ugh, dumb girl appears in front of their confrontation, and boy did that invisible guy take her hostage. Bro, we can't k i l l k i d s here. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Just covering my tracks, like a ninja. Anyways haha the girl gets to live another day, but only after both sides acknowledged each other who literally graduated from the same school and yes including the cat which if you recall has been brain transplanted into an animal which HAS been confirmed by Katou the deliveryman in disguise who ACTUALLY confirmed this tech working on human to human now. Hey, I thought <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/88729/Kenzou_Momoi target=_blank>that boss in "Servant x Service"</a> as a stuffed animal was creepy, but this kid beside Sasama... uh... Married, by the way. Had a kid, by the way. Not with that brain though. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah there are weird truths every turn, so I shall tread slowly and think of what else I missed. Hmm... is there then reason to believe that (1) as Sasama said Katou and the others are actually working against... world order or that (2) Sasama has been manipulated to listen to the orders from higher-ups which may or may not include the UN? Because as I think about it from Saruta flashback, he likely went to UN to do a lot more assassination missions but came back to kill someone in Japan which might be a threat in itself? Yeah so technically speaking we are made to believe that Katou and the others are not the baddies! But then Kumogakure family though we have one on this side and one in that Rainbow squad on the other side... Maybe Kuro-san was a traitor? Then how can he manage to get a newer disguise vest from his family? And the satellite? ARGH the layers of analysis here haha I can't even. All in all... dammit I thought there will be a plot twist here at the end. You know, someone gets slit just like the intro? Well, maybe it's too much for one episode, huh, people dying. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways, I'm still <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hyper-ep/1708528255?l=en-US" target=_blank>"hyper"</a> <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> for some reason, even if the animation isn't great and the action scenes aren't going to win against even... what's the worse action series out there this year? Oh, this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, I am still very invested in the lore despite its secrecy it's ninja anyways we don't even know the truth at all, but if I had to take a guess, someone that is not Katou is working independently unknown to the current cast now. "Under Ninja", remember? See you then, or not, Suzuki and Onikobe dear beautiful ladies, don't die or whatever we still need someone to dunk on that editor lol </div><div>[TL:DR; "The enemy's a male... and what is with that cat?"

Not going to give more chances though, I may have to put their style aside from here on, sadly. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/love-peace-masterpeace/1708146582?l=en-US" target=_blank>Sambomaster's new album</a></b> isn't any better since I thought I will have a better impression after listening in to the album trailer but eh, I only managed to give the only 2 new songs in it kind of begrudgingly, to be frank. Oh well, where's the creativity I've heard all these years, huh. Moving on, and of course as expected <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A9%E3%83%80/1710327088?l=en-US" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new album</a></b> just tore through the list of candidates here despite me not giving it a serious listen on Day 1, still did impress me with songs which lyrics aren't written by the singer herself lol gottem, are really trying to get me with pop styles and even familiar melodies just because. Oh well, it has been 15 years already we can't have things getting <em>too</em> new. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Speaking of too new, I ended up giving <b>TWO YUKI-san songs</b> <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%95%B7%E3%81%84%E5%A4%A2-single/1536308672?l=en-US" target=_blank>one of them from a rock festival live</a> which I think I will elaborate on them more when I have to review <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%95%B7%E3%81%84%E5%A4%A2-single/1536308672?l=en-US" target=_blank>THREE</a> <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A5%BD%E3%81%8D%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AA%E3%82%93%E3%81%A0%E3%82%8D%E3%81%86-%E6%B6%99-%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8A%E3%81%AE%E3%83%A1%E3%83%88%E3%83%AD-single/1536272699?l=en-US" target=_blank>DIFFERENT</a> <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E8%AA%B0%E3%81%A7%E3%82%82%E3%83%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC-single/1536311416?l=en-US" target=_blank>SINGLES</a> to end the year because I also missed one of them when listening to one of her best album years ago. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I know right, what is this year in Klassic Note Review even hehe</div><div><br></div><div>Damn, am I not done with songs this week and I have to deal with more new songs slated for the rest of the year? I thought we are done already. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Maybe I'll skip those cover reveals those really don't bring much value and I want to write lesser lol. Also not talking about <a href="https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1724019277605519704?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new song preview</a> because yeah, just listen to the album I gave that song anyways haha. <b><a href="https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1724352300641313251?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's new music video</a></b> though for her EP is actually interesting, but damn, do listen to the song for yourself, it's just I need to listen to this on the next full moon now. <b><a href="https://x.com/miyustaff/status/1724442066216972546?s=20" target=_blank>Tomita Miyu's new song</a></b> for her birthday and solo artist 5th anniversary was alright, I would say sounds like but not as good as her debut single song, so we'll put that aside for now until her new album next year. Oh <b><a href="https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1724623254294245732?s=20" target=_blank>SID's Anime tribute album revealed tracks from "Kuroshitsuji"</a></b> sung by the voice of Sebastian dear Ono Daisuke (Ono-D, they call him), and <a href="https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1724985641480712512?s=20" target=_blank>other people I don't know</a> lol but <a href="https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1725015843719827629?s=20" target=_blank>I do know the song</a> so we shall see how many else I know leading to the actual release early next month. <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1724698758787584129?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</a></b> for their single next month for Anime is uh... interesting to say the least, why make the video this epic I have no idea. The song isn't though, rather disappointed actually. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Will still listen when it comes out though, they are Collection Artist level in Klassic Note already. <b><a href="https://x.com/The_FirstTake/status/1724774254787375283?s=20" target=_blank>Kishidan is finally on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> that YouTube series (run by Sony Music Japan lol) which got popular during the pandemic *ack* and they sang their most popular song which I won't say got me interested in Japanese music but I did meme this as a kid dancing to it so yeah I guess so. It's as epic as it can get seeing it 20 years later though, brings a tear to my eye. We get to hear a bit of <b><a href="https://x.com/Scenarioart/status/1724745308305801548?s=20" target=_blank>Scenarioart's new song through a live clip</a></b> but I don't think that's much to go by but hey, new songs coming soon maybe? They shadow dropped one recently so why not? <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1725453736670056915?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new music video will air next week</a></b> which was from their latest single and boy this should have been done months ago to make an impression but hey I've already done a review on it so this can only get better in my opinion. Last but not least I think this still matters, <b><a href="https://x.com/doax_vv_staff/status/1725821717195661723?s=20" target=_blank>a new DOAXVV soundtrack will release in two weeks</a></b> including new songs for the 6th anniversary for a game that will never end <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> so yay, I like the style they are going on for her though I will never put this in my music library, but heck, I'll take a listen.
