<div>Wow, the end (of the year) is nigh, huh. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  This is quite a week to be frank, because besides almost forgetting to do the
  fanfiction thing, yesterday also marks the 6th year I've played what, a
  free-to-play game? Yeah, so screw you "Alternative Girls", the honour for
  longes playing goes to "DOAXVV" now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Games aside though, I wish I have more time to optimize this blog (and GitHub)
  so hopefully I have spent more time over this week to do it. You know,
  programming stuff that people expect to be paid but I just like to do it just
  because. Also content, as you will see below the amount of effort I would go
  to do dumb shit. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, girls just never got to see me working
  this hard, they just don't know.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Speaking of women lmao, we will get more of them below in each of the Anime I
  watch AND the music I listened to this week so let's talk about them! Thanks
  Sambomaster for balancing this up by the way, as little as their contribution
  was haha ah hey

    you have preferred a love hotel? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yes haha
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  Man, you know how much bad it has done me to wait a damn week AND know that
  the damn official not Twitter account keeps spamming me on GIFs and clips I
  can't even?? I wanted Karane's one to be a surprise too... haha in this new
  episode where if the intro isn't obvious enough (#Hyakkano06), yeah yeah it's
  not like we want to see them in swimsuits or anything so blah blah pool
  episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh come on, we knew this was coming. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In the
  transition episode between introducing new girls, this time around since we
  all have played Old Maid already lmao I guess not Nano-chan, Hakari suggested
  they all go on a date... at a pool. Didn't know Hakari was the series director
  here haha perfect timing anyways, that doesn't mean everyone is prepared for
  it. I mean, Rentarou doesn't have to prepare he just wears a speedo and ogles
  at his girls. Haha normally he'll ogle at other girls but he has too many.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We start off strong by showing TWO RACKS haha I haven't even
  witnessed one IRL though, but yeah, that's it, right, we're done? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Yeah I know Shizuka is offended because she thought this was another day at
  the school's pool lol it's still so cute that I have to call the FBI on me
  haha ah, and Karane is offended just because. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Rentarou is probably
  right on saying that the girl is just not winning the competition, but hey,
  not like Shizuka was worried about that, she is only worried about her legs
  not touching the floor on the lazy river and drifting off without anyone
  holding on to her floatie. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, we each have our strengths and
  weaknesses, and of course in this one we will still explore more of them from
  the girls. You know, like Nano-chan literally letting Rentarou grab her melons
  (lol) (not porno btw) and so did Hakari and yeah I gotta say the winner is the
  latter lmao Nano-chan please don't gouge my eyes out, these are already some
  things that will get any guy going and I don't even mean those strangers at
  the pool because damn did Rentarou lose more blood than ever but not as close
  as Ikuto did in
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou"
    target="_blank"
    >"Nagasarete Airantou"</a
  >
  for like, half an episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still, he's not that strong he did faint
  because I probably will do, and it's funny for that expected drama bit where
  none of them can do the CPR thing because you know, what is airflow if
  mouth-to-mouth is the selling point? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But alright fun time is over,
  because damn look at who is the MVP this episode. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> It's not Rentarou
  who decided to save his girls in trouble as he was lying down there after
  losing all the blood from them boobies lmao, it's not Shizuka who put her
  voice out at such a specifically high frequency only bats can hear and I
  didn't know Rentarou wasn't human lol, not surprisingly, it's Karane. And boy
  did that feed my desires so much (thanks to voice behind Tomita Miyu-chan you
  have been of great help hehe) on this damn
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a>
  because damn, holding on to rack is stressful and I don't like little girls
  and even though they say being average is an issue, Goldilocks still had the
  best porridge. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> All in all though, great episode once again I feel like
  they are doing the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> themes a
  <em>little</em> too much (especially with the hugging on Karane hehe) but that
  is to say I haven't watched
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/53040/Kanojo_mo_Kanojo_Season_2"
    target="_blank"
    >"KanoKano"</a
  >
  this week yet lmao so we can't be too sure, but the violence is on point I
  guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, I like such romance Anime with all the damn jokes and
  stuff it never gets old, I feel like the series definitely made it worthwhile
  before just dumping you on the fact that none of the girls will be interested
  in you because we only have one male character and it's Aijou Rentarou.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey if there be a chance I can take one girl away from him, don't
  bother asking who- Hakari. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  Alright, who brought in the storm into our land? Oh, Naoya did. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well,
  it's his land now with all the damn women at his place so he wins, I guess.
  Haha in this new episode where I was promised fanservice <em>especially</em> of
  a certain woman who claims she doesn't like the guy <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> (#KanoKano19), I am
  seeing a pattern around here as Milika-san forces herself into their lives
  effectively bending all the damn rules on the planet. Because you see, just
  because Naoya is okay with everything she does to him or around him, doesn't
  mean all the girls in the house will be. Bro, for this, you might need to
  consult on their opinions too. Shion included. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For this time around
  though, we start with sleeping. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, as one might expect, the others
  are already having an opinion about this. But ironically, Naoya did not say no
  to Milika wanting to sleep with her new boi. Conversely though, Saki-chan
  decided to set a rule on this, that they also get to do the same thing too,
  which actually makes sense now that I think about it on this whole stayover
  thing. Basically, the girls don't have to say no to whatever Milika-san wants
  to do with Naoya, besides the limits of course. All Naoya needs to do is to do
  the same for the others. Shion included. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> (I know right, when has she
  joined in the party-) This is like the newbies in your company protesting
  about incentives and all of us benefit. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Yeah we just went from Shikai
  to Bankai to Limit Release in Karakura Town- No one will get this
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach" target="_blank"
    >"BLEACH"</a
  >
  joke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on lol I'm sorry about these analogies, of course every
  single one of them had to have a try at doing this with Naoya every night.
  Shion included. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Shion first, actually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Order is important
  apparently, as I really thought Shion was horny (lmao) but she was wearing...
  you can watch it for yourself haha, as instructed by Saki-chan her friend, to
  seduce her boyfriend? This can only work in this Anime. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Remember, the
  fringes on Shion-san is the top half of a heart. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> I nosebleed as much as
  Rentarou did but with just the one flat chick <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> but nonetheless, Naoya
  wasn't faltered in the least. Maybe also a good reminder he has seen her just,
  full on n*ked for like, twice. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;Yeah, we testing how far we can
  go right?
  <strike>Before it's too late</strike> And then it's too late?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Naoya
  is going to bang Milika-san FOR SURE. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She was worried about getting
  laid too quick though lol we have 5 months dude and she's pure so that will
  never happen to say the least, is ironically wanting more of his verbal
  affections than... you know, whatever that &lt;insert insult from Milika to
  Shion here&gt; did to Naoya the night before. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, thank goodness
  that was a real bummer, because apart from all this nonsense doing a number to
  Naoya's physical and mental health (though the latter is probably an
  improvement lol), it got even better and/or worse depending on your
  perspective, when Nagisa ensured her potluck (by winning Saki-chan) and made
  sure Naoya slept. Just slept though, no kinky stuff or anything like this.
  Because she knew he wasn't sleeping well (I mean, duh) (Haha), so she had to
  do the nurse's role (literally) by taking care of him for once. Hey, ain't
  anyone giving him a rest day I know Milika-san won't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And Saki-chan
  just uh... gave him magazines of flat chicks? Yeah, gotta take lessons before
  we do all the stuff people do while sleeping with each other. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't
  have to scrimp on those though. Paddings, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all this is
  as much of a mess as every other episode in this second season, I don't
  understand how Naoya can be so calm so far up till now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, looks
  like we are picking swimsuits for a (they cannot not have) promised beach (or
  pool) episode of sorts which will lead us to the scene we saw in the opening
  theme maybe, so I'll look forward to that. Hey, what can I say, I'm not into
  rack. Haha who am I lying to I'm just not into huge racks Nagisa-chan would do
  enough for me-
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "Let's
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha" target="_blank">flirt around</a> a
  lot so that Milika-san doesn't get more than you two!" This episode in a
  nutshell I can't even haha]

  Alright, we start with an action scene, this series has evolved. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In
  this new episode where the opening theme song still slaps and there's still
  plot twists at every convenience (store) lol (#UnderNinja07), well looks like
  we are starting this with some old hag dead. Okay, it's not just some old hag
  if she was an ex-instructor in a ninja school, but this sure is suspicious.
  Let's trace our tracks to see if I got this right. Woman was killed by a
  ninja, specifically one in a full suit, so can't be Kuro-san or Suzuki or that
  weird old man with a invisible top built-in. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically, this one
  might be Saruta which the kids know of, because he managed to speak to a cat
  in whatever cat language Nekohira is speaking to, both now we finally knew of
  their identities as they met Suzuki on the streets obviously waiting for a
  showdown to happen. Saruta here is a killer by day and by night, you know.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways haha ugh, dumb girl appears in front of their confrontation,
  and boy did that invisible guy take her hostage. Bro, we can't k i l l k i d s
  here. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Just covering my tracks, like a ninja. Anyways haha the girl
  gets to live another day, but only after both sides acknowledged each other
  who literally graduated from the same school and yes including the cat which
  if you recall has been brain transplanted into an animal which HAS been
  confirmed by Katou the deliveryman in disguise who ACTUALLY confirmed this
  tech working on human to human now. Hey, I thought
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/88729/Kenzou_Momoi" target="_blank"
    >that boss in "Servant x Service"</a
  >&nbsp;as a stuffed animal was creepy, but this kid beside Sasama... uh...
  Married, by the way. Had a kid, by the way. Not with that brain though.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah there are weird truths every turn, so I shall tread slowly and
  think of what else I missed. Hmm...&nbsp;is there then reason to believe that
  (1) as Sasama said Katou and the others are actually working against... world
  order or that (2) Sasama has been manipulated to listen to the orders from
  higher-ups which may or may not include the UN? Because as I think about it
  from Saruta flashback, he likely went to UN to do a lot more assassination
  missions but came back to kill someone in Japan which might be a threat in
  itself? Yeah so technically speaking we are made to believe that Katou and the
  others are not the baddies! But then Kumogakure family though we have one on
  this side and one in that Rainbow squad on the other side... Maybe Kuro-san
  was a traitor? Then how can he manage to get a newer disguise vest from his
  family? And the satellite? ARGH the layers of analysis here haha I can't even.
  All in all... dammit I thought there will be a plot twist here at the end. You
  know, someone gets slit just like the intro? Well, maybe it's too much for one
  episode, huh, people dying. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways, I'm still&nbsp;<a

  <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> for some reason, even if the animation isn't great and the action
  scenes aren't going to win against even... what's the worse action series out
  there this year? Oh, this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, I am still very invested in the
  lore despite its secrecy it's ninja anyways we don't even know the truth at
  all, but if I had to take a guess, someone that is not Katou is working
  independently unknown to the current cast now. "Under Ninja", remember? See
  you then, or not, Suzuki and Onikobe dear beautiful ladies, don't die or
  whatever we still need someone to dunk on that editor lol&nbsp;

  is not bad and I've said for quite a while she is the only long time
  Collection Artist in Klassic Note that holds up, singing love songs and still
  making pop tunes that I like, I'm not doing a review but it's good alright.

  did startle me with first impression new songs in the release, so it's already

  put their style aside from here on, sadly.

  isn't any better since I thought I will have a better impression after
  listening in to the album trailer but eh, I only managed to give the only 2
  new songs in it kind of begrudgingly, to be frank. Oh well, where's the
  creativity I've heard all these years, huh. Moving on, and of course as
  expected

  just tore through the list of candidates here despite me not giving it a
  serious listen on Day 1, still did impress me with songs which lyrics aren't
  written by the singer herself lol gottem, are really trying to get me with pop
  styles and even familiar melodies just because. Oh well, it has been 15 years
  already we can't have things getting <em>too</em> new. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Speaking of too
  new, I ended up giving <b>TWO YUKI-san songs</b>

  for their single next month for Anime is uh... interesting to say the least,
  why make the video this epic I have no idea. The song isn't though, rather
  disappointed actually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Will still listen when it comes out though,

  that YouTube series (run by Sony Music Japan lol) which got popular during the
  pandemic *ack* and they sang their most popular song which I won't say got me
  interested in Japanese music but I did meme this as a kid dancing to it so
  yeah I guess so. It's as epic as it can get seeing it 20 years later though,
  brings a tear to my eye. We get to hear a bit of

  including new songs for the 6th anniversary for a game that will never end
  <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> so yay, I like the style they are going on for her though I will never
  put this in my music library, but heck, I'll take a listen. I just hope it
  doesn't ruin my Apple Music Replay like last year because region lock so you
  can only hear it in Japan... if you listen on Spotify or YouTube Music you
  dumb idiots. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

  So next week, unless I'm giving <b>ClariS new single</b> a listen while at the
  same time giving the middle finger to the title song's "broken" verses (lol
  they have been disappointing this year anyways), I will have the week off,
  maybe start to think of the Song Awards for the year already or think of
  Kodama Hikari the week after LMAO can we not

  I guess we are announcing new Anime sequels by the week now haha this time

  and boy am I happy to see more of this original series despite it being dumb
  in plot, it's actually great to see a predictable eventuality (unlike in real
  life) where you can just scam the rich for money. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'm not rich, by
  the way, just so you know, I only use free web hosting. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you guys
  next week then I'm ending this on time unlike other Sundays just because I
  need to sleep for the anxiety I'm going to experience early morning tomorrow
  <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>, so until next time... hopefully it'll be better. It <em>will</em> be
  better next week's phone wallpapers are all Moeshi I already bought her radio
