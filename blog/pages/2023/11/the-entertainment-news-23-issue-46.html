  Well, long weekend, might as well enjoy Sunday first before I sleep for the
  whole of Monday haha I won't life is short I can't just sleep and feel tired
  all day <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

<div>
  Hey, welcome back, hope you are not deterred by my new story about the one and
  only <strike>Mommy</strike>&nbsp;Mikako (lmao) because damn, I should stop
  writing stories like these. I know right? Just write stuff like dating the
  TrySail girls or hanging out with Rieri, that's more fun. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Speaking
  of which, Rieri as my desktop wallpaper is <span class="emoji" title="😚">*chef's kiss*</span>, I had a great dinner
  yesterday and lunch earlier on, so I'm ready for more Anime and music...?
  Trust me I tried, music isn't sticking onto me at this time of year. Also next
  week is going to be a blast so I might as well take a break for that.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So many things happening next week though, but let's wrap up this week with
  more stuff I would like to talk to others but no one cares so I'm here! Been
  doing that for so long already, it seems.

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "I'm one rank above you at 87th, okay??" Little does Karane-chan know that
    she is the closest to Rentarou in grades so she wins <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  Man, imagine your exam results put on display in school. You can just be
  rejected by your crush all because she saw how bad your grades were. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span>
  Anyways, Rentarou might not be the smartest guy out there but in this new
  episode (#Hyakkano05) I'm pretty sure we know who is the smartest. It's the
  author- It's our new girl and soulmate for our boi! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> She's called
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/jinkouchinou" target="_blank">Eiai</a>-san
  and boy did it take me way too long to figure out that word pun (if you don't
  get it so far just ask ChatGPT, they'll help) (haha), but to figure this girl
  out won't take you any time at all. See, she is all about efficiency, so this
  is what we call a "machine". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't want to query on her backstory
  because damn she sounds like she is locked up with a mom who told her to take
  over her identity by 16 lol that's an Anime "F ni Naru" reference don't look
  too hard into that Eiai-san I don't think you watch Anime anyways <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
  GOTTEM, it looks like our new girl here is less than interested in being
  distracted for anything in her life right now besides studying. I mean, she
  won't confess to us, right? We can just leave her as is? Yeah, one less
  girlfriend to introduce to the others, she also won't die since she didn't
  confess in the first place? Let's just, uh... leave her alone, eh? Haha not if
  we let Rentarou talk to this poor girl. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But even in the biology
  class where they had to look into a microscope and she rather just fill in the
  assignment and be done with it, still did not understand why waste time in
  class to not do what the teacher expects you, to gain your own experience of
  the subject. Heck, then what is she going to do for the rest of the period? Do
  homework? Well, lick Rentarou's finger I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, this is
  more efficient than going to the doctor's office to get a band-aid? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  So wait, we just had to optimize her actions for sensual interactions- Yeah so
  she HAS to lay down on all fours? I might have to put in as much effort as
  Rentarou for this one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just as Eiai-san here did to memorize the
  digits of Pi I guess if you don't know what that is let's just say it's an
  never-ending number (of a supposed math constant determining the whole of
  trigonometry) still in calculation of its decimal points today, but turns out,
  she has not forgotten what godly thing she did to a finger from some guy in
  class that day. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Not a porno, by the way) And then she what,
  realized&nbsp;that even if she recites the value of Pi until the latest number
  that has been discovered or even if she finds it out herself lol that is not
  that easy by the way... Rentarou will still occupy some place in her brain.
  So, just as any sensible woman will do (that is MOST DEFINITELY not how this
  works no one likes me) (lol <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>) is to then give up on being distracted by a
  man's affections and just, you know, confess to him.&nbsp;And get him to
  reject you. The perfect plan. Sadly, Eiai-san here doesn't have prior
  knowledge that this guy can NOT reject you, so yeah, instead of going head to
  head on a girl who doesn't feel the meaning of life, he instead chose to help
  her understand that feeling, with a trip to the amusement park. It took me
  until the ferris wheel to realize what is up apart from all the meaningless
  dialogue all this while (lmao gottem again), that, the easiest way to expose
  this robot as a human (haha) is to find her weakness. And apparently it's
  heights. And if holding her hand calms her down, then all is well- Oh, a kiss
  is needed too? Sure, why not my girls had their fill. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all...
  I'm not as great of a man as Rentarou would EVER. Is this what will happen if
  you confessed and got rejected a hundred times? Not in the age and position to
  do that anymore but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If that's how the world works now, I'm glad if
  anyone, yes I mean even you, me, would remind ourselves of what it means to
  have meaning in life. I'm just surprised it took Nano-chan <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> here this
  long to figure out. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Next up though haha even the narrator is more
  excited than me second being Hakari, we have a pool episode at this time of
  year though, so I'm pretty sure summer hasn't ended just yet. Stick with me,
  will ya? Oh, you rather stick by Rentarou's side? Understandable haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I came here today to put an end to this love" YO NANO-CHAN this love
  will NEVER end according to the Lord himself did you even see Rentarou's girl
  no.26? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

<div>
  Sorry about this but I'm still VERY SURPRISED why Milika-san can keep Naoya
  for this long and NOT just jack him off and put in him her- IN THIS NEW
  EPISODE OF THIS MESS OF A SERIES lol (#KanoKano18), I'll just call in the cops
  to report a kidnapping first, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> More like, in this new episode
  where rich people can do whatever the f**k they want haha is this not a better
  reflection of reality in any way possible, and I've got lots to say about that
  (haha) so let's get to it! I'll try to keep it short but no promises there,
  just like how firstly, Milika can never promise Naoya she won't give up on
  trying to get him to fall in love with her. Well, both sides have their
  reasons, we know Naoya sure is bent on ensuring that no one else comes in
  between the only TWO girls he is in a relationship right now we cannot
  complicate things any further at this point lol can we not though? But heck,
  Milika-san is also just as tryhard as anyone else in this series. Even
  compared to Naoya. Even compared to Nagisa-chan as we have seen in the first
  season. Not Saki-chan though, she's just enjoying her life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah,
  instead of just, if we&nbsp;<em>kill</em> her (don't cancel me thanks, just an
  if) and that'll be the end of it lmao I am seriously joking about this part,
  or just beat her up to her senses even if she goes as far to show off her
  respectable body (hehe), maybe we let her do whatever she wants. Besides well,
  admitting that she is in a relationship with Naoya. Now wait a minute before
  you go as crazy as Saki-chan as they go back after Milika's mini birthday
  party in the middle of the night lol, this apparently has conditions. I don't
  know why that will make her give up because cue 5 months later when she still
  doesn't haha, but maybe then we can let her give up after rejecting her one
  last time. Says Naoya. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The lack of confidence is admirable you are
  already not making men respect you so why not sink in further haha gottem, but
  seriously though, I can't think of a better solution. It's more like because
  Milika-san here doesn't accept a rejection, and we just, be friends and do
  friend things somehow, since all those can be done anyways without being in a
  relationship. A satellite one, I would think. Yeah, isn't it though? The
  literal difference between what everyone is doing with Naoya now (including
  Shion lmao don't say it's not) and what Milika-san is trying to achieve, is
  just that this girl doesn't want to be rejected. *looks at Anime "Hyakkano"*
  Then yeah, we can just don't, with time you'll just accept the rejection
  yourself. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't know if that's how it works seeing the latest
  volume of the original manga itself but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> heck sure, I'll buy it. I
  can't think of a better solution that doesn't require law enforcement and/or
  the girls being at risk so uh... we'll take this status quo as of now, I still
  think Naoya may have made this more than possible considering now, EVERYONE is
  living at his place. Okay maybe not Risa-chan we need her to tell the parents
  later too about her sister. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh wait, technically the father knows
  right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... should've let your dad wipe your MeTube channel.
  Not like you can't call in to recover it anyways, why did Naoya even bother.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So Milika-san is just being annoying, now where have I seen that
  before... <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And yeah Naoya even, he's the only one coming up with real
  solutions to everything that's screwed up about his life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really,
  try asking the Israeli government to come up with something better. You can't.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways haha world politics joke right there, but considering that
  everyone has lessons to learn from each other even to Shino-san too by the
  way, it really looks like this series can go anywhere but away from the
  firstly established status quo. Which is the two-timing thing, in case you
  forgot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not going to be as excited seeing Shino-san take the place of
  Milika-san though (lmao get it) but heck, might as well see them through.
  Through... whatever she is wearing below...? Haha damn this Anime keeps on
  giving I can't even

  [Okay I got more opinions about this series in general, and that's why I feel
  that what they promoted about this story at the start was about right, the
  idea of fresh ideas of a romance series. They challenged societal norms of
  two-timing and I would pretty much not encourage that even in an open
  Westernized culture lol, they have satellite relationships now, and we have
  that one
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a> we
  put her far away from the girls just to watch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that's why I'm
  glad watching this, I'm just happy I'm here for the journey because of the
  voice actress cast in the first place. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Alright less talk more girls]

<div>
  Yeah watch as the bullies just punch Kuro-san up in his cardboard box
  disguise. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where Eita comes to the rescue to save
  himself from the bullies (#UnderNinja06) haha what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Alright, we have
  quite a trip here to talk about and how are we only halfway through this
  series I don't know, but heck, let this be the next action series I'm invested
  in, and I'll tell you why. Firstly, the bullying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay not that, we
  know Eita can't fight for sh*t but this is a good idea to not show face, I
  guess. Not like Kuro-san hid himself at any point, I would assume he just
  strolled into this while trying to find Eita to ask about the school
  director's location, so he might as well help this guy out anyways. It still
  hurts defending from a punch though, I speak from experience. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving
  on haha, is when Kuro-san actually confronted the school director in the
  boiler room for some reason, when we saw him last time he basically threw a
  middle finger in front of them, then revealed he is some swordsman who will
  take the ninja down, only to realize who he is dealing with. Not just new
  tech, nor is it the new accessories Kuro-san would have gotten in the van with
  Katou-san like that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shuriken" target="_blank">shiruken</a> or
  that AI-powered motorbike lol might as well just trash that already we don't
  have female ninja in this organization <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, but more importantly, that
  Escape satellite permission Kuro-san got from the higher-ups, whoever they
  are. What it physically is though now we know, it's literally just a beam
  which is powerful enough to stop opponents at their tracks, is very precise
  (because apparently it's not super precise as Katou has mentioned) at hitting
  their targets, and is not used by normal means. Which also means according to
  Hibi, that Kuro-san is really someone with authority and not to be messed
  around, which might bring him some trouble out of this incident itself, which
  also brings us to the next thing about checking his living conditions. We know
  that cat is going to play a part in the unpredictability of the happenings so
  far not gonna lie here since, as you have seen the backstory, we have weird
  brain transplant sh*t going on here too so that's kinda cringe actually, but
  also, a ninja has been dispatched to check Kuro-san's living quarters,
  revealing various defences in his furniture and nice neighbours to stay with,
  it drops your guard against them. Whether this means to reveal Kuro-san's
  stand in this abode says a lot of things, but I can still assume Kuro-san
  works for Katou-san here, right? Just that his Kumogakure family is a lot
  more... mysterious and powerful than one would expect? Yeah, we'll keep it at
  that first, we gotta beat up people at a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yanki-" target="_blank">yankee</a> high
  school next, if the school's name isn't obvious enough. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all...
  well I would still say this is quite an Anime I've seen so far just this year
  alone. Maybe I should not drop this one after all, lest Kuro-san send
  Lightning Hibi to strike me down instead of an actual satellite. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> MVP
  is the cat haha as long as they don't talk about their dark history <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span>, and
  I can't wait for the reveal on that female ninja who scoured Kuro-san's place.
  What, we will never get to see what she looks like? Pity haha guess we have to
  live with Yamada-san and her... I don't know what you call that in English,
  "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hanatsumami" target="_blank">nose poop</a
  >"? Hey I can't say that, me, this is a family series. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> We shall see why
  Suzuki is being attacked next week then, interesting story so far in my
  opinion.

<div>
  Well considering this is getting a sequel just being a spin-off and the main
  is getting a second season at some point, I don't feel like watching this now
  but heck, this mini-series (#HanakoKunHoukago01) is only barely compiled to a
  full length episode so why not, right? In the number of short stories meant to
  pay tribute to our Lord and Saviour that is the Mokke haha alright me, we have
  a lot of them short stories of the world around this series about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/youkai" target="_blank">apparitions</a> and
  everything in between, long before "Kyokou Suiri" had a chance to showcase
  itself. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Some of them are great, some are alright or just lame haha,
  but they all have the same purpose: To remind you of everything about this
  series, great or bad. It talked about main girl and now not human Yashiro Nene
  being cursed and Hanako here is barely keeping her alive, is just enjoying the
  fest of this girl coming to his living quarters in the school ie. the girls
  toilet (lmao) to clean up every day after school. We are also reminded of the
  Minamoto family and their exorcist powers meant to deal with things like
  Hanako but I promise you, we can't get rid of the main guy in the series not
  even you Teru-senpai haha, so Hanako will live to see another day for now.
  Yeah, wait till we prep Tiara-chan here when we get her into this high school
  in a decade's time, THEN we will strike. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Speaking of striking, I
  don't think this Mokke tribute mini-series (lol) is doing them any more
  favours besides making them dumber, as they go through interviews to audition
  as a new Seventh Wonder (considering some of them are dead as of now *OOF*),
  only care about candy, and LOVE to brainwash people out of habit haha, I don't
  think there is anything redeeming about them besides being a great mascot.
  Mascots, I'm sorry don't kill me with your heat. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Actually, kill me
  with your heat drop by my office desk anytime I could use some warmth while
  working in the North Pole. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> On the bad guy's side though, I'm sure you
  would remember Tsukasa ie. Hanako's evil twin along with some other idiot I
  forgot his name trying to be friends with Mitsuba, and Sakura-chan easily the
  best girl as I recall pitting her against Yashiro in the thighs department
  and, uh... you tell me who won because someone definitely lost. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> There's
  also the Halloween special though I'm sure at airtime it's already a few days
  behind lol, but heck why not right?
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/babubabu" target="_blank">Babu</a> Nene-chan
  is cute. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (I didn't spell that wrongly by the way haha) All in all...
  alright, they have essentially captured what I liked about this series that
  isn't just the stories about the Wonders or screwed up is the drama in it.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways haha this is only half the spin-off series we are already
  promised another set... exactly a year from now lol, so meanwhile I will chill
  with

    target="_blank"
    >the theme song</a
  >
  in this hehe what a surprise Akarin is singing another Anime song (I know the
  lyrics are "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/taihen" target="_blank">bad</a>"
  but repeating it makes it "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/hentai"
    target="_blank"
    >erotic</a
  >" lmao my brain just can't), and maybe not look forward too much to season
  two whenever it arrives. Remember, my impression of this series is still a
  mixed bag a couple of years ago. I'm just interested in why they decide to
  keep this one up.

  just because it's cute and Kitou Akari singing theme songs again so what else
  is new haha, but also been waiting to finish watching the mini-series to give
  this a month later. Sorry, Akarin! I have my principles and I refuse to
  violate them. I can violate you if you want-

  and I assume the final one before the album is one of the few she didn't write
  lyrics for, and it's as cool as you can imagine. And with this I've listened
  to most of the songs beforehand so let's hope your album next week will be
  good, my dear.

  singles back in June. Not as much as

  for her new song for a commercial which I totally wasn't following so it took
  me a while to know it exists (I do follow her on Facebook if that counts), but
  these somehow did not get me despite their specialty on songs with a more
  emotional touch.

  for their upcoming album next month is alright, I can feel the beats it's not
  bad, so let's hope they keep this up, they have been so far with me walking
  back on their music library and the single months ago, and I want my first
  album review from them to be at least memorable.

  which is releasing on her birthday next week sounds dope, I might just give it
  by then, reminds me real well for her debut song 5 years ago when I had to
  give it for Anime "Houkago Saikoro Club" opening song. Ah yes let me talk
  about this:

  and sang a couple of their songs for the Gibson YouTube channel and of course
  I much prefer miwa-san but heck, both songs are great why not take a listen,
  they both got their feels right.

  somehow haha don't ask me why, in promotion of their new album releasing next

  and I almost missed the release window haha, isn't bad but damn, is the area
  between this Rock band and voacalist solo brand Cwondo being too close, I
  actually hate it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Please don't do this next time again, guys. Moving
  on, I might listen to FINLANDS only member and vocalist

  So next week, we have a slew of releases specifically albums which I think I
  already know the outcome of, so I'll do some big head predictions right now
  haha.

      >GLIM SPANKY's new album</a

  will not be much of an indicator as I kind of lost interest in them past few
  years since they failed to deliver a solid melody and/or beat for their retro
  style not even for
  <a
    href="https://x.com/glimspanky/status/1722223890729181207?s=20"
    target="_blank"
    >their title song music video</a

      target="_blank"
      >Sambomaster's new album</a
    ></b

  likely case too, I hope it's not it has been a long time coming, and I hope to
  listen to something better, but
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgF8eC3tl9A" target="_blank"
    >the album preview</a
  >
  is really putting my hopes too high I would think.
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A9%E3%83%80/1710327088?l=en-US"
      target="_blank"
      >Natsukawa Shiina's new album</a
    ></b
  >
  will likely be the winner here as I listen to more variety of songs than the
  above mentioned styles, so likely with the previews this will make this
  release more impressionable.

  though might just trash all of these if their seasonal flavours are hit right
  as what they have done earlier this year. So yeah, maybe imouto for the win,
  just saying. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  week is going to be short and sweet, and I might take tomorrow to you know,
  clean up stuff here and there or even do up Klassic Note stuff huh. I better,
  actually, we don't have much time to determine the winners. See you guys next
  week then, and until next time, I think I have some stuff to buy up next
  including a next year calendar candidate <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> so look forward to that at the
  least. Yeah I don't think people are here for this they just want to see the
  insides of photobooks so they don't have to buy them and can still jack off-
