I know right? Just write stuff like dating the TrySail girls or hanging out with Rieri, that's more fun. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Speaking of which, Rieri as my desktop wallpaper is <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span>, I had a great dinner yesterday and lunch earlier on, so I'm ready for more Anime and music...? Trust me I tried, music isn't sticking onto me at this time of year. Also next week is going to be a blast so I might as well take a break for that.</div><div><br></div><div>So many things happening next week though, but let's wrap up this week with more stuff I would like to talk to others but no one cares so I'm here! Been doing that for so long already, it seems.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Hyakkano05><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na Hyakunin no Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I'm one rank above you at 87th, okay??" Little does Karane-chan know that she is the closest to Rentarou in grades so she wins <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Man, imagine your exam results put on display in school. You can just be rejected by your crush all because she saw how bad your grades were. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Anyways, Rentarou might not be the smartest guy out there but in this new episode (#Hyakkano05) I'm pretty sure we know who is the smartest. It's the author- It's our new girl and soulmate for our boi! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> She's called <a href=https://jisho.org/search/jinkouchinou target=_blank>Eiai</a>-san and boy did it take me way too long to figure out that word pun (if you don't get it so far just ask ChatGPT, they'll help) (haha), but to figure this girl out won't take you any time at all. See, she is all about efficiency, so this is what we call a "machine". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't want to query on her backstory because damn she sounds like she is locked up with a mom who told her to take over her identity by 16 lol that's an Anime "F ni Naru" reference don't look too hard into that Eiai-san I don't think you watch Anime anyways <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> GOTTEM, it looks like our new girl here is less than interested in being distracted for anything in her life right now besides studying. I mean, she won't confess to us, right? We can just leave her as is? Yeah, one less girlfriend to introduce to the others, she also won't die since she didn't confess in the first place? Let's just, uh... leave her alone, eh? Haha not if we let Rentarou talk to this poor girl. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But even in the biology class where they had to look into a microscope and she rather just fill in the assignment and be done with it, still did not understand why waste time in class to not do what the teacher expects you, to gain your own experience of the subject. Heck, then what is she going to do for the rest of the period? Do homework? Well, lick Rentarou's finger I guess. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, this is more efficient than going to the doctor's office to get a band-aid? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So wait, we just had to optimize her actions for sensual interactions- Yeah so she HAS to lay down on all fours? I might have to put in as much effort as Rentarou for this one. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Just as Eiai-san here did to memorize the digits of Pi I guess if you don't know what that is let's just say it's an never-ending number (of a supposed math constant determining the whole of trigonometry) still in calculation of its decimal points today, but turns out, she has not forgotten what godly thing she did to a finger from some guy in class that day. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Not a porno, by the way) And then she what, realized that even if she recites the value of Pi until the latest number that has been discovered or even if she finds it out herself lol that is not that easy by the way... Rentarou will still occupy some place in her brain. So, just as any sensible woman will do (that is MOST DEFINITELY not how this works no one likes me) (lol <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>) is to then give up on being distracted by a man's affections and just, you know, confess to him. And get him to reject you. The perfect plan. Sadly, Eiai-san here doesn't have prior knowledge that this guy can NOT reject you, so yeah, instead of going head to head on a girl who doesn't feel the meaning of life, he instead chose to help her understand that feeling, with a trip to the amusement park. It took me until the ferris wheel to realize what is up apart from all the meaningless dialogue all this while (lmao gottem again), that, the easiest way to expose this robot as a human (haha) is to find her weakness. And apparently it's heights. And if holding her hand calms her down, then all is well- Oh, a kiss is needed too? Sure, why not my girls had their fill. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... I'm not as great of a man as Rentarou would EVER. Is this what will happen if you confessed and got rejected a hundred times? Not in the age and position to do that anymore but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> If that's how the world works now, I'm glad if anyone, yes I mean even you, me, would remind ourselves of what it means to have meaning in life. I'm just surprised it took Nano-chan <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> here this long to figure out. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Next up though haha even the narrator is more excited than me second being Hakari, we have a pool episode at this time of year though, so I'm pretty sure summer hasn't ended just yet. Stick with me, will ya? Oh, you rather stick by Rentarou's side? Understandable haha</div><div>[TL:DR; "I came here today to put an end to this love" YO NANO-CHAN this love will NEVER end according to the Lord himself did you even see Rentarou's girl no.26? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4ESTvuw4Zb_BKHmtfOmLr8l61lMMYz8ZGk81p0siYJcutL4iLnRhdp9F-zax1fq7h_y11sPT1r_MIApOQH2tXXwbxjevo2ZHd51x-MsJ5R-SZ87Nd_v-PClJNV3RvgXf0Vd0-DqYTIDYFYRdy05C1VHNOR57NzrAC1jVgrfBX6eQiYMpTW17wXr5vF_U/s1600/hyakkano05_patting.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is me dealing with all the voice actress social media posts btw<br>(Hehe pls Naganawa Maria you need personal social)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjA0FOv7CzaY-QON5cA7SEGHgzlj0SYKC-1IyWYViozCJYXs29izb91hatpMteHXGgOweXfjrnnlbS09IlHcxiTBxIgE-TlJpHxskXjNaWJSMvkUl7InBWhD-6KzxXcXcTCzE8y3BRYVS4fkQA7l_mFYr_VjjoHA6W1Mx9zZ0qAz1jgqP2E7cq5C4oXrpc/s1600/hyakkano05_sucking.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Not a porno btw<br>(Haha)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I'll try to keep it short but no promises there, just like how firstly, Milika can never promise Naoya she won't give up on trying to get him to fall in love with her. Well, both sides have their reasons, we know Naoya sure is bent on ensuring that no one else comes in between the only TWO girls he is in a relationship right now we cannot complicate things any further at this point lol can we not though? But heck, Milika-san is also just as tryhard as anyone else in this series. Even compared to Naoya. Even compared to Nagisa-chan as we have seen in the first season. Not Saki-chan though, she's just enjoying her life. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, instead of just, if we <em>kill</em> her (don't cancel me thanks, just an if) and that'll be the end of it lmao I am seriously joking about this part, or just beat her up to her senses even if she goes as far to show off her respectable body (hehe), maybe we let her do whatever she wants. Besides well, admitting that she is in a relationship with Naoya. Now wait a minute before you go as crazy as Saki-chan as they go back after Milika's mini birthday party in the middle of the night lol, this apparently has conditions. I don't know why that will make her give up because cue 5 months later when she still doesn't haha, but maybe then we can let her give up after rejecting her one last time. Says Naoya. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The lack of confidence is admirable you are already not making men respect you so why not sink in further haha gottem, but seriously though, I can't think of a better solution. It's more like because Milika-san here doesn't accept a rejection, and we just, be friends and do friend things somehow, since all those can be done anyways without being in a relationship. A satellite one, I would think. Yeah, isn't it though? The literal difference between what everyone is doing with Naoya now (including Shion lmao don't say it's not) and what Milika-san is trying to achieve, is just that this girl doesn't want to be rejected. *looks at Anime "Hyakkano"* Then yeah, we can just don't, with time you'll just accept the rejection yourself. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I don't know if that's how it works seeing the latest volume of the original manga itself but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> heck sure, I'll buy it. I can't think of a better solution that doesn't require law enforcement and/or the girls being at risk so uh... we'll take this status quo as of now, I still think Naoya may have made this more than possible considering now, EVERYONE is living at his place. Okay maybe not Risa-chan we need her to tell the parents later too about her sister. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh wait, technically the father knows right? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... should've let your dad wipe your MeTube channel. Not like you can't call in to recover it anyways, why did Naoya even bother. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So Milika-san is just being annoying, now where have I seen that before... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And yeah Naoya even, he's the only one coming up with real solutions to everything that's screwed up about his life. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, try asking the Israeli government to come up with something better. You can't. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways haha world politics joke right there, but considering that everyone has lessons to learn from each other even to Shino-san too by the way, it really looks like this series can go anywhere but away from the firstly established status quo. Which is the two-timing thing, in case you forgot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not going to be as excited seeing Shino-san take the place of Milika-san though (lmao get it) but heck, might as well see them through. Through... whatever she is wearing below...? Haha damn this Anime keeps on giving I can't even</div><div>[TL:DR; "She might be doing stuff to him while he's asleep!"

A cardboard box, <em>bro</em>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Yeah watch as the bullies just punch Kuro-san up in his cardboard box disguise. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where Eita comes to the rescue to save himself from the bullies (#UnderNinja06) haha what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright, we have quite a trip here to talk about and how are we only halfway through this series I don't know, but heck, let this be the next action series I'm invested in, and I'll tell you why. Firstly, the bullying. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay not that, we know Eita can't fight for sh*t but this is a good idea to not show face, I guess. Not like Kuro-san hid himself at any point, I would assume he just strolled into this while trying to find Eita to ask about the school director's location, so he might as well help this guy out anyways. It still hurts defending from a punch though, I speak from experience. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha, is when Kuro-san actually confronted the school director in the boiler room for some reason, when we saw him last time he basically threw a middle finger in front of them, then revealed he is some swordsman who will take the ninja down, only to realize who he is dealing with. Not just new tech, nor is it the new accessories Kuro-san would have gotten in the van with Katou-san like that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shuriken target=_blank>shiruken</a> or that AI-powered motorbike lol might as well just trash that already we don't have female ninja in this organization <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but more importantly, that Escape satellite permission Kuro-san got from the higher-ups, whoever they are. What it physically is though now we know, it's literally just a beam which is powerful enough to stop opponents at their tracks, is very precise (because apparently it's not super precise as Katou has mentioned) at hitting their targets, and is not used by normal means. Which also means according to Hibi, that Kuro-san is really someone with authority and not to be messed around, which might bring him some trouble out of this incident itself, which also brings us to the next thing about checking his living conditions. We know that cat is going to play a part in the unpredictability of the happenings so far not gonna lie here since, as you have seen the backstory, we have weird brain transplant sh*t going on here too so that's kinda cringe actually, but also, a ninja has been dispatched to check Kuro-san's living quarters, revealing various defences in his furniture and nice neighbours to stay with, it drops your guard against them. Whether this means to reveal Kuro-san's stand in this abode says a lot of things, but I can still assume Kuro-san works for Katou-san here, right? Just that his Kumogakure family is a lot more... mysterious and powerful than one would expect? Yeah, we'll keep it at that first, we gotta beat up people at a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yanki- target=_blank>yankee</a> high school next, if the school's name isn't obvious enough. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... well I would still say this is quite an Anime I've seen so far just this year alone. Maybe I should not drop this one after all, lest Kuro-san send Lightning Hibi to strike me down instead of an actual satellite. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> MVP is the cat haha as long as they don't talk about their dark history <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span>, and I can't wait for the reveal on that female ninja who scoured Kuro-san's place. What, we will never get to see what she looks like? Pity haha guess we have to live with Yamada-san and her... I don't know what you call that in English, "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/hanatsumami target=_blank>nose poop</a>"? Hey I can't say that, me, this is a family series. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> We shall see why Suzuki is being attacked next week then, interesting story so far in my opinion.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9iHWUoraNwpWcaRKsiA14c2K_AiUoYLqOO9by6IZ3AR9hqByADOS7OW20mpyMJNrBEYCDBW2HcWUCvUHCefGFkJp2SUXsfDZKvp9mga_lmHQ_1lISO291bJWog9yZ4UC0QJMpowaMMtotIFji14T1euNbQ9RidW4pVJTRlPtwDY1uRk42EMh9u42IHkQ/s320/underninja06_slash.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I want to convince people to watch this, so here you go, cool action scene<br><span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4eBvEoYM7F4Lt9GVfCrG2vhSY-V9XJ0s4WbFHmnyCZ62kH05Mqv4G5iMJMTqdBi06HhMmDcTNyoSxDQFzN98Y2W75vr2H17qIMH4yF9PffKOSR-BtPQJ6vjpTL0NfQ6kw3zM-nKz5GA_KA7b334e-YctW0jKfdXlk3WE9oJrOUx6n3sOT05Pgxjy-d24/s320/underninja06_eita1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I slapped someone for the first time in my life<br>(Haha no joke, it hurts, Newton's 3rd Law at work)<br>(No it was someone's face, not rear-)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

In the number of short stories meant to pay tribute to our Lord and Saviour that is the Mokke haha alright me, we have a lot of them short stories of the world around this series about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/youkai target=_blank>apparitions</a> and everything in between, long before "Kyokou Suiri" had a chance to showcase itself. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Some of them are great, some are alright or just lame haha, but they all have the same purpose: To remind you of everything about this series, great or bad. It talked about main girl and now not human Yashiro Nene being cursed and Hanako here is barely keeping her alive, is just enjoying the fest of this girl coming to his living quarters in the school ie. the girls toilet (lmao) to clean up every day after school. We are also reminded of the Minamoto family and their exorcist powers meant to deal with things like Hanako but I promise you, we can't get rid of the main guy in the series not even you Teru-senpai haha, so Hanako will live to see another day for now. Yeah, wait till we prep Tiara-chan here when we get her into this high school in a decade's time, THEN we will strike. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Speaking of striking, I don't think this Mokke tribute mini-series (lol) is doing them any more favours besides making them dumber, as they go through interviews to audition as a new Seventh Wonder (considering some of them are dead as of now *OOF*), only care about candy, and LOVE to brainwash people out of habit haha, I don't think there is anything redeeming about them besides being a great mascot. Mascots, I'm sorry don't kill me with your heat. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Actually, kill me with your heat drop by my office desk anytime I could use some warmth while working in the North Pole. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> On the bad guy's side though, I'm sure you would remember Tsukasa ie. Hanako's evil twin along with some other idiot I forgot his name trying to be friends with Mitsuba, and Sakura-chan easily the best girl as I recall pitting her against Yashiro in the thighs department and, uh... you tell me who won because someone definitely lost. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> There's also the Halloween special though I'm sure at airtime it's already a few days behind lol, but heck why not right? <a href=https://jisho.org/search/babubabu target=_blank>Babu</a> Nene-chan is cute. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (I didn't spell that wrongly by the way haha) All in all... alright, they have essentially captured what I liked about this series that isn't just the stories about the Wonders or screwed up is the drama in it. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways haha this is only half the spin-off series we are already promised another set... exactly a year from now lol, so meanwhile I will chill with <a href="https://x.com/hanakokun_info/status/1712664705767284908?s=20" target=_blank>the theme song</a> in this hehe what a surprise Akarin is singing another Anime song (I know the lyrics are "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/taihen target=_blank>bad</a>" but repeating it makes it "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/hentai target=_blank>erotic</a>" lmao my brain just can't), and maybe not look forward too much to season two whenever it arrives. Remember, my impression of this series is still a mixed bag a couple of years ago.

This one, I may have other opinions so I might do <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tonarino-metro/1536272699?i=1536272701&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>a little more listening</a> to see if I can do a <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> YUKI single review special <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> to end the year, expect good news next week. I've also given <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%9D%A5%E3%81%84-%E6%BF%83%E3%81%84%E6%81%8B-ep/1708529795?l=en-US" target=_blank>Anime "Houkago Shounen Hanako-kun" theme song</a></b> just because it's cute and Kitou Akari singing theme songs again so what else is new haha, but also been waiting to finish watching the mini-series to give this a month later. Sorry, Akarin! I have my principles and I refuse to violate them. I can violate you if you want-</div><div><br></div><div>Well, more news this week so let's see what is up to wrap up the year, yes? <b><a href="https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1721501433235972153?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new song preview</a></b> and I assume the final one before the album is one of the few she didn't write lyrics for, and it's as cool as you can imagine. And with this I've listened to most of the songs beforehand so let's hope your album next week will be good, my dear. <b><a href="https://x.com/mol_74/status/1721497877204390394?s=20" target=_blank>mol-74's new song on a shadow drop this week</a></b> is emotional, but not enough to get me at first listen, so yeah, next time then. <b><a href="https://x.com/fumika_tweet/status/1721860058143945208?s=20" target=_blank>fumika's new music video</a></b> is for her recent new song and eh it's fine I just didn't feel as much as her singles back in June. Not as much as <b><a href="https://x.com/shion_miyawaki/status/1721353659228061833?s=20" target=_blank>Miyawaki Shion's new music video</a></b> for her new song for a commercial which I totally wasn't following so it took me a while to know it exists (I do follow her on Facebook if that counts), but these somehow did not get me despite their specialty on songs with a more emotional touch. <b><a href="https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1721905690212757907?s=20" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's new song</a></b> for their upcoming album next month is alright, I can feel the beats it's not bad, so let's hope they keep this up, they have been so far with me walking back on their music library and the single months ago, and I want my first album review from them to be at least memorable. <b><a href="https://x.com/miyustaff/status/1722177141595357293?s=20" target=_blank>Tomita Miyu's new song preview</a></b> which is releasing on her birthday next week sounds dope, I might just give it by then, reminds me real well for her debut song 5 years ago when I had to give it for Anime "Houkago Saikoro Club" opening song. Ah yes let me talk about this: <b><a href="https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1723167227787219194?s=20" target=_blank>miwa did a collaboration performance with Australian artist Orianthi</a></b> and sang a couple of their songs for the Gibson YouTube channel and of course I much prefer miwa-san but heck, both songs are great why not take a listen, they both got their feels right. <b><a href="https://x.com/VictorMusic/status/1723264308577173745?s=20" target=_blank>Sambomaster is releasing a figurine set</a></b> somehow haha don't ask me why, in promotion of their new album releasing next week and I thought you guys should know just because. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/no_buses_band/status/1722204120269128142?s=20" target=_blank>No Buses' new song</a></b> and I almost missed the release window haha, isn't bad but damn, is the area between this Rock band and voacalist solo brand Cwondo being too close, I actually hate it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Please don't do this next time again, guys. Moving on, I might listen to FINLANDS only member and vocalist <b><a href="https://x.com/Finlands12/status/1723294746251350298?s=20" target=_blank>Shioiri Fuyuko's solo single</a></b>(?) when it releases next month during a live and for music subscription services since you know, I can use more of her music though not like she has been excelling so far but I do have some leanings on this so, whatever, do what you like. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>So next week, we have a slew of releases specifically albums which I think I already know the outcome of, so I'll do some big head predictions right now haha. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/the-goldmine/1712618445?l=en-US" target=_blank>GLIM SPANKY's new album</a></b> will not be much of an indicator as I kind of lost interest in them past few years since they failed to deliver a solid melody and/or beat for their retro style not even for <a href="https://x.com/glimspanky/status/1722223890729181207?s=20" target=_blank>their title song music video</a>, so I'll see what I can get here. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/love-peace-masterpeace/1708146582?l=en-US" target=_blank>Sambomaster's new album</a></b> likely case too, I hope it's not it has been a long time coming, and I hope to listen to something better, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgF8eC3tl9A" target=_blank>the album preview</a> is really putting my hopes too high I would think. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A9%E3%83%80/1710327088?l=en-US" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new album</a></b> will likely be the winner here as I listen to more variety of songs than the above mentioned styles, so likely with the previews this will make this release more impressionable. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%9C%88%E3%81%AB%E9%A1%98%E3%81%84%E3%82%92-ep/1712607080?l=en-US" target=_blank>miwa's new EP</a></b> though might just trash all of these if their seasonal flavours are hit right as what they have done earlier this year. So yeah, maybe imouto for the win, just saying. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Ah, it's a great Sunday, isn't it? A Sunday with a Monday public holiday us the best. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also great is my desktop wallpaper now haha I know I should stop saying it already, but at this rate prepare for another Takahashi Rie story with fictional me, I tell ya. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I WILL TAKE A <a href=https://jisho.org/search/mendokusai target=_blank>BOTHERSOME</a> WOMAN AS MY WIFE RIERI I DO NOT CARE IF YOU BEHAVE LIKE MY MOM <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next week is going to be short and sweet, and I might take tomorrow to you know, clean up stuff here and there or even do up Klassic Note stuff huh. I better, actually, we don't have much time to determine the winners. See you guys next week then, and until next time, I think I have some stuff to buy up next including a next year calendar candidate <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> so look forward to that at the least. Yeah I don't think people are here for this they just want to see the insides of photobooks so they don't have to buy them and can still jack off-</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
