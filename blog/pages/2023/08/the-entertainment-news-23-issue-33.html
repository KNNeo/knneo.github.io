I promised myself not to talk about someone getting married already if you want
to know see this week's fanfiction lol <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span>, so let's move on and talk about
the long weekend, specifically
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/obon" target="_blank">Japan's long weekend</a>
and more specifically, the weekend of the new Comiket! Uh... I still did not
manage to grab that one chance to get the final illustration book which was on
stock for a bit on Thursday, should've even done it on my phone when I saw it in
the morning only to realize it was too late when the proxy service went to grab
the order as I ordered it at home that evening. Oh well, my last chance(?) might
be after the event if they have leftovers (which I highly doubt so) so maybe
that or else I might as well just cry about it on my review post next month
<span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways! Only positive vibes here, we might as well talk about Kanno Mai's
  birthday livestreams because they decided to stream the events! Okay, they are
  paid even with a subscription I can't afford to pay for them... or can I? Haha
  but yeah, Anime and music first then more of the former though because I did
  not listen to music this week- It's all Ajuju's fault, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I
  PROMISED NOT TO TALK ABOUT THAT haha I still like you girl it's just a little
  bit lesser HAHA<br />

  </blockquote>
  Damn, Shirogane, you into older men? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, in this new episode
  (#TonikawaJK03) where if you did not expect this bunch of high schoolers to
  not like this sensei who had a wife? You need to think again. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well,
  not Shirogane it seems don't you forget she is the class chairperson which
  also kind of means she has the disciplined stereotype... until she saw like,
  two guys fighting along the river and thought the not Kurenai's boyfriend is
  so cool she wants to get f**ked by him or something- We all know that is the
  case with JK. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically, she sent the wrong confession message to
  her new teacher instead of the dude himself which also makes me wonder how did
  you even get his number and yes I meant the latter, and apart from getting his
  wife crazy and yes I meant the former, I guess someone else now knows of her
  little secret and in part she is now asking the teacher for advice? Dude,
  Nasa-kun got it easy, he can't give you any advice. Even his confession spot
  is like, in a scene of a truck accident. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Nonetheless, he did give
  some proper advice apart from Tsukasa's which is like, stalk the heck out of
  him or something leading us to believe that (if you haven't found out)
  Ginga-kun here is being stalked by someone hopefully some JK who wants to
  confess to him lol how can he even think of this, makes it super unbelievable
  for Aya-chan who then intends to join him to see if he is right.. and it looks
  like a date now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Thank goodness Nasa-kun gave some motivation to the
  now depressed Shirogane so she can get on her feet and do the thing. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Nasa-kun dude, I wish you were around to advice me a decade and a half ago.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Actually, I might sitll be able to do it now- What am I even saying.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Too bad though, Ginga-kun can think of such things, but didn't know
  it's right in front of him? Man, I wish I was that thick to not realize stuff
  like this. Thinking back I don't think I have such a thing going on for me so
  lucky you, bro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next up, Tsukasa is now thinking about how Nasa-kun
  is getting all the p*ssy in an all girls' high school? Yeah, motherf**ker's
  getting the j-j-j-jealousy going on hard. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Yeah don't mind on this
  blog's running joke) Well we all know it's dumb, it's all built on trust,
  sadly the wife didn't have much trust on the husband lol but also she did have
  too much free time thinking about it on the bath house counter is the likely
  reason, so she went to see the husband in school. Heck, maybe not getting
  spotted by the students is a good idea after all, since now that at least two
  of them won't keep your secret where you guys are making out in the streets-
  All in all haha, some progression and don't expect it to be on the wife haha
  really no that's not happening anytime soon, but hey, maybe the final episode
  here we will get some of that to conclude this mini-series. So yeah, let's
  find out the lore about this next week- When it airs in another 2 weeks haha I
  can wait I have so many distractions just see the rest of this post.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;

  [TL:DR; "I... really just came here to teach programming, though" I know right
  what are these kids thinking you're a pu** slayer just because you have a wife
  lol]

  </blockquote>
  Please Komura, she only knows her way home, it'll be a miracle if she can walk
  to your place without her glasses. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe we set that as a yes to the
  confession. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we are changing seats already
  (#SukiMega06), I guess we gotta grab every last moment we have with the girl
  we like, yes? Haha yes Komura it's not just you, I can like a middle school
  girl. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey WAIT WAIT NO haha okay we know it's not that, but you
  know, girls &gt; arcades, yes? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oh yeah, she heard about that
  alright. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In an effort to make sure Komura gets to hang out with his
  dudes though lol I don't have friends don't mind me, Mie-san here is really
  trying very hard to see stuff even though she can't even see the kanji on her
  textbook when brought up to her face so what else is new. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Komura
  knew of this all along, he knew maybe going to the post office with her to put
  that letter (for applying for a prize, don't think stamp cards are around
  outside Japan these days but I did get one for eating at a food court lol)
  would be a good idea lest she just misses it altogether and throws it in the
  rubbish bin. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know I sound like I'm making a joke but trust me, that
  has a higher probability than you think. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah Komura saw his girl
  out real good, and in the end they did go put that letter together... just in
  a nearby convenience store they have letterboxes there too, and so Komura also
  gets to go to the arcade with his dudes. So jokes on us, it's both, he can do
  both. But yeah, priorities, I know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In the new school year though,
  and yes this is only a thing in Japan I don't even get sh*t for perfect
  attendance, but to be frank I CANNOT BELIEVE (lol) these two went to school
  every day despite one being blinded because look at the series title and the
  other one being blinded by love <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, still managed to go on stage to get
  her certificate and not like, hold on to something else which will make all
  this even more awkward than her mean eyes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (No, not gonna elaborate-
  The principal's suit seam <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) But of course, this is hardly any scary
  compared to the scariest event of all in this class with same teacher:
  changing of seats! Be reminded of Episode 1 where we started with a change of
  seats but just a year ago, and lucky for Komura-kun he got to sit beside this
  marvel of a girl and I say that because he likes the girl. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Fast
  forward a year later and uh... I think our luck ran out, dude. So yeah Komura
  you asked for it, if it's anyone to take care of her it's either her friends
  or Azuma. And I guess this time around it's Mie-san with the j-j-j-jealousy
  because some girl is sitting beside Komura? Oh hell yeah let's go this is the
  fuel for the rest of the season huh. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay not so quick because in
  the many jokes underlying on this series' success, Mie-san got her seat wrong.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She ended up with Someya-san sitting in front of the class but then
  still suffers from the same problems of wanting to see her guy in class all
  the time (lmao cheeky) and not like a mirror on her desk will help her out
  because see the title again lol, so looks like the new girl who switched into
  this class sitting beside Komura got them back into square one. Nice girl,
  maybe we like this one instead. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, MVP Higuchi (oh hey
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/47669/Saki_Miyashita" target="_blank"
    >dead detective</a
  >&nbsp;Siesta lmao) for setting up this for all of us haha but yeah, this is
  as smooth as it goes, moving up a year in class. But heck, I don't think my
  class change is this smooth. Well, mine in elementary school was like, all the
  way to the last class in one year and jumped back to the first in the next so
  you can tell about my grades. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well at least all of them got what they
  wanted. Higuchi won't be happy with this dude anyways. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Moving on
  though, IS THAT
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu" target="_blank">SKINSHIP</a>???
  Bro, final year in middle school doesn't equal to making out though?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  These previews are the worst lol see you then he finally brought the glasses
  home lmao

  Well, if you haven't been spoiled by the official <strike>Twitter</strike> X
  post about the new couple in town... <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode though
  (#ShinigamiBocchan17) turns out Hugo was right all along!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay if
  you didn't get anything from here on, at least take a hint from our circus'
  resident kid, alright? It's as straightforward as I can put it, and if this
  doesn't count... don't worry technically it does haha, but we have to say that
  in context first, I suppose. So, the circus' first open performance in a
  while. They are all ready to perform, they had a huge audience standing by in
  the town square which attracted a lot of other people we have Zain and Cuff
  and Daleth and Keto and Teto... wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, as from the previous
  episode, Daleth is not going to let Zain's excuse let her down, so as much as
  Zain might be prepared to leave for the witches' world after not telling Cuff
  what happened because she figured it out anyways lol he is such a bad liar,
  the trio of witches decide to ruin the circus... well for the better because
  they aren't killing people anytime soon lol but we know to not make things
  worse considering there are the circus people who are human and the audience
  are at risk, so we better save at least Hugo from being eaten by the magic
  Venus flytrap? Okay hot chick, your magic is kinda brutal for starters.
  Ironically though, not enough for Zain to use his time magic because remember
  we have a resident killer in our hands- Excuse me, resident cursed killer.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, Bocchan showed off his "magic" as if it's part of the circus
  like none other, eroding the creature like there's no tomorrow, and despite
  the attempts to try to stop the girls including distracting Zain with an
  illusion lol that was easy, Cuff almost fell off the roof trying to get to the
  one witch and Zain's time magic had to be used which he had to in a pinch to
  save her. Yeah, Cuff before anything, dude. Not even for the two witches who
  offered him a handy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I meant, just holding hands, I don't mean
  nothing- Zain has no d*ck, we know of that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The couple (lol) also
  took the time to confess to each other out I guess; Zain did it in public at
  an alley before Cuff ran away in embarrassment haha kawaii, and Cuff... well,
  if a kiss is anything of a reply to a confession and I can list out as many
  romance Anime to prove to you that this is it haha... yeah Zain can't leave
  now the seal has been done. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, I think we can all agree
  that the lesson learnt this episode is that no matter how deep your love is
  for boobies, you will still get laid with a pair of them eventually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  (Not true don't cancel me but) I gotta say though this might be a little
  sudden in terms of storytelling, but heck I'll take it though! It has been a
  while since these secondary characters can play around lol what this has gone
  to, and looks like maybe this is as much as a challenge as also a way to show
  their friendship thus far. Cuff loves someone who she can rely on, and Zain
  just loves rack. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Enough jokes, it's sentimental of a feels at the
  least, but more importantly, the lore dude! How Alice knew her mom's not
  dead... yet lol, and how she was lied to as a kid. We shall see where that
  goes though we did not really mention Rob being a whistle-blower at any point,
  so let's see if he will reveal anything about this incident of Sharon's
  disappearance.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "You're finally going to confess to her (Cuff)?" Yeah Hugo that's what
  Zain is going to do lol]

  I mean, do we have to do a meeting in the Detective Agency setting? Haha I
  mean we can do this anywhere maybe in the Ability users prison in Europe too.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where the Agency members get to regroup for now
  (#BungouStrayDogs55), maybe here's the turning point now that the world is in
  chaos and the page cannot be filled no more ie. no more fates can be
  manipulated without real action. HELL YEAH action now where have I heard of
  that before. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, the plan to kickstart potentially the final fight.
  There is a lot to take in here, so let's go through them. Fukuchi intends to
  take the ultimate commander weapon and let's call that instead I just forgot
  the name, and with his Ability of doing anything 100-fold he will make sure he
  can control the world's military ie. the Detective Agency will have no future
  in front of them. To combat against this, Ranpo's current approach (because
  never say never to change) is to deal with the handing over of the weapon to
  Fukuchi apparently happening in 18 other places including the airport where
  the final showdown will be held. Yeah, it's like they all know what is
  happening already, so no surprises there. What will be a surprise will be two
  fold, so let's talk about particle manipulation master Saigiku, or Jouno as
  mentioned by his Captain. I think we all know something felt weird when
  Fukuchi decided to talk to him in person and the moment the door closed in on
  him in the room, his fate was pretty much sealed. Of course he refused to help
  Fukuchi with his plans by betraying him, and this wasn't without reason, for
  starters. As he has the power of feeling things around him (eww gross haha)
  (also hell yeah lol technically he has touched all women) he knew of
  Tachihara's suspicions to Fukuchi long time ago, and cornering him was part of
  the plan, but he didn't know about Akutagawa's participation preventing his
  escape which is probably why Fukuchi was prepared for this or else why would
  he dare to even attempt this, did somewhat succeed in stopping him though
  since he got the vampire bite so I guess it might be over for him RIP Saigiku
  haha not how that works, but also because he knew of this backfire on him, he
  placed a note on nearby Aya-chan who shocked herself with the truth because
  she overheard what she really shouldn't have lol I'll just pretend it's not my
  business tbh, followed them into the room and then found out about everything
  inside the room. So yeah, Saigiku knows she's inside, don't think Fukuchi or
  Bran will though. But as she needs to leave with evidence of this including
  planning for a route of escape which I guess can be done once old man leaves
  the premises, in her infinite wisdom she thought taking a photo with her
  smartphone camera would be the best thing to do. LMAO JAPAN PROBLEMS AMIRITE
  haha oh by the way smartphones sold in Japan are flash enabled by default, I
  think this is still a thing. I would've done a video recording. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So
  oh boy now Aya-chan had to go into hiding. But where though, and how will she
  even get out of this? I guess we will find out soon enough. Though the hint so
  far is- Okay dude, you got me good as much as Fukuchi. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Damn, this is
  great so far. Though sorry for famous detective detection here haha, this will
  do little to help the Detective Agency out, and I will more than believe that
  Aya-chan will likely meet her fate which I hope not, and Saigiku will be able
  to get himself out because he probably can fight Akutagawa and win, I like to
  think that Ranpo might be prepared to deal with as many layers of Fukuchi's
  brain that will come after them mainly because you know, old man and Atsushi
  have seen his power first hand so they probably thought of that too. Whatever
  happens next though? I'll let the story tell itself haha maybe Aya-chan hid
  inside the coffin LOL tell me that is true so I can brag about already knowing
  this magic trick before it's revealed (hehe the best place to hide is the one
  with the highest assumption, and that's assuming she won't get bit lol)

  for a one-night stay haha I can't use the word "stand" to be frank
  (#KanoKari30), because it isn't what you think. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> If you would recall
  we are at the final phase of the shooting for the movie crowdfunded for
  Chizuru herself so that the grandmother gets to see it as a parting gift lol
  hopefully not but we set her ambitions of being an actress high and early, and
  yeah, this is just an opportunity to get a good shot of the stars for this
  apparently solo scene which as I said I don't know the movie so if that will
  be released in cinemas IRL or span two episodes in the future that'll be
  great. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or else, you would be relived that just like me, Chizuru isn't
  scared at all to be frank and I know why, because Mini-chan can only go this
  far into setting this up even with the room allocation. So yeah, maybe putting
  trust on the only guy left in the room is a better idea after all. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Yeah later Kazuya becomes a beast and- Shit happens only at night, dude.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay we should move on, just a reminder that we are here to shoot a
  final scene of the movie, and after some scene checking because they do that
  first instead of stumbling into it at the dead of night, and even then that
  happened real quick since you know, what else you gonna do in the hotel
  between those times? Flirt with each other- Let's move on to the next scene at
  night haha, they finally start the night shooting which I assume they took
  some quick naps just in case Kazuya screws up and we have to do this all
  night. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And literally at the actual run, Chizuru had to stop him as
  she has something to confess? Yeah, she is just gonna thank you for all of
  this as movie producer, that's all. Or yeah, she'll tell you to sleep at the
  corridor later. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And because I write some parts of this review on the
  go haha the video is paused right now AND I'm right, it's the former so
  literal trauma dump about her grandfather passing his legacy to the wife (lol)
  and now we have to make sure it happens or else old man that sounds like
  Mayuri will come haunt us in our dreams. Which is probably true since Chizuru
  did not sleep well that night she must have been scared of sleeping in
  separate <a href="https://jisho.org/search/futon" target="_blank">futon</a>s
  HAHAHAHA okay me get your decency back, and same to Kazuya too even he is
  technically doing this because he likes the girl, isn't it? He's not wrong,
  making this movie is already a dream to him, down to the core. He's definitely
  jerking off to this every day afterwards haha what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What is not a
  dream though, is either if you're into Chizuru in which like her, you would
  have realized you slept on the bus and that's the best for Kazuya, OR if you
  are into Kazuya you would be keen on what Ruka-chan has to offer now that she
  found out what happened within the span of what, 24 hours? Haha yeah told you
  already, all it needs was a phone call to her boi for her to figure this out.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... maybe I truly am scared of influence, unlike what these
  two have done to each other. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But seriously though, Ruka-chan, I'll
  give you my everything, just not the crotch, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Heck, maybe even
  physical intimacy I might be afraid. I think of the little experience I have
  with women (yes including family members I will state for reference only don't
  think too far lol) and think how little I know about... anything actually,
  compared to this one Kinoshita Kazuya. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah, so let's not think too
  deep into it this is a private affair after all including my hopes and dreams
  and me being a wimp lmao, looks like next up we will be compensated in due
  time for all the lack of... well everything
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> with
  <strike>Naobou</strike> Ruka-chan episode!! ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN GUYS haha see
  you then.

  OMG SAKURA-CHAN YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING lol I'm into her what of it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  In this new episode where we are still stuck in exams haha that sucks
  (#HorimiyaPiece07), yeah that next issue is going to be out of stock- What did
  I tell you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, Sakura-chan is into manga. Yes, call her a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/otaku" target="_blank">weeb</a> or whatever
  you just didn't notice I'm also one too lol, but yeah, nothing else (and I
  think many will agree) beats that feeling of chasing the latest chapter every
  week for the next exciting plot twist or whatever, and in this case, I promise
  you they did not copy from that popular ninja series, no. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah,
  when sometimes she drops by her usual bookstore since she knew to avoid
  convenience stores, still managed to be out of stock sometimes and that's just
  sad to any reader, honestly. That's why you gotta have backup or fallback,
  dude. I know this is <em>the</em> bookstore but you gotta at least have 3 more
  backed up. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Not me as a Japanese haha even if I am one I probably
  will just read online. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, she technically did miss it
  because that damn guy who thinks he looks cool Yanagi walked into the store to
  get a copy before our dear girl so how dare you haha, ended up just giving out
  his copy since he can buy from near his place? Also Sakura you're right, he's
  a fellow weeb too and they ended up talking about the characters in the series
  they both follow- Dude, is this not the most awkward conversation you can have
  between weebs? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But of course, seeing how they even talk in school
  and/or go to the bookstore together to grab the latest stuff and being seen as
  a couple lmao Sakura no, they also talked about other stuff, like how they
  wear glasses so maaaaaybe we don't just take this ship at face value.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, we are done with the bullsh*t that is the confession with
  Ishikawa, right? We can use some consolation. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> This second half
  though... let's just say Honoka is just me without the Hori-san fangirling.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Getting bullied, no friends to hang out with, hard to speak up and
  I'm a male for goodness sake... It's all in a day's work for me being in
  school all day, to be frank. Thankfully, for Honoka's case, she has friends in
  third year which I guess she forced herself into thanks to Hori-san if you
  remember she was her No.1 fanclub member lmao, somewhat still ostracized by
  her classmates but ended up not only helping them out in return because she is
  just a nice girl anyways after being what, thrown off her scarf from the
  building to be found out by Miyamura? Dude, I wish I had a chance to shame
  anyone who has bullied me before- MOVING ON haha I'm fine don't worry it has
  been decades ago <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>, and as we can see with how Honoka hangs out with the
  others, it's alright being weird, it's less alright when you aren't being
  nice. And Honoka isn't any of that to be frank we got weirder people in the
  list lol, but you did ride on Sengoku which is envy even to
  <strike>Remi-chan</strike> RemiRemi-chan lmao so I don't know if I should
  continue to bully you or not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, as I see the ending and
  thought of how much money they had put into this season of Anime and how yes

    target="_blank"
    >Yanagi and Sakura are singing the song</a
  >
  for the manga they like... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Damn, this episode is good, way better
  than last week somehow. I thought we are going to be shell bombed with
  bullying stories but at least we got away with that so thank goodness, we
  don't need history repeating itself I regret watching those in "Sangatsu no
  Lion" already. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways moving on, this is great, and interestingly
  next week is about Yanagi instead of what was in this week. Hmm interesting,
  looks like we got more handsome guy stories to cover then hehe

  [TL:DR; No one will truly understand what it means to be weak-willed, and we
  are only showing females being so, by the way. I just hope many can understand
  through this episode what it means to be one of them.]

      better than you

  </blockquote>
  Oh yeah, the layers between the palace and Seireitei, by the way. No one said
  this was easier than going up, so deal with it, Ichigo. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah,
  until Ichigo reaches the ground in this new episode though (#BLEACHTYBW19),
  hey I guess you don't need Urahara-sensei (yes I call him that) to tell you
  that things are looking <em>pretty</em> bad out there, yes? Hey, kudos to Renji
  and Rukia hanging out there, so let's talk about more of what they did,
  specifically of the latter. So yeah, boy this is quite an episode. The most
  beautiful and magnificent episode, female fans would argue. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah
  this is Rukia's fight against her brother's opponent- Hey As Nodt HOW DARE YOU
  TOUCH MY RUKIA haha also the ASMR dude, that's called fear haha you ever
  wanted to let a fat man whisper into your earhole? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I'm sorry
  Yoshitsugu fans don't cancel me) Also, if you think putting the harem master
  (lol) Matsuoka in this to voice the villain of fear was a mistake, I think on
  the contrary (and not because it's ASMR lol) that they picked the right guy.
  From the whispers to the laughs to the screams to even the normal flashback
  scenes of him still being a human in a hospital bed for some reason, it looks
  like he did his job very well: instilling fear into all of us to remind
  ourselves that he isn't just living in all the harem Anime you love. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Jokes aside though, maybe we talk about Rukia's sword now. If you didn't catch
  the name of her sword it's basically "a snow petal", but just like how Rukia
  never learnt of its true form, turns out, it is what it says, just a piece of
  snow in itself. As such, she is a master of manipulating cold temperatures
  only of course the reverse is probably still Yamamoto if he isn't dead RIP
  haha, so freezing anything now only requires her sense of touch, which quickly
  stopped the "fear" thing that is the bulk of As Nodt's power. But I would
  argue at this point it's already just a difference in spiritual power for our
  little Rukia to be able to do so much, so much so we have the recognition of
  our <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onii" target="_blank">onii</a>-sama haha
  shout out to Byakuya, so honestly saying this Quincy didn't have much of a
  chance. Yeah, even if you look at this monstrosity of a V-power (lol) you will
  also be scared. But no fear, Rukia. Your brother has your back because it
  isn't hard to cut off the whatever ball that is encircling you with all the
  damn eyes even he is having deja vu off it haha it's just way more than that
  and it's fear, just considering that we made many assumptions here about their
  training and stuff, it's hard to understand how all this fear thing will not
  work on Rukia. But let's just say bringing up Kaien to her even at this point
  won't make her scared- We did that with Aaroneiro already dude, we can't reuse
  villains. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, moving on, and this dragged on to the ending for
  some reason and thanks for cutting it off lol I didn't like the song tbh, As
  Nodt was defeated with her Bankai, and if you need some explanation, take it
  like liquid nitrogen or instafreeze effects lol this is a rarity even in the
  mangaverse honestly, so with crazy limitations in time and movement of what
  was shown earlier, she just stops the enemy in one hit. Obviously the
  limitation here is range and of course how fast she can do this she still has
  to thaw which is a problem imo, but heck, we have effectively proven how it
  works in battle, so claps all around we don't have to see Byakuya's Bankai in
  this for the I don't know how many times coming. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Now that we got rid
  of fear itself haha it's that easy guys, looks like we might move on to
  Kenpachi's fight uh oh spoiler alert, which I recall is kinda long because it
  starts with Yachiru and Isane. Well, the latter should be fine if I recall but
  not the former so uh yeah, maybe we will see some more action up front. Just
  uh, thaw yourself a bit alright we need to keep this heat goin'!! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "It's because you got cold feet." Ayo! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey As Nodt didn't
  know you are a comedian too haha get it because Rukia]

  [I have to say right and now as I have been, I wonder if Rukia's Bankai can
  hit multiple enemies lol, and I wish that when she thaws off, it will still
  make environmental damage so she is technically immune to attacks until she
  heats up. Or else man, she can't fight alone or against multiple targets per
  se because that will be REAL bad haha more of this marvel though because she
  won in screenshots 1 more than As Nodt]<br />

This week on Klassic Note was quiet mainly because of the shorter work week of
course, but nonetheless I did try to pick my itch of listening to songs so I
went around to take a look. But among the live videos I watched which included
that backlog of rock festival videos where they all did not catch my attention,
I even went as far as listening to
<b
  ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H5MR5p_WgE" target="_blank"
    >never young beach's poorly recorded live video</a
  ></b
>
from last year but heck still ended up listening to more
<b
  ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzZDIR7eb2w" target="_blank"
    >Yogee New Waves' live video</a
  ></b
>
(which will be removed in October FYI) and ended up giving

  target="_blank"
  >their debut song remastered for the album</a

as it's more mellow compared to the original so I liked that version instead. I
also did listen to

    >spira.spica's new song</a

for their 5th anniversary major debut which isn't bad but I don't know why I
took a while to give this song so I'm sorry guys maybe your melodies do suck.
<span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I gave it though, we good.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Okay maybe we can don't talk about news from a specific platform from here on, I
might as well not. So, news of music from the wide Internet. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  ><b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</b></a

is for their new song for some drama you probably never heard of, but heck let's
just hope this song holds up because damn despite my weak impression of it, this
might be good enough to give in a couple of weeks. And that is compared to

which is fine by all means I might be more keen on the B-sides even though
Clara-san looks great in the music video hehe.

I think you know this name better than me, is singing for Anime and it's kinda
mellow so I suppose it's for the drama itself but I'm not that keen after
listening to it so no thanks. Hell yeah

for her new single next week is great- Just don't ask about the song itself I'm
at the pretty sure area of not giving this title song already to be honest.
<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Good that they let her dance though, that bounce is just different.

the last time I heard of Cwondo a couple of months ago which was a flop.

other one was... meh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

which I did give as part of their promotion of their live tour I assume. Rather
obvious because it was posted on their parent parent company (didn't type that
wrong) Sony Music Japan's account haha and yes even

<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See Elon, people will move elsewhere to talk about their music.

So for next week, looks like I will have to decide on

    target="_blank"
    >Asakura Momo's new single</a

and we haven't even heard of the B-side and I already want to say no haha my
wallet you are safe for now, and I'll listen to that band

to start the week I suppose. Man, everything's gonna happen in the end of the
month, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><br />
So, Maimai's birthday event livestreams, eh? I promised myself to never buy
tickets for anything else other than for my birthday *looks at Inorin* haha but
heck, I may not have done it for the earlier
<a

  target="_blank"
  >the night one</a

because there's singing in it! Sponsored by JOYSOUND by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't
worry, I didn't expect her to sing anything from my music library (lol) but she
did sing a ClariS and YUI song, so that's good enough.
<a
  href="https://twitter.com/fogfran666/status/1690690611857530880?s=20"
  target="_blank"
  >She did sing a lot of cute songs</a
>
that should get anyone on a Sunday night so that's probably for the better.
<span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> She did read us a (probably love) letter from her to us which is
enough to make her weep so that was adorable (hey, she won't let her shame go to
make her cry buckets on camera, we know), and she announced a photobook to be
shot in Okinawa (if you <em>still</em> don't know what that place is, just go back
and look at my many
<a
  href="../../2022/05/the-fifteenth-and-sixteenth-book-worth.html"
  
  >photobook reviews</a
>) (or wait a month when I talk about Isobe Karin's haha) which has no release
date yet so unless you tell me it's early next year and/or there is no bikini or
even swimsuit involved... Man, we're not getting it, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you guys
next week then if anyone else is reading this besides me, and until next time...
we got another long week ahead of us so until I get over the idea of perfecting
my future I guess we will go through the weekly life once again! Hey, at least
every week will be different; Next week won't have Ajuju announcing she's
married-
