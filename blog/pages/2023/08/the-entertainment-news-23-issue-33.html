Uh... I still did not manage to grab that one chance to get the final illustration book which was on stock for a bit on Thursday, should've even done it on my phone when I saw it in the morning only to realize it was too late when the proxy service went to grab the order as I ordered it at home that evening. Oh well, my last chance(?) might be after the event if they have leftovers (which I highly doubt so) so maybe that or else I might as well just cry about it on my review post next month <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span><div><br></div><div>Anyways! Only positive vibes here, we might as well talk about Kanno Mai's birthday livestreams because they decided to stream the events! Okay, they are paid even with a subscription I can't afford to pay for them... or can I? Haha but yeah, Anime and music first then more of the former though because I did not listen to music this week- It's all Ajuju's fault, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I PROMISED NOT TO TALK ABOUT THAT haha I still like you girl it's just a little bit lesser HAHA<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TonikawaJK03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Tonikaku Kawaii: Joshikou-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Sometimes, timing can be a nightmare" Yeah like how in every other romance story the guy stumbles upon a naked girl in the bathroom-</div></blockquote>Damn, Shirogane, you into older men? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, in this new episode (#TonikawaJK03) where if you did not expect this bunch of high schoolers to not like this sensei who had a wife? You need to think again. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, not Shirogane it seems don't you forget she is the class chairperson which also kind of means she has the disciplined stereotype... until she saw like, two guys fighting along the river and thought the not Kurenai's boyfriend is so cool she wants to get f**ked by him or something- We all know that is the case with JK. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ironically, she sent the wrong confession message to her new teacher instead of the dude himself which also makes me wonder how did you even get his number and yes I meant the latter, and apart from getting his wife crazy and yes I meant the former, I guess someone else now knows of her little secret and in part she is now asking the teacher for advice? Dude, Nasa-kun got it easy, he can't give you any advice. Even his confession spot is like, in a scene of a truck accident. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Nonetheless, he did give some proper advice apart from Tsukasa's which is like, stalk the heck out of him or something leading us to believe that (if you haven't found out) Ginga-kun here is being stalked by someone hopefully some JK who wants to confess to him lol how can he even think of this, makes it super unbelievable for Aya-chan who then intends to join him to see if he is right.. and it looks like a date now. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Thank goodness Nasa-kun gave some motivation to the now depressed Shirogane so she can get on her feet and do the thing. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Nasa-kun dude, I wish you were around to advice me a decade and a half ago. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Actually, I might sitll be able to do it now- What am I even saying. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Too bad though, Ginga-kun can think of such things, but didn't know it's right in front of him? Man, I wish I was that thick to not realize stuff like this. Thinking back I don't think I have such a thing going on for me so lucky you, bro. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, Tsukasa is now thinking about how Nasa-kun is getting all the p*ssy in an all girls' high school? Yeah, motherf**ker's getting the j-j-j-jealousy going on hard. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (Yeah don't mind on this blog's running joke) Well we all know it's dumb, it's all built on trust, sadly the wife didn't have much trust on the husband lol but also she did have too much free time thinking about it on the bath house counter is the likely reason, so she went to see the husband in school. Heck, maybe not getting spotted by the students is a good idea after all, since now that at least two of them won't keep your secret where you guys are making out in the streets- All in all haha, some progression and don't expect it to be on the wife haha really no that's not happening anytime soon, but hey, maybe the final episode here we will get some of that to conclude this mini-series. So yeah, let's find out the lore about this next week- When it airs in another 2 weeks haha I can wait I have so many distractions just see the rest of this post. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> </div><div>[TL:DR; "I... really just came here to teach programming, though" I know right what are these kids thinking you're a pu** slayer just because you have a wife lol]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhStlokDGLetRScGeUMQCYe2ho59NwEj_H1WeYemP99HZsE6uibB6IQHaWU6hxsthHB4T368nb2gMwbrkkwwx-yrn5TJTEOJmqjpCM5q4rt_GhBPHDCKSDluGx_qTy4Uxx5MLDfKuyGaQDU_eE3-N-80mgu1t--d_4pESRPzYi5xLGrLOBaE-BNag5YWtI/s320/tonikawaJK03_couple3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You think they are a couple?<br><span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9NpzQ5IDTrjTYW27xHYGF1Z56UcfMd31ZgsA2WYHeRLZCOOjgGom-m3CkTpBmyS4_OYsDuKoocD4YKqe5NktpOlD-bBVISSIrU-xYyCk0NSPah5l4AjhZFfgoQLRJ1MZqEN8TGBKZxDDIfPC5v_l-Z205l77ztpWod_6VIf0t2bN1oMs1HutXo-YrrLQ/s320/tonikawaJK03_couple6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>These two are a couple though.<br><span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></table></div></div><div>P.S. "But it was so manly, it made my heart throb" Okay Shirogane maybe that's why all guys decide to get ripped so they can fight someone in front of their girl or whatever huh LAME <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>P.P.S. "Listen closely! Romance is essentially <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen target=_blank>a battle of wits</a>!" Okay Tsukasa you can't say that dude lol can the author of "Kaguya-sama" sue? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> "When a cute girl does it, it's not stalking. It's true love" Oh boy haha<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SukiMega06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Suki na Ko ga Megane wo Wasureta</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"She's not going to get lost going somewhere unfamiliar without her glasses, is she?" What do you think, Komura-kun? What do you think haha</div></blockquote>Please Komura, she only knows her way home, it'll be a miracle if she can walk to your place without her glasses. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe we set that as a yes to the confession. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we are changing seats already (#SukiMega06), I guess we gotta grab every last moment we have with the girl we like, yes? Haha yes Komura it's not just you, I can like a middle school girl. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Hey WAIT WAIT NO haha okay we know it's not that, but you know, girls > arcades, yes? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh yeah, she heard about that alright. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In an effort to make sure Komura gets to hang out with his dudes though lol I don't have friends don't mind me, Mie-san here is really trying very hard to see stuff even though she can't even see the kanji on her textbook when brought up to her face so what else is new. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Komura knew of this all along, he knew maybe going to the post office with her to put that letter (for applying for a prize, don't think stamp cards are around outside Japan these days but I did get one for eating at a food court lol) would be a good idea lest she just misses it altogether and throws it in the rubbish bin. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know I sound like I'm making a joke but trust me, that has a higher probability than you think. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah Komura saw his girl out real good, and in the end they did go put that letter together... just in a nearby convenience store they have letterboxes there too, and so Komura also gets to go to the arcade with his dudes. So jokes on us, it's both, he can do both. But yeah, priorities, I know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In the new school year though, and yes this is only a thing in Japan I don't even get sh*t for perfect attendance, but to be frank I CANNOT BELIEVE (lol) these two went to school every day despite one being blinded because look at the series title and the other one being blinded by love <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, still managed to go on stage to get her certificate and not like, hold on to something else which will make all this even more awkward than her mean eyes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (No, not gonna elaborate- The principal's suit seam <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>) But of course, this is hardly any scary compared to the scariest event of all in this class with same teacher: changing of seats! Be reminded of Episode 1 where we started with a change of seats but just a year ago, and lucky for Komura-kun he got to sit beside this marvel of a girl and I say that because he likes the girl. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Fast forward a year later and uh... I think our luck ran out, dude. So yeah Komura you asked for it, if it's anyone to take care of her it's either her friends or Azuma. And I guess this time around it's Mie-san with the j-j-j-jealousy because some girl is sitting beside Komura? Oh hell yeah let's go this is the fuel for the rest of the season huh. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay not so quick because in the many jokes underlying on this series' success, Mie-san got her seat wrong. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She ended up with Someya-san sitting in front of the class but then still suffers from the same problems of wanting to see her guy in class all the time (lmao cheeky) and not like a mirror on her desk will help her out because see the title again lol, so looks like the new girl who switched into this class sitting beside Komura got them back into square one. Nice girl, maybe we like this one instead. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, MVP Higuchi (oh hey <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/47669/Saki_Miyashita target=_blank>dead detective</a> Siesta lmao) for setting up this for all of us haha but yeah, this is as smooth as it goes, moving up a year in class. But heck, I don't think my class change is this smooth. Well, mine in elementary school was like, all the way to the last class in one year and jumped back to the first in the next so you can tell about my grades. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well at least all of them got what they wanted. Higuchi won't be happy with this dude anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Moving on though, IS THAT <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu target=_blank>SKINSHIP</a>??? Bro, final year in middle school doesn't equal to making out though?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> These previews are the worst lol see you then he finally brought the glasses home lmao</div><div>[TL:DR; "I can't help but want to have you for myself" HOLY SHIT IT'S ONLY EPISODE SIX haha I'll let you figure out who said this lol]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj37MdkMkCjNuc1W9ENAQXJvTLVXybGf27bEaxrTVyj6iFjYFIgkKJLwAgoWQdqBHTkKuV2_g1YjVkjAdBBhhziZpVbrVCkxMWEfQrNOsVQwfBRclGTv5lmehYmtebb4i-a6IYa3xeXao7zO6WpN0UsEjuCdGPFgBzGx02wQQlwGsejUahf-zTtEFV8_oo/s320/sukimega06_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is pretty deep jealousy going on here haha<br>(No not the class ikemen)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhe0QceU7pCVtepPSgOBZpT_natB1N8n93y0X4vY4qbKwnlMPdsUYWgK1Qag9LzpiIKa-1sjdcwo6GEYVmgyXJ-vlTfU20cGxmgWx0DPD0nWzxMhaYEt-BgU97yFGB22uq6mRfFr60BciLtM10YyphEQwGfPWQtfyLM_qLm6RxfWZ_NfbpkrhHaTKl00lI/s320/sukimega06_komura1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is pretty deep jealousy going on here haha<br>(I don't know who lost but someone did lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Oh Bocchan got the possessiveness issues too? Haha</div></blockquote>Well, if you haven't been spoiled by the official <strike>Twitter</strike> X post about the new couple in town... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode though (#ShinigamiBocchan17) turns out Hugo was right all along!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay if you didn't get anything from here on, at least take a hint from our circus' resident kid, alright? It's as straightforward as I can put it, and if this doesn't count... don't worry technically it does haha, but we have to say that in context first, I suppose. So, the circus' first open performance in a while. They are all ready to perform, they had a huge audience standing by in the town square which attracted a lot of other people we have Zain and Cuff and Daleth and Keto and Teto... wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, as from the previous episode, Daleth is not going to let Zain's excuse let her down, so as much as Zain might be prepared to leave for the witches' world after not telling Cuff what happened because she figured it out anyways lol he is such a bad liar, the trio of witches decide to ruin the circus... well for the better because they aren't killing people anytime soon lol but we know to not make things worse considering there are the circus people who are human and the audience are at risk, so we better save at least Hugo from being eaten by the magic Venus flytrap? Okay hot chick, your magic is kinda brutal for starters. Ironically though, not enough for Zain to use his time magic because remember we have a resident killer in our hands- Excuse me, resident cursed killer. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, Bocchan showed off his "magic" as if it's part of the circus like none other, eroding the creature like there's no tomorrow, and despite the attempts to try to stop the girls including distracting Zain with an illusion lol that was easy, Cuff almost fell off the roof trying to get to the one witch and Zain's time magic had to be used which he had to in a pinch to save her. Yeah, Cuff before anything, dude. Not even for the two witches who offered him a handy. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I meant, just holding hands, I don't mean nothing- Zain has no d*ck, we know of that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The couple (lol) also took the time to confess to each other out I guess; Zain did it in public at an alley before Cuff ran away in embarrassment haha kawaii, and Cuff... well, if a kiss is anything of a reply to a confession and I can list out as many romance Anime to prove to you that this is it haha... yeah Zain can't leave now the seal has been done. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, I think we can all agree that the lesson learnt this episode is that no matter how deep your love is for boobies, you will still get laid with a pair of them eventually. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Not true don't cancel me but) I gotta say though this might be a little sudden in terms of storytelling, but heck I'll take it though! It has been a while since these secondary characters can play around lol what this has gone to, and looks like maybe this is as much as a challenge as also a way to show their friendship thus far. Cuff loves someone who she can rely on, and Zain just loves rack. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Enough jokes, it's sentimental of a feels at the least, but more importantly, the lore dude! How Alice knew her mom's not dead... yet lol, and how she was lied to as a kid. We shall see where that goes though we did not really mention Rob being a whistle-blower at any point, so let's see if he will reveal anything about this incident of Sharon's disappearance.</div><div>[TL:DR; "You're finally going to confess to her (Cuff)?"

Eh Ranpo-san I don't think this will be that easy but sure dude I believe you<span style=text-align:left> </span></div></blockquote>I mean, do we have to do a meeting in the Detective Agency setting? Haha I mean we can do this anywhere maybe in the Ability users prison in Europe too. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where the Agency members get to regroup for now (#BungouStrayDogs55), maybe here's the turning point now that the world is in chaos and the page cannot be filled no more ie. no more fates can be manipulated without real action. HELL YEAH action now where have I heard of that before. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, the plan to kickstart potentially the final fight. There is a lot to take in here, so let's go through them. Fukuchi intends to take the ultimate commander weapon and let's call that instead I just forgot the name, and with his Ability of doing anything 100-fold he will make sure he can control the world's military ie. the Detective Agency will have no future in front of them. To combat against this, Ranpo's current approach (because never say never to change) is to deal with the handing over of the weapon to Fukuchi apparently happening in 18 other places including the airport where the final showdown will be held. Yeah, it's like they all know what is happening already, so no surprises there. What will be a surprise will be two fold, so let's talk about particle manipulation master Saigiku, or Jouno as mentioned by his Captain. I think we all know something felt weird when Fukuchi decided to talk to him in person and the moment the door closed in on him in the room, his fate was pretty much sealed. Of course he refused to help Fukuchi with his plans by betraying him, and this wasn't without reason, for starters. As he has the power of feeling things around him (eww gross haha) (also hell yeah lol technically he has touched all women) he knew of Tachihara's suspicions to Fukuchi long time ago, and cornering him was part of the plan, but he didn't know about Akutagawa's participation preventing his escape which is probably why Fukuchi was prepared for this or else why would he dare to even attempt this, did somewhat succeed in stopping him though since he got the vampire bite so I guess it might be over for him RIP Saigiku haha not how that works, but also because he knew of this backfire on him, he placed a note on nearby Aya-chan who shocked herself with the truth because she overheard what she really shouldn't have lol I'll just pretend it's not my business tbh, followed them into the room and then found out about everything inside the room. So yeah, Saigiku knows she's inside, don't think Fukuchi or Bran will though. But as she needs to leave with evidence of this including planning for a route of escape which I guess can be done once old man leaves the premises, in her infinite wisdom she thought taking a photo with her smartphone camera would be the best thing to do. LMAO JAPAN PROBLEMS AMIRITE haha oh by the way smartphones sold in Japan are flash enabled by default, I think this is still a thing. I would've done a video recording. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So oh boy now Aya-chan had to go into hiding. But where though, and how will she even get out of this? I guess we will find out soon enough. Though the hint so far is- Okay dude, you got me good as much as Fukuchi. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Damn, this is great so far. Though sorry for famous detective detection here haha, this will do little to help the Detective Agency out, and I will more than believe that Aya-chan will likely meet her fate which I hope not, and Saigiku will be able to get himself out because he probably can fight Akutagawa and win, I like to think that Ranpo might be prepared to deal with as many layers of Fukuchi's brain that will come after them mainly because you know, old man and Atsushi have seen his power first hand so they probably thought of that too. Whatever happens next though? I'll let the story tell itself haha maybe Aya-chan hid inside the coffin LOL tell me that is true so I can brag about already knowing this magic trick before it's revealed (hehe the best place to hide is the one with the highest assumption, and that's assuming she won't get bit lol)</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuCFELY6KQUngFyzkBdQU4CwNpLD0WooTD8JeMZBzgqcPCB4W_QVCEPNYe8_rP8lGlZJusxuL9XpBGxJ7lqZBQjAfBKQv4CyPL9jZon1acGrDgQN0fOy4UHsO6w5yg8ioHtHOYIJvEGzbAh0zsfEMCA8rRYbHWpDK_HjIutK2DcM5IknJnvXvz1a2ryPM/s320/bungoustraydogs55_saigiku3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What everyone thinks Saigiku looks like<br>(Oh hey Jesus, hello?)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3IWgtfEWYPSnW4YaCPinp6O5f32xwNOu8ftNzbj_FpyqSx2eTT0Z_G5YsIBJWfbUQDpqi0YquFsWvq338JRjVYFTltXD9xLOhV7HbN8VgU7r13G09tFqbnoZu4H4Ls4uQgZ3uoxkxEUatwQN7Tst-KJjsFo6Pi6w6SEWLCLkJHlwAgwPAp5in-wVKwJg/s320/bungoustraydogs55_saigiku4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What Saigiku looks like now<br>(lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Good job, girl. <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sasuga target=_blank>Sasuga</a> Kazuya's discipline. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where a couple goes up the mountains for a one-night stay haha I can't use the word "stand" to be frank (#KanoKari30), because it isn't what you think. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> If you would recall we are at the final phase of the shooting for the movie crowdfunded for Chizuru herself so that the grandmother gets to see it as a parting gift lol hopefully not but we set her ambitions of being an actress high and early, and yeah, this is just an opportunity to get a good shot of the stars for this apparently solo scene which as I said I don't know the movie so if that will be released in cinemas IRL or span two episodes in the future that'll be great. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or else, you would be relived that just like me, Chizuru isn't scared at all to be frank and I know why, because Mini-chan can only go this far into setting this up even with the room allocation. So yeah, maybe putting trust on the only guy left in the room is a better idea after all. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah later Kazuya becomes a beast and- Shit happens only at night, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay we should move on, just a reminder that we are here to shoot a final scene of the movie, and after some scene checking because they do that first instead of stumbling into it at the dead of night, and even then that happened real quick since you know, what else you gonna do in the hotel between those times? Flirt with each other- Let's move on to the next scene at night haha, they finally start the night shooting which I assume they took some quick naps just in case Kazuya screws up and we have to do this all night. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And literally at the actual run, Chizuru had to stop him as she has something to confess? Yeah, she is just gonna thank you for all of this as movie producer, that's all. Or yeah, she'll tell you to sleep at the corridor later. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And because I write some parts of this review on the go haha the video is paused right now AND I'm right, it's the former so literal trauma dump about her grandfather passing his legacy to the wife (lol) and now we have to make sure it happens or else old man that sounds like Mayuri will come haunt us in our dreams. Which is probably true since Chizuru did not sleep well that night she must have been scared of sleeping in separate <a href=https://jisho.org/search/futon target=_blank>futon</a>s HAHAHAHA okay me get your decency back, and same to Kazuya too even he is technically doing this because he likes the girl, isn't it? He's not wrong, making this movie is already a dream to him, down to the core. He's definitely jerking off to this every day afterwards haha what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What is not a dream though, is either if you're into Chizuru in which like her, you would have realized you slept on the bus and that's the best for Kazuya, OR if you are into Kazuya you would be keen on what Ruka-chan has to offer now that she found out what happened within the span of what, 24 hours? Haha yeah told you already, all it needs was a phone call to her boi for her to figure this out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... maybe I truly am scared of influence, unlike what these two have done to each other. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But seriously though, Ruka-chan, I'll give you my everything, just not the crotch, thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Heck, maybe even physical intimacy I might be afraid. I think of the little experience I have with women (yes including family members I will state for reference only don't think too far lol) and think how little I know about... anything actually, compared to this one Kinoshita Kazuya. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah, so let's not think too deep into it this is a private affair after all including my hopes and dreams and me being a wimp lmao, looks like next up we will be compensated in due time for all the lack of... well everything <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> with <strike>Naobou</strike> Ruka-chan episode!!

Yes, call her a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/otaku target=_blank>weeb</a> or whatever you just didn't notice I'm also one too lol, but yeah, nothing else (and I think many will agree) beats that feeling of chasing the latest chapter every week for the next exciting plot twist or whatever, and in this case, I promise you they did not copy from that popular ninja series, no. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, when sometimes she drops by her usual bookstore since she knew to avoid convenience stores, still managed to be out of stock sometimes and that's just sad to any reader, honestly. That's why you gotta have backup or fallback, dude. I know this is <em>the</em> bookstore but you gotta at least have 3 more backed up. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Not me as a Japanese haha even if I am one I probably will just read online. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, she technically did miss it because that damn guy who thinks he looks cool Yanagi walked into the store to get a copy before our dear girl so how dare you haha, ended up just giving out his copy since he can buy from near his place? Also Sakura you're right, he's a fellow weeb too and they ended up talking about the characters in the series they both follow- Dude, is this not the most awkward conversation you can have between weebs? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But of course, seeing how they even talk in school and/or go to the bookstore together to grab the latest stuff and being seen as a couple lmao Sakura no, they also talked about other stuff, like how they wear glasses so maaaaaybe we don't just take this ship at face value. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, we are done with the bullsh*t that is the confession with Ishikawa, right? We can use some consolation. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> This second half though... let's just say Honoka is just me without the Hori-san fangirling. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Getting bullied, no friends to hang out with, hard to speak up and I'm a male for goodness sake... It's all in a day's work for me being in school all day, to be frank. Thankfully, for Honoka's case, she has friends in third year which I guess she forced herself into thanks to Hori-san if you remember she was her No.1 fanclub member lmao, somewhat still ostracized by her classmates but ended up not only helping them out in return because she is just a nice girl anyways after being what, thrown off her scarf from the building to be found out by Miyamura? Dude, I wish I had a chance to shame anyone who has bullied me before- MOVING ON haha I'm fine don't worry it has been decades ago <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, and as we can see with how Honoka hangs out with the others, it's alright being weird, it's less alright when you aren't being nice. And Honoka isn't any of that to be frank we got weirder people in the list lol, but you did ride on Sengoku which is envy even to <strike>Remi-chan</strike> RemiRemi-chan lmao so I don't know if I should continue to bully you or not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, as I see the ending and thought of how much money they had put into this season of Anime and how yes <a href="https://twitter.com/horimiya_anime/status/1690377852053520384?s=20" target=_blank>Yanagi and Sakura are singing the song</a> for the manga they like... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Damn, this episode is good, way better than last week somehow.

No one said this was easier than going up, so deal with it, Ichigo. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, until Ichigo reaches the ground in this new episode though (#BLEACHTYBW19), hey I guess you don't need Urahara-sensei (yes I call him that) to tell you that things are looking <em>pretty</em> bad out there, yes? Hey, kudos to Renji and Rukia hanging out there, so let's talk about more of what they did, specifically of the latter. So yeah, boy this is quite an episode. The most beautiful and magnificent episode, female fans would argue. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah this is Rukia's fight against her brother's opponent- Hey As Nodt HOW DARE YOU TOUCH MY RUKIA haha also the ASMR dude, that's called fear haha you ever wanted to let a fat man whisper into your earhole? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (I'm sorry Yoshitsugu fans don't cancel me) Also, if you think putting the harem master (lol) Matsuoka in this to voice the villain of fear was a mistake, I think on the contrary (and not because it's ASMR lol) that they picked the right guy. From the whispers to the laughs to the screams to even the normal flashback scenes of him still being a human in a hospital bed for some reason, it looks like he did his job very well: instilling fear into all of us to remind ourselves that he isn't just living in all the harem Anime you love. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Jokes aside though, maybe we talk about Rukia's sword now. If you didn't catch the name of her sword it's basically "a snow petal", but just like how Rukia never learnt of its true form, turns out, it is what it says, just a piece of snow in itself. As such, she is a master of manipulating cold temperatures only of course the reverse is probably still Yamamoto if he isn't dead RIP haha, so freezing anything now only requires her sense of touch, which quickly stopped the "fear" thing that is the bulk of As Nodt's power. But I would argue at this point it's already just a difference in spiritual power for our little Rukia to be able to do so much, so much so we have the recognition of our <a href=https://jisho.org/search/onii target=_blank>onii</a>-sama haha shout out to Byakuya, so honestly saying this Quincy didn't have much of a chance. Yeah, even if you look at this monstrosity of a V-power (lol) you will also be scared. But no fear, Rukia. Your brother has your back because it isn't hard to cut off the whatever ball that is encircling you with all the damn eyes even he is having deja vu off it haha it's just way more than that and it's fear, just considering that we made many assumptions here about their training and stuff, it's hard to understand how all this fear thing will not work on Rukia. But let's just say bringing up Kaien to her even at this point won't make her scared- We did that with Aaroneiro already dude, we can't reuse villains. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, moving on, and this dragged on to the ending for some reason and thanks for cutting it off lol I didn't like the song tbh, As Nodt was defeated with her Bankai, and if you need some explanation, take it like liquid nitrogen or instafreeze effects lol this is a rarity even in the mangaverse honestly, so with crazy limitations in time and movement of what was shown earlier, she just stops the enemy in one hit. Obviously the limitation here is range and of course how fast she can do this she still has to thaw which is a problem imo, but heck, we have effectively proven how it works in battle, so claps all around we don't have to see Byakuya's Bankai in this for the I don't know how many times coming. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Now that we got rid of fear itself haha it's that easy guys, looks like we might move on to Kenpachi's fight uh oh spoiler alert, which I recall is kinda long because it starts with Yachiru and Isane. Well, the latter should be fine if I recall but not the former so uh yeah, maybe we will see some more action up front. Just uh, thaw yourself a bit alright we need to keep this heat goin'!! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "It's because you got cold feet."

Hell yeah <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1688929307362816000?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new music video</a></b> for her new single next week is great- Just don't ask about the song itself I'm at the pretty sure area of not giving this title song already to be honest. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Good that they let her dance though, that bounce is just different. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Moving on, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1689260239374422016?s=20" target=_blank>Sambomaster's new performance on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> is alright but I'll give that new song when the album drops in November as I've mentioned last week. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/mol_74/status/1689109261715120129?s=20" target=_blank>mol-74 helped produce indie band "yeti let you notice" and their new mini-album</a></b> so I got to check them out a bit by <a href="https://twitter.com/ylyn_TMP/status/1688928234552074242?s=20" target=_blank>listening to a preview</a> and I gotta say this might be the missing bit that can fill in the gaps since the last time I heard of Cwondo a couple of months ago which was a flop. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1689593574919385088?s=20" target=_blank>cinema staff's new YouTube Shorts</a></b> (haha) is of their recent live with a recent song and I liked it a lot, brings out the moody feels when I need to have them. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1689245728844214272?s=20" target=_blank>RYTHEM's new best album is finally on music streaming services</a></b> 3 months after physical release (seriously) and thus had put available one new song other than the one you should have heard at the start of the year and that other one was... meh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1690717590337748992?s=20" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new single title song teaser</a></b> is anything but, even so it could be as disappointing as the last time we did this so let's hope this is not the case. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi_info/status/1689834028206092288?s=20" target=_blank>yanaginagi's new song is for an Anime</a></b> next season what else is new the only thing that isn't is me giving the songs <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, and <b><a href=https://www.tiktok.com/@sonymusicjp/video/7266392203323280647 target=_blank>TrySail did a TikTok dancing to their new album song</a></b> which I did give as part of their promotion of their live tour I assume. Rather obvious because it was posted on their parent parent company (didn't type that wrong) Sony Music Japan's account haha and yes even <a href=https://www.tiktok.com/@sonymusicjp/video/7265175696140537090 target=_blank>Mocho's dancing of her new music video</a> was there too so be sure to take a look if you are keen I've seen them all. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See Elon, people will move elsewhere to talk about their music. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><br><br> So for next week, looks like I will have to decide on <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%AF%E3%83%AF-ep/1699352529?l=en-US" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new single</a></b> and we haven't even heard of the B-side and I already want to say no haha my wallet you are safe for now, and I'll listen to that band <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/peeling-on-the-pool/1699155481?l=en-US" target=_blank>yeti let you notice's mini-album</a></b> to start the week I suppose. Man, everything's gonna happen in the end of the month, huh. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span><br><br><br><br><br> So, Maimai's birthday event livestreams, eh? I promised myself to never buy tickets for anything else other than for my birthday *looks at Inorin* haha but heck, I may not have done it for the earlier <a href="https://twitter.com/heihei_kissa/status/1690636271897784320?s=20" target=_blank>talk show</a> but I'll do it for (still afternoon but) <a href="https://twitter.com/heihei_kissa/status/1690715516938416128?s=20" target=_blank>the night one</a> because there's singing in it! Sponsored by JOYSOUND by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Don't worry, I didn't expect her to sing anything from my music library (lol) but she did sing a ClariS and YUI song, so that's good enough. <a href="https://twitter.com/fogfran666/status/1690690611857530880?s=20" target=_blank>She did sing a lot of cute songs</a> that should get anyone on a Sunday night so that's probably for the better. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> She did read us a (probably love) letter from her to us which is enough to make her weep so that was adorable (hey, she won't let her shame go to make her cry buckets on camera, we know), and she announced a photobook to be shot in Okinawa (if you <em>still</em> don't know what that place is, just go back and look at my many <a href=../../2022/05/the-fifteenth-and-sixteenth-book-worth.html>photobook reviews</a>) (or wait a month when I talk about Isobe Karin's haha) which has no release date yet so unless you tell me it's early next year and/or there is no bikini or even swimsuit involved... Man, we're not getting it, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys next week then if anyone else is reading this besides me, and until next time... we got another long week ahead of us so until I get over the idea of perfecting my future I guess we will go through the weekly life once again! Hey, at least every week will be different; Next week won't have Ajuju announcing she's married- <div>P.S.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6tel-xwTdnFh7_wj2Le14IodAq7CLinDu8s7SKf4k0tQpzVQ-U8-8ezdPJmZbGqhyNKJk2SVDutTbSpuSL_9NcoM1Kl70L-4xKxhDQPczYehPTVG9xZmi5U72V511SzLu7hqQhLgoV_jQteChxVPZO61pE0dim8rHp1u4hBpIUZgMYchF0QvocaQppwA/s1920/Screenshot%202023-08-13%20174050.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6tel-xwTdnFh7_wj2Le14IodAq7CLinDu8s7SKf4k0tQpzVQ-U8-8ezdPJmZbGqhyNKJk2SVDutTbSpuSL_9NcoM1Kl70L-4xKxhDQPczYehPTVG9xZmi5U72V511SzLu7hqQhLgoV_jQteChxVPZO61pE0dim8rHp1u4hBpIUZgMYchF0QvocaQppwA/s320/Screenshot%202023-08-13%20174050.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Just evidence I watched this live haha I'm 1 hour behind btw<br>(She just sang <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/good-bye-days/1537515380?i=1537515381" target=_blank>YUI's "Good-bye days"</a>, truly a classic)</table><div><br></div><div><div>P.P.S.
