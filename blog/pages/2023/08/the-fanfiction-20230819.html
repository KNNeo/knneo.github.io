<div>Well I did promise you a sequel so here we are!!</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Haha if you have no idea what I'm talking about, refer to my story two weeks
  ago and then come back here for the continuation- Hey, I wished I didn't screw
  this up and do this back to back especially if we are talking about sequels
  but heck, Anime isn't even following this rule already so technically I'm
  still fine. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, someone popped on that news to be relevant last
  week so I had to get it off- What am I even saying she is already taken lol
  not this one though HAHAHA
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Might as well write this before she is though, it's hard to predict Japanese
  voice actresses marital status nowadays lol ikr Inorin might already be
  flirting with some dude for what we know-
</div>

    After walking around the festival for a bit, I bought some
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senkouhanabi" target="_blank"
      >sparklers</a
    >
    for us to end the day. Well, Minase Inori told me to buy for her to play
    because I am again reminded on how this is just a date to repay her for
    saving my life and all expenses are on me. She is enjoying herself though,
    so it was worth buying another pack.

      We played by the shed around the back nearby the shop where they sold
      them. The sky is dark enough to light them up but bright enough for me to
      still see the ecstatic face Minase-san was making while she lit one up.
      She cheekily brought it to my face without me looking, I squirmed in fear
      and retreated a few centimetres. Her beautiful smile immediately turned
      into a giggle but also quickly turned into a face of worry.

      She moved up to me as I nodded in embarrassment. I later did the same
      thing to her as she was preparing to light up another sparkler.</i

  The theme song for this week's story is likely
  <a
    href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%8F%E5%A4%A2/1263776647?i=1263776650&amp;l=en-US"
    target="_blank"
    >Minase Inori's "Natsu Yume"</a
  >
  and boy was that quite a song to describe this occasion. Well, just the
  situation at hand, not the benefactor part in case you totally forgot about
  how this might have happened not in real life. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Nonetheless, since we
  didn't know each other well anyways we are technically acquaintances, so
  cheeky Inorin can only happen in fiction, right? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Man, I wish summer
  festivals were like this for me, all we have here are Hungry Ghost festivals-
  Maybe I just want to date Inorin after all hehe oh you bet I'm going to
  continue this lore someday because as a benefactor is there any end to
  repaying this? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you then.
