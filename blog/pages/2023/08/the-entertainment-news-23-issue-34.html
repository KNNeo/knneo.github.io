Well, my weekdays already suck especially with the emptiness from the gacha this
week lol at least next week it won't be! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> At least I'll ensure it won't
be for next week since the upcoming package is on its way hehe this is my
motivation now, but if you haven't looked around at this place for a bit why not
take a look? I got another fanfic up and running and this time around I promise
she's still single. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Don't jinx it, me, don't jinx it)
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Uh... August can only move so fast amirite?? Haha I'm running out of things to
  say to be honest that's how boring this week was lol oh yeah I had to choose
  between MaiMai and my imouto for livestream airing on the same time on
  Thursday and uh, the latter's was lagging and I paid for the former one AND
  she's playing Fall Guys too just like what the latter did before so... <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Let's just talk about Anime and music! Oh and sorry if I sound more dull than
  normal this will be me until next week where the new package is here haha this
  is how I live now huh. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'm also trying to fix this blog and it's
  such a pain haha but thankfully I still have like what, 10 months to go before
  the 5th anniversary on this new domain? Oh boy I remember this well since I
  don't even have a girlfriend-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Anime and music is still just better haha let's get to it!</div>

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  It's okay Mie-san you remember Komura's face by memory, right? You don't have
  to see him to do it- Later she just draws a- In this new episode haha
  (#SukiMega07) where this should've happened like, 6 episodes ago haha, we
  getting physical. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, technically not wrong, Komura somehow
  brought Mie-san's glasses home for some reason. Well, not without reason. Not
  for the reason I would hope (so Komura can pass it to her on days she forgot)
  which makes total sense but would not exist here lol. It's Friday, someone
  left her glasses in school because what a surprise she forgot, isn't exactly
  safe but then again isn't it? Haha but yeah they aren't cheap and Komura is a
  freak so he asked if he could bring it home. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, it's just
  bringing a pair of glasses home for the weekend, this is going to be an easy
  write-up for me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well turns out it is not, if you like these stuff
  you're welcome female audience if you are watching, it's basically Komura
  being so wary of the glasses we might as well set up one of those altars for
  him to put the glasses on. Trust me, he definitely thought of asking his
  parents whether he can buy a glasses rack to put those on. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, it's
  kind of affecting him, like, distracting from his homework?? Dude, it's just a
  pair of glasses, relax. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;<strike
    >It's just like having a plug up your-</strike
  >
  It's just like having something new in your room: You just gotta get used to
  it as it takes up that space. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, we know he will never. Heck,
  even Mie-san is thinking if she really should let her boi bring her glasses
  home and even calling to him to ask if it was dirty or anything <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> and
  even if it is we won't know because that guy brought in the cleaning company
  to maintain your glasses already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All the jokes in this episode haha
  and you thought the mom knew what happened. You be better off knowing if your
  son is watching porn- Speaking of not bringing it back home haha let's talk
  about what was brought up in school. Which physical contact do you want me to
  elaborate on though? The fall on him, massaging his shoulders or touching his
  fingers? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yep, that all happened alright Komura, you didn't imagine
  things at all. I mean, tripping and landing on your boi? I mean, I would've
  done that on purpose. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But of course, I think maybe more wholesome in
  terms of perspective, definitely is when Komura is napping in an empty
  classroom and Mie-san just waltz in to touch him all over- Not a porno, by the
  way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp; Well specifically touching his fingers to the point that
  he woke up so that's kinda busted in any way, not like the guy doesn't mind
  though he's all into this. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, still funny but yeah as with
  all slice-of-life series this will get dull real quick but we are hanging on
  just like how the glasses are hanging on to Mie-san's face most of the time...
  hopefully haha yeah it's kinda the same tbh if you think about it, and next
  time looks like we are peeking into a confession which uh, doesn't involve
  both of them? Yeah alright we get it, that's only happening in Episode 12 and
  even then we can't guarantee it will happen so why not learn from others, yes?
  It's like me- I've never seen a confession. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't think that's
  good from a personal perspective but yeah just like this Anime couple what
  else is new haha
</div>

  [TL:DR; "Isn't there something pervy about bringing home Mie-san's glasses?"
  Yes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

      nothing has been set in stone until the last moment, Walter. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Then again Walter is not wrong, it'll be rad if even if Bocchan managed to
  cure his curse in which the mom will still let the SECOND son take over the
  household. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#ShinigamiBocchan18) we get to
  talk about not the main couple? LET'S GOOOOOO haha you know I'm not a fan.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What I am a fan of though, is Walter- Who are we lying to he's still
  second on this list. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yes, Viola-chan. Walter is definitely trying
  to bring up his image to prove to his mom slowly but surely, but maybe just
  sometimes he is faltered helping her sister slim down considering she is
  eating way too many sweets more than the average Anime girl will eat to be
  honest (lol) and just screaming at the top of his lungs so the mom can hear it
  lmao, still is a great onii-chan honestly saying better than the cursed one
  lol despite what he feels like in person, is encouraging to his sister back
  then and even till now. Much wholesome sibling action right here considering
  the other one is far away from these two. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But hey, that's the point
  of having siblings, right? The parents don't understand this diet and sweets
  stuff. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Then again, they also don't understand that curse put on
  their eldest kid so what else is new. And of course besides the main couple
  returning home, the highlight of this episode has <em>gotta</em> be the date
  between Zain and Cuff our new couple... and Hugo? <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> When will this kid get
  our of their way so they can bang- Then again he is a loner now for having to
  leave his pickpocket circle so let's credit him to making this ship a success
  (hehe) and then kick him away when this is all in place so that he doesn't get
  in the way where they are in a cave by themselves for the night because of a
  snowstorm, eh? I mean, maybe next time Zain. Maybe next time you'll get to
  fondle her- Maybe next time you'll get to think of a plan faster than Daleth
  will come up with one. Then again, it is rather important for them to visit
  Bocchan considering he is technically also in trouble lest that damn witch is
  coming back to tell him stuff again lol especially to Alice at this point. To
  protect them or something lol somehow Daleth has that power to freeze people's
  minds in order to talk to them though, that's rather fascinating and creepy at
  the same time. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Daleth, anyone? No, not you, Walter. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Spoiler territory right here already hehe, but damn is the time Zain and Cuff
  had together just the best thing that has happened to this series to far. Hey,
  they didn't say a couple won't be formed, it's just not telling on when this
  couple is sprawling from, since technically it happened hehe. All in all
  though, progress is made, but not much is told. What Walter is doing going to
  the town is still kind of a mystery but seeing what has been on the season
  trailer it's likely he's meeting a witch <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, and yeah, the witch itself.
  We might be paying her a visit though so that's exciting? Haha I can't believe
  I said that, but you know, we gotta deal with her at some point. Or Walter
  might HAHAHA see you then.

  </blockquote>
  So yeah, remember when we were saving the world? Yeah, let's put Aya-chan
  aside for now and haha in this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs56) talk about
  instead how I was right and possibly am smarter than Ranpo-san right now CALL
  ME
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/meitantei" target="_blank">MEITANTEI</a>
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Alright sorry for the spoilers it wasn't in the intro but a bit
  later, but yeah, now that we know that and technically it isn't even Fukuchi's
  priority right now, let's talk about what the Detective Agency actually has
  planned in the airport where they expect the delivery of One Order. Before
  that for starters, Fukuchi didn't find the one who spied on him living in the
  same room, and thought it might be just a trick from the Agency. As mentioned
  once again, the only thing Fukuchi can't deal with is complication. So he has
  to take priority to go to the airport case than deal with whoever is hiding in
  the same room as him... apart from <strike>Bran</strike> Bram of course haha,
  since in the former case he has to intercept the delivery of One Order.
  Ranpo-san was right, it did take one second. The handover. But preventing it
  from happening can happen in too many ways he can't deal with. Problem is,
  Ranpo knows the only way his logic can fail is if that logic doesn't exist.
  Which brings us to our two geniuses still locked in the prison. Firstly,
  Fyodor is a problem, in case you didn't know about this already. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  HOW??? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> How did he manage to kill the two pilots on the plane without
  even seeing them in the first place? Does he even know it's these two that
  will deliver the package? Yeah, as always Fyodor's Ability is something to be
  afraid of. That or I like to think this might be from the page of the book,
  written vaguely as "kill the people who are delivering the package" and then
  letting ChatGPT interpret that creatively. (Haha AI joke) Still, this is quite
  a plan, and yes Ranpo-san will not be able to reason out that Fukuchi is
  working for Fyodor, and therefore had planned for the remaining two (lol)
  Hunting Dogs to take the crashing plane down since it can't go back and this
  Fukuchi will be able to grab it in a second, literally. But then again Dazai
  also prevented on this by telling Ango-san to lie which is as hard as telling
  me to lie (lol) so that's smart. It's not violating the page I assume since
  specificity is likely not detailed in it, we are just delaying the inevitable.
  Remember, our world is controlled by the two of them wits against each other,
  which begs the question once again... Now what? Apparently getting them out is
  what happened afterwards, as Nikolai did by the way, got both of them out of
  their cells which haha ironically isn't the best defence here but heck, we got
  a game to play here. To escape from prison, but in Nikolai's way. Remember
  last time he knew he got duped by Fyodor, so his revenge is to make sure they
  die in half an hour and whoever escapes gets an antidote. Not like Nikolai
  wants to kill Dazai but don't you think this is familiar already? Deja vu
  even? Just that he is not that far bloke Ivan? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I can only imagine
  this is all but a fluke because I'm pretty sure in all of their infinite
  wisdom they are already planning to really escape and/or have preventions
  against the drug they are taking right now, but heck, what do I know I don't
  have 200 IQ. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... "wow". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, Dazai summarized it
  there for me already, what else is new. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What is new though, is
  probably the jokes that have successfully landed unlike that plane (lmao)
  because damn is Aya-chan carrying Bram out of his coffin the funniest thing we
  have seen so far. One might even say the coffin was designed to put her in it.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Author, don't second guess me) Then again, it's hard to get Bram
  going apparently... but he does have one desire that will. He just wants an
  classy oldie radio. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Please, Fukuchi can't even do HALF of this, he
  only knows of military radios. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So wait, did Bram just lost to an
  online subscription because Aya-chan introduced him to it? Oh boy, the devil
  himself is into capitalism too?? Really, what else is new. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As you can
  see, it's many laughs as long as Aya-chan is here by the way, and I can't wait
  to see what happens next. No really, just this part, I don't even care about
  the Agency and/or the guys in prison anymore haha
</div>
<div>
  [I didn't take until now to realize, but doesn't Fyodor and Dazai look
  surprisingly similar? Are they twins by chance? Haha sorry for the Aya-chan
  level of questions but <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>]

  Firstly, a garden pool special? Heck, this is all the swimsuit we are going to
  get, so be grateful, you virgins out there. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that includes you
  Kazuya, and you thought this is all, isn't it? How about some cream- I mean,
  sunscreen on the girl because you know she can't reach her back? Even Kazuya
  knows this can only happen in Anime and Manga haha fourth wall break by the
  way, but yeah, not going to stop Naobou from squealing so that's great.

    >I recorded it all already</a

  and then it just ended. All because we don't have enough of the sunscreen.
  Haha we're good,

    >"saved by the cream"</a

  okay that sounds wrong. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Should've brought a brand new bottle instead.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on haha see the marvel for yourself would you, it's probably
  costing a lot for the boi because remember they just burnt all their expenses
  on a trip to Madarao though within the movie budget, still costed a lot and
  this b*tch wants a date which costs more than that? Heck, we are doing hotel
  buffets in the evening too (it's not cheap by the way, paid for my family of 4
  for MY birthday too <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>) and THEN Ruka-chan still wants a birthday gift
  above all of this? B*TCH THIS WHOLE DAY IS THE GIFT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
  ABOUT- What she is talking about though, is that she probably wants more
  physical intimacy just like how those two are making out in the park under the
  starry sky lmao but she will never have the guts to do it anyways haha this
  kind of women can only exist in Anime lol, but not like Kazuya is going to do
  anything to her which to be frank just reiterates the point of them even being
  together in the first place, it's just win-win but we know the wins in this
  case are a little different. Kazuya wins just being a male virgin (lol) and
  Ruka-chan just wants to be pampered by someone she likes. See, the idea in
  this, girl, is to have someone who likes you pamper you, not the other way
  around. Think about it. Moving on haha, looks like we have some time for
  Sumi-chan but how did she see Chizuru going to the hospital to see her
  grandmother is not just a mystery, but she is kind of out of the circle apart
  from when she mentioned she was handing out flyers for the movie, was of
  course glad to hear that the movie was a success and
  <strike>Kazuya did the banging with Chizuru in Madarao</strike> Kazuya did all
  of this movie stuff and fulfilling the elders' promise all for her sake, just
  goes to show how much is already going on between them. Even when Chizuru
  started rambling about the behind the scenes of the movie and how much of it
  99% percent involved Kazuya instead of the rest of the staff lol... Yeah,
  Sayuri be like TMI already haha. All in all... "Goddamn" Haha same Kazuya but
  again why are you complaining- Your should've just bought a gift. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Despite all the Ruka-chan advances to Kazuya even calling him just by his name
  only (though Kazuya-chan will be funny lmao just ask Nasa-kun from
  "ToniKawa"), and Chizuru still denying her love for the dude and I don't
  really know where Sumi-chan is at this point... I'm just grateful that Kazuya
  is getting all the p*ssy and only saving like, Mami-chan for the rest of us.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Though I would argue that might be too quiet on her side so I can't
  wait for her to ruin everything for us or something. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> No? Then what's
  the point?? Haha we shall see guys, we shall see.

  [TL:DR; "(True love blossoms) when you're having a great time talking about
  them" Haha grandma Sayuri you are spot on alright]

  Oh, so Ishikawa is the guy Yanagi likes? Uh oh that's a problem for Yoshikawa
  haha ah wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode we know it's centered about Yanagi
  because look at the episode title (#HorimiyaPiece08), so in case you haven't
  got enough of Anime "SukiMega" or probably for the better if you haven't
  watched it at all, let us talk about what it means to lose your glasses. You
  want to ask what my degrees here is again? <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> Haha anyways, Ishikawa was
  trying to find his contacts since he dropped not only his glasses apparently,
  but also maybe because Yanagi himself has his own share of life problems, as
  we quickly found out. For starters, he's good at being late. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I gotta
  say though, bad excuse to not wake up considering you just flipped your alarm
  clock to notice the wrong time and THEN threw it on the ground on broad
  daylight? No wonder you thought your house was haunted when you see it on the
  ground as you reached home every evening. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, that should be
  the least of his issues despite the class teacher enforcing a late policy on
  him and he still got it on the last day lol, it's more about Yanagi being
  friends with everyone. Well, being the ikemen he is in everyone's minds enough
  for the student cohort to think he is, especially Sengoku because how dare you
  be more handsome than the student council chairperson lol, so let's briefly
  talk about everyone's relationship with him. Apparently according to him, his
  behaviour towards others easily shows how he sees people as friends, and
  that's kind of bothering Sengoku somehow considering he literally said it in
  front of him thus making Sengoku sad and all, but in the reverse he wonders if
  Yanagi only likes people who are... dumb? Hey, I don't want to use this word
  Ishikawa, I just didn't have better vocabulary to describe your girlfriend.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, it's probably not that soon as he will find out and I mean
  Sengoku, but maybe being himself is easier considering that being Ishikawa
  and/or Iura would be asking for suicide so I rather he be the disciplined
  fellow he is now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yanagi sure is having a great time in school
  though, seeing he might be in a different class than they do, still manages to
  hang out with them once in a while enough for some of them to call him by his
  first name Akane, and so on. He's liked with the girls too, though I swear the
  focus is on the guys here haha I sometimes question why I watch this series in
  the first place. Damn, if they put this up on the first three episodes of on
  the first season I might just skip this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all though, the jokes
  are better than everything else in here as usual, and not like Yanagi has a
  sad story to tell apart from him being some insomniac and/or has little to no
  discipline to manage himself haha you can ask Sengoku for advice I guess. But
  hey, who am I to judge? I wish someone will call me and/or send me weird texts
  to wake me up in the morning. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I wonder who next is on the chopping
  board haha hopefully not Iura I got enough of his nonsense lol not his sister
  though if Motoko wants to make an appearance again hehe<br />[TL:DR; "No one
  likes waiting in the cold all alone" Man, I wish

  Yeah, imaging having an instinct to fight back. Not me. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> In this new
  episode where in memory of- Oops you should not know of this let me erase it
  right now (#BLEACHTYBW20), we talk about Kenpachi and Yachiru's fight against
  the Sternritters. I got spoiled on not Twitter already but not like it will
  help considering I also know the original work. Good thing though, that is
  also "vanishing" from my mind so let's recap what actually happened here
  without comparing too much to the manga itself. So, the not V-power. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Okay maybe we shouldn't even talk about that, because this Sternritter doesn't
  have that in the first place. Well, they don't need it. If you have the power
  of vanishing in people's minds, you don't need a boost especially when you can
  just reset. But heck, Yachiru's instinct is that hard to follow, you don't
  even have to intro yourself and she already knows if you're friend or foe.
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sasuga" target="_blank">Sasuga</a> famous
  detective you're better than Edogawa Ranpo now lol, and that's just her in
  person which explains how she has the same killer feels as Zaraki himself. To
  add on, her sword effectively boosts on her instinct making sure she isn't one
  to trifle with. To explain this to you tech kids out there, Yachiru's
  zanpakuto is basically those smartphones that promise you the Top Shot feature
  (lol) where they take a video to cover a few frames before and after you hit
  the shutter: They then take the best estimation of the best hit and let you
  save it. Just here is a blade and the estimation is the sword's accuracy.
  You're welcome. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on haha I would argue she won this, but lost
  to the imagination of- Man this is confusing so let's just say that was all
  fake beforehand because this vanishing Sternritter is backed up by another one
  who, sorry to blow your mind again, they then created this one from their
  imagination. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'll let you take a break to think about it because the
  Anime didn't haha. Yeah, Yhwach is like "hey we're missing a couple of guys
  for the invasion to put them in alphabetical order just make a few more" and
  Gremmy is like "sure" and made this. And Lloyd. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah talking about
  the real real Sternritter now, Gremmy's power is basically what we want to
  live the rest of our lives as a kid. (Sorry, Kyoraku) (Haha) Imagine this,
  imagine that, it all becomes so simple. Even Askin knows people who can only
  imagine are also the most useless people in the world. Haha yeah he's totally
  a kid by the way, this Gremmy. Total virgin also, never imagined himself
  banging a chick. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, at least in battles I can already imagine he
  doesn't even fight people so prove me wrong, kid. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Then again, he did
  get convinced by the now Kenpachi (the real one, surprisingly with Unohana
  existing everyone else is not real Kenpachi haha I'm not trying to Gremmy you
  I promise) that competition is technically the way to prove one's power, so
  they took on Kenpachi's challenge and uh... you can see the results for
  yourself. I would argue it's just this kid hardly even knows anything because
  if Yhwach or ChatGPT had your power they would be invincible, but also that
  their focus is its limitation, so just like the stuff in "Bungou Stray Dogs",
  complication will make this hard to play efficiently. Kenpachi also no longer
  has a limitation of what he can't cut even if all you can do is imagine since
  he can always be stronger. That is partly thanks to him learning of his
  zanpakuto's power which he stole from a shinigami? That is still accurate,
  right? I can't imagine it not being right. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> ANYWAYS, it manifested
  into his way which is the biggest monstrosity we have seen in years as a
  cleaver to cut anything, and that's just the shikai, giving him the power to
  cut in half basically a planet coming into contact with a fictional world
  which I'm told are flat so you can't prove me wrong- They imagined it, ask
  Kubo-sensei if I'm right. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay I'm tired of this already lol, but the
  turning point of this is when Gremmy imagined he was Kenpachi NOW. Remember
  last time Lloyd (the one who didn't impersonate Yhwach) tried to do that but
  still lost and that's because Kenpachi still isn't as strong as he is now, so
  this one failed mainly because their body couldn't keep up lol. Ironic, isn't
  it? That's all I want to say haha it's getting long so let's wrap up. All in
  all... still exciting though, to be frank. I never thought this adaptation
  will look this good especially when they had to bring in all the imagination
  elements using 3D of course, it all makes sense. But as with many episodes
  this season alone, a lot of them feel rushed, and I don't quite feel Gremmy
  wanting to fight Kenpachi and stuff, let alone the implications of Gremmy
  being released in the first place, because in the original they are regarded
  as also a monster just because. Well I guess more emphasis on the winning side
  <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> who cares about the Sternritter after this episode haha, but I feel
  like it can use more justification even if it's non-physical in nature, like
  with As Nodt on the fear element. But well, not like the original work did any
  better in imagining this, so welp. Moving on though haha I'm tired of
  imagining stuff now I'm glad I'm done with this week's posts lmao I can
  imagine my jokes are terrible already <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, looks like we're moving on to
  the rest of Bambi-chan's friends HELL YEAH FEMINISM haha see you then

  [TL:DR; "Because I'm Kenpachi" Man, this term has such a long story of lore

  in battle. Remember? Remember when he fought against Ichigo so hard, and even
  against like, Nnoitra? This one didn't even shout when he tried to cut an

  which isn't too bad in my opinion they do share certain similarities, and I
  picked up a couple of songs along the way some of which are produced by the
  latter band.<br />

  due next month, at least you can listen to the short ones on YouTube to get an
  idea if you care about this 20 year old now duo going forward. I may have to
  reconsider some of these artists soon already, not gonna lie.<br />
  <br />So for next week, thanks to the slew of releases because music companies
  don't know how to spread these out lol, here are all the new stuff that will
  be out when I go through them upcoming Wednesday. Note to self to review this
  in order, we have *takes in deep breath* <b>nasuo's new single</b> for Anime
  "Shinigami Bocchan" and it's going to be quick give because it's likely I have
  to give this single track release a Review <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span> haha it's not that great
  imo, <b>Amber's new single</b> which should be exciting to listen to as I'm
  fascinated by the title song for Anime "KanoKari" which has since subsided a
  bit, <b>LUCKLIFE's new single</b> for Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" in which if I
  give the B-side it'll join the ranks on my shelf,
  <b>halca's new single</b> for Anime "KanoKari" too which has TWO B-sides they
  are very brave for doing that to be honest and I don't even like the girl, and
  <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new single</b> if I'm bored since I'm not that
  impressed by the topic song for Anime.&nbsp;I need to take work leave haha
  maybe then I'll touch on <b>nano.RIPE's new mini-album</b> because damn it has
  two editions and one's for Anime and I'm still confused if anything inside
  there isn't a cover song. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>

  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  And... the week's over. Welp. I missed my naps this weekend. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well,
  next week will be better, me, if you want to take the Friday off like you
  intended to apply and get approved tomorrow. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See, everything comes
  from initiation. And mine on my life will start... maybe not this month haha
  people pride on watching Running Man on lunch hours I pride myself on writing
  on this blog. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let's never talk about retrospect in this place
  already, ok? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you guys next time then, and until then... man, I
  want Koga Aoi so bad you don't even know HAHA it's her birthday next week
  though oh you bet I remember her birthday gift. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Really, see you
  then.
