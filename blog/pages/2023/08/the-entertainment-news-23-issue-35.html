They won't even know what hit them haha<div><br></div><div>Anyways, welcome back if you have been tricked into reading my posts every day since Thursday. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yes, it was intentional, I did it for the audience retention bullsh*t that's popular in capitalism now even though my audience is as many as non-existent lmao, but hey, at least I don't have to rush stuff every day, alright? I need time to do other things too like read up on the newest Comiket <a href=https://jisho.org/search/doujinshi target=_blank>doujinshi</a>-</div><div><br></div><div>Anime and music once again! Oh someone took a break though I legit just forgot so hey, always good news to me I'm already burning Saturdays to watch shows every week I could do with less<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TonikawaJK04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Tonikaku Kawaii: Joshikou-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"The first impression I got from her is that she was a sorcerer" lol Sakura Ayane is one with magic not gonna lie <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div></blockquote>Yeah okay <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/189413/Kaguya_Gekkou target=_blank>Kaguya</a> why are you the same as that <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/136359/Kaguya_Shinomiya target=_blank>Kaguya</a> who is way more popular than you in Anime. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this final episode of a short series I didn't expect to get after what is two seasons of animation without a conclusion (#TonikawaJK04), well not like this one concluded anyways lmao so yeah, let's talk about what happened though. Firstly, we talk about Kaguya. Not the one in that other Anime you might have known, no, but this one bears similar features. She is too smart for her own good, somewhat pampered of a princess even her family does not want to take care of her, and she has pink hair. Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh yes this one has, along with a bunch of friends to take care of her, some other things Shinomiya didn't have. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, very weird to be talking about her when we saw whatever that flashback was in the previous episode like Kaguya here is going to abduct Tsukasa or something, still won't make you think otherwise because well, she can hardly take care of herself let alone take care of what might be a historical figure? Damn, there is story in here but I have no idea what that is. Guess I'm just not smart enough for the lore. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What I am smart enough to know though, is all the other girls including the girls from Nasa-kun's class talking about how Tsukasa did not confess her feelings enough to the husband. Always showered with affection and praises, they think that this woman is enjoying the time of her life but forgetting to give back. I mean, is that imbalance though? Maybe Tsukasa NOT saying she loves him and/or show off whatever underwear she is wearing might be a good idea for Nasa-kun considering he won't be able to hold himself back- Why am I being so conservative here? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, that embarrassment coming in from Tsukasa is great just stack them with a couple of buns and serve it to me- Oh, she doesn't have any. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> All in all... is that how they chose to conclude this, with some weird dream?? Well, it's definitely better than season two to say the least. Haha I hope you didn't miss this after you watch that, by the way, or you might be missing on stuff. But all to say though, I really thought Kaguya would have something to do with this lore but turns out my dream from two days ago had more lore than this (lmao), and we are hinted that Nasa-kun is some emperor from a long time ago? Past life maybe, but if that is real... he is also a cheater, literally. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, I'm just glad this is all over haha, because damn, if there isn't any more lore drop this is just a married life slice-of-life. Heck, we had to bring in a class of high schoolers in order to make this interesting- Do you even remember how bummed I was last season already? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All's well ends well, I guess, until they reveal Tsukasa's real identity and what all this means for all them.<div> [TL:DR; "One should avoid things they cannot understand" I think I'm already closer to being a genius lol or maybe I already am I can relate "I just want to understand the world" See?]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEij13ix25sVz_zpMqFesuHGC7IzFk6R6jASIxpqpvZrtBLHETUH-7gPS1LUmrFEaFaNcKT5WQMDujBJziSoZ00tnB4dHv6qMN1SzAuF55oG4138xynx2mGUlF1DSXOwRom8oJbmSguGuFhljSL9BrBo12YzI74mDRQzDlll9RhTbAnitcuJmwxyOXXuBzs/s320/tonikawaJK04_arise.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>My reaction to &lt;insert voice actress here> releasing a swimsuit photobook lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF20qKMIXapve5Mj3xRGOwdFZBQh7sAZ7IYErNzRUonVFUiob_G1R4Va1xdQWUIxc1Zs6gHjjo5bF-PODj4HdibDeFEcU4Kw9z0gw4F2p6OQJrK0pL2IcwNeXD-amovT1dwhd_vDcAVg3bTYbBdE3y46qHO0_TktU4cpPc33t748JOoDwUDPGNSWLeTsc/s1600/tonikawaJK04_lovestruck.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Basically how idolism works in a nutshell haha</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Women be like <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>P.P.S. "When you start thinking of a confession, you have already lost?" Hey Kaname we are going to get sued if you keep this pace up because <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen target=_blank>wrong Anime</a>, girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SukiMega08><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Suki na Ko ga Megane wo Wasureta</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I forgot my home keys. I'm waiting for my mom to come home." Wow been there done that lol just that I don't hang out by the playground</div></blockquote>FEET FOR FREE?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh come on Mie-san, Komura can hear the undressing and is already nose bleeding. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I can only make jokes of and this is not a joke (#SukiMega08), I guess we can continue on this fandom ride, eh? I speak from experience. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Firstly, damn the rain is still brighter than my future lol, we see more of... I don't know it's just good haha speaking like an idolism right now, but that's the whole shtick of this, right? Komura just salivating at the wrong stuff. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Just don't tell anyone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> From pushing her instead of the chains on the swing (lmao) to seeing her in swimsuit in the pool in class, to her picking up his microtransaction card haha, it just seems like Komura has a lot of things he can't tell anyone. But on the other hand, Mie-san tells him everything and treating him like a true friend. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Just a friend, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Often by mistake even I would argue, as he got a late night call of the girl going to the bathroom at a sleepover at someone's house. So yeah, assumption that it's dark, you don't know the way, and there's horror stories before this? Okay, maybe not the last part but the girl's definitely feeling scared. Komura got to cheer her up now that he got on the wrong side of this phone call (dammit why the school song we have at least 2 songs you can sing) apparently with some ASMR because the mom's awake he cannot let her know they are couple-talking lmao, and I like how that triggered something in Mie-san. Yeah, new fetish discovered for Mie-san, congrats. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So good, she had to return the favour, and I'm still darned how that didn't draw the mother's attention lol. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> I know this feeling Komura, that we can talk to the girl we like till morning. Mine? I think only lasted about half an hour. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> That's also the only call with someone I like in my life. Sadded. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't want to talk about how Komura is licking the winning ice cream stick lmao so last but not least which should be the topic of conversation, Komura accidentally stumbled into a confession while chasing a cat? Well, Mie-san did it too but she can't see it so that's going to be a problem. Oh, Mie-san is not interested in confessions? Yeah, keep it that way- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She is bound to stumble into it at some point probably at the worst timing possible, so Komura had to... warn her? Haha we do this physical stuff all the time just without the confession, dude, this is normal. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I don't know who won, but someone other than the ice cream stick won. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Interesting they put the "confession" at the end, really brings in the feels that Azuma is the popular guy in class. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, take notes, people, the girl that likes him has pointers- She totally rehearsed on that. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, somewhat better episode than last week's, I'm still in for the jokes, obviously the pace is slow since slice-of-life romance, but it's still good. I also need to not sink in on the negativity on the Internet too that's kinda affecting me too. Moving on it's only Episode 9 and we're groping and making her sad??

He's such a chad. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I can't believe I'm saying this, but hear me out. Who cares about the Little Red Riding Hood brat haha, let's talk about the actual story. I know we have heard of it many times, so let's do a simple recap. If you have forgotten about this second son of the household lol I'm sorry Walter, it should be obvious that even in the family level, everyone is viewing Bocchan as a victim whilst Walter is just a replacement through and through, so he just inherits all the values that his brother is supposed to have which includes being nice to women we will get to that in a bit, but also, learning everything behind his footsteps to take over the household if Bocchan will not be able to soon enough. Probably also that's why the mom called upon the meeting back then, it's only in emergency of the dad's condition did the mother choose to make this decision. Yeah, real bad in his opinion but I would argue this is more of something in the 19th century, so in an effort to I assume make the family great again, Walter wants to find out about the curse on his brother. And so, as we have seen previous episode, he went to some shady merchants to find a way to enter the world, and he did it. Also in the Sabbath though under the red moon are of course the witches who had to attend, but also Bocchan and Alice specifically because Alice wanted to confirm what Daleth said was true, about reviving her mother. Which if true means she is likely doing this to ask her about the things her sister has done including, and yes I won't even mention at this point, what she has done to her face. But we know that one, the sister just hates her. Which also means we know of Walter, the brother hates him. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I just didn't know that they have to slot me in to be in the cast in order to convey this message. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, they gotta do it someday, didn't know I was a short and small, unmannered kid-like witch who likes to play hide-and-seek. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, illegally because there aren't rules in the magical world so they stole Alice's pendant (with the mom Sharon's photo) and challenged Walter in the game he is best at mostly playing with the brother *ack* haha but turns out, and I really did not even realize even with the 3D graphics, that there are two of them, which is why they can be this fast in running away. (Just a side note, both voiced by the same guy we all know him Fukuyama Jun, impressive) Smart guy Walter strikes again, but also because he knew that the older brother was instructing him to follow what he says, and that's just lame even in Walter's eyes. Literally to prep us for that, Walter then dropped down (lol) on Daleth saying she's ugly looking at the mirror in the church, he did the most gentlemanly thing by encouraging her to face herself and do what he does: Be better than being the shadow of your older sibling. Well in Daleth's case probably twins but it's similar. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... I didn't expect to be watching an Anime featuring an embarrassed voice acting from <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Youko_Hikasa target=_blank>Hikasa Youko</a> in the year 2023. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sorry if that will take knowing of my Anime watching history to understand this, but heck, just ask Walter why and you'll get it. And what a build-up too! <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Excuse me while I wipe off my tears, because damn this is quite a progress on a tale we have all but ignored from Walter this far, for this to make sense to everyone. Heck, if you were here for romance I think they have to apologize, this is an emotional one end to end. Still doesn't deny the fact that they are still in the witches' world illegally though, so we shall see their fate next time. Damn, my body is rejecting Daleth but they've convinced me to accept her I can't even</div><div>[TL:DR; "My face is ugly and scarred! A handsome man like you will never understand!"

He just broke in earlier just now? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#BungouStrayDogs57) where I guess pitting wits against your enemy is making the 5th choice a selection lol Sigma, let's talk about how simple the prison break is now. Well, apparently not simple. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You know, smart people pitting against each other sounds like a simpler task though, because besides Nikolai telling them all the lore they need to know to escape where they are now, he also provided them with one tool out of the 4 shown on a tray to aid their escape. Sounds too fake to be true, which is why Fyodor did not bother to make a wise choice, but Dazai did, he chose Sigma. Turns out, it's because Dazai might have figured out that Fyodor would be able to get help from outside already which makes sense, the vampire pandemic is going on as we speak, so someone with enough sanity or is undead but still alive(?) with some Ability will be able to help him out. Turns out, it's Chuuya. Good choice because I assume from being a strong ally to Fyodor, it's also easier for Dazai to play with haha, so this will be an interesting fight. Oh, Sigma is useless by the way, forgot to mention that haha. Anyhow, we know it's 2v2 from there on already, so let's move back to the airport. Looks like Ranpo-san might have figured out what happened and what's why we don't know anything else about Fukuchi's plan and his next instruction to his remaining (lol) Hunting Dogs, so at least we now know that the Agency is playing a different game now that the game has been changed singlehandedly by <strike>Ichimaru</strike> Jouno who got betrayed real bad. (Sorry for "BLEACH" joke again lol) Tetchou the sword guy found Kenji who was protecting Aya-chan and Bram from the vampire security who are already roaming the airport premises, and Teruko disguised herself as Aya-chan (that's an easy deduction because that voice wasn't <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/6634/Minako_Kotobuki target=_blank>Mina-chan</a> you can't fool me hehe I knew her everything for more than a decade even her being married-), but as much as Atsushi was baited into Teruko's disguise, Teruko was also baited into Atsushi's plan of showing her Tachihara's video, likely added in with recent talk so that the girl(?) won't think this is a fake, I hope not. She requests to talk to Ranpo-san though, not that it's a good idea, but not like she will start to believe in the terrorists right now, so we shall see. Meanwhile, we almost forgot that Hunting Dogs are like, drugged or even modified to be strong on all levels even without their Ability, so this is going well for the farmer in the airport. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> All in all, great episode, lots of fighting as this action series should be, dead pan jokes from Bram as usual lmao we also now know his powers can only be controlled by Fukuchi so we are just effectively disabling him for now even though it's too late, and I STILL cannot believe there is literally no fanservice whatsoever apart from <strike>Teruko</strike> Aya-chan right here just fuelling me on this still interesting plot. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, once the brain battles go on too long it gets stale on a bit but I'll sit through it. Oh I meant zombies because you know, brains. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'll see myself out just like Tachihara and Jouno did haha GOT THEM lol maybe we will find out what the Hunting Dogs intend to do now apart from knowing the situation from Ranpo's side.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi87mL73myvB6lW2CHKoONyLn_BGrbuwYfZYoNO3wu_VKISIYAiVC1ckBhbpebMDpbbjeUbmAxJvGm0o368usNxv9j4byJeOOss-rqOyobeGoNcn7HJSXR6fgFZ_h3pszK5IR2sQziB8r5zaI4z4jJh6MTdNpQckYbSWiOzU3VziSQSmyGzSZLWB26fHoI/s320/bungoustraydogs57_dazai2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me on Monday thinking of giving myself a break on Friday<br>(Haha hmm)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHlOvupU5f8DFyHd8-9wdXwhSWt66x8M-Fb1ih67xVlFB0CZ1XAc5mat4xeozmdFH4fpA58H-HX0bjYAUM03gl0JxZfHDl5q2mPibxl9mQsGfRo9blITbGa0HnguLyzx0GI_Z6cUqF7cnKDPY4nrVr_TyWZLTCj6l8vAN804h-E7zOreEwyasK-TYDyqc/s320/bungoustraydogs57_piggyback.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If I showed this to anyone else they won't believe this is an action series lol</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha so let's. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We are technically introduced to two new teachers this episode alone, Terajima who sits beside Yasuda in the faculty room and I wonder for her safety until you realize she is sharper than any sword on this planet lol, already knew this male teacher with a wrong nerve, which is probably also why she didn't confront him as he gets played around by high school girls while he's sleeping. Yes, in the faculty room, what of it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, we are also introduced to Nakamine-sensei which if you even remember his name and/or face you would have better memory than he has, is a hoarder of keys in his lab coat which makes me wonder why he doesn't think his coat is getting heavier every day or if he ever maintains it, would still be having holes in them so students can help pick up after him and never return to him just because? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> This school's security must be really safe or must have nothing to defend against. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yoshikawa was kind enough to help him mend his lab coat pocket though for the sake of the school, but for the sake of her boyfriend Ishikawa she either does less ie. here's the kit do it yourself, or just let him watch as the teacher-student magic unfolds in front of their eyes. Wait, their? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yasuda is outside of the home econs room sh*tting on Ishikawa though, like as if Yoshikawa doesn't love him or whatsoever- Hey Sakura-chan you hear that?? You got chance now- Ah. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Anyways, small things that make the jokes happen so don't think too much into that, but among other things the students are doing kinda illegally like bringing a whole cake to school but only have the science prep room fridges to put them in lmao, we also found out more about the teachers, like how it'll be funny of Yasuda here to get a normal girlfriend <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> like maybe Terajima <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> even though he's like knuckles deep into <a href=https://jisho.org/search/JK target=_blank>JK</a>- Can I even say that? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or that he's single, yeah that. Or even fear that Nakamine of all people will marry first before he does. Well don't worry sir, going by Nakamine standards he would have also forgot who to marry in the first place. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... RIP Yasuda. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well for one day after the lecturing from Terajima-sensei, but that's just all in a day's work for them, yes? Just removing logic from all states of matter because does this school even have standards in the first place though?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> That's how they make the jokes I guess, as I giggle about the actual victim of Hori and Sengoku being in a locked student council room.

The girls here won't even talk to me- In this new episode where you know we have to slot in a female empowerment episode (#BLEACHTYBW21), damn I really did not expect to get this much out of the Strenritter ladies but hey, we gotta do something about this, right? It's just dudes against dudes so far (yes and I count Bambi-chan as one too lmao) so I'm just glad this episode exists. From the Glutton that is <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki target=_blank>Yuuki Aoi</a> she can just eat me up for supper haha, to Gizelle showering me with her blood I will gladly be her slave lol, to how much <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/26063/Reina_Ueda target=_blank>Ueda Reina</a> punches me is how much she loves me I'll be her punching bag any time of the day, to the goddess of anger <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11784/Yumi_Uchiyama target=_blank>Uchiyama Yumi</a> lmao, each has their own character and power it's great to see them in action. Unfortunately as <strike>Aoi-chan</strike> <strike>Loli</strike> Lilotto (haha) has mentioned it's above their Daten ie. bestowed power by Yhwach and we will elaborate on that soon enough it's also the thing why those two had to be executed in order to restore their powers back to the son of the Quincy King by the way, so they can't really do much besides only stop Kenpachi on his bare legs (hehe) but they kind of did bully someone who just went through literal hell playing with imagination lol so yay one win for the women I guess. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then Ichigo came back from upstairs and nothing matters anymore. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As he and Kenpachi are that *special* in this war, they won't let him go that easily, and we are technically referring to not the rest of the shinigami who are still alive and kicking haha especially those who have came down from above earlier on. What IS different about Ichigo coming down though, as briefly mentioned by Yhwach and not Ichigo somehow, as Mayuri mentioned there will be a timeout to allow the Quincies to go up to the Squad Zero quarters which is just a matter of calculated time. So yeah, Ichigo just chose the wrong time to come down and help. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> If he came down when Yhwach was asleep that wouldn't have mattered. *taps brain* It's all within the Almighty predictions, dude. Okay oaky spoiler alert way too fast I told you I read the original work and that many years ago already, but what confronted Ichigo as he tried to stop them wasn't the lord himself, but his own buddy(?) Ishida Uryu. Yeah, remember that other main guy in this series? Haha yeah also Inoue and Sado, they got back in time to help Ichigo from Hueco Mundo it seems. (Also means Urahara is back along with [REDACTED] so that's exciting hehe) Not like Ishida is going to give Ichigo any explanation of him changing sides technically he didn't change sides he was still walking inside the area under his allegiance and race, but of course in typical Ichigo fashion he REFUSES to believe that is the case, and thinks he's likely manipulated or something. Yeah manipulated by history books I guess, Ichigo did you not read about the 2000-year old history between the two main forces of soul powers in this <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>alternate world</a>? *ack* Haha please spare me from the explanations that will appear in due time. All in all... didn't know I was in this Anime and am controlled by <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11184/Nao_Touyama target=_blank>Touyama Nao</a> as a cute skeleton, how lucky of me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'm only going to remember this week's episode for just the front half just because I love women and want to hear more of them before you know, like what Askin said, someone will get their power slashed and die lying down on the ground. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I hope it's me with any of them ladies though, I'll take Bambi-chan lying down on the ground too. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Great episode for plot development and as I said I forgot what comes after what (and how protecting Kenpachi was a thing lol), great soundtrack if you forget the iconic track "Only One" which apparently got remastered again, and are we ending the season with the Royal Palace takeover? We might though in another month also we are ending with an hour special episode, so let's see where this leads us, yes? But for now it's UP UP AND- Uh oh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "So... will I be chosen?" Haha Askin everyone is also asking the same question, dude.

style=font-size:large>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hmm this week's releases... where shall I start? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, let's talk about those that did not matter first because damn did <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B3%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BB%E3%82%AB%E3%82%A4-ep/1701375760?l=en-US" target=_blank>ClariS' new single</a></b> not matter to me at all despite me saying something in their songs may catch my attention but I'm just bored of their usual style so I'm giving them up for now. Moving on haha, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kiseki-ep/1701082401?l=en-US" target=_blank>LUCK LIFE's new single</a></b> almost got on the shelf if not for a poor B-side which I don't even want to give at all, did not stop me from thinking that would be a possibility since normally they release more than 2 tracks in their singles. Maybe next time guys, maybe next time- Is it because I didn't go to your live? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Don't ask me if I gave <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%98%9F%E5%B1%91%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A0-ep/1701548890?l=en-US" target=_blank>nasuo's new single</a></b> or not I definitely gave one of them that I knew the other I don't even care. Really, they are trying to sell me idolism, and I hate that. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyhow, not like <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%81%8B%E6%84%9B%E3%83%9F%E3%83%AA%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%AB%E3%83%A0-complete-edition/1701375839?l=en-US" target=_blank>halca's new single</a></b> isn't but surprisingly this is the first time I've given a B-side on her single for Anime so that's impressive already in my opinion. In contrast, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB-ep/1701375377?l=en-US" target=_blank>Amber's new single</a></b> is rather a disappointment so we shall not talk about anything other than the title song. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hikari-no-nai-machi-ep/1701117793?l=en-US" target=_blank>nano.RIPE's new EP</a></b> also did not catch my attention too much despite having a laundry list of songs in their release. And this week's MVP is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%87%E3%83%B3%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4-%E8%A7%A3%E4%BD%93%E6%96%B0%E7%AB%A0-ep/1701375324?l=en-US" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new single</a></b> because despite me showing little interest in the songs because of their off beats I still ended up giving them and even remembering throughout the week which I don't know how but heck, my mind takes priority so I'll give it the thumbs up. Not to be on the shelf though, just good job thumbs up. I didn't miss anyone, right? I hope I didn't haha<br><br> Wow, didn't realize we have this many news to catch up on, so maybe we should talk more about them. <a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1693541874743795968?s=20" target=_blank><b>miwa's song for Tamai Shiori</b></a> which I then found out it's for idol group Momoiro Clover Z's monthly new song release for each of their members as solo, and... it's not bad I hope someday miwa will be singing this so I can actually give this song. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I also found out that <b><a href="https://twitter.com/KroiOfficial/status/1692493298513137806?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi's new song is for Anime</a></b> and this might be their first since they joined major label a couple of years ago so that's rad, actually the song's even rad I might just give the Anime about ninjas. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Don't quote me on that I'll confirm that in a month on the Anime previews. If new songs don't catch your fancy, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/KroiOfficial/status/1690395355941355520?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi's recent live short</a></b> on not Twitter also sang one of their beloved songs haha at least for me. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1693548494739370072?s=20" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new single is for Anime again</a></b> no surprises there because that's what happens when you star in a 2-cour Anime series. Oh yes this is worth mentioning though it's not new song, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1693602374282309882?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL finally was awarded a Guiness World Record during their recent live</a></b> for being the Longest Standing Female Band with Original Members! Yes, that's a thing because bands themselves tend to lose members if you would recall <a href=../../2023/06/the-law-of-diminishing-band-members.html>my recent Klassic Note case study blog post</a> you're welcome for the link it's in this blog, and yes, these girls have been only breaking records since they started as high schoolers without much knowledge of music composition and production. Good for them, and in case you need a new song <a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1693643369413792089?s=20" target=_blank>their new song is released on music subscription services</a> so help yourself to a song that... in my opinion not breaking any records anytime soon. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lantis_staff/status/1693910892721922445?s=20" target=_blank>LUCK LIFE's new music video</a></b> is for their new song which their single released this week, and boy it is more sentimental than their best album last month somehow. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1694726261657018563?s=20" target=_blank>SPECIAL OTHERS' new song this month</a></b> for their monthly releases I don't know what to feel about it but it does feel good, so maybe I'll get around to it considering <a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1695753127025381857?s=20" target=_blank><b>SPECIAL OTHERS new album has been confirmed for October release</b></a> which is arriving in two months! Very excited for this even though it's not impressive thus far. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ironically to say this but, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/McDonaldsJapan/status/1694877250666078227?s=20" target=_blank>Homecomings' new song is for a fast food ad</a></b> and yes it's the big M so might as well eat a burger and wait for their new song to release someday haha. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie_staff/status/1694998059137343548?s=20" target=_blank>Takahashi Rie's new live video</a></b> is not for me but if you liked the song I'm sure you liked the music video too just like I did. Oh I also found out that apart from <b><a href="https://twitter.com/wodofficial7/status/1692507045625561201?s=20" target=_blank>w.o.d.'s new live video</a></b> is for the Anime "BLEACH" opening theme song, but also <a href="https://twitter.com/wodofficial7/status/1695445125336633433?s=20" target=_blank>its single is releasing in two weeks</a> and I have technically given all the songs in it already because I've watched a live video with them playing it back in June. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well! I have to give it then! Haha nice, already better than Kitani Tatsuya last year. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1695754335874162699?s=20" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's new song is releasing start of next month</a></b> which is quite a surprise drop so let's see if it's better than last time. There's also a lot going on <b>#YouTubeMusicWeekend</b> so do yourself a favour and find out more with the hashtag on YouTube because <a href="https://youtu.be/ons4dRYem7s?si=EO3tkM0ebEqf68DO" target=_blank>I just did for the rest of the night</a>. Last but not least, for their 8th anniversary live <b><a href="https://twitter.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1695738263691305321?s=20" target=_blank>Earphones' new album will release on Valentine's Day next year</a></b> which is a Wednesday apparently so I can't wait for more songs to release on that day so these vocal... music manipulating specialists if you have heard of them you'll know, will lose to them. Hopefully not, here's hoping that's not the case. <br><br> So next week, it's not as much as this week which is fine so I thank <b>GRANRODEO's new single</b> for Anime "Stray Dogs" and <b>Kamiyama You's new single</b> for "BLEACH" <span class=emoji title=🤮>*pukes*</span> for not making me as busy as this week, and also these are so much likely to be on my shelf if I accidentally give more than one song on <a href="https://twitter.com/ewe_jpn/status/1694704526354530366?s=20" target=_blank>any of them</a>. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Let's not say too soon I even know I have to buy singles two weeks from now already HAHA if this is the case though that'll be WILD even for Klassic Note alone <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> I'll try my best hehe no promises though<br><br><br><br><br> Uh oh, I think I ran out of good stuff to say, I see the sad stuff creeping onto me around the back already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again I'm still thinking of how much bandwidth I will need to give for potentially the next package of the largest batch of CDs for the year because apart from nasuo and w.o.d. now, I may have to give GRANRODEO, Kamiyama You, Omoinotake if I think the Anime Edition counts, up till Ikimonogakari's double A-side which releases in two weeks. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I just hope I don't have to give more than half of them. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, I am in such a mess treading into foreign territory right now in Klassic Note I don't even know what to do. Maybe I am staying too long in my comfort zone, huh, that my music library is reminding me of this fact. Yeah. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you next time then, and until next time... maybe I'll figure out my life direction by them haha this suddenly got dark lol I'm 30 by the way LMAO okay go away<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I will not explain too much in this Anisama weekend but suffice it to say I saw a lot of song titles that are weird including <a href="https://twitter.com/anisama/status/1695742088930005168?s=20" target=_blank>halca's new song with half the main cast of "KanoKari"</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/anisama/status/1695332790546698670?s=20" target=_blank>TrySail singing with angela a blended song</a> from each of their groups, and if you remember <a href="https://twitter.com/anisama/status/1695721646685044866?s=20" target=_blank>Oohishi Masayoshi singing with the main cast of "SukiMega"</a>... so many interesting stuff I won't get to see until earliest end of the year when they air video on demand on national TV. Until then, only can imagine how good they are I guess haha Japanese in forums say the tickets aren't selling well though!? Understandable, this is going to be a MusicRay'n fest in a couple more years lol</div></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
