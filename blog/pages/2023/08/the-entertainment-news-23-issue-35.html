  who is way more popular than you in Anime. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode of a
  short series I didn't expect to get after what is two seasons of animation
  without a conclusion (#TonikawaJK04), well not like this one concluded anyways
  lmao so yeah, let's talk about what happened though. Firstly, we talk about
  Kaguya. Not the one in that other Anime you might have known, no, but this one
  bears similar features. She is too smart for her own good, somewhat pampered
  of a princess even her family does not want to take care of her, and she has
  pink hair. Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh yes this one has, along with a bunch of
  friends to take care of her, some other things Shinomiya didn't have.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, very weird to be talking about her when we saw whatever that
  flashback was in the previous episode like Kaguya here is going to abduct
  Tsukasa or something, still won't make you think otherwise because well, she
  can hardly take care of herself let alone take care of what might be a
  historical figure? Damn, there is story in here but I have no idea what that
  is. Guess I'm just not smart enough for the lore. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What I am smart
  enough to know though, is all the other girls including the girls from
  Nasa-kun's class talking about how Tsukasa did not confess her feelings enough
  to the husband. Always showered with affection and praises, they think that
  this woman is enjoying the time of her life but forgetting to give back. I
  mean, is that imbalance though? Maybe Tsukasa NOT saying she loves him and/or
  show off whatever underwear she is wearing might be a good idea for Nasa-kun
  considering he won't be able to hold himself back- Why am I being so
  conservative here? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, that embarrassment coming in from Tsukasa is
  great just stack them with a couple of buns and serve it to me- Oh, she
  doesn't have any. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> All in all... is that how they chose to conclude
  this, with some weird dream?? Well, it's definitely better than season two to
  say the least. Haha I hope you didn't miss this after you watch that, by the
  way, or you might be missing on stuff. But all to say though, I really thought
  Kaguya would have something to do with this lore but turns out my dream from
  two days ago had more lore than this (lmao), and we are hinted that Nasa-kun
  is some emperor from a long time ago? Past life maybe, but if that is real...
  he is also a cheater, literally. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, I'm just glad this is all
  over haha, because damn, if there isn't any more lore drop this is just a
  married life slice-of-life. Heck, we had to bring in a class of high schoolers
  in order to make this interesting- Do you even remember how bummed I was last
  season already? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All's well ends well, I guess, until they reveal
  Tsukasa's real identity and what all this means for all them.
  <div>
    [TL:DR; "One should avoid things they cannot understand" I think I'm already
    closer to being a genius lol or maybe I already am I can relate "I just want
    to understand the world" See?]

      FEET FOR FREE?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh come on Mie-san, Komura can hear the
      undressing and is already nose bleeding. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
      where I can only make jokes of and this is not a joke (#SukiMega08), I
      guess we can continue on this fandom ride, eh? I speak from experience.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Firstly, damn the rain is still brighter than my future lol, we
      see more of... I don't know it's just good haha speaking like an idolism
      right now, but that's the whole shtick of this, right? Komura just
      salivating at the wrong stuff. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Just don't tell anyone. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      From pushing her instead of the chains on the swing (lmao) to seeing her
      in swimsuit in the pool in class, to her picking up his microtransaction
      card haha, it just seems like Komura has a lot of things he can't tell
      anyone. But on the other hand, Mie-san tells him everything and treating
      him like a true friend. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Just a friend, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Often by
      mistake even I would argue, as he got a late night call of the girl going
      to the bathroom at a sleepover at someone's house. So yeah, assumption
      that it's dark, you don't know the way, and there's horror stories before
      this? Okay, maybe not the last part but the girl's definitely feeling
      scared. Komura got to cheer her up now that he got on the wrong side of
      this phone call (dammit why the school song we have at least 2 songs you
      can sing) apparently with some ASMR because the mom's awake he cannot let
      her know they are couple-talking lmao, and I like how that triggered
      something in Mie-san. Yeah, new fetish discovered for Mie-san, congrats.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So good, she had to return the favour, and I'm still darned how
      that didn't draw the mother's attention lol. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I know this feeling
      Komura, that we can talk to the girl we like till morning. Mine? I think
      only lasted about half an hour. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That's also the only call with
      someone I like in my life. Sadded. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't want to talk about how
      Komura is licking the winning ice cream stick lmao so last but not least
      which should be the topic of conversation, Komura accidentally stumbled
      into a confession while chasing a cat? Well, Mie-san did it too but she
      can't see it so that's going to be a problem. Oh, Mie-san is not
      interested in confessions? Yeah, keep it that way- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She is
      bound to stumble into it at some point probably at the worst timing
      possible, so Komura had to... warn her? Haha we do this physical stuff all
      the time just without the confession, dude, this is normal. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All
      in all, I don't know who won, but someone other than the ice cream stick
      won. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Interesting they put the "confession" at the end, really
      brings in the feels that Azuma is the popular guy in class. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also,
      take notes, people, the girl that likes him has pointers- She totally
      rehearsed on that. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, somewhat better episode than last
      week's, I'm still in for the jokes, obviously the pace is slow since
      slice-of-life romance, but it's still good. I also need to not sink in on
      the negativity on the Internet too that's kinda affecting me too. Moving
      on it's only Episode 9 and we're groping and making her sad?? DUDE haha
      see you then.

      Hey, I hope it didn't occur to you that Walter very likely picked up on
      the SECOND girl in the family. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Uh oh I better run he has
      protection now lol in this new episode though (#ShinigamiBocchan19), it
      just occurred to me though, that this is kind of like the reverse of Zain
      and Cuff's relationship now, the guy's a human and the girl's going to
      kill me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay okay, let's talk Walter first. He's such a chad.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I can't believe I'm saying this, but hear me out. Who cares about
      the Little Red Riding Hood brat haha, let's talk about the actual story. I
      know we have heard of it many times, so let's do a simple recap. If you
      have forgotten about this second son of the household lol I'm sorry
      Walter, it should be obvious that even in the family level, everyone is
      viewing Bocchan as a victim whilst Walter is just a replacement through
      and through, so he just inherits all the values that his brother is
      supposed to have which includes being nice to women we will get to that in
      a bit, but also, learning everything behind his footsteps to take over the
      household if Bocchan will not be able to soon enough. Probably also that's
      why the mom called upon the meeting back then, it's only in emergency of
      the dad's condition did the mother choose to make this decision. Yeah,
      real bad in his opinion but I would argue this is more of something in the
      19th century, so in an effort to I assume make the family great again,
      Walter wants to find out about the curse on his brother. And so, as we
      have seen previous episode, he went to some shady merchants to find a way
      to enter the world, and he did it. Also in the Sabbath though under the
      red moon are of course the witches who had to attend, but also Bocchan and
      Alice specifically because Alice wanted to confirm what Daleth said was
      true, about reviving her mother. Which if true means she is likely doing
      this to ask her about the things her sister has done including, and yes I
      won't even mention at this point, what she has done to her face. But we
      know that one, the sister just hates her. Which also means we know of
      Walter, the brother hates him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I just didn't know that they have
      to slot me in to be in the cast in order to convey this message. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Hey, they gotta do it someday, didn't know I was a short and small,
      unmannered kid-like witch who likes to play hide-and-seek. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well,
      illegally because there aren't rules in the magical world so they stole
      Alice's pendant (with the mom Sharon's photo) and challenged Walter in the
      game he is best at mostly playing with the brother *ack* haha but turns
      out, and I really did not even realize even with the 3D graphics, that
      there are two of them, which is why they can be this fast in running away.
      (Just a side note, both voiced by the same guy we all know him Fukuyama
      Jun, impressive) Smart guy Walter strikes again, but also because he knew
      that the older brother was instructing him to follow what he says, and
      that's just lame even in Walter's eyes. Literally to prep us for that,
      Walter then dropped down (lol) on Daleth saying she's ugly looking at the
      mirror in the church, he did the most gentlemanly thing by encouraging her
      to face herself and do what he does: Be better than being the shadow of
      your older sibling. Well in Daleth's case probably twins but it's similar.
      <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... I didn't expect to be watching an Anime featuring
      an embarrassed voice acting from
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Youko_Hikasa" target="_blank"
        >Hikasa Youko</a
      >
      in the year 2023. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sorry if that will take knowing of my Anime
      watching history to understand this, but heck, just ask Walter why and
      you'll get it. And what a build-up too! <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Excuse me while I wipe off
      my tears, because damn this is quite a progress on a tale we have all but
      ignored from Walter this far, for this to make sense to everyone. Heck, if
      you were here for romance I think they have to apologize, this is an
      emotional one end to end. Still doesn't deny the fact that they are still
      in the witches' world illegally though, so we shall see their fate next
      time. Damn, my body is rejecting Daleth but they've convinced me to accept
      her I can't even
    </div>
    <div>
      [TL:DR; "My face is ugly and scarred! A handsome man like you will never
      understand!" Okay Daleth I think you just praised Walter haha]

      </blockquote>
      You know that Nikolai explaining all this of escaping the prison is
      useless, right? He just broke in earlier just now? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new
      episode though (#BungouStrayDogs57) where I guess pitting wits against
      your enemy is making the 5th choice a selection lol Sigma, let's talk
      about how simple the prison break is now. Well, apparently not simple.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You know, smart people pitting against each other sounds like a
      simpler task though, because besides Nikolai telling them all the lore
      they need to know to escape where they are now, he also provided them with
      one tool out of the 4 shown on a tray to aid their escape. Sounds too fake
      to be true, which is why Fyodor did not bother to make a wise choice, but
      Dazai did, he chose Sigma. Turns out, it's because Dazai might have
      figured out that Fyodor would be able to get help from outside already
      which makes sense, the vampire pandemic is going on as we speak, so
      someone with enough sanity or is undead but still alive(?) with some
      Ability will be able to help him out. Turns out, it's Chuuya. Good choice
      because I assume from being a strong ally to Fyodor, it's also easier for
      Dazai to play with haha, so this will be an interesting fight. Oh, Sigma
      is useless by the way, forgot to mention that haha. Anyhow, we know it's
      2v2 from there on already, so let's move back to the airport. Looks like
      Ranpo-san might have figured out what happened and what's why we don't
      know anything else about Fukuchi's plan and his next instruction to his
      remaining (lol) Hunting Dogs, so at least we now know that the Agency is
      playing a different game now that the game has been changed singlehandedly
      by
      <strike>Ichimaru</strike> Jouno who got betrayed real bad. (Sorry for
      "BLEACH" joke again lol) Tetchou the sword guy found Kenji who was
      protecting Aya-chan and Bram from the vampire security who are already
      roaming the airport premises, and Teruko disguised herself as Aya-chan
      (that's an easy deduction because that voice wasn't

        href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6634/Minako_Kotobuki"
        target="_blank"
        >Mina-chan</a
      >
      you can't fool me hehe I knew her everything for more than a decade even
      her being married-), but as much as Atsushi was baited into Teruko's
      disguise, Teruko was also baited into Atsushi's plan of showing her
      Tachihara's video, likely added in with recent talk so that the girl(?)
      won't think this is a fake, I hope not. She requests to talk to Ranpo-san
      though, not that it's a good idea, but not like she will start to believe
      in the terrorists right now, so we shall see. Meanwhile, we almost forgot
      that Hunting Dogs are like, drugged or even modified to be strong on all
      levels even without their Ability, so this is going well for the farmer in
      the airport. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> All in all, great episode, lots of fighting as this
      action series should be, dead pan jokes from Bram as usual lmao we also
      now know his powers can only be controlled by Fukuchi so we are just
      effectively disabling him for now even though it's too late, and I STILL
      cannot believe there is literally no fanservice whatsoever apart from
      <strike>Teruko</strike> Aya-chan right here just fuelling me on this still
      interesting plot. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean, once the brain battles go on too long
      it gets stale on a bit but I'll sit through it. Oh I meant zombies because
      you know, brains. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'll see myself out just like Tachihara and
      Jouno did haha GOT THEM lol maybe we will find out what the Hunting Dogs
      intend to do now apart from knowing the situation from Ranpo's side.

      finally we have some time to talk about this boring a** of a teacher lol
      (#HorimiyaPiece09), well at least we got more idiots to join this pervert
      amirite fellas?? Haha so let's. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We are technically introduced to
      two new teachers this episode alone, Terajima who sits beside Yasuda in
      the faculty room and I wonder for her safety until you realize she is
      sharper than any sword on this planet lol, already knew this male teacher
      with a wrong nerve, which is probably also why she didn't confront him as
      he gets played around by high school girls while he's sleeping. Yes, in
      the faculty room, what of it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, we are also introduced
      to Nakamine-sensei which if you even remember his name and/or face you
      would have better memory than he has, is a hoarder of keys in his lab coat
      which makes me wonder why he doesn't think his coat is getting heavier
      every day or if he ever maintains it, would still be having holes in them
      so students can help pick up after him and never return to him just
      because? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> This school's security must be really safe or must have
      nothing to defend against. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yoshikawa was kind enough to help him
      mend his lab coat pocket though for the sake of the school, but for the
      sake of her boyfriend Ishikawa she either does less ie. here's the kit do
      it yourself, or just let him watch as the teacher-student magic unfolds in
      front of their eyes. Wait, their? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yasuda is outside of the home
      econs room sh*tting on Ishikawa though, like as if Yoshikawa doesn't love
      him or whatsoever- Hey&nbsp;Sakura-chan you hear that?? You got chance
      now- Ah. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Anyways, small things that make the jokes happen so don't
      think too much into that, but among other things the students are doing
      kinda illegally like bringing a whole cake to school but only have the
      science prep room fridges to put them in lmao, we also found out more
      about the teachers, like how it'll be funny of Yasuda here to get a normal
      girlfriend <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> like maybe Terajima <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> even though he's like
      knuckles deep into
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/JK" target="_blank">JK</a>- Can I even
      say that? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or that he's single, yeah that. Or even fear that
      Nakamine of all people will marry first before he does. Well don't worry
      sir, going by Nakamine standards he would have also forgot who to marry in
      the first place. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... RIP Yasuda. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well for one
      day after the lecturing from Terajima-sensei, but that's just all in a
      day's work for them, yes? Just removing logic from all states of matter
      because does this school even have standards in the first place though??
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That's how they make the jokes I guess, as I giggle about the
      actual victim of Hori and Sengoku being in a locked student council room.
      Still, we are near the end please let this end I can only laugh for this
      long lmao see you next time then

      Hey, if I none on to a world of Quincies I'll get hot chicks though!! The
      girls here won't even talk to me- In this new episode where you know we
      have to slot in a female empowerment episode (#BLEACHTYBW21), damn I
      really did not expect to get this much out of the Strenritter ladies but
      hey, we gotta do something about this, right? It's just dudes against
      dudes so far (yes and I count Bambi-chan as one too lmao) so I'm just glad
      this episode exists. From the Glutton that is

      lmao, each has their own character and power it's great to see them in
      action. Unfortunately as <strike>Aoi-chan</strike>&nbsp;<strike
        >Loli</strike
      >
      Lilotto (haha) has mentioned it's above their Daten ie. bestowed power by
      Yhwach and we will elaborate on that soon enough it's also the thing why
      those two had to be executed in order to restore their powers back to the
      son of the Quincy King by the way, so they can't really do much besides
      only stop Kenpachi on his bare legs (hehe) but they kind of did bully
      someone who just went through literal hell playing with imagination lol so
      yay one win for the women I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then Ichigo came back from
      upstairs and nothing matters anymore. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As he and Kenpachi are that
      *special* in this war, they won't let him go that easily, and we are
      technically referring to not the rest of the shinigami who are still alive
      and kicking haha especially those who have came down from above earlier
      on. What IS different about Ichigo coming down though, as briefly
      mentioned by Yhwach and not Ichigo somehow, as Mayuri mentioned there will
      be a timeout to allow the Quincies to go up to the Squad Zero quarters
      which is just a matter of calculated time. So yeah, Ichigo just chose the
      wrong time to come down and help. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If he came down when Yhwach was
      asleep that wouldn't have mattered. *taps brain* It's all within the
      Almighty predictions, dude. Okay oaky spoiler alert way too fast I told
      you I read the original work and that many years ago already, but what
      confronted Ichigo as he tried to stop them wasn't the lord himself, but
      his own buddy(?) Ishida Uryu. Yeah, remember that other main guy in this
      series? Haha yeah also Inoue and Sado, they got back in time to help
      Ichigo from Hueco Mundo it seems. (Also means Urahara is back along with
      [REDACTED] so that's exciting hehe) Not like Ishida is going to give
      Ichigo any explanation of him changing sides technically he didn't change
      sides he was still walking inside the area under his allegiance and race,
      but of course in typical Ichigo fashion he REFUSES to believe that is the
      case, and thinks he's likely manipulated or something. Yeah manipulated by
      history books I guess, Ichigo did you not read about the 2000-year old
      history between the two main forces of soul powers in this
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank"
        >alternate world</a
      >? *ack* Haha please spare me from the explanations that will appear in
      due time. All in all... didn't know I was in this Anime and am controlled
      by
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11184/Nao_Touyama" target="_blank"
        >Touyama Nao</a
      >&nbsp;as a cute skeleton, how lucky of me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm only going to
      remember this week's episode for just the front half just because I love
      women and want to hear more of them before you know, like what Askin said,
      someone will get their power slashed and die lying down on the ground.
      <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I hope it's me with any of them ladies though, I'll take
      Bambi-chan lying down on the ground too. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Great episode for plot
      development and as I said I forgot what comes after what (and how
      protecting Kenpachi was a thing lol), great soundtrack if you forget the
      iconic track "Only One" which apparently got remastered again, and are we
      ending the season with the Royal Palace takeover? We might though in
      another month also we are ending with an hour special episode, so let's
      see where this leads us, yes? But for now it's UP UP AND- Uh oh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      [TL:DR; "So... will I be chosen?" Haha Askin everyone is also asking the
      same question, dude. Also if I'm God I'll only choose the ladies to stay
      because those old men can die-]

      not matter to me at all despite me saying something in their songs may
      catch my attention but I'm just bored of their usual style so I'm giving
      them up for now. Moving on haha,

      almost got on the shelf if not for a poor B-side which I don't even want
      to give at all, did not stop me from thinking that would be a possibility
      since normally they release more than 2 tracks in their singles. Maybe
      next time guys, maybe next time- Is it because I didn't go to your live?

      or not I definitely gave one of them that I knew the other I don't even
      care. Really, they are trying to sell me idolism, and I hate that.

      isn't but surprisingly this is the first time I've given a B-side on her
      single for Anime so that's impressive already in my opinion. In contrast,

      also did not catch my attention too much despite having a laundry list of
      songs in their release. And this week's MVP is

      because despite me showing little interest in the songs because of their
      off beats I still ended up giving them and even remembering throughout the
      week which I don't know how but heck, my mind takes priority so I'll give
      it the thumbs up. Not to be on the shelf though, just good job thumbs up.
      I didn't miss anyone, right? I hope I didn't haha<br />
      <br />
      Wow, didn't realize we have this many news to catch up on, so maybe we
      should talk more about them.

      which I then found out it's for idol group Momoiro Clover Z's monthly new
      song release for each of their members as solo, and... it's not bad I hope
      someday miwa will be singing this so I can actually give this song.

      and this might be their first since they joined major label a couple of
      years ago so that's rad, actually the song's even rad I might just give
      the Anime about ninjas. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Don't quote me on that I'll confirm that
      in a month on the Anime previews. If new songs don't catch your fancy,

      no surprises there because that's what happens when you star in a 2-cour
      Anime series. Oh yes this is worth mentioning though it's not new song,

      you're welcome for the link it's in this blog, and yes, these girls have
      been only breaking records since they started as high schoolers without
      much knowledge of music composition and production. Good for them, and in
      case you need a new song

      for their monthly releases I don't know what to feel about it but it does
      feel good, so maybe I'll get around to it considering

      >&nbsp;which is&nbsp;arriving in two months! Very excited for this even
      though it's not impressive thus far. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Ironically to say this

      new song to release someday haha.

      is not for me but if you liked the song I'm sure you liked the music video
      too just like I did. Oh I also found out that apart from

      and I have technically given all the songs in it already because I've
      watched a live video with them playing it back in June. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Well! I
      have to give it then! Haha nice, already better than Kitani Tatsuya last
      year. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

      which is quite a surprise drop so let's see if it's better than last time.
      There's also a lot going on <b>#YouTubeMusicWeekend</b> so do yourself a
      favour and find out more with the hashtag on YouTube because

      which is a Wednesday apparently so I can't wait for more songs to release
      on that day so these vocal... music manipulating specialists if you have
      heard of them you'll know, will lose to them. Hopefully not, here's hoping
      that's not the case.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      So next week, it's not as much as this week which is fine so I thank
      <b>GRANRODEO's new single</b> for Anime "Stray Dogs" and
      <b>Kamiyama You's new single</b> for "BLEACH" <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span> for not making me as
      busy as this week, and also these are so much likely to be on my shelf if
      I accidentally give more than one song on
      <a
        href="https://twitter.com/ewe_jpn/status/1694704526354530366?s=20"
        target="_blank"
        >any of them</a
      >. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let's not say too soon I even know I have to buy singles two
      weeks from now already HAHA if this is the case though that'll be WILD
      even for Klassic Note alone <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> I'll try my best hehe no promises
      though<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Uh oh, I think I ran out of good stuff to say, I see the sad stuff
      creeping onto me around the back already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again I'm still
      thinking of how much bandwidth I will need to give for potentially the
      next package of the largest batch of CDs for the year because apart from
      nasuo and w.o.d. now, I may have to give GRANRODEO, Kamiyama You,
      Omoinotake if I think the Anime Edition counts, up till Ikimonogakari's
      double A-side which releases in two weeks. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I just hope I don't
      have to give more than half of them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, I am in such a mess
      treading into foreign territory right now in Klassic Note I don't even
      know what to do. Maybe I am staying too long in my comfort zone, huh, that
      my music library is reminding me of this fact. Yeah. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you
      next time then, and until next time... maybe I'll figure out my life
      direction by them haha this suddenly got dark lol I'm 30 by the way LMAO
      okay go away<br />

      P.S. I will not explain too much in this Anisama weekend but suffice it to
      say I saw a lot of song titles that are weird including

        >Oohishi Masayoshi singing with the main cast of "SukiMega"</a
      >... so many interesting stuff I won't get to see until earliest end of
      the year when they air video on demand on national TV. Until then, only
      can imagine how good they are I guess haha Japanese in forums say the
      tickets aren't selling well though!? Understandable, this is going to be a
      MusicRay'n fest in a couple more years lol
