Well this might be much of a week to you but it is to me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Behind the
scenes stories for a bit because why not, I think I may have an idea of how to
deal with the upcoming packages in terms of timing, because just Friday I
received shipping notifications for some of them items I have no idea when they
ship, so they may be aligned with those Akarin bromides which has been sitting
there for almost 2 weeks now, so that's good. If I screw this up though I will
end up doing 3 packages this month lmao and that does not include the Comiket
one I'm doing separate from this line- Too much information, huh. You will get
it in due time when it gets busy here. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah, more exciting stuff for the blog and a shorter work week next week I
  suppose with the holiday in the middle so maybe I'll spend some time doing
  enhancements on this blog I've planned so many months beforehand, so let's
  talk about Anime and music while it's happening! August man, it's changing my
  luck for the better that's for sure- I got a SSR on the new DOAXVV event
  yesterday by the way. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span><br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  What, I didn't write that intro quote wrongly, read it again. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In
  this new episode where yeah we are about half a year off Valentine's Day
  apparently (#SukiMega05), but yeah, hard to talk about love if we don't
  mention Love Day, so I guess this makes sense. So yeah, for starters, the
  streets are looking very red at this time of year, which damn if that did not
  catch the attention of anyone unless you're totally blind, and since Mie-san
  technically isn't without her glasses at least she can still feel her
  surroundings to know that Komura isn't dressing in red so that he can disguise
  himself as a tower of chocolates. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She did hear him say he wants
  something from Mie-san though, we will get to that later hehe, but seeing that
  Komura is so worried that the girl might otherwise realize they are in
  chocolate land might be a problem for him and whatever he just said in which
  she has overheard... uh, maybe not telling her he wants some Valentine's Day
  chocolates is a good thing after all. Again, this guy is just hyped up on the
  drugs that is Mie-san so he won't know about friendly chocolates is a thing
  anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, not until Mie-san did mention that she just does this
  chocolate making thing every year too, for the friends around her and
  apparently that includes guys to nice of her to do so, so technically Komura
  will also get one... until she realized she forgot to prepare his gift on the
  day itself. Welp, might as well go die now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But what if I told you
  that her house is nearby the school and she left it on the counter and Komura
  you can go to her house to get it- That will be quite an awesome development
  but as expected I thought too much even more than the boy himself lol, so as a
  way of compensation Mie-san chose to, of all things to give to Komura, a
  favour he can ask her to do. I mean, I would just ask her to come to my place
  or a date or something but Komura will die of embarrassment so maybe not.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> How about she has to say yes to whatever he says next and it's a
  confession? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Man, I am FULL OF IDEAS today though haha but that
  doesn't mean he will do any of those so that's kinda sad with all the
  monologues laid out bare lol, but damn that might be the best time (in my
  opinion) to actually do a confession and get yourself laid in middle school
  but hey what do I know Komura is just going to be a virgin by my age anyways.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, he has to return the favour for enjoying such embarrassment
  and whatever guilt comes out of Mie-san by giving back her chocolates a month
  later haha yes it's White Day now, but she has a problem. I think she is
  technically speaking heavier than me now, according to the weighing scale.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> That first number can't be a 4 or 5, right? That's... kinda bad
  actually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, what is going to stop sweets desperate Mie-san if
  she effectively skipped breakfast and all the guys (lol) are retuning the
  chocolates from when she was graciously giving out a month ago, then realized
  maybe asking Komura to help me not eat them would be the impediment to her
  enjoying some of these, would rather sacrifice her weight problems by eating
  the one given from her bestie maybe boyfriend who sits beside her in class.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... this is a win, I guess? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Simple episode
  though, not much flair apart from the Love Day theme which I would say it's so
  staple in any romance series it's hardly surprising anymore, but they did
  still put in their own twist on it so that's fine. And I'm kinda slowly
  getting uneasy over the otherwise slower pace in this series so maybe that's
  not a good thing. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Though it's still fine, and I'm seeing a lot more
  points that they can make this interesting every episode as they have so far,
  so I'm optimistic this will go well. Whatever it is though? I don't know.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> A different seat in class? Uh oh haha see you then.

  [TL:DR; "And I can't believe she forgets her glasses outside of school too"
  Yeah Komura I can't believe it either lol <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span>]

  Aw, that was quite an intro to be honest- I want a possessive girlfriend like
  Cuff-san. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where hey we get to go see the circus
  which ironically isn't talking about me or this blog lol
  (#ShinigamiBocchan16), we get to talk about more of the serious parts of the
  story while still joking about how we are living in a world of racks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Hey, take a page from me, Zain, I am the love master here. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Moving on
  this is all a joke so far we can talk serious in a bit, the main couple (hehe)
  first bumped onto Hugo the kid who works in the circus, and that's probably
  the easiest way of them getting into the group to meet Zain and Cuff in the
  first place, all things considered before Bocchan has any chance in killing
  anyone without his current disguise which looks like Zain but I'm sure those
  two share some similar characteristics. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> They are missing out on Zain
  though so since they are here and under the Ringmaster's recommendation, they
  decide to play around (get it?) with this bunch of misfits (literally) until
  you know, maybe Zain will know of what happened so far in the story lol. But I
  suppose even without the lore drop from Bocchan who has recently been visited
  by Daleth of all people <em>HE KILLED YOUR GIRL'S MOM</em> lol, we still need to
  know more about what is the reason behind why Zain is so important to the
  witch's world that is all the hype right now. Turns out, it has much to do
  with what we know last time around, where Daleth's sister might have done the
  deed to whoever this woman is in the coffin who is technically still alive by
  the way maybe she is cursed also lol, and who got Daleth's face into the state
  that it is today. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Wow, so the sis is more evil than Daleth here?
  Yeah I guess so she did put a curse of death on our main guy here lol. Damn. I
  don't know what to say she sounded like an interesting witch until she wasn't.
  Heck, I'll even take Keto and Teto now lol Zain be like. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But
  nonetheless, Daleth knew that Zain's time magic <em>might </em>(and that's a
  huge "might" because remember his flashback with Cuff about saving their
  parents) save Sharon from whatever state she is in now which will probably
  make Alice very happy but I see no reason to do that other than that they are
  friends, still is kind of desperate in Daleth's case so she intends to go all
  out and bring a couple more racks with her to see the powerful witch who is
  also into boobs. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, if you really want to make a case for Zain to
  leave with you guys immediately? Just do a porno. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know we may end
  up not being able to air this haha but it's for the sake of Sharon so small
  price to pay for him to put his magic sausage on- I'm good for now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  All in all... hmm this isn't exactly a threat so much so as they are still
  being rather formal with each other, seeing that they are all on par with each
  other and all. By the way, and not even remotely close to the sister's powers,
  and that's why nothing much has happened so far. But looks like Daleth might
  be going on the aggressive here it seems, even if Zain tried to delay his
  farewell to the human world, this witch might end up striking first to make
  sure she gets what she wants. What will happen to Cuff though? Oh boy, if you
  aren't getting worried we can't save the human world boobies, you gotta start
  worrying now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  Okay, so good to know timing and range is still his biggest limitation to
  overcome, good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> RIP Akutagawa though, you will be missed. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Moving on haha in this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs54) wow okay we got a lot
  to talk about before what is effectively a pandemic *ack* haha man, and maybe
  that's why this sequel got delayed this far back like, 3 years after the fire.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, what happened. Atsushi managed to escape, and it was planned well
  even at last minute attempt, where Akutagawa did not kill the one he held
  hostage but let him be a distraction to Fukuchi at the boat. So yeah,
  complication is his biggest weakness. And I'll keep an example of it short in
  case this and the next fight (hehe) still made you confused. Assuming Fukuchi
  is going against 20 people. Due to complications of everyone going at him, he
  can't send himself back to the past enough times or fast enough to predict
  when everything will happen, and thus will just lose to 1 of them, if
  anything, because it's not in his human instinct even as a experienced soldier
  to deal with everyone all at once. In this case though, Akutagawa made sure he
  was letting someone of status go, so the guy did inform the authorities which
  will complicate his case to, for example, go back in time and kill this guy
  who informed everyone because then everyone will ask where he is and that's
  where it will all be traced to Fukuchi himself which will be awkward. So
  instead, he had to start his next plan which will also be mentioned later,
  taking over half of the world's population. I won't call this new character in
  a coffin to be an Ability user but I guess he is also he is voiced by f**king-
  Is that Tsuda Kenjirou? Why is he f**king everywhere?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, might
  as well live with it haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Introducing the final member of the Hunting
  Dogs, Bran the vampire lol, apparently a legend in the undead, and I guess
  Akutagawa was the first victim to start, spread out to Higuchi and Gin (that
  squeal when bitten,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kawaii" target="_blank">kawaii</a>) (haha
  sorry I just gotta) and Hirotsu and I thought we get to see some action but I
  guess not, old man ensured Tachihara won't meet the same fate... at least for
  now. And at this point I already wondered how involved was he in the
  operation, but I guess he wasn't involved with the events at the boat or else
  this arc will end earlier, but trying to reverse the tide of the fates of the
  Detective Agency in the Hunting Dogs meeting is also kind of his plan. As a
  member of Port Mafia, obviously changing sides at this point not because he
  didn't believe someone was doing his job in the group also, but technically he
  got found out by Mori Ougai. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course our dear MVP boss wants him to
  get back at Fukuchi considering his Ability has the best chances of dealing
  damage to him anyways (well I guess Mori also knows of his Ability) which
  yeah, remember Fukuchi's sword is made out of metal? Haha FUCKING GOT HIM lol
  is that not common knowledge or what. Should've made that out of wood so that
  Tachihara can't
  <a

    >Senbonzakura</a
  >
  this old man ass. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (sorry for "BLEACH" joke) Sadly though, well,
  Fukuchi did find out the intention in the first place and suspected Tachihara
  even just a bit at the meeting, that was just a deduction at best, and all
  this was just a precaution more than a prediction. But that's also it because
  Tachihara's immediate action to backstab his backstab was a mistake. If he
  dragged on to like, tomorrow, he would've been able to get around Fukuchi's
  suspicions and not like they will be able to travel to the past to understand
  that. Also, doing this ALONE?? BRUH WHAT DID I JUST SAY? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, now
  that the world is practically on fire lol we closing borders soon, yes? Well,
  can you even close borders if the border guys are also vampires? Who is going
  to stand in the hot sun for guard duty then? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All your confusions and
  queries answered by the United Nations leader next time, on what makes my
  blood boil more than whatever Fukuchi was getting through his veins lol this
  series is just the best

  Seriously though, what is with all this serious talk aren't we doing the
  shooting on her chest- On location this episode?? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> In this new episode
  though thanks to the thumbnails online (#KanoKari29), looks like we are doing
  the shooting for the movie! We have the funds, everyone is on time with the
  production of this film, and thanks to mostly the perfect acting from Chizuru
  (apparently called Kyouko-chan to the rest of the crew lol) and the film
  club's boss and director and NOTHING to do with Kazuya's effort as best man
  even going out to the bridge to chase a cicada away haha, most of the film is
  completed and done on schedule during their university break. Ruka-chan
  thought this is just holiday camp mostly just... what did she do again to
  contribute to this movie? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She remembered the script but then?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well whatever who even cares about her anyways lmao, but I guess
  we can talk about everyone else. Obviously this is an effort to show how much
  Kazuya will do for this movie and man I mean EVERYTHING because if taking care
  of Ruka-chan isn't the most he has done for anything in his life you gotta
  think twice because he doesn't even like the girl. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then maybe
  Mini-chan might be right about Chizuru thinking twice before thanking this
  bloke in front of her who is doing all he can to either make her the next
  popular actress and/or fulfil her grandmother's wishes. As she said it herself
  in reflection to Kazuya thinking bad about himself though, we are technically
  all doing something for our family and/or people around us. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Not true
  but we will take it as is for now haha this is a family show after all <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>,
  so hopefully that will not make Kazuya keep thinking like he's a useless piece
  of trash like his friends think he is. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on though, the crucial
  and last part of the shooting ironically is left for Kazuya to handle because
  the senpai has to deal with his own club's shooting soon and thus probably
  cleared out most if not all the important scenes filming for him so that's
  wise, leaving him to do probably the easiest and/or quickest stuff so that he
  can actually spend the rest of the budget going to the mountains and flirt
  with Chizuru- You see where this is going already? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, you might not
  though but Mini-chan did. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that's why it's a mistake asking anyone
  else but Kazuy's own friends for help and not like he had a choice, so his
  discipline gladly accepted his orders. Yeah, Mini-chan is going to plan
  everything including all the romance plots and precious moments that Kazuya
  will want in this situation. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And just that we thought that you know,
  maybe Ruka-chan will be involved so maaaaaybe we set in the hotel rooms to be
  Mini-chan and Ruka-chan and HAHAHA the other two can take another room because
  we can't find more rooms, but NO. Mini-chan is more evil than that. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  So no surprises there, Mini-chan was definitely not intending to go with them
  anyways, and probably contacted Ruka-chan later to ensure she won't go and
  it's not like Kazuya will contact her to confirm again. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Genius plan
  but Ruka-chan will be freaking LIVID with such a situation- Nice one,
  discipline. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Though in retrospect, I like how because it's this third
  person that Ruka-chan in the first place won't think of anything suspicious
  that we can cancel ONE FINAL SHOOTING of a movie on a crowdfunding budget just
  because one person fell ill. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, Ruka-chan is dumb, what can I say?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And Mini-chan having to explain to Kazuya in the levels of talking
  about lust and thing and stuff forgetting this is just a video shooting and
  that is basically impossible to answer to Chizuru besides the truth... We get
  it this is CLEARLY a

  Well Sengoku, you can sleep with your parents like you did when you were a
  kid. I hope you did that before, don't think your parents are that harsh to
  you. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode though (#HorimiyaPiece06) maybe we are done
  with character specific episodes? I don't know dude, this Sengoku arc is
  looking a little familiar in presentation. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Oh hey, mom. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  (Edit: That was the voice of
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/1952/Kazumi_Yoshida"
    target="_blank"
    >Anime "Shana" Kasumi</a
  >, the classmates who likes the main dude, I remember) Anyhow, maybe at least
  half of this episode is about that, so let's talk about how Sengoku is not
  going to sleep for the night. Like, at least invite not Iura if you want some
  sleep? That d*ck will never give you peace. Just look at Miyamura, dude.
  Invite only them instead. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically, we are in a situation where
  anything can happen seeing this dynamic, but mainly we got no space for
  Sengoku to sleep due to poor planning. But&nbsp; yeah as I thought to myself
  earlier on and soon that they realized, just move the damn table and it'll be
  fine. It's a sleepover, you gotta move your room around a bit, it's fine.
  Then, it's the not BL thing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Miyamura is just sleepy all the time
  he's not at school specifically, so he won't be too aware about what people
  around him will do to his naked body (lmao), especially when it's Sengoku who
  wants to- Please, we need some decency here, Iura. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> With all regards
  to this though, the emphasis seems to be why Miyamura is always clothed.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ishikawa may have helped Miyamura to cover to him time and time
  again, from telling the guys he had a bazooka in his crotch (HELL YEAH
  Hori-san will be pleased lmao) to even accidentally dropping stuff to distract
  Sengoku as he changed out to the school sweater... dude sometimes you have to
  take care of your own secrets. Shout out to MVP Ishikawa haha Miyamura's naked
  butt can only be saved that many times and he saved it every time lol, but
  when asked directly by Sengoku himself I highly doubt even amongst friends he
  will tell them anything either way. Yeah, probably will get mocked at, or so
  he thinks. Moving on, and boy I did not expect this other half coming in, we
  talk about Remi-chan. This is actually probably the sweetest (get it?) episode
  I've seen so far, and boy is it just about the world around her. For starters,
  Sengoku as boyfriend. Not that he doesn't know how to be one, but yeah, I
  guess Remi-chan really wanted an aggressive dude as her partner, as she keeps
  time and time again hint him to take certain action just on the trip back home
  together, from hugs to holding hands to why are you walking so fast learn how
  to pace with a woman you dumba**. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You know, I have to say this is
  kind of common knowledge unless you are dealing with my mom who leaves the
  rest of the family at the back when walking lmao, so yeah I'll blame this on
  Sengoku. He did give the hug though. The right way too, he watched Anime
  "ToniKawa" and Tsukasa explaining how to hug someone shorter than you.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And then, I wished I can be bribed with material goods just like how
  I somewhat did in school as a student. Sadly, it wasn't friends, my math was
  better than Remi-chan's lmao, and I didn't have that desire for like, premium
  cookies I just lost the right to have basic rewards like cheese sticks from
  the local supermarket. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on haha, I like how they made sure
  rounding up the numbers on Remi-chan's test will make her happier on her
  efforts, even to go so far out as to leave her alone and meet up haha yeah
  just Sakura and Sengoku, enough to make the world think they are a thing, only
  for you guys (hopefully earlier) to notice that if someone's bf and bestie
  hang out together it's always for a surprise gift for the person in question,
  in case you wondered. All in all, this is summer season so we can do with less
  warm stories for the heart. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I like it though, just like the rest of
  the series so far to be honest. More Remi-chan would be great hehe I'm just a
  fan <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

  Yeah Kenpachi can deal with himself. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> With Soul Society in a freaking
  mess we can do some regrouping and ignore those who can take care of
  themselves. In this new episode I hope it will be Kensei and Rose
  (#BLEACHTYBW18) as they deal with the new Superstar in town which by the way
  isn't Ichigo if you aren't aware yet from last week, we changed him out dude.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, this episode is primarily focused on the Superstar
  Sternritter himself... or himselves if you are aware that he has a cheerleader
  fan in his squad haha. Anyways, just a quick summary of what happened because
  that was intense even in a general perspective. For starters, of course Rose
  and Kensei had to fight this bloke probably not together because I wonder why
  not, but hey Kensei be dealin' those punches I'm just impressed to see it in
  full action so far because damn when's the last time we actually see this
  work? Like, in Karakura Town arc he barely punched anything, this is just
  fanservice. Also Rose when Kensei got struck down because they didn't know the
  James lore, that Bankai is sadly not music to the ears hehe get it probably
  because the soundtrack isn't even making it good and that's compared to Renji
  by the way, but damn the quality in this is still real good. Though yeah,
  still seriously downplayed in this animation but damn it's already so much
  better than what was shown in the manga where everything is done in two pages
  haha, but really though Kensei's Bankai is cooler. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (As a side note,
  I wished Rose's Bankai is not tied to hearing, but vibes so unless you don't
  have a vibrating body like say BG9 then you should not be immune) (I have
  studied audio engineering btw <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>) Moving on, they didn't do much to this
  Superstar and we aren't even seeing him use his ultimate yet I am not going to
  read that off again- He has the star power he doesn't need the V-power.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I kind of like him now actually HAHA okay let's just mow over the
  losers and bring in the tough guy, in this case Renji. We will see more Rukia
  action I promise you and to my sis who has been waiting for that specifically
  for years hehe, but more of getting Renji to the level of cool he deserved
  since he lost to Ichigo that many years ago. Seriously, it's all his
  zanpakuto's fault, as explained by the author a.k.a. Ichibe-san in the
  upstairs (lol) his sword soul never revealed to its user their true form,
  though we know it manifests in two animals. It's the opposite of Yumichika
  basically, where instead of not wanting their sword to be at its full
  potential, this one Zabimaru is like "f**k you" and never showed off its
  power. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, eventually he did achieve that in the short time he
  did proving again he is faster in training compared to Ichigo haha got him
  good, and his current Bankai is impressive especially with that last bite. Oh,
  that's it? Okay. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I mean, what else is there to say for
  this episode? Well, for starters, I didn't expect Renji and Rukia to drop by
  (get it?) this quick though, maybe I was stuck at the Anime pace back then
  with the drags, but damn this is moving fast!! So yeah, VERY AWESOME I will
  watch this episode for the rest of the week to be honest <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>, and I'm
  just glad we are giving a lot more credit to Rose and Kensei before Renji
  comes in and ruins everything lol including the Superstar himself , and on the
  contrary though the latter is actually even more interesting despite the fast
  pace and lack of explanations to his powers and/or James to be honest. Like, I
  distinctively remember Renji saying sh*t about them once they recovered their
  hearing but I guess not. Keeping the jokes aside, this is as cool, well, might
  be even better than "Stray Dogs" now so congrats Kubo-sensei, you have
  impressed me once again. Okay I gotta go back and enjoy this again hehe or
  just watch the Tiktok videos if you want

  [I gotta say though, it's hardly a time in action series like this we get to
  see not just a one-sided win because damn Kensei vs the Superstar was quite a
  scene to watch; Rose just got ripped apart once he showed off his Bankai haha
  LAME Kubo-sensei probably didn't even have an idea what his final scene was I
  assure you- More Superstar, yes?]

    and vice versa, I will have a chance to talk about the former in a Review

    good. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Yes for the record I don't give Anime releases and I have

    with her new album and though I already want to give up on her just in

  So, news online about music. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah soon I'm going to be referencing

  was for a song I did not regret skipping haha it was the title song on their

  and boy do I miss this SID x Mayflower combination and if you even know either
  of the bands which are due their age (lol) then maybe you'll appreciate this
  new collaboration because they have been making grounds since I heard of them
  a couple of years ago, they serve to impress.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <br />
  Next week brings us nothing which is fine haha I still have a stack of
  <b>rock festival lives</b> to watch so I'll be sure to find something on it to
  listen to- That's the problem though we are inundated with so many old songs
  that aren't released this year it's an issue for skewing the stats for Klassic
  Note though. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'll think of something haha or not actually lol
  PSYCHE<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />Oh happy birthday, Oonishi Saori! I know my question for your Instagram
  Q&amp;A probably won't get answered or anything (since I literally asked for
  selfies lmao) but damn I just want to let you know you are some motivation I
  never expect to have since when I knew more about you that many years ago.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay serious talk over, making out with her is still my top priority
  by the way, even if it's in a dream. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time then, and
  until next time if there aren't any takers for Oonishi here because she just
  said she doesn't use perfume lol, I'll take her body odour any time of the day
  she just has to also take mine now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Maybe I should write a
  fanfiction of her instead of Inorin lmao
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. THE PLANETS ARE ALIGNING ALL THE STUFF IS APPEARING SO I CAN SHIP OUT
  AKARIN BROMIDES- Why is there a Kana-chan fanclub item in here? *looks at
  site* Oh, that thing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We'll talk about those next time, yes?
