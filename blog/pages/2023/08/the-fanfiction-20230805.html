  Oh hey and I'm back! For this month though, I will be focused on the summer
  theme since this heat is getting into me and I can't stop thinking of girls in
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yukata" target="_blank">yukata</a> lmao not
  true I wish they would just take it off- This is the intro you wanted, me?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe I should rewrite this to be honest even the outro which I
  haven't written is still better than this garbage-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyhow, if you can appreciate such level of comedy and/or if you really are
  desperate like me and want to imagine going on the summer dates with the voice
  actress you like, boy do I have some of them lined up this month and then
  maybe we see what else my creative mind can cook up with. Because damn, I'm
  going to run out of image sources real soon.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Without further ado, let's get the hardest one to write of the rest of the
  list going! No really, I don't even know this one will make any sense hehe who
  cares amirite

      It was the first of many favours I had to repay Minase Inori personally
      for saving my life some time ago. Of all things, she wanted me to join her
      in a summer festival outside of town. We arranged to meet nearby and walk
      the rest of the way there. I was amazed and speechless when I saw her
      slender body in the yellow-white yukata for the first time, I was
      definitely not thinking straight at that time.

        >"What is with that expression though",</abbr
      >&nbsp;she said to me while laughing it out as I tried to explain myself
      and hold my embarrassment back from her.

      As we walked down the streets en route to the festival, we passed by a
      playground on which had a pelican-like ride. Minase-san thought it was
      adorable and went up to it while saying
      <abbr title="かわいいよ">"isn't this cute"</abbr> along the way. She then
      squatted down, put her finger against its beak, and looked back at me with
      a pout. I was confused yet adored at this sight, where later she explained
      that I looked exactly like that earlier on.

  I feel like putting the context in for this inside the fiction might make this
  too long so I might as well put it here. Inorin's relation to me... Hmm, well
  it cannot be imouto I can only have
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >the one imouto</a
  >
  and Moka-chan failed the latest auditions so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, this is kind of
  like a benefactor relationship? Yeah, she saved my life once and I am to
  return the favour by... going out with her? Haha, that can only happen in
  fiction. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also also, it's more like an aggression considering does
  anyone even want them to repay such a favour unless you are so attractive to
  go out with it'll be worth your time? *looks at self* Maybe not me in reality
  but this is Aozaki Shouhei we are talking about so sure. Maybe the other way
  around would've made now sense. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you next time for the sequel.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Little did I tell you that in order for all this to happen I must have
  had her contact information MUAHAHAHA- She asked me for it by the way <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Also did some Japanese on the dialogues (I don't think mobile can see
  but I'll work on something) so that I can truly experience what it's like for
  them to talk to me-
