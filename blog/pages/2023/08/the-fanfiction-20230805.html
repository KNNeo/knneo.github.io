  Oh hey and I'm back! This month on though, I will be focused on the summer
  theme since this heat is getting into me and I can't stop thinking of girls in
  yukata lmao not true I wish they would just take it off- This is the intro you
  wanted, me? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe I should rewrite this to be honest even the outro
  which I haven't written is still better than this garbage-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyhow, if you can appreciate such level of comedy and/or if you really are
  desperate like me and want to imagine going on the summer dates with the voice
  actress you like, boy do I have some of them lined up this month and then
  maybe we see what else my creative mind can cook up with. Because damn, I'm
  going to run out of image sources real soon.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Without further ado, let's get the hardest one to write of the rest of the
  list going! No really, I don't even know this one will make any sense hehe who
  cares amirite

      It was the first of many favours I had to repay Minase Inori personally
      for saving my life some time ago. Of all things, she wanted me to join her
      in a summer festival outside of town. We arranged to meet nearby and walk
      the rest of the way there. I was amazed and speechless when I saw her
      slender body in the yellow-white yukata for the first time, I was
      definitely not thinking straight at that time.

      She says to me while laughing it out as I tried to explain myself and hold
      my embarrassment back from her.

      As we walk down the streets en route to the festival, we passed by a
      playground on which had a pelican-like ride. Inori thought this was
      adorable and went up to it while saying
      <abbr title="かわいいよ">"it's cute"</abbr> along the way. She then
      squatted down, put her finger against its beak, and looked back at me with
      a pout. I was confused yet adored at the same time, in which later she
      explained that I looked exactly like this earlier.

  I feel like putting in the context for this might make this too long so I
  might as well put it here. Inorin's relation to me... Hmm, it's kind of like a
  benefactor relationship? Yeah, that she saved my life once and I am to return
  the favour by... going out with her? Haha, that can only happen in fiction.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also also, it's more like an aggression considering does anyone even
  want them to repay such a favour unless you are so attractive to go out with
  it'll be worth your time? *looks at self* Maybe not me in reality but this is
  Aozaki Shouhei we are talking about so sure. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you next time for
  the sequel then. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Little did I tell you that in order for all this to happen I must have
  had her contact information MUAHAHAHA- She asked me for it by the way <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Also did some Japanese on the dialogues (I don't think mobile can see
  but I'll work on something) so that I can truly experience what it's like to-
