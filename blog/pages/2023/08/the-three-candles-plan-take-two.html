</div>
<div>
  I mean, I do have a lot to do this weekend considering I just slept all
  afternoon on Saturday (lol) so maybe just a quick update, I still want to
  cover as many bases I can though.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Welcome back! The last time you saw a similar title, it was half a year ago.
  As to why I am back for another one of these I would call status update, it's
  likely because we are very far off the perpendicular, I told myself I have to
  do something to straighten this out. And thus, I'm back to doing this again. I
  promise this will be shorter.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  In case you aren't keen in knowing everything, I'll summarize my changes to
  the original Plan over here <a href="#ThePlan" target="">#ThePlan</a>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And in case you ARE keen in knowing something, then let me start from what
  happened to my 30th year so far.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  THE
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kinkyouhoukoku" target="_blank">CATCH-UP</a>
  (AKA "WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS")<br />Much has happened in the past
  6 months since my 30th birthday. I grew half a year older (lol) but jokes
  aside, <b>I have not been following the plan to a tee</b>. Of course I'm not
  expecting to have to follow this all the way, no, but I have definitely not
  been disciplined or even capable of doing what I have set out to do.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Above that, things have also changed in the past 6 months.
  <b>Podcasts came and went, and so are the schedules and locations they can be
    heard.</b>
  Well, not all of them are like this but with the new financial year back in
  April, it's probably not surprising to see many of them cancelled around June
  for various reasons, mostly because of Oonishi Saori though haha she need to
  take a break we understand as fans. (Thanks for the Instagram stories and
  selfies though!) Still, this and some of them peaked out at Mondays made this
  hard to be a regular pill to swallow every week even after work, so I decided
  to shuffle things around.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE PLAN</div>
<div>
  To revise what happened half a year ago, here is in summary what I promised
  myself to dedicate more of my free time to do:
</div>
<div>
  <ol style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Revive APoL (Start with Chapter 17 by this year)</li>
    <li>Play New Video Games (Monthly)</li>
    <li>
      Listen To More Japanese Voice Actresses' Podcasts (If Possible, Live)
    </li>
    <li>Increase Digital Purchases (Avoid physical for non-music releases)</li>
    <li>Devote to Fanclub Subscriptions (As Many Known)</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div>
  Well, I've not made any progress for <b>APoL</b>, for starters. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This
  is quite an issue considering I really want to get this rolling but I still
  don't have the time and energy to plan for storyline and/or write the damn
  thing to be honest, and weekend are even now given to the Anime I watch on a
  weekly basis which are mostly sequels that don't want to put me down.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  For <b>video games</b> played? Hmm let me check... I've so far played
  Indoorlands, replayed Kingdoms &amp; Castles to only know they are done with
  development, replayed Populous: The Beginning but it got too hard, and
  Townscaper. Wow, not even once a month, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not when I keep falling
  sick every month lol. I thought of playing some Wolfenstein early 3D game
  though but did not put my money to do it, I don't know why. Maybe I'm not into
  shooters which I have no idea if they are hard or not lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  For <b>podcasts</b>, and this is the main point why we are here. As you will
  see me document using a calendar page I have on my local (your usage
  experience may vary it was hard using it either), I've only been most
  dedicated to listening on Mondays and Thursdays, and totally avoided Sundays
  for some reason. (Hey maybe this blog is the reason haha) These have also
  ended and/or been replaced by some which I have recently found out well
  A&amp;G isn't the only Internet radio out there, so the landscape is
  definitely not the same as before.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <b> Digital purchases</b> made so far I guess was mainly through Amazon
  Kindle, and even then I can count with one hand. The rest are as you have seen
  so far in this blog though, so that's kinda cringe how the ratio is still so
  skewed since physical goods still matter. Hey, not everyone is playing Raffle
  and giving out digital bromides like marupi-chan was doing in 2022, dude. Not
  anymore. But that does not mean Japan doesn't believe in physical goods as I
  will continue to prove every month with those package arrivals, just really
  did not justify my purchases anyways as digitals are hard to obtain in the
  first place. So yeah, this isn't going to work either way.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And fanclubs are just a money thing so those won't change as long as my card
  doesn't expire lmao
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div id="ThePlan">THE PLAN: TAKE TWO</div>
<div>
  This time around, I want to be more realistic about my free time goals. Since
  I'm lazy and still want to sleep and do other stuff that is definitely not
  hanging out with a girlfriend (lol), so these are set up in view of what time
  I left of this year, and from my experience in dealing with them in my free
  time every week.
</div>
<div>
  <ol style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Revive APoL (Start with Chapter 17 as weekly short story column)</li>
    <li>Play New Video Games (Whenever)</li>
    <li>
      Listen To More Japanese Voice Actresses' Podcasts (Throughout Each Week)
    </li>
    <li>Increase Digital Purchases (Where Applicable)</li>
    <li>Devote to Fan Subscriptions (In More Fulfilling Content Formats)</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div>
  Well, that is not to say I'm done with APoL and video games in general of
  course, the latter is more like a "if it gets me going" then maybe I'll play
  an indie game or two, but APoL? I may have to take my own suggestion to write
  a spec script and story overview document in order to pass this on to anyone
  interested to complete this story for me, as much as I'm still very keen on my
  writing my version of a story.
  <b>I am considering to write these in short story format</b> just like how I
  did recently for "The Fanfiction" series and maybe that's a good way to
  continue this passively. We shall see, I never got around to even letting
  people touch this gem anyways, and I doubt I will ever, but as what it is,
  maybe it is better left alone until I feel like doing it again. Making
  promises like these really made me motivated... to not touch them lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  As with video games...
  <b>let's just say mobile games still dominate my life</b>, and I don't have
  the mood and/or time to play them at length as much as I would love to, so
  sorry in advance to all the indie games out there I might as well watch
  streamers play them now. I really need to change this out soon because damn do
  I not need more life around this stuff that only gets the kids in. Maybe I'm
  still a kid, huh. MOVING ON haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Podcasts wise... maybe I'll let the table explain itself once again:</div>

    *All schedules are subject to change, time in HHMM format in Tokyo
    time ie. GMT+9</div><div>**Anything after 2400 is considered after midnight, and is
    known to extend to 2700 ie. Tokyo 3am next day</div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  In summary, I will <b>expand my paid subscriptions</b> apart from Kanno Mai's
  further into Aizawa Saya's on Tuesdays ie. Voice Garage, and Isobe Karin's if
  she does not keep inviting guests to her stream so we shall see about that. I
  will also cover radio shows from other Internet channels so long as I have
  access to them, and now <b>also cover Internet Radio Station Onsen</b>. Only
  the free ones though, Kouno Marika's gaming based program is full paid without
  any partial viewing so not gonna pay to watch that. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Ask me again in
  half a year and we shall see- Maybe I cancel her fanclub to sub to this?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I will also
  <b>add in irregular programs as and when they are available</b> as many of
  them are monthly but do not reveal of their days until within a week before,
  so no point listing all of them here. My calendar tracking will also cater to
  events not instead of regular schedules since they are hard to determine in
  the first place.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I'm effectively removing the digital purchases promise because damn it's just
  impossible, and if things like "Seiyuu Tomosha!" will continue to make this
  promise possible, I don't mind. But moving on,
  <b>unless the photobooks or anything else has a digital version</b>, it will
  apply to most of them as of now, from their 2nd book I have onwards so at
  least I can talk about them physically (lol) for their 1st, and hopefully only
  so it's worth the purchase. *looks at Kana-chan 2020 photobook* Not going to
  buy back those without any digital release though, as much as I want to haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Last but not least,
  <b>my fanclub subscriptions will still stay valid for the rest of the year</b>, but things will change from then on. Some of the fanclubs deliver nothing
  within the past half a year and I'm worried so I might just cancel them if
  they don't deliver content enough for me to justify the stay. Then maybe I'll
  move on to their podcasts if they have a subscription of sorts, we shall see
  on that too.
  <b>I also have not dedicated to more fanclubs since then</b>&nbsp;including
  Tomita Miyu and Uesaka Sumire which is why the above will also make sense
  since the former has that too, so maybe going along those lines from here on.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Maybe with this all aligned, I will be able to spend more of my single time
  not hanging out with others because they don't like me anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Well, let's hope I can hold up most of the promises this time around because
  damn I tell you, sometimes it's so tiring coming back from work on Mondays I
  rather just sleep early... as in sleep after dinner, wake up and listen to
  MaiMai and then go sleep again haha <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Hopefully this will make sure I'll
  follow this a lot more faithfully and listen to most if not all of them on a
  regular basis, the podcasts. I'm just lazy, dude. It's tiring to listen to all
  of them while I'm asleep anyways. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But as with all things, I will
  try.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  There won't be an update from here on, so maybe I'll talk about my progress on
  the Entertainment News posts from time to time. Speaking of which, see you in
  a bit for that too. Boy, this is rough haha bye
