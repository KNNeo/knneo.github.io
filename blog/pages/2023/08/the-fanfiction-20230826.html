  I thought of doing this up yesterday but my introverted self was out all
  afternoon <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> haha and also I could spread out the posts for the rest of
  the week, so here we are. For this week though, we will end the summer of
  August (lol) with someone else because I got enough of repaying Inorin.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, I hope you are okay with sequels every other week because I really
  should have done this back to back, again thanks to the one married woman in
  this month's list (lol) I had to make some adjustments. Yeah it's like the
  Anime "ToniKawa" special episodes just do your own recap before we start haha

    To whoever told my dear Koga Aoi-chan about my recent interaction with Waki
    Azumi in that foot bath near my place, I hate you. They don't know that
    Aoi-chan she has such a temper about such things, she walked away the moment
    she saw me at our meeting point in a summer festival near her place.

      Fortunately, I had a chance to explain myself whilst grabbing on to her
      hand. But instead of listening to me, she pointed at the dessert store
      which drew her attention. I did not hesitate to buy her what she wanted,
      and she walked to the bridge behind the stalls to eat. I stood by her with
      an awkward silence until she smiled at me and offered me a serving.

  So surprise surprise!! I planned this all along I promise I didn't want to
  resort to this hehe, but yeah Koga Aoi in fiction is my current same year
  jealous girlfriend. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> In case you have not realized from the story above,
  she lives far away from my place but the others aren't (lol) so she got
  jealous of me being friendly with Ajuju even though - and I legit have a
  reason to argue this now haha - she is already married to someone. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Hey, can't stop that j-j-j-jealousy amirite fellas?? Haha I wished she was
  that desperate. Yeah, in case you don't know how this works just imagine

  Moving forward though, I might take a break from this madness (lol) but also
  reflect on the content I shall prepare from here on. There is talk about
  continuing APoL my own novel series in this format, and Suruga-ya is slowly
  running out of images that I can comment on even this one above requires some
  imagination, so stay tuned in the new week and month for another update!
