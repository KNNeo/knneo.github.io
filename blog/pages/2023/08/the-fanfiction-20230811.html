  Alright this week's plan was to continue on the story that is whatever summer
  thing from last week if you have read that haha featuring Inorin of all
  people, but now that the news is out yesterday that a certain someone is
  married, I feel like I may have made the mistake of doing this first a week
  later even thought it was supposed to- INORIN IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT haha okay
  me, not like you have an idea to write this story last week without the
  marriage news anyways. *looks at Kana-chan* Haha oh well, maybe let's think of
  something here, yes?&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  This week's guest is kind of... I wouldn't even say favourite now because damn
  if you get married your rank drops real fast lol she is now technically ranked
  below her puppies haha trust me I was sadder yesterday than today I would
  trauma dump if I had to do this a day ago.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Forget about the outside world for now, maybe time travel back a bit, in my
  new story about interacting with girls I like!

  <i
    >There was this open foot bath that is very popular in the neighbourhood. As
    I have cold feet, I would pop in from time to time to enjoy this public
    facility which is hard to find in the city. But recently, as I passed by it
    on my way home, I saw my neighbour Waki Azumi in a yukata soaking her feet
    in the water. She said she was on her way back after visiting the shrine and
    taking some photos of the nearby festival.</i

    <i
      >As I took a seat opposite her after what was quite a long walk anyways,
      she decided to dangle her feet against mine and I laughed it off in
      embarrassment. Some time later, she stretched her hands up into the air
      and forwards to me with a beautiful smile, and I stared at her for a
      moment.</i

      I let off a giggle as I pulled her up, and she gave me a cute pout in
      return.</i

    <div><span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Haha</div>

    <div>
      Oh yeah, I'm totally taking a page from
      <a
        href="../../2021/03/the-eleventh-book-vs-twelfth-book-worth.html"
        
        >her photobook a couple of years ago</a
      >
      hehe I did not sleep with her afterwards though. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      So yeah, my relationship with Ajuju. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I feel like my relation with
      her should be less than lovers (since I can't get over dogs as in I'm
      slightly allergic to them) but more of just friends hanging out, and
      coincidentally, I was hanging out with just her. Hey, she lives nearby,
      okay? Don't ask me how someone will know of this encounter <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, but
      this proximity in this fictional world will likely put in jealousy, I
      suppose. Now that we can get "married couple" out of the way haha <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
      and to add to the fever, I almost had the chance to buy the final
      illustration book from the new Comiket series I'll be doing down the line
      when I saw it yesterday morning, only got to it by the end of the day and
      since I'm not buying directly from the store there was a delay, it was
      sold out by the time Buyee could get to it. AJUJU THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT
      haha well I should have done this earlier during the day but I forgot so
      it's all on me. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> See you next time haha even typing on this new
      keyboard which arrived before I typed this is making regret my life
      decisions because it's technically worse imo now and I can't revert back
      to the old keyboard which refused to connect and will make me type Vs out
      of nowhere <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> I will live with all of this in due time I just need to
      rest more lol see you all for Anime this weekend.

      P.S. Also TL:DR; Dear Waki Azumi
      <a
        href="https://twitter.com/azumi_waki/status/1689607594095349760?s=20"
        target="_blank"
        >your marriage news</a
      >
      have made me more sad than I have ever since many idols ago and I don't
      know why my heart hurts. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Maybe I do love you for all you are
      despite my dislike for dogs. I wished I was your gamer husband though, I
      truly do.

    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      P.P.S. Oh happier news, Kanno Mai's birthday livestream this weekend is
      going to be DOPE!! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> F**K COMIKET DUDE I CAN'T EVEN GET PRE-ORDERS
