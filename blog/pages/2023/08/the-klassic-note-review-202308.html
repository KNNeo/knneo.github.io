  Well this is rather expected of me haha we are only missing a month and we're
  back with more music talk? Hell yeah dude who says there isn't music to give
  nowadays haha
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyhow, this is probably the most predictable release I've given thus far even
  in the history of Klassic Note I would say, as we are technically talking
  about an Anime's theme songs all sung by an artist that is not Hoshimachi
  Suisei

<div>
  (I mean, what do you want me to say about this? I guess the artist image looks
  great for another single we don't get to see the face of)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: I don't think I know a lot of this 16-year-old virtual singer singing
  for an Anime major label, but I do know about the Anime, so maybe we talk
  about that. As the new season of Anime appeared and I have to deal with FIVE
  sequels I shall not mention of that anymore, "SukiMega" was the only series I
  picked up that was new, and so did I get fascinated by the arrangement of the
  opening and ending theme songs, especially the opening which is why we are
  here. Ironically, they intend to release both singles picking up each other's
  songs, and make this a big selling point backed up by composers with fame. And
  that's how I get to know this voice from the opening, and that it reminded me
  of VTuber Hoshimachi Suisei and her singing, still does sound uniquely
  different especially in the Anime music industry to stand out among the rest.
  Let's find out more why this is actually so.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) NAME</div>
<div>From last chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"(I) want to get closer, closer</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I) will help with anything, because I'll protect you
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Always always be by (your) side even if (we) get lost, (I'm) sure to find
    each other
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (Our) hearts are fluttered and moved, does this feel weird
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I) want to know the name of this feeling"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  This song just spells love in itself of course credited by the mood of the
  Anime itself of protecting someone without their glasses but this goes in a
  more generic direction, talking about how that brings them together and stuff.
  Melody-wise I think it's catchy enough to catch anyone's attention, but I'm
  particularly disturbed by the abrupt pauses especially till the end of the
  song where if you did not count your beats, you would be blasted without
  realizing which can prove to be irritating at times, but otherwise even the
  bridge part is smartly written I assume thanks to DECO*27 who wrote the
  lyrics. All around great feels though, definitely something that will get its
  name at some point.
</div>
<div>Rating: Strikingly Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Metamoru [Metamour]</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"If (I) call this "affection"</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Then "love" (should be) more sophisticated
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Ah I don't know! Because (I'm) not yet there
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I'm) in the process between adulthood and (being a) kid"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  I was initially weirded out by the song title, but now that I've listened to
  the song and its lyrics, I think this made sense. This is also a love song, no
  surprises there, but what struck me and probably youngsters out there is
  probably the heavy pop style which ironically did not deter me mainly because
  I've been listening to such genres over the years and am actually used to the
  technopop style it is repeating chorus after chorus, I am actually bopping to
  it at this point. The lyrics talk about stuck between being a kid and adult,
  so of course the feelings of love will be choppy and even misleading at times,
  and that love might be more sophisticated, and so the feelings then will be
  all over. Interesting take on the lyrics, a heavy pop feel that's hard to
  beat, short and concise makes this a better song to recommend than even the
  title song.
</div>
<div>Rating: Addictingly Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(3) Megane-Go-Round [Glasses-Go-Round]</div>
<div>
  This ending theme song definitely sounds like a pun waiting to happen, but
  that's what happens when you do an unusual collaboration between the main
  couple's voices and Anime singer-songwriter Ooishi Masayoshi because the
  latter wrote the song. In general though, this song is as normal as it's
  decently good and even catchy in melody and the bridge part is fine, the
  lyrics makes sense tying in to the theme of the Anime of seeing way more
  without glasses in (because of people around you), just that this version is
  technically a cover song done by the opening theme artist herself as the
  others have done for her song too. So yeah, no special dialogues, no extra
  harmony, choruses are essentially just her, all that flair. Her singing does
  bring in the usual mature feminine voice not in the original though, which
  probably makes this cover all that unique.
</div>
<div>Rating (original song): Lovingly Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This will be a rare recommendation even from me to a virtual
  singer at this time of age, but heck, I'll do it. This is a good release
  overall, and even if you have no idea of the Anime series, this will still
  make of a great start to listen to the new Anime singer in town who is trying
  to make a name (get it?) for herself at a young age. Hopefully with such a
  head start she can go far into the Anime music industry, because honestly
  saying? This start isn't too bad at all.

  Well this one just came right on time with the next package incoming, so she
  was just here to join in on the ride unlike the last time we did this where I
  ended up burning a lot of money. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> Still, this is already planned long
  ahead of time I was just waiting for the full release to confirm the B-side
  and hey it was good so here we are.

  The hardest part is probably about choosing what special gifts to take from
  this girl. Considering she is a virtual singer and at this point (hehe) the
  Anime is probably more prominent in significance than her, I chose to take
  Anime gifts instead of the aritst-based ones, so to speak. And we aren't even
  going to talk about the Limited Edition gifts and/or

  That shall be it! This is a great single to listen to just like the many
  bangers I have reviewed this year and it isn't even the ones that do not fall
  into the Review requirements of liking every song in the release, so yeah,
  this is a great year in Klassic Note already. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span> See you in the next
  one actually we have an answer to that already which is kinda <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜¬">*cringe*</span>
  considering I should ban single-track singles sometime soon, but until then
  maybe I should focus on anything new to give by the end of year. We shall see,
  it has been a blast so far just from Anime songs alone lol
