Wow this is quite the weekend, huh? My fingers are now in trouble specifically
typing with my right hand because now my middle finger is giving me the middle
finger lol (okay maybe the tip is still fine), so don't ask how long I took to
just write up the new Anime season preview!! Haha yes new shows are coming in
and I want it to be like 2012 where I watch music and mystery genres which is
impossible so... more romance shows I guess!! lol
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Man, really should stop trauma dumping in these weekly posts, they start the
  tension dude but not in anyone's crotch- Maybe I should write shorter this
  time haha. If I can't type faster than what I think, then I can't write long.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> That's a nice logic actually maybe I should get my fingers chopped
  off-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  More disgusting boils on my fingers, and watching the new Resident Evil 4
  Remake playthrough, only on the weekly Anime and music blog!! Haha is that a
  good tagline or maybe I should talk about AnimeJapan instead?<br />

  It's that time of the year again where I dunk on new Anime I haven't seen
  before lol, so let's see if I can find something different to watch in the new
  year's offerings because this past season doesn't count:
  <div>
    [As usual, premiere dates means will give it a minimum 1 episode watch, in
    Japan simulcast order]
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        (As always, sequels I will skip so don't ask about whatever Anime sequel
        unless I know of them. Then again, to know what I know and watched,
        refer to
        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/KlassicNeo" target="_blank"
          >my MyAnimeList profile</a
        >. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Wow "Jigokuraku" sounds like something interesting and can last 20
        seasons (lol) but I'm not that interested in that and also if they don't
        have special powers and it's actual sword fighting like it's the actual
        Edo period instead will make this more appealing to me, so no thanks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Okay anything with gamer bullsh*t is out for me so no for "Yamada-kun"
        haha
      </li>
      <li>
        Should I even give a chance to <b>"Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu"</b>?
        The only thing bothering me apart from the main guy being a killer is
        just the looks, dude. You can NOT look worse than me, that's my right as
        an Anime audience. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, really done with romance series
        already so let me think about it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Haha <b>"My Home Hero"</b> just sounds like "<a

          target="_blank"
          >Kakushigoto</a
        >" but this involves not telling the daughter that your dad killed your
        boyfriend. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> CRINGE lmao jokes aside though, too much blood also
        because no shit we are killing someone from a gang this dad is asking
        for trouble already (Note to self: Go find the opening theme song haha)
      </li>
      <li>"Tensei Kizoku" your title is too long so I'm moving on lol</li>
      <li>
        Oh I've heard of Waki Azumi talk about the same-word four-time title
        "Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear Punch!" and you bet I don't give a damn because
        video games again dude (and if you are keen on the title, the four times
        are written differently with same definition; in Hiragana, Katakana,
        Kanji, and Katakana but pronounced in English)
      </li>
      <li>
        Ah yes my bro is into the sequel of that Isekai smartphone Anime so I
        hope you are too- NOPE. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

        [Premieres April 4th, 2023] seems to me to be more of a high school
        slice-of-life than a romance series because you know, breeding the
        relationship sprouts is way better than whatever girl lands on you or
        childhood friend storyline. Hey, it always seems that way, huh. Yeah
        also the guy looks better haha hey we can give the not most attractive
        girl a chance. With

        [Premieres April 4th, 2023] because what more better of a romance series
        where Hanazawa Kana (married, by the way) keeps disturbing you into
        loving her- Deja vu? Don't be too surprised; I copied the one from
        previous season lol so yeah, will come back to it where I left off so
        don't be shocked to not see this in next week's weekly post since I
        don't intend to copy 6 episodes of comments here haha
      </li>
      <li>
        Yeah basically "Kawaisugi Crisis" is just some girl who wants to destroy
        the planet and won't because of cats. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, to each its own,
        yes?

        Anime and is probably a better programmer than I do. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'll just
        watch when it comes out in a couple of weeks lol the theme songs are
        once again going to be hard to give, no surprises there.
      </li>
      <li>
        Should I care about heavenly series <b>"Megami no Cafe Terrace"</b>? I
        don't know, I feel like the hate of the grandmother who left the café to
        the main guy will fade away real quick with the ecchi scenes and the
        idea of living with 5 girls (WOAH) will probably get my bro more
        interested in this than I do lol
      </li>
      <li>
        Now that I think about it, yeah "Edomae Elf" is basically "Kannagi"
        because the god also just plays around (literally, with video games) but
        then once in a while fulfils peoples' wishes but I suppose this doesn't
        have the latter's dark story in potential but I may be wrong, don't
        think I will want to find out though.

      <li>
        Hey what if I told you that instead of an angel we have an alien?? In
        <b>"Otonari no Ginga"</b> that seems to be the case, and boy,
        RE-MARRIAGE?? Hey the stepmother is attractive af so what's the problem,
        younger than middle school kids? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I thought I may be able to
        watch this but what is with the kids' voicing? Oh hey Naganawa Maria as
        the son haha we were so close, so close.

        [Premieres April 10th, 2023] actually made me want to watch romance
        series this season again. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I've heard of this, but seeing that
        this is going to be a series to touch hearts of a couple <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> of
        students who share the same problems in the first place and wanting to
        fix them, I can't help but want to see them progress in their lives as
        well as them, with each other. I'll take a look for an episode or two.
      </li>
      <li>
        "The Marginal Service" sounds like something I dreamt of if I'm super
        tired and reached home to immediately go to sleep at 3am lmao so nope

      watching. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, no surprises, still ending up with romance series

      </div>
    </blockquote>
    Okay Kotoko-chan had the spirits keep watch on the guy, that's... kinda
    cheating dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In the plot twist of plot twist events because we
    are not done yet and Kotoko doesn't want this to end wrong (#KyokouSuiri23),
    she reveals the real killer. Spoiler alert, it's not the old man, or the fox
    spirit he ordered to kill his own wife. There's a lot more to digest here,
    so in case you are not prepared please leave now... the killer is Kaoruko,
    the only daughter in the Otonashi family. So turns out wink wink, Kotoko
    suspected the fox's statement which then led her to find out the actual
    killer was not the fox because someone already did it beforehand, a real
    human. And guess what, the husband only knew of it 23 years later. YUP!
    You've been living with a murderer all this time, dude. Happy now? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Maybe the mom IS right. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But not really the problem wasn't the guy,
    your daughter is also kinda screwed up lol. Anyways, so in summary, the way
    it happened was that Sumi-san the old woman was confronted by Kaoruko her
    own daughter, got stabbed in silence, and dropped to the ground with her
    wallet empty as if it was an attempted burglary. Then the fox standing by
    came in, disguised as a dog because good guess on why he didn't choose to
    transform into a human which clearly will make things harder haha okay bro
    blame the dogs for everything I guess, then ended up not killing anyone, but
    decided to give the killer an alibi because the killer of all genders was
    female and we has to make it male so you know, we can avoid saying stuff
    like this in International Women's Month. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on haha yes the
    fox was ordered to not implicate the kids of the deed, but that's all
    actually. Yeah and they DARE to ask for the largest portion of the
    inheritance, by the way?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Irony can't describe this case anymore,
    dude. The old man did not take this too well but in some sense it's also his
    own sin for thinking his belief in he did the deed is also having its own
    consequences just like the daughter did soon after <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>, still isn't doing
    as bad as Kaoruko's husband here who WOAH WOAH WHERE DID YOU GET THAT GUN
    FROM?? Uh... relax! But yeah, and that's why Kuro-san was here, to give all
    of them a warning in fact, of not dealing with people who know of the
    supernatural. Speaking of that, and Rion you are not exactly wrong but
    Kotoko-chan is still human though, she just rules all of the spiritual world
    haha, and we have mention of Rikka-san. Yeah, and that's why we are even
    here to be honest, I was waiting for that drop to happen at some point, and
    here it is. Because if you wonder how Otonashi the old man knew of
    Kotoko-chan so easily considering who she is, it's because Rikka-san
    introduced them to him. Uh oh, sounds like a trap to have taken this offer
    then, but apparently it's more of to show Kuro-san how potentially evil this
    girl in front of him is? I means Kotoko haha. Hmm... I gotta say, if this is
    onset to next season, I'm kind of in actually! Seeing Kuro worry about
    Kotoko-chan not just as his girlfriend lol but about her bullsh*tting skills
    lmao, one would actually think if she is worse off than the cousin.
    <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Uh oh, this is as spicy as it gets I think? We
    still have another episode to go, the last one, so let's see if they are
    reeeaaally trying to set this up. I don't think so though, if you would
    recall the first episode of this series. Well, we got next week to find out.

    Oh wow we have a Hunting Dogs season now? Why not call it "Hunting Stray
    Dogs", eh?? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Pretend I didn't say that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode
    where I wrote no notes so we are doing memory tests now just like Sigma
    apparently (#BungouStrayDogs49), we proceed on the first attack back on the
    Angels of Death. Thanks to <strike>Kana-chan</strike> Margaret's Ability
    haha never fail me on the shame girl that is my fuel now, the
    <strike>terrorists</strike> Detective Agency have taken themselves to the
    Sky Casino which ironically has a past no one will care about haha we will
    see how we should not even care at all to be frank, and the Hunting Dogs
    want a take on these bad guys, trying to find out where they would hide and
    of course, getting information from the café owner from the building the
    Agency resided. Sensitive guy went with the interrogation procedure lol he
    likely almost got it but thank goodness we didn't witness a murder and I
    guess killing the guy isn't a good option, so sword guy literally pleaded
    for the info. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What a stark contrast in work approach but hey not
    like I will bow down to my clients unless I'm Japanese which I'm not lol
    don't narc, Tachihara and that girl (lmao) were sent to the Casino to deal
    with them. Yes, deal with Sigma, who the heck wants Atsushi and Margaret
    dead anyways? They look like a great couple- Shout out to the time they were
    naked together. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay coming back, because that the two Hunting are
    actually here to find suspects and Sigma refuses to shut down the casino to
    let them do so which I assume it's just for operation purposes considering
    this is international ground and laws don't apply here, are probably not
    known of the fact that Sigma is running illegal operations here in orders of
    the Angels, to specifically cause worldwide terrorism exchanging coins to
    ones that will explode after it has spread around the world. Hey, Fyodor?
    This is not going to work, I go cashless. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay I guess I do have
    some coins on my wallet, but I'm going to suspect that USA will take the
    smallest hit because they only have dollar notes and can't embrace anything
    other than nickels. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Hey, who said America did not prepare for the
    next world war? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically, Sigma is dealing with the wrong people,
    as Tachihara survived the blast from the coin he found in a secret safe in
    one of the rooms which as expected Atsushi led them to so do they know about
    Tachihara being a spy for Port Mafia? Haha whatever this is not the point,
    the guy survived because metal manipulation, and anything bigger than an
    airplane I assume the girl when transformed into her larger-sized self
    (ironically didn't look more attractive lmao HIT ME) will be able to deal
    with. Maybe, she's bleeding out a bit. Either way, all under Dazai's plan as
    they seek to take over the place and Sigma is desperately fighting back as
    much as possible, calling on the customers who will dare to fight against
    these two to take on them. I say that because remember the guy remembers all
    the customer info? That's how he uses them to his advantage. The Hunting
    Dogs can't retaliate against innocents. Guess Sigma is using this tactic for
    now. What other ideas he has on his sleeve to protect this casino? Your
    guess is as good as mine. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> You want my take on this? Well I'm going
    to call out on a few things first then. Firstly, the Hunting Dogs will win,
    all will go according to Dazai's plan. But not smoothly. But it will happen,
    taking over the casino. Next, Sigma is not anything, even at all. Sigma, the
    now to us 3rd member of the Angels, is likely just a creation. Amnesia might
    not even be the point, or be part of it. Remember the pages that were left
    by that one Ability user who died which we are pursuing the last page of?
    This guy was written onto it, apparently along with the casino as Fyodor
    mentioned. So yeah, don't be too surprised that he might still be as weak as
    he is unless they wrote him as an Ability user with more than what Dazai
    explained (the trading thing) which will really last a while considering now
    we know what is happening already. Boy, I'm liking this one, guess we don't
    need new shows after all haha see you then

    Oh. OH!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, if your realized that intro just for a moment,
    you are not alone. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this final episode which hey I think they
    just did what I wanted them to do (#OtonariNoTenshiSama12), is that a kiss?
    ALREADY?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay. Say that is a joke, Mahiru. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And so we are
    at the last stretch. And as they are at during the sports event, it really
    feels like, as Amane has mentioned, that everything else has been set up to
    let him know about his feelings for the girl. Maybe we start with explaining
    that. For starters, Mahiru probably found out that he is playing
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/karimonokyousou" target="_blank"
      >scavenger hunt</a
    >
    with her too, likely on opposing teams. Then, no surprises there once you
    heard that Chitose is hosting this segment, Mahiru likely asked for her slip
    of paper to write what she wants to convey to the guy. And lastly, just
    picking him up will not be too hard since it's a race and he's in the
    ground. Literally picking him up, but that's for later haha, it's for the
    description of "a person I treasure" which of course, saying this in front
    of the class or even school will get plenty of guys livid, but I guess
    Mahiru did expect this to happen, and thus argued with the guys on the lack
    of their taste in relationships, citing the obvious of not knowing people
    enough, and to also find out how caring of a person Amane is? And how Mahiru
    is just adorable beyond hope she needs to be protected? Hey, the "must
    protect" thing is real after all, dude. Just that the girl took action
    earlier than he will EVER. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Again, can understand as they sit down
    together in the final part lol, that Amane is not just apprehensive in
    liking the girl that is in front of him not because he has to stay gentleman
    and not have erotic thoughts because who doesn't want to bang a cute girl in
    high school haha ah, but also, that his past is getting in his way. Trusting
    people, that is. Yet this ten levels higher of an angel dropped down on him
    and spoil him useless (title drop) beyond all doubt, to even make him think
    on whether it is okay to like such a perfect girl like
    <a
      href="https://twitter.com/WeeklyFamitsu/status/1639249712657371136?s=20"
      target="_blank"
      >Shiina</a
    >
    Mahiru. And boy, did his worries get resolved. The checkpoints have been
    clear, sir. You can now legally... go steady with the girl now that the
    class will be over with this and all the Amane and Mahiru fanclubs will shut
    down all over the class and everything. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... wow. Just
    wow. Hey, at least they gave a strong drop at the end, bringing us back to
    the title. I honestly did not expect anything out of this series to conclude
    since friends forever lmao, but boy did they make sure I remember that is
    not the case. It's the feeling of caring for someone important, dude. It's
    easier to say than do though, if you have someone you care about you will
    understand that, but for losers like me and those bunch of guys in class, we
    are probably just hoping for something beautiful to happen at some point.
    Not that it's a problem, but to do and experience all this... maybe it's not
    that easy after all. As a joke though, I'm just glad Amane isn't dead in his
    apartment from all the jealousy he's getting from those other guys. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Or yeah, history repeat himself from middle school. Well, he has friends who
    are cooler than him, he has some girl who will care for his stomach to say
    the least, and he has motivation to care for her now. What more can you want
    of this story? NOW we can call this romance series Jesus Christ we had to
    wait this long. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Very excruciating but satisfying process though,
    don't you think?
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; "I guess people can change when they meet someone they really care
    about" Still thinking about that, to be honest. Or not. Whatever. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>]

    likes me" HEY FUJIMIYA AMANE YOU KNOW WHAT F**K YOU DUDE!! YOU TRYING TO
    SHIT ON ALL THE GUYS IN THIS WORLD?? Chill, me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />
    [Now that I think about this and how it relates to my life, even if we are
    not talking about women (lol) I wonder if I've actually cared so much of
    something after all. Yeah, Klassic Note might be my escape from my supposed
    attempts back then as a kid, but even so I don't think I cared for this
    music library project enough, not even to their extent I would say, so I
    don't think I will do better even if I have found the woman of my life.
    Thinking about this series is making me cringe so maybe I should've stopped
    watching this after all haha I hate

    because why not they did not upload the full one years ago and aren't smart
    enough to do whatever MusicRay'n did with their TrySail talents' music
    videos and substitute with a full one from the short. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> THE ORAL
    CIGARETTES' new music video was for a song they released a month ago so I
    don't know if this will make me like it again the first impression was

    haha yep she delivered the news to us alright but she wasn't aware of what

    So next week. Yeah, next week we have some <b>Kroi's new mini-album</b> to
    listen to, some occult style Hip-Hop if I ever get them again we shall see I
    hardly did last year anyways to even justify them to be on the ranks, and I
    highly doubt this will change everything, but never hurts to give them
    chance on a low release week. Or maybe I'll take a listen to

    Maybe we conclude this week's post with some talk from AnimeJapan event
    in... Japan haha it's their yearly end of March thing to talk about Anime
    present and future to be honest, maybe past I guess "<a

    on YouTube so it was a mess to find out where all of them are, so I had to
    see them through my Twitter feed based on the Anime I follow on Twitter.
    Yes, official Twitter, bro, what do you know about those. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> For

    better after watching back the former which aired on the same time slot haha
    also likely because at this point the former's 5th girl of the harem (lmao)
    is losing to the 5th girl of the latter because

    one and learnt once again about how real Inorin is including her drinking
    black coffee. BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No wonder she was so skinny in that live
    trailer lol. See you guys again once more, and until next time... I don't
    know, go watch people play video games or something the new RE:4 remake is
    great to watch if it doesn't remind me of the whatever warts that might be
    growing on the middle finger of my right hand. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay I better stop
