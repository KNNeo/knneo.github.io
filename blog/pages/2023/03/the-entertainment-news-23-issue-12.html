Oh yeah we are kinda close to the end of the season already. Haha, how time
passes when you are enjoying yourself. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I meant Stray Dogs, by the way,
I will only miss more Mori Ougai tbh haha also Elise-chan too lmao
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah putting that as the intro is probably for the better, because damn did
  my weekend trips to the doctors not have much progress. Yes, it's plural.
  Yesterday to the clinic the doctor told me to come back in 2 months to take
  another urine test so basically telling me to live with the pain after I've
  been in it for a month?? BRUH haha also female so Happy International Women's
  Month. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Today's TCM visit is slightly better, I sure hope this is just a
  stomach infection so I'm just not ordering any bubble tea for this afternoon's
  watch party (lol) (hey Amazon Prime can we get Kotoko-chan up there too?) just
  because. So yeah, "living with the pain" looks like my year's motto now, I
  will update this again next week. Just, remind me to not put this as the intro
  because even I don't care. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anime and music I guess! I'm just mind full of Kido Ibuki because I bought her
  digital photobook recently so sorry Moeshi I just like her more <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span><br />

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Yeah, we still haven't figured out how your dad or granddad killed his wife!!
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well maybe in this new episode (#KyokouSuiri22) we will get
  something. Maybe. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So as expected everything much is going along with
  Kotoko-chan's plan, just that you know, the kids need some breather because
  damn is it a pain to listen for this long and also have to feel guilty about
  it haha hey maybe I was the one not listening attentively to university
  lectures lmao, and Kotoko believed that Rion will likely be the first to
  figure out a proper conclusion to the current proposition laid out in front of
  them. After talking with her father on the phone haha hey she just learnt you
  and the uncle wanted to kill my grandmother lol, but his father did end up
  providing a lot more detail as to why his brother would be better to succeed
  the company, and how all this is also rather unavoidable. Mainly because if
  would recall, the grandmother was taught by her dad to run the organization,
  and to tell her to press on his beliefs apparently including how to get your
  family together haha oh well think about that for your parent's case and how
  they aren't breathing down your necks for a second, then maybe tell me if the
  old woman will be right in going against what was her life motto so far with a
  red carpet success all this time. So looks like Rion ended up believing that,
  and as proposed to the rest of them, that the granny took her own life. Of
  course this will not end up possible considering our initial proposition was
  the husband did it, but she then reasoned to what if it was the husband who
  told her all the impact she has been making following her dad's decisions?
  Haha by the way, this is super unlikely but fair that none of them will know,
  the husband has NOT been successful in convincing her to put a stop to her own
  actions. I mean, right? She could've just said she is in some long-term
  illness and can't undertake the chairman duty and let the husband take over,
  and all this would have been solved. But no, someone thought death was a
  better option for her. Well, everyone else in the family too but let's not get
  too hasty. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The kids didn't really know that, so making such a
  deduction isn't exactly wrong by any means. And so, Kotoko accepted her
  answer. Because you know, she is also tired from all this lol especially
  Kuro-san I gotta say just standing there in a suit all day bro I also will
  feel tired and wanting to get laid on top of <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, so they presented it to
  the old man. He thought it was fine. Bear in mind he did want the kids to know
  that he is responsible for this but not of course knowing that the kids also
  intended to kill his woman lol how dare you she is my woman haha only I get
  to- Anyways haha, BUT, and I'm also sure this wouldn't end this smoothly just
  yet, Kotoko isn't going to let this session go so easily, saying that
  committing suicide making it like a murder is actually impossible to achieve
  without aftermath police investigations and such. Yeah,&nbsp;so Kotoko is
  trying to make sure the kids REALLY don't suspect this one bit and ensure what
  the old man wanted will happen. If you would recall, his whole purpose of
  doing this was not to let people believe that spirits are the saviour of
  changing the lives of us humans, specifically their lives. But of course, none
  of the kids even know
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/youkai" target="_blank">youkai</a> exist. So
  how will Kotoko make sure she did her job? I think we might have an episode
  reserved for that next week.

  </blockquote>
  Yeah okay with that large iron door I don't think Mushitaro is living the
  life. Yet. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well in this new episode though (#BungouStrayDogs48) and I
  CANNOT BELIEVE Mushitaro is still in this, yeah you bet he's going to send
  that letter out- No way dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, we have more interesting stuff to
  talk about apart from this sh*thead haha, so let's go over what actually
  happened this week. He escaped. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay that might be too obvious, but
  if you have not figured it out as he was writing his letter to a dead person
  lol, he can't go out on his own considering his Ability isn't offensive in
  nature. But Atsushi and Kyouka are. So recap, they were in the ambulance with
  now recovered Margaret (we will talk about her in a moment haha Kana-chan~!!),
  and of course are under Francis for a bit and acting to secure the escape of
  the one guy who can tell them more about Fyodor's plans. Sadly, Ango's gang
  has arrived. Mushitaro talks about him being scary in the government even
  though we know he is not but stay with me we will wrap this up in a bit, but
  of course he has to use a bit of his brain where he learnt from his dead buddy
  who by the way, he still hasn't helped in releasing the truth behind the final
  page of his novel let alone the final book lol here's a hint it's with Ranpo
  haha, so yeah in a way he is living his legacy of creating more mystery from
  this mystery itself, to run away from Ango. But alas, now that we have found
  out from ourselves that Ango himself is also an Ability user by the way, and
  specifically his is to find memories of people inside the items they leave
  behind which I must say is rather powerful if the escapees did not bring the
  money with them haha the cash is already crime-free why not just buy some
  Starbucks with it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, we can erase the evidence of that money used
  on that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/matcha" target="_blank">Matcha</a> Latte
  Frappuccino too. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> It's a thing in Japan, I assure you. Moving on,
  turns out Ango is NOT trying to capture and/or kill them, because turns out, I
  would consider my deduction was correct in that Ango is working on the outside
  in accordance with Dazai's orders. That's probably how he knew of Mushitaro's
  location (which by the way he has NOT been killed by Nikolai, but likely
  captured by the police instead which I assume Ango has some control of), and
  how he can ensure his presence with this lot because, as the man said it
  himself, Ango is not with the weird organization in the government meant to be
  evil. As we have seen at the start of the season, Ango was likely worried that
  the death of Detective Agency will cause trouble within the nation's powers
  and boy does it we knew so much since then, and probably sought out to tackle
  the outside world himself after contacting Dazai, I assume. Which of course,
  is linked to the past arc we have seen back in season 2, fitting back the
  final puzzle piece of the relationship between Ango and Dazai after the death
  of... let me find the name... Sakunosuke, yes. Yeah the guy who can see like,
  3 seconds into the future lol. Interestingly, this is also why Ango was made
  an evil character in Mushitaro's impression to not let them meet which I think
  is likely because something with searching memory and erasing crime would make
  Ranpo even more unpopular of a detective than he is now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Yeah, you
  think you are smart now, <em>punk</em>?) Anyways, the final part of this episode
  is more important, so let's not talk about it quick. After doing this much and
  getting all of them under Margaret's spell haha she should be happy that
  Atsushi is in this LMAO but okay stay focused, Mushitaro reveals as much as he
  knows which of course doesn't include the other 3 members of the Angels lol
  why would he be able to know that, but the pages that triggered the framing of
  the Detective Agency still leaves them with just one page more for their final
  motive: To erase the state of I assume, Yokohama. I don't know if the subs
  and/or the dubs are messing with me lol, but this feel like a "we need a world
  prison" thing and Yokohama sounds like a place for it I guess lol. All in all,
  fantastic wrap-up of what happened so far I suppose, and Atsushi has brought
  back hope of getting Detective Agency back together assuming that in 10 days
  they can write that they are innocent by the end of all this. Haha he's just
  going to scribble "Also the Detective Agency is innocent" and alllll will be
  resolved lmao we shall see if that will happen in due time. Or maybe they are
  just going to run out of space haha ever had that problem when it was an
  open-book test? Been there lmao

  Mahiru in first place so that's just unfair even in the standpoint of the
  female students in the class itself lol we will talk about them in a bit, but
  yeah, time to collect our prizes I guess!! Haha Amane got his ear cleaned real
  good by Mahiru-chan over here, and the girl... spent a great time with his
  boi. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean, what else you think she wants in return? She already
  thinks she is blessed to have someone who understands her. We are just glad it
  isn't female. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Happy International Women's Month- Haha okay joke's over
  I can't do this all month. Anyways, someone did doze off just digging them
  ears for him though how is the pick not stuck in Amane's brain right now lol,
  and in the guy's defence he did try to call to the girl to wake her up even
  doing pretty much everything besides &lt;insert porno genre here&gt; lmao so
  he did the gentlemanly thing by bringing her back home. Next door. Yes, using
  her keys. Putting her inside her very room with the rumoured teddy bear by the
  bed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, we gotta find out the truth somehow, today was the day.
  Oh and that's the shrine- NOPE, DIDN'T SEE NUTHIN'!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey Mahiru-chan?
  It was also dark, no one turned on the lights so we can't see who that picture
  frame of some dude in a school uniform is anyways. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Imagine if that
  is like, Kadowaki? Haha Amane will be *flips table* I swear haha but serious
  talk though: You dumb b*tch how many times Amane need to explain to you that
  you need some decency around people- Moving on I guess haha, let's talk about
  the ACTUAL ikemen. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Kadowaki of course, who else? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He's good
  at sports, he's cool hanging out with Amane haha pls we know Amane is the less
  handsome one, and he is nice helping out Mahiru now his acquaintance at
  teacher work because the teachers are lazy in Japan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, not true,
  Mahiru was also likely just being considerate anyways. Besides, what better
  place to hang out than just in school? Oh, we have to listen to the background
  talk of how people hate Mahiru-chan here? <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> Maybe we do this at home.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of, and I guess even I will think Mahiru has split
  personalities, but the guy isn't exactly wrong in saying that she is not even
  close to being herself in school but we know that is in fear of getting into
  trouble and possibly upsetting the mother who doesn't give two birds about her
  life right now. <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> Maybe we get rid of the mother. Haha wrong Anime, sorry.
  Also Kadowaki, bro? Not everyone likes you being cool too. Mahiru doesn't. *<a

  giggles* And that's why we watch this Anime because compared to the voice
  acting of Mahiru in this, Anime "Tada-kun" SUCKS!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay me, relax,
  that was in 2017. All in all, this sharing of concerns and emotions and
  considerations between the couple here... aren't we just friends? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Friends show each other their weak side I get it, but showing THIGHS?? BRUH
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But as you can see, we are nearing the end of whatever this
  relationship is, and man, am I not excited for the drop because what else can
  they do anyways? Haha blow my mind please, but suffice it to say, maaybe we
  just treat the final episode(s) as just another day, yes? This is a light
  novel adaptation after all, can't expect these guys to kiss. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> We
  shall see, we shall see. At least give us the confession, please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

[TL:DR; "As long as I have someone who sees me as I really am, I think I'd
rather just be myself" That's just great advice honestly I just don't have that
person lmao okay maybe my bro]

    Hmm wow we are halfway through March already huh. Hey, we got new songs to
    talk about though! So let's. Well
    <b

    isn't impressive though as I watched a music video from last week I still
    ended up giving
    <a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/etude-of-adolescenc-feat-haruko-nagaya/1672261369?i=1672261370&amp;l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >Nagaya Haruko's collaboration song</a
    >
    because it isn't bad. I didn't really give the other collab songs though,
    guess I really was in because of Haruko-san's voice. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I also did
    give an instrumental track from the ska band though, so let's see SPECIAL
    OTHERS trash them half a year later. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on,
    <b
      ><a

        target="_blank"
        >anewhite's new EP</a
      ></b
    >
    is actually not bad, though I did not give a good number of topic songs as
    I've heard of them in the past year, but I did give the new songs, so that's
    a good reminder their usual style being much more to my tastes. I also did
    give a listen to
    <b

        href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/eye-rendezvous/1675026467?i=1675026826&amp;l=en"
        target="_blank"
        >frederic and Fujifabric's collaboration song</a
      ></b
    >
    as I saw their music video on YouTube and it isn't bad, so I think I will
    just give it. Really reminded me of their most popular (but not to me) song
    "<a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/oddloop/1154372767?i=1154372879&amp;l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >Oddloop</a
    >", but then again frederic has always sounded like this so thank goodness
    they have some variety making songs with someone else even though it still
    sounds like them. I like the occasional frederic slip-in in Klassic Note,
    what can I say haha<br />
    <br />
    So, about the new stuff that has been making waves on Twitter, and if you
    missed it here's a summary of what I've followed. Kajiura Yuki's own band
    <b

        >FictionJunction's new album will feature an Aimer collaboration</a

    in a song of course so what else is new she is everywhere now haha I meant
    Aimer-san.

    gave a strong feel of retro matured songs and I'm starting to think why she
    likes this genre to be honest, is she that old-fashioned? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

    after I found out hey these guys are releasing new songs, listened to the
    trailer and be like I wish I could be on the event to buy the damn thing but
    as usual I guess we will wait.

    along with a tour announcement so I wonder how much I've missed from these

    miracles from this Anime singer again after I just reviewed one last month.

  <div>
    <br />Next week looks like it's idolism week, so take note my opinions of
    them will be lowered and/or raised so I enjoy mainstream better haha who am
    I lying to anyways. Also, <b>SIX LOUNGE's new single</b> is still mainstream
    but going for it being an Anime theme song one would consider it being in
    review, but I have heard of the B-side in a studio live livestream they did
    last month so I don't think so, maybe we give another chance. Other than
    that, it's idolism haven haha because

    will be her first self-composed release so yeah I guess you can say it's her
    first baby (lol) so let's see why she really loves to sing retro matured
    songs all this time. No joke, it somewhat feels the same as some of her
    singles. And who cares about

    Seriously considering how much effort will it take to manually "fix" my blog
    for all the elements we've done for this series so far to align to the
    latest. I can find those I need to fix, but since this is Blogger and I hate
    to use their API lol also I suck at updating HTML elements apparently
    because this upgrade process is a mess and don't ask how I did for the
    thumbnails before, I will have to change some of the content of old posts to
    make them work today, for example the hashtags you see on the top of the
    page. Just go 2 years ago and those aren't even there. You can't even click
    on the thumbnails to switch, you must hover your mouse. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well that's
    the least of my problems. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, maybe someday. Or not. Who am I
