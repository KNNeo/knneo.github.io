Yeah, the package arrived a week earlier than expected lol RIP White Day dude don't worry we have Moeshi's birthday incoming<div><br></div><div>Anyways, welcome back, I did a lot for Saturday including a lot of housekeeping... in front of the PC of course lol my room is still a mess, so I wish for more time for do any of these... next month. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Don't ask if I have done much on the Three Candles Plan; I still haven't played a video game since the 2 weeks ago haha well I guess the remake of that mini-game on my GitHub site will count</div><div><br></div><div>And I guess if you need a video recommendation you can watch <a href="https://twitter.com/AzumiLogin/status/1633818551319695361?s=20" target=_blank>Ajuju's final livestream of her semi-regular gameplay series</a> (which I would say if you want to continue go join Nan-chan hehe fill up her alternate week schedule on Fridays), where (for free viewers) she played an hour of Mario Party minigames with her "Blend.S" crew so Akarin and Haruno Anzu she has changed a lot she knows I like long black hair, and boy I like gamer Ajuju when she loses. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See her photobook 2 years ago for more info lol this video doesn't show her chest though-</div><div><br></div><div>Well, let's wrap up the week with some Anime and music!! It's kind of a relief to not have to watch 4 every week though. Not like 3 is any better but 2 of them are sequels so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Oh I gotta do the 3-2-1 thing? Uh... only one of them is great? haha BOOM)</div><div><br></div><div><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KyokouSuiri21><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kyokou Suiri</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Just what did I get dragged into?" Same girl I don't know how I ended up watching this series lol</div></blockquote>Wow telling the kid you can take grandpa's money and do whatever they want? SIGN ME UP haha okay in this new episode though where we are not dealing with inheritance just yet (#KyokouSuiri21), we are dealing with the bad, bad things your grandfather did. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, he killed your grandma. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And as the door closed behind the old man, Kotoko actually suggested something probably way worse than what was supposed to happen ie. three of them suggesting how the murder was performed, but instead to tell them to come up with one together and THEN they can decide on the inheritance together. Good thing is, they all have their standings on how they want their inheritance, so we should be fine. This is not your typical Taiwanese family drama where everyone wants all anyways. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> So yeah, easy step 1. But Rion aka the daughter of the first son can't help but wonder if there is another intention behind the gathering of the descendants to proclaim the granddad's involvement in the grandma's death. Smart kid, this girl, but also, why go through so much is probably also what the kids are thinking about. Problem is, they strayed even further from the original plan where the kids start to confess on their side on their plans to murder their mother in order to set things straight. Bruh, can we not scare the youngest person here? Talking about Rion-chan, please. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like, the two brothers did intend to kill their mom (Happy International Women's Month lol) and let a fight between them be an alibi for one of them to go do the deed while the other vouched for his presence, but turns out it has already happened and they did not do anything else other than pretend quarrel despite planning it for so long. Kaoruko, the only daughter, also had plans along with her husband who the mom hated and disapproved of, but instead of faking a sprain on the leg she actually sprained her leg and was probably not in a condition to do the deed herself. Welp, should've knocked your leg off harder. Yeah, my leg hurts too hearing what her husband has to say, same bro. <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> Anyways, as Kotoko-chan said, she does not give two f**ks about them confessing to their crimes despite all the murderous intent that was filling the room freaking dear Rion-chan out haha, but more importantly, we had already realized that just like any rich family drama, many would have had the same thought if a certain someone was ruining everyone else's lives. The mother, in this case. So yeah, get thosr confessions off their back first before we ACTUALLY think of the crime itself, yes? Also, what do you think the intention can be if the dad gathered all of you around and said he did it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You think he knows of all your plans to kill his wife? BRUH <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... well I was just here for some storytelling but man we don't even need Kotoko-chan to flame anything up and the whole house is already on fire. But now that the fire has ceased, maybe we think of it again. On literally WHY, we are framing your old man for the death of your old woman. No really, you guys are innocent, we promise you. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Daddy got the easy way out lmao</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3zB13FrhhrHyNyFPEqVIUQqFXs82813IedWIqlFKHjbbSbroCTPcFJiH9wp0pwnQDLQdzal7BcXzA__u8QeQAZaIGXgfC3fjiW5sHs13MonmQU9LoFfz6IU9OGcr4bx8bvJxNNxNYn0bjWepPNB0D1KsD47dqOGCLw6b5H0xtLr_GK3LKY-xn_vqi/s320/kyokousuiri21_kotoko5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Ignoring Kotoko the bath does look real good haha <br>(Still planning on a hotel escapade someday, still planning)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieX8obkQBORlhregXZkmKnmH3KI22b1kR0rBWhwjuVEjRCbN3odzHjVnQIM1lQqDjx2zLqL7lHK39o8p2wyuaZt63oBxLj8FQWNj68HDudHarJNOmre04nMqh8y8lS3ERi6g3x5jraPeE98-YHrU2mUxe5q7KQym0VMzQlSTGNMeTWDaI0uSkD5MQg/s320/kyokousuiri21_rion1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Also, Rion-chan best girl now? lol</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Also makes you wonder they let out their weakest underlings to protect the Agency members, and Francis probably doesn't mind sacrificing Margaret. Oh damn, they just delayed getting rid of Kana-chan, huh. Haha noooooo in this new episode though where the deception continues (#BungouStrayDogs47), Francis betrayed us big time. Not surprising, he really likes to side with the stronger side, and the Agency isn't that side as of now. But wait, THERE'S MORE. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Turns out, Francis sides with the rich ie. he knew the author of the series lol <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> so HE KNEW who will win in the end, but also means the ambush was really from the military and not from him. Uh oh. Well, thank goodness we can still trust someone here <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> we will get to that in a bit, but this double betrayal? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not possible. Well, then obviously, the military knew of the trap, faked what was an ambulance and try to blow it up in front of Kenji, and then stabbed him? Man, this fifth member of the Hunting Dogs sure is something. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> They managed to escape into Port Mafia's underground maze though, so for a while they might be safe. Yosano instead suggested that the 3 of the Agency members split up instead and try to gather again at the safe point if they can be there alive, and they went off. Interestingly, Yosano ended up in front of the REAL ambulance which has Margaret and Atsushi and Kyouka which might explain how we know that Francis might be in this plan instead. (Yeah, I like to believe the exit to this was planned but from Louise's side, for Yosano to meet the real ambulance) But wait, the sword guy caught up. How? Haha we will deal with that for later, but looks like one of the Port Mafia members had to stay and fight the guy considering we have what, someone on a stretcher. Though wow old man, you are impressive. You just blew my mind again ever since season one. *wipes off tears* No really, YOU CAN DO THAT?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Too bad, that didn't last too long, so maybe RIP you won't be missed lol. I doubt he's dead, and I might have an answer for that in a bit, so let's move on to another secret location of Port Mafia haha dude this organization has a lot in place for this, but then they were quickly caught up by the sword guy once again? O~kay you might have figured it out already but I promise you I didn't until it was mentioned by Yosano-san, there was a traitor. Among us. *sus* No no, as in, every time Yosano walked somewhere, the traitor was among us. Obviously I'm not going to suggest the other two Agency members since who knows if Kenji is still alive lmao, but yes, it was from Port Mafia. Turns out, wink wink if you don't want spoilers leave now, one of the two who brought Yosano to the underground, Tachihara, was the traitor. (Oh thank goodness it isn't Gin she is so cute and Akutagawa's <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> that cannot be possible also my imouto by the way NAN-CHAN!!~ Haha it was intense and it's my excitement of hearing the voice acting not someone stabbing themselves lmao) Though yeah both have the most talk time so far in this series, it was the guy who stood out of the most in this episode considering hey guess what, he was around us all along. Or else how would he know his "boss" Mori-san was ordering him to take out a never-dying medic, how he knew where Yosano walked in the maze and be able to find her this quickly haha how coincidental to AFTER the ambulance left lol you think I might have contradicted myself but maybe Francis does know about this part but can't do anything, and how Gin's dagger can still function when some Port Mafia member suggested to put a bomb at the door so any Ability user who passes by will be dead. You think? You think it works on some 5th Hunting Dog member who we knew can manipulate metal? He can dispose of that bomb faster than I can scream upon the collapse of Gin, dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay gotta summarize now. TOTAL. TWENTY-SIDED. CARNAGE. My brain is still trying to process all this by the way, but I think a good summary is that the 5th member of the Hunting Dogs is a traitor in Port Mafia. Which easily explains why nothing happened to them when the incident happened earlier. They won't be, since they are under control. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> More exciting and crazy movements just like that sword that flies around and scatters and more, only on the only action series I watch today. Don't, don't talk about Titans I wanted that to end already lol</div><div>[TL:DR; Uh Yosano I have bad news: If a perfectly disguised traitor reveals themselves, it means you HAVE to die.

"Work was fun, as strange as it is to say." F**k off haha wait-</div><div>[Actually now that I watch it back haha knowing about the traitor, I like how Tachihara is impressed with the old man Hirotsu's Ability which I had to recall was just force manipulation, so he can easily deflect anything metal with his hand, but this guy has never seen it executed before. As in that metal thing he had to pretend was his physical form and the real Hunting Dogs him and also Port Mafia him- You get the idea haha]</div><div><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=OtonariNoTenshiSama10><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Otonari no Tenshi-sama ni Itsunomanika Dame Ningen ni Sareteita Ken</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Are you doing anything on Mother's Day?" I intend to make you a mother- Who am I joking I can't even touch Mahiru-chan haha</div></blockquote>Let's see what's up next on the calendar lol it's like this series is like me waiting for the next big occasion in life. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, mine's meaningless so far but this time around it'll be something since in this new episode (#OtonariNoTenshiSama10) we talking about Mother's Day, dude? Amane's mother?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No, don't talk about Mahiru's mom I wish I can send a spirit fox to kill her. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Interestingly, we are NOT talking about moms no more while we continue to cultivate on this relationship which bares no qualms on how far it can go, despite taking its own pace. Haha am I doing well on this summary? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, boy tells his backstory, it's just him realizing how to not trust people easily which yeah same but that also only got me "classmates" as I graduate so what else is new, and I still felt like Mahiru's story is sadder since you know, irresponsible parents. <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> Anyhow, the returns of pampering comes back and forth, and we are now overcharged in canoodles on Amane's side after this? And we gotta return the favour if she is sad someday? No, I'll NEVER do that; I'll keep this change forever. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Because yeah, gotta make the girl happy, dude. Can't bear to see her be sad. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> So yeah, pick-up lines longer than the lines at the food court I eat for lunch hours lol, because it's okay on the guy side since the girl knows no shame, but yeah, not for the guy it's not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Because are you even a man if physical contact with women isn't CONSTANTLY on your mind? Haha this girl has no idea. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh here we go speaking of which as asked by her classmates who saw her outside, Mahiru just say he was your brother or something. Or yeah even better just say you were working as a rental girlfriend. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> That's a "KanoKari" reference and I apologize for my sense of humour. Moving on, and this is just a rollercoaster ride haha because I'm pretty sure Mahiru failed in logic in school lol, she was just contradicting herself of course on the relationship she has with this special man in her life I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But hey, she is just clarifying herself I guess, and yeah popular people blah blah she can say whatever she wants and not get slapped yet, I know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This is pure, so let's stay pure for this, yeah? No physical violence here unless it's <strike>getting humped by 1x <a href="https://twitter.com/WeeklyFamitsu/status/1634171835834335238?s=20" target=_blank>Shiina</a> Mahiru</strike> getting humped by the exam cramming HAHAHA no really which maniac puts THREE papers in one day?? Because it's that bad though, I guess everyone including Kadowaki who just looked like he witnessed some spectacle at Amane's place lol, had to gather to study as much as Itsuki doesn't want to. There's also reward on the line too, Amane, so you better work hard before you work hard, if you get what I mean?? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> All in all... boy did they not show a trailer for next episode but, do they even teach sex ed in Japan?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, Mahiru, we don't talk about those thoughts. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, I did learn them in high school to be honest and if you did read on my past few photobook reviews I knew of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gurabia target=_blank>gravure</a> idols way earlier than any male would have, so... yeah, I probably can't hold back as much as Amane would if I were him. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Dammit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, nice episode and it really feels like Amane is right when he says this girl is <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shuuchi target=_blank>humiliating</a> him the best way she can but she doesn't know what she did is also a porno genre haha ah, is also bringing them closer than ever as they become ever so honest with each other. Whether it's backstory, or their... their desire to want to bind each other of their physical forms. Haha good now I won't get banned I will take note on the thumbnails lol we are only getting a kiss at the end anyways haha don't worry I've seen dozens of this before lmao</div><div>[TL:DR; At this rate I think I need to prepare my heart for next episode. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You think the sex will happen?

And of course I was sad of the lack of good songs to listen to from the indie artists so I went out of the way again to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/somehow-somewhere/947853321?l=en" target=_blank>Homecoming's 1st album</a></b> from their indie days back in 2014 where they are only singing English songs... boy it reminded me of Ajikan but otherwise it wasn't easy to give apart from the one I listened from a YouTube music video which started this particular journey. I did end up giving a couple more songs though, and maybe I will stop for a while so that their new album next month will be refreshing to say the least. We can but hope.<br><br> Wow there really much in my world of music on Twitter actually, so let's go through these quick. If you can't wait for me to talk about <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1632525182731714561?s=20" target=_blank>SkaPara's new song</a></b> with RyokuShaka's vocalist collaborating song then please help yourself I will talk about it specifically next week. More <a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1632667343460638720?s=20" target=_blank><b>Kana-chan's live excerpts</b></a> are on YouTube including one which this particular one I did not give. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Finally after this many years <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kayanoai_0913/status/1633845096100798466?s=20" target=_blank>Kayano Ai's solo music debut mini-album is now on streaming</a></b> services after the initial physical release with a photobook I won't regret not buying lmao, still blocked me on their YouTube livestream to celebrate the occasion but I'm not that keen already so why listen in to what Kayanon has to say, yes? <b><a href="https://twitter.com/specialthanks_7/status/1634482765361205249?s=20" target=_blank>SpecialThanks' new music video</a></b> is for their new song which released this week but I wasn't that keen it was a normal song so maybe next major release then. I literally did that last year with the new EP from last month and I just gave the bulk of them so yeah, that way. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br>So for next week, this one is even less hope than this week's releases, I will take a listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/junk-or-gem/1672261369?l=en" target=_blank>TOKYO SKA PARADISE ORCHESTRA's collaboration mini-album</a></b> thanks to Ryokuoushoku Shakai's vocalist Nagaya Haruko's involvement in one of the songs, and let's see if their ska music will get me. I stan for only ORESKABAND on this genre don't ask me why. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh yeah I should also listen to <b>SCANDAL's new song</b> in a while it has been a while since their album last year, and looks like <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/anew/1671540415?l=en" target=_blank>anewhite's new EP</a></b> is releasing next week too and we had a great relationship with them so why not again, eh? I really wish for them to be good their are indie but just didn't have much success with me personally so I don't know. <br><br><br><br><br> Oh yeah I'm stuck with another round of watching Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" past seasons again haha this time on Amazon Prime Video because I have a subscription and they have Japanese animation now. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Well, OF COURSE I had to go back to watch Gin's reveal haha Episode 30 by the way lol, but man is Nan-chan so short-changed on this series I feel bad. Then again is she even in Anime these days? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, cya guys next time then, I wish I could be happier but I need to prep for my bro's birthday and I think I have until Plan D at this point for his birthday present so let's see how this works out. Maybe I buy him a gravure photobook instead lol it's just better and closer to what he wants other than a girlfriend. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> That I can't help bro; You can't ask someone single who has you as a friend to find other girls for you. Haha let's see how that pans out then<br></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
