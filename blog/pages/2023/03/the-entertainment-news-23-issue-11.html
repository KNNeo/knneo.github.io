A very happy birthday yesterday to Touyama Nao for being so girlfriend all year
and also doing charity again this year- Okay but who cares though I just did a
photobook review of Nagae Rika earlier this week and SHE IS JUST *chef's kiss*
so be sure to go take a look! Yeah, the package arrived a week earlier than
expected lol RIP White Day dude don't worry we have Moeshi's birthday incoming
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, welcome back, I did a lot for Saturday including a lot of
  housekeeping... in front of the PC of course lol my room is still a mess, so I
  wish for more time for do any of these... next month. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Don't ask if I
  have done much on the Three Candles Plan; I still haven't played a video game
  since the 2 weeks ago haha well I guess the remake of that mini-game on my
  GitHub site will count
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And I guess if you need a video recommendation you can watch
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >Ajuju's final livestream of her semi-regular gameplay series</a
  >
  (which I would say if you want to continue go join Nan-chan hehe fill up her
  alternate week schedule on Fridays), where (for free viewers) she played an
  hour of Mario Party minigames with her "Blend.S" crew so Akarin and Haruno
  Anzu she has changed a lot she knows I like long black hair, and boy I like
  gamer Ajuju when she loses. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> See her photobook 2 years ago for more
  info lol this video doesn't show her chest though-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well, let's wrap up the week with some Anime and music!! It's kind of a relief
  to not have to watch 4 every week though. Not like 3 is any better but 2 of
  them are sequels so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Oh I gotta do the 3-2-1 thing? Uh... only one of
  them is great? haha BOOM)

  Wow telling the kid you can take grandpa's money and do whatever they want?
  SIGN ME UP haha okay in this new episode though where we are not dealing with
  inheritance just yet (#KyokouSuiri21), we are dealing with the bad, bad things
  your grandfather did. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, he killed your grandma. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And as
  the door closed behind the old man, Kotoko actually suggested something
  probably way worse than what was supposed to happen ie. three of them
  suggesting how the murder was performed, but instead to tell them to come up
  with one together and THEN they can decide on the inheritance together. Good
  thing is, they all have their standings on how they want their inheritance, so
  we should be fine. This is not your typical Taiwanese family drama where
  everyone wants all anyways. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> So yeah, easy step 1. But Rion aka the
  daughter of the first son can't help but wonder if there is another intention
  behind the gathering of the descendants to proclaim the granddad's involvement
  in the grandma's death. Smart kid, this girl, but also, why go through so much
  is probably also what the kids are thinking about. Problem is, they strayed
  even further from the original plan where the kids start to confess on their
  side on their plans to murder their mother in order to set things straight.
  Bruh, can we not scare the youngest person here? Talking about Rion-chan,
  please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Like, the two brothers did intend to kill their mom (Happy
  International Women's Month lol) and let a fight between them be an alibi for
  one of them to go do the deed while the other vouched for his presence, but
  turns out it has already happened and they did not do anything else other than
  pretend quarrel despite planning it for so long. Kaoruko, the only daughter,
  also had plans along with her husband who the mom hated and disapproved of,
  but instead of faking a sprain on the leg she actually sprained her leg and
  was probably not in a condition to do the deed herself. Welp, should've
  knocked your leg off harder. Yeah, my leg hurts too hearing what her husband
  has to say, same bro. <span title="*ugh*">🙄</span> Anyways, as Kotoko-chan said, she does not give
  two f**ks about them confessing to their crimes despite all the murderous
  intent that was filling the room freaking dear Rion-chan out haha, but more
  importantly, we had already realized that just like any rich family drama,
  many would have had the same thought if a certain someone was ruining everyone
  else's lives. The mother, in this case. So yeah, get thosr confessions off
  their back first before we ACTUALLY think of the crime itself, yes? Also, what
  do you think the intention can be if the dad gathered all of you around and
  said he did it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> You think he knows of all your plans to kill his
  wife? BRUH <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... well I was just here for some storytelling
  but man we don't even need Kotoko-chan to flame anything up and the whole
  house is already on fire. But now that the fire has ceased, maybe we think of
  it again. On literally WHY, we are framing your old man for the death of your
  old woman. No really, you guys are innocent, we promise you. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Daddy
  got the easy way out lmao

  [Yes, that was waaaay too obvious or I mentioned this last week, Rion is
  voiced by the one and only Iwana Manaka-san. She has a rather unique voice
  though. Or maybe I've listened too often of her in Anime- Heck, "Tenshi-sama"
  too! So yeah, probably.]

  Oh well, turns out Mori and I were correct, it was a trap. Also makes you
  wonder they let out their weakest underlings to protect the Agency members,
  and Francis probably doesn't mind sacrificing Margaret. Oh damn, they just
  delayed getting rid of Kana-chan, huh. Haha noooooo in this new episode though
  where the deception continues (#BungouStrayDogs47), Francis betrayed us big
  time. Not surprising, he really likes to side with the stronger side, and the
  Agency isn't that side as of now. But wait, THERE'S MORE. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Turns out,
  Francis sides with the rich ie. he knew the author of the series lol <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> so
  HE KNEW who will win in the end, but also means the ambush was really from the
  military and not from him. Uh oh. Well, thank goodness we can still trust
  someone here <span title="*wink*">😉</span> we will get to that in a bit, but this double betrayal?
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Not possible. Well, then obviously, the military knew of the trap,
  faked what was an ambulance and try to blow it up in front of Kenji, and then
  stabbed him? Man, this fifth member of the Hunting Dogs sure is something.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> They managed to escape into Port Mafia's underground maze though, so
  for a while they might be safe. Yosano instead suggested that the 3 of the
  Agency members split up instead and try to gather again at the safe point if
  they can be there alive, and they went off. Interestingly, Yosano ended up in
  front of the REAL ambulance which has Margaret and Atsushi and Kyouka which
  might explain how we know that Francis might be in this plan instead. (Yeah, I
  like to believe the exit to this was planned but from Louise's side, for
  Yosano to meet the real ambulance) But wait, the sword guy caught up. How?
  Haha we will deal with that for later, but looks like one of the Port Mafia
  members had to stay and fight the guy considering we have what, someone on a
  stretcher. Though wow old man, you are impressive. You just blew my mind again
  ever since season one. *wipes off tears* No really, YOU CAN DO THAT?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Too bad, that didn't last too long, so maybe RIP you won't be missed lol. I
  doubt he's dead, and I might have an answer for that in a bit, so let's move
  on to another secret location of Port Mafia haha dude this organization has a
  lot in place for this, but then they were quickly caught up by the sword guy
  once again? O~kay you might have figured it out already but I promise you I
  didn't until it was mentioned by Yosano-san, there was a traitor. Among us.
  *sus* No no, as in, every time Yosano walked somewhere, the traitor was among
  us. Obviously I'm not going to suggest the other two Agency members since who
  knows if Kenji is still alive lmao, but yes, it was from Port Mafia. Turns
  out, wink wink if you don't want spoilers leave now, one of the two who
  brought Yosano to the underground, Tachihara, was the traitor. (Oh thank
  goodness it isn't Gin she is so cute and Akutagawa's
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> that
  cannot be possible also my imouto by the way NAN-CHAN!!~ Haha it was intense
  and it's my excitement of hearing the voice acting not someone stabbing
  themselves lmao) Though yeah both have the most talk time so far in this
  series, it was the guy who stood out of the most in this episode considering
  hey guess what, he was around us all along. Or else how would he know his
  "boss" Mori-san was ordering him to take out a never-dying medic, how he knew
  where Yosano walked in the maze and be able to find her this quickly haha how
  coincidental to AFTER the ambulance left lol you think I might have
  contradicted myself but maybe Francis does know about this part but can't do
  anything, and how Gin's dagger can still function when some Port Mafia member
  suggested to put a bomb at the door so any Ability user who passes by will be
  dead. You think? You think it works on some 5th Hunting Dog member who we knew
  can manipulate metal? He can dispose of that bomb faster than I can scream
  upon the collapse of Gin, dude. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Okay gotta summarize now. TOTAL.
  TWENTY-SIDED. CARNAGE. My brain is still trying to process all this by the
  way, but I think a good summary is that the 5th member of the Hunting Dogs is
  a traitor in Port Mafia. Which easily explains why nothing happened to them
  when the incident happened earlier. They won't be, since they are under
  control. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> More exciting and crazy movements just like that sword that
  flies around and scatters and more, only on the only action series I watch
  today. Don't, don't talk about Titans I wanted that to end already lol
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; Uh Yosano I have bad news: If a perfectly disguised traitor reveals
  themselves, it means you HAVE to die. RIP.]

  [Actually now that I watch it back haha knowing about the traitor, I like how
  Tachihara is impressed with the old man Hirotsu's Ability which I had to
  recall was just force manipulation, so he can easily deflect anything metal
  with his hand, but this guy has never seen it executed before. As in that
  metal thing he had to pretend was his physical form and the real Hunting Dogs
  him and also Port Mafia him- You get the idea haha]

  Let's see what's up next on the calendar lol it's like this series is like me
  waiting for the next big occasion in life. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, mine's meaningless so
  far but this time around it'll be something since in this new episode
  (#OtonariNoTenshiSama10) we talking about Mother's Day, dude? Amane's mother??
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No, don't talk about Mahiru's mom I wish I can send a spirit fox to
  kill her. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Interestingly, we are NOT talking about moms no more while we
  continue to cultivate on this relationship which bares no qualms on how far it
  can go, despite taking its own pace. Haha am I doing well on this summary?
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, boy tells his backstory, it's just him realizing how to not
  trust people easily which yeah same but that also only got me "classmates" as
  I graduate so what else is new, and I still felt like Mahiru's story is sadder
  since you know, irresponsible parents. <span title="*ugh*">🙄</span> Anyhow, the returns of pampering
  comes back and forth, and we are now overcharged in canoodles on Amane's side
  after this? And we gotta return the favour if she is sad someday? No, I'll
  NEVER do that; I'll keep this change forever. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Because yeah, gotta make
  the girl happy, dude. Can't bear to see her be sad. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> So yeah, pick-up
  lines longer than the lines at the food court I eat for lunch hours lol,
  because it's okay on the guy side since the girl knows no shame, but yeah, not
  for the guy it's not. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Because are you even a man if physical contact
  with women isn't CONSTANTLY on your mind? Haha this girl has no idea. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Oh here we go speaking of which as asked by her classmates who saw her
  outside, Mahiru just say he was your brother or something. Or yeah even better
  just say you were working as a rental girlfriend. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> That's a "KanoKari"
  reference and I apologize for my sense of humour. Moving on, and this is just
  a rollercoaster ride haha because I'm pretty sure Mahiru failed in logic in
  school lol, she was just contradicting herself of course on the relationship
  she has with this special man in her life I can't even. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But hey, she
  is just clarifying herself I guess, and yeah popular people blah blah she can
  say whatever she wants and not get slapped yet, I know. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> This is pure,
  so let's stay pure for this, yeah? No physical violence here unless it's

  getting humped by the exam cramming HAHAHA no really which maniac puts THREE
  papers in one day?? Because it's that bad though, I guess everyone including
  Kadowaki who just looked like he witnessed some spectacle at Amane's place
  lol, had to gather to study as much as Itsuki doesn't want to. There's also
  reward on the line too, Amane, so you better work hard before you work hard,
  if you get what I mean?? <span title="*wink*">😉</span> All in all... boy did they not show a trailer
  for next episode but, do they even teach sex ed in Japan?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah,
  Mahiru, we don't talk about those thoughts. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I mean, I did learn them
  in high school to be honest and if you did read on my past few photobook
  reviews I knew of
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gurabia" target="_blank">gravure</a> idols
  way earlier than any male would have, so... yeah, I probably can't hold back
  as much as Amane would if I were him. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Dammit. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, nice
  episode and it really feels like Amane is right when he says this girl is
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shuuchi" target="_blank">humiliating</a> him
  the best way she can but she doesn't know what she did is also a porno genre
  haha ah, is also bringing them closer than ever as they become ever so honest
  with each other. Whether it's backstory, or their... their desire to want to
  bind each other of their physical forms. Haha good now I won't get banned I
  will take note on the thumbnails lol we are only getting a kiss at the end
  anyways haha don't worry I've seen dozens of this before lmao
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; At this rate I think I need to prepare my heart for next episode.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> You think the sex will happen? With

    >I'm not praising them</a

  because their music is kinda... out of place. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, maybe you guys
  can try the others out if they haven't disbanded. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on though,
  this week's new release was

      >Ooishi Masayoshi's new single</a
    ></b
  >
  and I think just like back then in 2017 when I gave their single I did not
  expect anything better because I don't know if he can pull off any other songs
  like the topic song so I did give more. And of course I was sad of the lack of
  good songs to listen to from the indie artists so I went out of the way again
  to listen to

  from their indie days back in 2014 where they are only singing English
  songs... boy it reminded me of Ajikan but otherwise it wasn't easy to give
  apart from the one I listened from a YouTube music video which started this
  particular journey. I did end up giving a couple more songs though, and maybe
  I will stop for a while so that their new album next month will be refreshing
  to say the least. We can but hope.<br />
  <br />
  Wow there really much in my world of music on Twitter actually, so let's go
  through these quick. If you can't wait for me to talk about

  services after the initial physical release with a photobook I won't regret
  not buying lmao, still blocked me on their YouTube livestream to celebrate the
  occasion but I'm not that keen already so why listen in to what Kayanon has to
  say, yes?

  is for their new song which released this week but I wasn't that keen it was a
  normal song so maybe next major release then. I literally did that last year
  with the new EP from last month and I just gave the bulk of them so yeah, that
  way. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
</div>
<div>
  <br />So for next week, this one is even less hope than this week's releases,
  I will take a listen to

      target="_blank"

    ></b
  >
  thanks to Ryokuoushoku Shakai's vocalist Nagaya Haruko's involvement in one of
  the songs, and let's see if their ska music will get me. I stan for only
  ORESKABAND on this genre don't ask me why. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Oh yeah I should also
  listen to <b>SCANDAL's new song</b> in a while it has been a while since their
  album last year, and looks like
  <b
    ><a

      target="_blank"

    ></b
  >
  is releasing next week too and we had a great relationship with them so why
  not again, eh? I really wish for them to be good their are indie but just
  didn't have much success with me personally so I don't know.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br /><br />
  Oh yeah I'm stuck with another round of watching Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs"
  past seasons again haha this time on Amazon Prime Video because I have a
  subscription and they have Japanese animation now. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Well, OF COURSE I
  had to go back to watch Gin's reveal haha Episode 30 by the way lol, but man
  is Nan-chan so short-changed on this series I feel bad. Then again is she even
  in Anime these days? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, cya guys next time then, I wish I could
  be happier but I need to prep for my bro's birthday and I think I have until
  Plan D at this point for his birthday present so let's see how this works out.
  Maybe I buy him a gravure photobook instead lol it's just better and closer to
  what he wants other than a girlfriend. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> That I can't help bro; You
  can't ask someone single who has you as a friend to find other girls for you.
  Haha let's see how that pans out then<br />
