This is definitely the latest I'll be watching Anime for Sunday so hey, let's
start in the afternoon, shall we? If "Twitch Chat Jukebox" does not ring a bell
with any of you guys then maybe we should move on and not talk about how none of
the things we are talking about here will be in that since I woke up to watch it
this morning lol okay there's Attack on Titan theme songs OH KAGUYA-SAMA haha
okay me
<div><br /></div>
<div> We'll get right into it then! I literally spent the whole of yesterday re-creating a game I've seen on a video game and am intending to let people try it out so let's see who will give a damn during lunch with my colleagues tomorrow. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't talk at work so this is going to be hard lol<br /> <div><br /></div> <div>  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KyokouSuiri20"> <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span  ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kyokou Suiri</span> </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <div style="text-align: center;">  "I'm sure you are surprised to suddenly be asked to meet with an older  gentleman you don't know" Me when I welcome the new female colleague lol </div>  </blockquote>  "Iwanaga-sama"? Did I actually marry her into my rich family where I- Who am  I joking I'm not rich. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Haha in this new episode (#KyokouSuiri20)  where we are talking about rich people haha cringe... well what's probably  more cringe is the wave of feminism we are dealing with here. Like,  Kotoko-chan is here, right? And you say getting rid of women makes things  better? BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, where's my chiffon cake if we have to walk  about another tale of the deception? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, story again I guess.  Hey, these are short, straightforward, but they are stories. Really missing  Rikka-san already though tbh lol you sure she is the antagonist? Haha moving  on, let's talk about the incident? Hmm is this even it? More like a lesson,  I would say. Otonashi is (not  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/55841/Io_Otonashi" target="_blank" >Io</a  >  because he's not) the dying and leading elder of the corporation he has  retired from, and is now <strike>soliciting young girls</strike> asking  Kotoko-chan to help him with a lesson to his kids. The lesson is that, to  not trust youkai and stuff to do anything in life, which was what he did two  decades ago where he made a deal with a (not  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Youko_Hikasa" target="_blank" >Hikasa</a  >)&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/youko" target="_blank">Youko</a>  to kill his wife for him to literally transform the family, for the better.  The problem is, as you can see, his life now and his kids are the opposite  to this lesson. With his wife's death and persistent character for order and  fast paced change, she has brought up the corporation from the father as  well as ruin the lives of everyone around them at the same time. Problem it  sounds like, and not like this old dude had anyone to turn to for help at  the time, but that is until this spirit fox appeared. As this idiot has  confessed to Kotoko-chan lol, the condition for the execution of this third  degree murder was to use the corporation's powers to develop a hotel near  the mountains instead of letting it be taken over by I don't know, other  youkai of its species? Sure, dude. I guess you can solve issues the other  way around ie. using humans as youkai, instead of the usual way that we have  seen so far. We are also hinted from Kotoko-chan on her time at the  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ge-musenta-" target="_blank" >game center</a  >  with her boyfriend (lmao) (hey they holding hands I guess they are lol)  (okay maybe not after Kuro-san says she's a turn off for him haha) a few  things that will make this old man's plan rather hard to help with in the  first place. But yeah, it came from Kotoko's parents so not like she can  reject this assignment. The old bloke decides to hold a "contest"? Yeah sort  of, to reveal the truth behind this particular murder, and to let them find  out that the mother/grandmother is indeed killed by the husband. Problem is,  of course, is if they are smart enough to figure that out. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> That yeah,  and that's also why Kotoko is here: to judge, and to guide them towards the  truth. <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> Why all this trouble, isn't it? Because simply even just  meeting them for two seconds, the second son is already doubtful that his  father killed his mother already. That's why we had to do all this, I  suppose. Nonetheless, sounds like a boring lesson waiting to happen I can't  wait to just watch the recording at 2x speed of haha that's a university  lecture joke, but one thing that bugs Kotoko will bug me, and boy we are not  far away from the end of this season so yeah, why the old man trust the  youkai business so much? Unless he knows a someone by the name of Sakuragawa  Rikka, we will never be too sure. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Let's see if I am right lol I hope  someone is right because I'm probably like the eldest son who rather just do  his own business then deal with inheritance lmao&nbsp; </div> <div>  <div class="thumbnail"> <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"  >   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img   border="0"   data-original-height="720"   data-original-width="1280"   height="180"   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqMynrdy5avwEHHU8_b3mTUgdmIJKcXlRSQDkC2oigdPqLZgQf7gpJ7NaG35Jc17QoiQ0hpdczlNrkcVBDDcMnjVYtNB8hO9TCoc0H_quGkSfKmqxOzb2MLJWxlsdkctNgHy_mOJlR3VuXfaHv3wny6V7mR2SnnoCPILqKIbjWgD13lN7QGdV4McCx/s320/kyokousuiri20_fubuki4.jpg"   width="320"    />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    How to identify a rapist lmao   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div> <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"  >   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img loading="lazy"   border="0"   data-original-height="720"   data-original-width="1280"   height="180"   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9q8J7egVtv09CHP8FQ4kRVN504oHplcZr_FQEOf6hSlxDW_y7PHTQUP9CZ_VA7iKkb7Lk956y5IY26GNif0wkcqvvEw7C4lIETdUoA6hRSMjE-K4TQX_BTSO0xsB1QWAzcbtp8LM_ctIP56z5RW41UaHrDPbH2Hp_UnYZHqv67kdLNJTXjS916EQL/s320/kyokousuiri20_wolf1.jpg"   width="320"    />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Oh boy how are you still humping on a corpse lol   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div>  </div>  P.S.

All of his friends are gone at this point lol </div>  </blockquote>  Oh we gonna find out about Yosano-sensei's story with the Port of Mafia? I'm  listening, go on. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where we are literally in  enemy territory but this one has a ceasefire I guess (#BungouStrayDogs46),  are you even a medic if you are not Yosano though?? Just saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  God, imagine if you can become what you are at like, 11, but you have to be  near death? Well I wouldn't do that personally but someone will. Haha like,  if you are in a war. Yeah. So I can date kid Yosano again, why not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>  So okay, didn't expect them to start a story based on a war they mentioned  like probably two seasons ago but yeah, why not? Back then not surprising  Mori Ougai was working as a medic and hired Yosano for her powers to she can  insta-revive soldiers to fight in a modernized war again. I know right, why  use tanks when there's Chuuya and Atsushi and stuff haha but hey, this  fictional world is just learning how to use Ability users in their war  efforts, okay? It's just like the advent of many things and how AI bots will  take over my programming job. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways, this should not be a  surprise to you the moment Yosano talked about healing the one guy who lost  half his body and it came back, because she can't heal their souls. Mental  health, as in. Because really, not even me with all my love for &lt;insert  idol name here&gt; will want to go to Japan to meet them in person.  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey I won't but I know someone will, to the point of marrying them  lol yeah my bro shared an article of some dude married to his idol who is  younger than them <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span> but anyways haha, I'm pretty sure no one will go  out and fight if the problem isn't that we have technically infinite healthy  soldiers. Also, no way to lose. Doesn't mean guarantee win though, take  note, as Yosano constantly heals soldiers physically and then getting beat  up on their mental health, won't make them any happier and they are better  off taking their&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;own lives because living is hell now.  Not much comparison to nowadays living in society but don't quote me on  that, would'ya? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I just review Anime. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So apparently Yosano  could not take all this pressure being an angel of death (lol shout out to  Fyodor and his gang you guys aren't OG angels of death) so I guess she did  hamper her side of the war a bit to be locked up looking like a deranged  killer with mental health issues. So she basically became a Kyouka-chan is  what you are saying. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey girl, you want to do a cosplay of Yosano?  Just cut your hair down. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But what made Yosano come back again isn't  Mori who opened that door, isn't Fukuzawa who recruited her of all people,  but apparently Ranpo-san. Who I guess did the same thing as Dazai I suppose,  only saved their members because of how kind they are to people, suited to  be a protagonist instead of antagonist, kind of way. Not wrong, but I would  rather take this idea in the lines of "then don't heal everyone". If their  lives are cheap if you heal all, then heal those you care. This is a healing  Ability not like, the next wholesale market weekend. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that's  probably what brought her back in my opinion. Don't... don't ask what  Fukuzawa and Mori-san are talking about we don't need an undying military.  Maybe robots for war though, maybe. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So all in all, yeah... well at  least we know Yosano is not going to die next week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or ever. Not  that they can't kill her, but more like they won't. Not sure about the  people around her though, so take my words on that lol. This is quite  interesting to be honest, talking about this part of fictional history we  don't know much about, but you know, it's fresh. We are still walking into  the trap unarmed though (literally), so let's see what will make of any of  them. Hey, maybe we will actually get Margaret back? Fingers crossed,  people! The deception of any hope for this wonderful action series will just  go on as long as all of them are human haha yeah it's like being in  Tanizaki's Ability all the time- </div> <div>  <div class="thumbnail"> <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"  >   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img   border="0"   data-original-height="720"   data-original-width="1280"   height="180"   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8CK6ga7lHXzkWXUczPDUdzv_idRwf66IQzDuJSH2hFIyBxf7q_ku2WIdDa9Gj5m__lBqPzGEHsxvtuUmri0LC6VDgv-xDaGYakNjhRzT-WDc9D7S59J6Mths--2-WsQV4KbZXIBudHocs1l4C7U8jvLjh2x1Ut1eSOr1JL43ToP_9wyfuHYi1MVbn/s320/bungoustraydogs46_bunk.jpg"   width="320"    />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Okay why is Mori Ougai always spotted hanging out with little    girls-   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div> <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"  >   <tbody>  <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">    <img loading="lazy"   border="0"   data-original-height="720"   data-original-width="1280"   height="180"   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgx7wc9d9zwgQ9UMisxyOklEORAfAeg9UnGZBYF1Fo_O50bkV0yKMXQ1ynnM4XBGyAlH9Hoe9Zre0IKdUK_rmh4nD70tUfs0ev9uqo_0oPCqaom7vaLUY9ow1iO56IFpWzv6cdoOOoVU7vZStLUx-pTnp57ftiSNpTWd51Kva8pZfM8WfR2JwRQo55f/s320/bungoustraydogs46_elise.jpg"   width="320"    />   </td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    OH ELISE-CHAN SO CUTE!!- WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO YOU<br />(Haha    like really, between this and present timeline)   </td>  </tr>   </tbody>  </table> </div>  </div>  P.S.

In the end, this guy chose not an  amusement park thank goodness I've gotten sick of those, nor the theatres  which I guess someone please go with me to watch the exclusive "Kaguya-sama"  movie screening here thanks haha, but instead went for a  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/nekokafe" target="_blank">cat café</a>.  Before that though, Chitose dropped over for a cooking lesson from master  chef Mahiru and don't guess what she might have done to this poor not  couple. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, human observation is valuable, don't you think?  Especially when they are sleeping haha dude, I wished I looked cute when I  was sleeping. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But *yawns* I don't haha, so let's move on the real  deal, the day itself, and I don't know why Mahiru but why you bother so much  of what you look like to your friend?? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Of course they gotta let  girls out in the public to pick this guy Amane up on the streets because hey  he is still under generic ikemen territory but nope this is Mahiru's ikemen  you b*tches don't you dare get a touch on him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Missed opportunity  though, he should have gone out with those two; This one doesn't want to be  girlfriend. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Also, shouldn't have gone out with class ikemen Kadowaki  around lmao because damn is he the first one to spot these two out in public  haha we know there have been rumours of a  <a href="https://twitter.com/WeeklyFamitsu/status/1629108092473585665?s=20" target="_blank" >Shiina</a  >  Mahiru going out with a handsome guy but they don't know it's Amane. And not  this guy right in front of them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You see, Kadowaki, just because  <a href="https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20230215/18/natsukawashiinablog/25/e7/j/o0600045015243550315.jpg" target="_blank" >Shiina</a  >-san doesn't like you doesn't mean she isn't into  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a>, just  saying. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Haha yeah Amane is HER ikemen. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Holding hands and  patting heads might still be forgivable, but yeah cooking at your place?? I  can only say sir, your defence against your two friends Itsuki and Kadowaki  at the karaoke the next day won't save your rear any longer than you can  hope, I tell ya. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But reality check though, guy can like girl, but  girl... girl REFUSES to- Okay who are we lying to we have only a couple more  weeks left. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, a very fruitful Golden Week for the both  of them on top of each other LMAO okay not that we know nothing will happen  between those two but what is with Mahiru wanting to kiss at the end...? We  don't know, it's unlikely we will seal the deal this season with one, so  let's not think too much and just move on! Okay they held hands already we  got chance for <i>maybe</i> a hug. You still got another voucher? We can  still redeem again hehe </div> <div>  [TL:DR; "So, like a  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kayoiduma" target="_blank" >housewife-in-making</a  >?"

Also yeah, that's him seeing  past and future whatever bullsh*t lore if you could recall. This first part  of a final of a final conclusion arc of whatever this Anime series has taken  us lol (#AttackOnTitanFinal01), I will not deliberate on the one-hour  special just because it is quite a lot of content and this is pretty much it  yep it's no series of 12 episodes, so let's see how much I can recall  without looking back at what I just watched. Boy, this is going to be rough.  Hey, EVERYTHING in this special alone (which I will refer to from now) is  rough, what else is new. If you would recall and I shall summarize quickly,  that negotiations with Eren failed on stopping him from activating the  Founder Titan powers and triggering the Rumbling along with Zeke in the  reunion with his brother, has started to bring havoc into the rest of the  planet as the parade of huge Titans walk out of the island. Well, not as  large as the Founder Titan structure itself but we will get to that in a  moment lol, but it is taking out lives left and right as they walk through  Marley without much resistance. So yeah, RIP. Yeah I'm going to copy paste  that a lot of times, thanks to Eren. Then if you would remember about  <strike>Eren's memories</strike>&nbsp;(*ahem* focus) the guys trying to fix  the prototype airplane so that they can fly and try to catch up with Eren's  moving wall, is meeting all sorts of obstacles including Annie not wanting  to join because she's got enough of that sh*t called war and wants to spend  the last times thinking of his boi Armin who is going into war though so RIP  to Armin too haha. We also got Floch who just appeared to shoot the plane  and delaying it from taking off because he still managed to crawl despite  being brutalised he is still on Eren's side, and Hange-san who had to pay  the price of that by fending off the titans to give them more time to fix  the plane as it was damaged. Hey, at least we get to see Heaven early, shout  out to that. Nice. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, at least we got Reiner and Pieck  (*umph* haha) to help us out and oh hey yo we still got Levi!! Haha don't  worry no one will forget about you; You can take a break before we slot you  in at the right moment. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Moving on haha he's joining in by the way  with two fingers on the trigger, and we made sure Gabi and her boi are in  the ship with the Hisuzu ambassador so they don't try anything funny. Come  on, what's funnier than all of them on the plane just talking about what  they did to make Eren like this today, to each other? Yeah as if we aren't  sad enough of Hange's passing in order for them to take flight? Hey Connie  can we not trauma dump right now? We got some planning to do here. But turns  out all that isn't much necessary because (1) Eren heard everything but yet  is not stopping them from getting to him which is somehow backed up by the  fact that Eren does not mind if they stop him because looks like he is  trying to achieve a limited Rumbling, and (2) Zeke is the problem and the  first they will attack upon arrival considering he just took out  <strike>an</strike> the remaining airship force with what was that, electric  stones? RIP that air force you won't be missed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all as we  progress to the point where confrontation or even fighting being the only  option left for them... Eren, what you said to that kid about the future  that cannot be changed, is that a hint for the conclusion? Haha this sounds  like a  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/68537/Yhwach" target="_blank" >Yhwach</a  >  thing now lol that's a "BLEACH" reference. Too real, but I don't think that  will change Eren's mind as he said over his public Titan Internet portal  thing lmao I forget terms please forgive me for my "sins" haha, and for sure  won't change the minds of everyone else around him. They may have made him  think otherwise, but it's very much on him to ensure the safety of Paradis,  I assume. As such, he thinks doing enough damage will ensure the rest of the  world won't rise back up again. Yeah bro, is this how you think humanity  works? Ha, what a joke this kid is. NO, it doesn't matter unless it's  complete annihilation. And we are MOST DEFINITELY not letting that happen.  See you in half a year haha see note below </div> <div>  [Note: Part 2 of this... extravaganza will air in at least half a year's  time based of the&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/status/1631693138715869186?s=20" target="_blank" >official Twitter</a  >&nbsp;and don't ask me if I will be happier if these are as movies together  or aired on TV.

And since there really isn't much to give  next week I'll drop by Audioleaf again which will be my first for the year.  That's a hit and miss though so I will come back with good stuff if I find  any, fingers crossed.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Oh wow the Anime "KanoKari" event just ended and gave us a teaser for season  3 and boy this really looks like "Hanayome" series now with new 5th girl  voiced by Serizawa Yuu who is definitely NOT my thing she is already ranking  lower than Yuuki Aoi who is pretty much down there already haha wait do you  guys not know of my girlfriend ranking for the series? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> You...  should have figured it out by now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Cya guys next time then and  until next time hopefully we will see the next package incoming haha aw  dammit why Kana-chan fanclub membership card you just showed up out of  nowhere I just shipped out lol. Oh well, maybe next month for that but we  have a great line-up for the upcoming one so stay tuned. Otherwise, stay  alive, me; I <i>really</i> don't want to do a package review in hospital lol  haha what<br /> </div>
