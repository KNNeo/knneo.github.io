  This has been a month in the making, this very blog post had to be prepared
  for the whole week just because, and I conceptualized this almost a month ago
  to give credit to doujin artists and after following some of them for more
  than a year, I think I can confidently do this now.
</div>

  This is the closest I can make it to a Comiket without actually being there.
  This is what people do if they had a lot of money (and didn't have to pay for
  international shipping) and actually went to every single booth out of the
  hundreds of them at Tokyo Big Sight to check them all out.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This, is MY PENULTINATE REVIEW, of Japan's 102th Comic Market!!</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Shall we begin?</div>
<div>(*This is a long post you have been warned)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE ORIGIN</div>
<div>
  If you have no idea of the world of not Anime, let me fill you in. We are
  specifically talking about doujinshi, fan-made artwork which are initially
  derived from you guessed it, original comics and animations which are familiar
  to the masses, but turned out to be more indie in nature, from the world of
  anthology works to even originals that will stand out in the crowd. Comic
  Market ie. Comiket, is the biggest representation of all this and cosplay
  which is also another branch of Japanese culture where people dress up as
  their favourite characters, is historically held in Tokyo Big Sight for the
  past couple of decades. If not for the world being on fire for the past couple
  of years, this one marks the first in-person event back on location instead of
  utilizing the Internet, spanning throughout the weekend of 12-13 August 2023.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Today, many of them take it up to the Internet to display their work albeit
  for free, and they had to try to sell their artwork in physical form from time
  to time to keep up with their own passions. And that's why I started thinking
  of paying them my respects like I owe them all of this greatness, to save
  artists from being internationally abused or more commonly exploited on the
  Internet due to lack of consumer knowledge (I don't have to find examples
  <a
    href="https://twitter.com/yako_FLPR3/status/1698677211388363217?t=SSRdTNrHZej0AYLIQohLlA"
    target="_blank"
    >authors just repost these fan observations</a
  >), among many other reasons that will put their careers at risk. And I'm not
  even talking about the recent trend in AI and how these artwork drawn by
  humans will be used to fuel tomorrow's machine learning models.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So as you can see, there is plenty of motivation to do this despite the
  logistical hurdles. I've been into these so much I actually put them up as
  phone wallpapers on days I don't want my voice actresses even today lol why
  are you lying to your Ajuju <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>&nbsp;As to what made me end up with this
  bunch though, it will be a longer story to tell...
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  See, some of these artwork aren't exactly of age lol but I'm not buying those,
  but still, among the websites to buy these,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/"
    target="_blank"
    >Melonbooks</a
  >
  is easily the largest online store for such works, and here comes the first
  hurdle not mentioned in the 10 volumes of "Douki-chan" I've bought: They
  require Japanese identification in order for you to sign up. Yup, that sucks
  for me during end June when I was deciding on how to get this going, so my
  alternative will be to rely on proxy services which are aplenty nowadays
  because they just cost money. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I chose to settle with Buyee instead
  of Zenmarket due to the latter's choppy ordering arrangements (I had to chat
  with them to align the local shipping fees and availability as they banned
  some of the items) (hehe), and I was initially only motivated to buy Chigusa
  Minori-sensei's artwork in the form of postcards which are exclusively sold on
  Melonbook (exclusivity is one of their tactics by the way). But over the
  course of the month of July, more new publications were announced for the
  event and on Melonbooks, and I realized I could not miss out on just ordering
  some cards and NOT pad the order. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I only got around to ordering using Buyee when August just started but this is
  where my issues began: Pre-order and everything else were ordered separately
  by them. In regret, I now recall that Zenmarket will be able to compile them
  together, making me save on shipping fees and/or be able to align the timings
  considering that, and this is what got me anxiety for the past week, the
  initial list of items arrived had to wait almost a month for the pre-order
  batch to appear. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Almost had to pay for more money just to keep
  additional days the former batch on their warehouse. I even went on to inquire
  their staff via email because tracking wasn't even showing separately on their
  website, which is probably more infuriating than I thought. (Zenmarket always
  from now on, me)&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE PLAN</div>
<div>
  Remember when I mentioned I wanted to pad an order of just postcards from this
  Minori-sensei? Yep, that was the initial plan. I scoured the site to find more
  of the similar item so I can showcase some sets of postcards out and not need
  to buy books since they are bulky and take up space in my room which is
  already chalked full of stuff (hehe). Eventually though, as Comiket closed in
  and more books were announced for the event itself, I could not help but
  consider why not support the artists the best I can by giving their books
  worth of (ah hey)&nbsp;<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/irasuto"
    target="_blank"
    >illustrations</a
  >&nbsp;a go?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  The current plan was to forsake any postcard and other types of merch (they
  have
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/posuta-" target="_blank">posters</a> and
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/dakimakura" target="_blank">body pillows</a>
  if you want lol) and focus on
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gashuu" target="_blank"
    >illustration books</a
  >
  from the big to small ones which:
</div>
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      They can only feature originals so no anthology books also screw you
      <a
        href="https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail/detail.php?product_id=1870602"
        target="_blank"
        >"Otonari no Tenshi-sama" and your postcards</a
      >
      haha I do not Anime here
    </li>
    <li>
      Screw you also mobile games because "Blue Archive" fanart have only been
      ruining my social media feeds lately
    </li>
    <li>
      They cannot be mature-rated and Zenmarket can actually help me check that
      as they have to list it on their site first (I didn't buy via them lol
      <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span>)
    </li>
    <li>
      They have to be sold in Melonbooks haha that's the whole point of this
      title
    </li>
    <li>
      The artists of these works can be found in Pixiv and/or Twitter/X and
      that's an assumption I make to all of them just for profiling purposes
    </li>
    <li>
      They must make art I like - Anime-like drawings, proportionate body
      figures, cannot have too much detail - and we will elaborate more on that
      later (Sorry for asking for perfection but what did you even expect out of
      this? Welcome to the world of 2D haha)
    </li>
    <li>
      They cannot be sold exclusively on location since I won't be able to buy
      them and promoting them on social won't matter in this case
    </li>
    <li>All the items total are to stay within 20k JPY (~200 SGD) in budget</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  As such, we will cover 11 other artists apart from Yomu-sensei which will not
  be featured here but instead will be replaced by the Comiket 102 catalogue
  made by Melonbooks themselves, we will cover that later.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE ARTISTS</div>
<div>
  I feel like putting a summary here before we proceed, so here are all the
  artists in review based on various criteria which I think are relevant to our
  topic of conversation going on. I will not, however, talk about their
  relevance in the industry because there will be no end to this but you may
  find some of them familiar here if you know of them, specifically in their
  involvement on character design in specific virtual YouTubers that are the
  thing these days.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  In case you wondered, and I've bought their manga series 10 times
  already,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/y_o_m_y_o_m" target="_blank"
    >Yomu-sensei</a
  >&nbsp;was supposed to be in this package but I bought it separately as you
  have seen weeks ago. So yeah, they are in a different level. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oh, and
  why we don't talk about how they have twice the followers on Twitter/X
  compared to Minori-sensei. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Haha that's how the world works dude

  This post will feature as much review talk as possible by (1) not showing any
  "rated content" as there will be quite a lot I promise you lmao, and (2) not
  showing too much content as as much as I like to show these off, these are
  still copyrighted material and they are not heavily circulated online (yet),
  and by (3) sharing their respective social media posts if I can find them, and
  leave the rest to your imagination.

  I will also refer to all of them from here on as "they", because gender is not

  <div>Ah, about that faded block on the last book though...</div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>HOW IT ACTUALLY WENT</div>
  <div>
    Well, let's talk about what went wrong. If you would recall, the plan was to
    get 12 books to review, 11 of them are featuring doujin artists and their
    own illustrations, but welp, that didn't go the way I want. Due to having to
    ensure the logistics will go my way, I hesitated for weeks in order to make
    the pre-order batch aligned with the others (and ordering them separately
    won't make this easier because storage time) and some items in the pre-order
    batch, just went out of stock.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    And that was&nbsp;<b>Nakamura-sensei's first illustration book</b> under
    doujin circle RIKKA (which will be mentioned again later), and it sold out
    real quick considering they have quite a following online and people are
    quick to know about this. Still, I wish I was quick to the chase when there
    are several occasions where I could have placed a pre-order (due to updates
    on the site, people may cancel) if not for my dumb actions which I tried on
    the Thursday before its release date when I recall I was on course and I
    could've done on the morning I saw it was available, also in that weekend
    when I saw that happen again in the evening and it wasn't until late night
    did the proxy service catch up. I know, I can only blame myself, the biggest
    regret I have so far this year alone <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, and I cannot stop looking at
    that product page every day to see if any glimpse of hope will happen after
    its release date during the Comiket weekend.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    So yeah,
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/donmai" target="_blank">don't mind</a>
    that! I can't keep dwelling on this. Maybe we can do this again and I'll try
    to get a copy! <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    Okay okay let's unboxing! It has to happen every month now haha I know we
    may have a lot to talk about but still THIS!?? *open box hand gestures*

    Starting off, and this is probably the reason why I started all of this and
    ditched my initial plan of buying their character postcards, it's
    <b>Chigusa Minori's illustration book!</b> This is their first I believe,
    and it's about <u>a couple of girls in involved with each other</u>, to the
    point of sexually. Yes, this is
    <a
      href="https://twitter.com/minori_chigusa/status/1544608544422789121?s=20"
      target="_blank"
      >the yuri couple</a
    >
    that is frowned upon(?) in society and somehow alright in the world of Anime
    (lmao), even still, this is not a popular genre in itself. However against
    all odds, <u>Minori-sensei impressed us with their lovely drawings</u>, a
    somewhat compelling story now I'm less geared towards shy Shino-chan with a
    huge rack and more towards aggressive handsome girl Ren-chan, and I'm not
    going to mention how much

      >gratuitous skin exposure</a
    >&nbsp;(click at your own risk) you'll see on their works. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still,
    I've followed them a long time coming
    <u>I'm pretty sure they are the first for me on Pixiv</u> equivalent to
    marupi-chan on Instagram (not relevant but) which makes this more impressive
    than I can ever thank them for.

    Next up, and I'm surprised I'm more excited after I've seen it for myself,
    this is
    <b>92M's illustration book for their regular comic series "Kinshi no Ane"</b
    >! I knew of this series mostly due to them
    <a
      href="https://twitter.com/92M/status/1485810721095294976?s=20"
      target="_blank"
      >being somewhat idolizing of&nbsp;Yomu-sensei on social</a
    >, and despite the kinda lacklustre drawings, I think what drew me in the
    most is the lore, and boy I really should not say that, about a sibling
    relationship where the elder sister loves her younger brother too much.
    <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We will unveil that as I talk about the book in a bit, but I feel
    like I may have caught up with all the story and not have to go with my
    initial plan of buying now FIVE volumes of the comic series. As you will
    also see the dialogue is drawn in unlike actual Manga which are typed in, so
    it's a bit hard to read even by my proficiency level. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, this
    is a wonderful series with delightful pictures of an elder sister to please
    (hehe), so if you are into *ahem* not *ahem* sibling love this will go right
    up your- Ears, ears haha there isn't Anime adaptation here but you fancy
    ASMR?
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    There's a lot more lore on this though so if you are any interested I
    IMPLORE you to buy the whole series down and tell me the story lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

    I feel like we should have done this before all these but heck, let's do it
    now! This is <b>Melonbook's C102 Catalogue</b> where obviously Melonbooks
    curated a bunch of artists with their artworks to give you a general idea of
    what is going on in the doujin fair! Interestingly, they also sold
    <a
      href="https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail/detail.php?product_id=2008399"
      target="_blank"
      >a more complete edition featuring 120 artists</a
    >
    but then that did not come with event tickets so that you can actually spend
    even more money considering that there is ALSO
    <a
      href="https://melonbooks.akamaized.net/special/a/2/POP/images/212001401359.jpg"
      target="_blank"
      >a rated version of the catalogue</a
    >&nbsp;featuring mature artists which obviously I didn't buy or else I can't
    even show you the cover lol. But otherwise this is just a smaller selection
    of 23 artists so that I can talk about some of them, and overall it's just a
    more expensive illustration book featuring artwork you might not like.

    Alright we can move on for now and talk about the rest and I promise it
    won't be as long as the first two above, we have reached pure territory
    people and this is a rarity in my opinion or maybe it's because they are
    Taiwanese, this is
    <b>Hiten's spring season illustration book!</b> This is their 15th already
    so talk about experience in the field this might be the longest, I followed
    them after

      >what legends I've seen from them</a
    >&nbsp;that I can stare at forever, and ironically, I did not buy their book
    for this Comiket. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> This is also one of those cases where the
    <u>older illustration books caught my eye more</u>, so I went with their
    latest spring season book! Trust me, and I'll show you how I have made the
    right choice real quick, and also expect this to be the average size of
    these books which cost below 1000yen, we are in that price range now. Easy
    on the wallet, is what
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/doujinshi" target="_blank">doujinshi</a>

    to liking the rest of their work.

    Alright so next up, and damn I'm sorry for saying the long ones are over
    because this one <b>Miwano Ragu's 10th anniversary illustration book</b> is
    obviously worth 10 years of content from them, I think specially done for
    Comiket 100 which was last year so I missed it totally haha, still think
    <u>their artwork is very jack-of-all-trades awesome</u>, a master at none
    but whatever they draw, however they draw is very representative of their
    animated style, and
    <u>I can confidently say I liked 80% of the 50 images they showed.</u> I
    mean, less talk more images, I guess! Captivation is what I think the theme
    is to be frank, it's just amazing imo

    Moving on down to smaller <strike>boobs</strike> books (haha) but moving up
    to celebrity status, up next we have
    <b>Fuumi's summer compilation illustration book</b>! Eh, this one is also
    not new, this one is from Comiket 100 too I really missed doing this one a
    year ago and I'm sorry, but this is very relevant to the season we are at
    now, it's all about summer! So yeah, light clothing is a theme right here
    and also as mentioned earlier, they are the
    <u>character designer for Hololive VTuber Tsunomaki Watame</u>- And
    introductions over haha remember I said not to talk about celebs too much?
    Still, <u>their artwork is on the lines of Anime standards</u> so I won't
    complain, but I will nag about why this is
    <u>basically a sellout book</u> talking about their recent works for other
    mainstream Anime works and so on, making me want to share less of them if
    possible lest I get copyright strikes. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Well, let's show what we
    can then! Haha you wait till these indie stuff get popular in 2 years and
    this site gets taken down...

    Well, not to be confused with Ragu-sensei here so I decide to put Watame in
    between these guys so I can remember their names separately, this is
    <b>Rangu's illustration book for Comiket 102!</b> Yes, finally some latest
    stuff haha, but then again who am I lying to many of these are drawn over
    time and shared online, but still. This one I took a little fancy on them
    mainly because of the
    <u>slightly more emphasized lines in their drawings</u> which I think I got
    used to, and I think they got me time and time again on Pixiv so I decided
    to give their latest publication a go. Yeah, it's as if they set me up to
    buy this book, which will be what most of them here are also so don't think
    too much into that. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also don't be too surprised to see sellout
    portions here, <u>they are currently doing a gallery in location?</u> That's
    cool actually, being able to see people admire your work at this modern day
    and age. And that's why they have half a million followers on Twitter/X? If
    you aren't impressed, I am. Let's see more daily lives of beautifully drawn
    2D women- That is for all of them haha

    Oh boy let's keep this train going we are in newbie territory now I think,
    this is <b>Sano Hiyori's very first art book</b> for Comiket 102! I have to
    say right off the bat though, for being quite a newbie in the field I think
    they started 2 years ago,
    <u>the drawings are quite up to (my) standards</u> and I'm really impressed
    on what I see though I also see a lot of skin but what is Anime without some
    cleavage and revealing outfits, isn't it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Jokes aside, I actually
    saw this while I was thinking of what to put in my cart from Melonbooks, and
    despite how hard it is to use their filter functions,
    <u>I managed to see this gem within the pile of books sold,</u>&nbsp;and did
    not hesitate to take their work into consideration. I think this is what it
    feels like to like bunny girls then- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

    Moving on towards pureness again because I wonder why I can't just buy these
    artwork and move on haha rack is where all the money's at apparently, this
    is
    <b>Komizuki's very first illustration book!</b> It's not meant for Comiket
    and this was released end of last year which was a compilation of their
    works over the past few years from back in 2019 where they were even softer
    in their art, but for me though I noticed their work most because of their
    <u>fine drawings against soft and balanced backgrounds</u>&nbsp;<a

      >so good they can be desktop wallpapers</a
    >
    if you have not noticed that sooner than me or the artist themselves as they
    write their comment in the book. That is probably the ideal combination I
    can think of with regards to these art forms so see Hiten-sensei again, and
    <u>this is probably more along the lines of what I think doujin art is</u
    >&nbsp;and is worth following. I may be wrong, but I think this purchase is
    right, you can't stop me. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

    <b>FuwaOmu's first illustration book!&nbsp;</b>I was first fascinated from

    <u>keeping to the Anime-like drawing standards</u> someone made a decade ago
    I don't even know who now, but heck, if this is something standard and

    Man, I like this trend of firsts in these artbooks because damn are there a
    lot of firsts here for the lot of them which are actually great starting
    points to encourage them to sell some of their artwork for all to see. This
    one though, is&nbsp;<b>KUREHA's illustration book release for C102!</b> They
    did not get a slot on this Comiket and the upcoming winter one though and
    that's a pity, but that does not stop them from releasing something to
    commemorate the occasion. Actually, they have released TWO books for the
    occasion, with one of them, uh, rated R-18 in Japan. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course, the
    one I possess is not the one that will get me banned, I think what might
    have gotten me when I saw their works on Pixiv from time to time is likely
    the focus on
    <u>very sizable proportions of a woman which many men want</u> and I as a
    heterosexual male won't deny I want

    or anything, but honestly saying anything goes for me at my age and this
    one's 18 too. I meant the character in this book, not the artist. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    But I would argue that&nbsp;<u
      >this might be more than borderline unsafe for my everyday viewing
      standards</u
    >&nbsp;(haha) and just like 92M-sensei, they have a (Pixiv) FANBOX account
    where they let you unlock not just high resolution images, but those with
    more skin to the point of nudity. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I shall elaborate no more I'm
    not going to sub to see those anyways haha you are also won't get to see

    Phew, I rubbed out a long one. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm sorry, rode- "wrote". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    My arms are aching for the past few nights as I take photos and type the
    stuff out above steadily every night by the way, not like these women will
    be massaging my shoulders after what I've done for them. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Will I
    even do a Part 2 out of this just so I can compensate for what I may have
    missed? And the half a dozen artist I've seen for the past month since I
    started ordering for this very review? I don't know, dude, ask my backlog
    ie. my wallet. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But I unlikely won't mostly due to the total
    inconvenience of buying any of this from a store that has to ask for your
    identity and make me worry if I can ship them. Yes, or else how do you think
    they can earn money selling rated content? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Toranoana is looser in
    this regard though, so maybe we try there next time. Don't know if that will
    pass customs or not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND EVERYBODY AND PROMISE ME

    and MANY MANY MORE I have shortlisted for this review but did not make the
    list, where you can check them out online and buy their artworks (I think
    they are on Melonbooks) if you want. Most of their latest works are from
    C102 as far as I'm concerned if not will be recent ones, so you can deal
    with the consequences of crazy shipping fees maybe if your country doesn't
    tax you or have a strong currency, in which case you're welcome.

    P.P.S. Honestly though, if I were Japanese and I get to go there after I got
    tickets, it'll stink like most conventions so I'll go with a mask anyways,
    I'll only go to the people I know haha, but then again I would've bought the
    catalogue (the full one which was not from Melonbooks and thick enough to
    kill a human with) and checked out some of them so... the amount of money
    spent might be equivalent compared to here but I would get way more haha
    LIFE SUCKS DUDE
