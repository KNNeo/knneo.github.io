  It's okay if you don't get any of this I may have to censor some of the words

  pay in instalments like what my colleague uses for EVERYTHING haha people pay

  Let's leave all the poor people who want rich people stuff aside lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>,
  and let's talk about Anime and music! The stuff that rich people will also
  watch even though this is for the poor- Does entertainment even have a price
  range? Hmm...

      "What do you want to do in your future, Komura-kun?" Oh Mie-san he wants
      to do you-
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Definitely not a gamer, Mie-san, those things have no future. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> In this
  new episode (haha) where the future doesn't matter yet since they are middle
  schoolers (#SukiMega12), let's talk about preparing for it instead. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  For starters, filling out that form of which school you want to go. Yes, bear
  in mind they are middle schoolers so they still have high school to go before
  being able to do anything in life haha that's not true but I assume they
  didn't drop out of school despite flirting with each other all day haha
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, still did not know what to fill in for their career paths because who
  knows if Komura would want to be a gaming streamer or Mie-san wants to be the
  next popular Instagrammer who just shows her cute face and body all the damn
  time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yup modern society jokes aside, they decide to look back to
  their dreams as kids for reference. Kids as in elementary school, we can't go
  too far back. Not as far back as what, 5 years old? Where Mie-san wants to
  marry her dad? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well you technically have a new dad now and that's
  Komura so why not marry him- Speaking of which, we gotta know if she can be a
  good housewife. Apparently she can do up some
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/omuraisu" target="_blank">omelette rice</a>
  and even provided evidence of the tomato sauce drawing she did on her recent
  creation... only for Komura to realize that is not a hand he decided to
  replicate it and the mom noticed it was *somewhat* drawn for him. How nice,
  this Mie-san, it's as if she is doing it for her future husband- Moving on
  haha, we of course need to know more about what Komura wants in his future. I
  assume Mie-san is included of course lmao <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, but apart from that, it's
  interesting to be able to hear from the other classmates during their home
  economics class, what Komura is like just playing at the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ge-musenta-" target="_blank">arcade</a>.
  That's not that Komura thinks though, as he sees people surrounding his girl
  especially when they emit handsome guy smells haha Azuma-kun talking about you
  bro, maybe getting Komura a little angry at some point even though the cookies
  done in class by Mie-san is all for you. Oh Komura you also have the
  j-j-j-jealousy? It's normal, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again I guess why can't you
  just make her jealous back- Oh yeah that's last week. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Flipping that
  around, we can also talk about Komura's past where he can't do the flip on the
  low bar (I don't think I can too) and failed when he was a kid. Not like he
  can do it now, but I guess Mie-san wants to see the photo he accidentally
  brought to school (lol) but he left it in school (nice) so I guess we get to
  see the action live! Don't worry, if you succeed Mie-san has it on video.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And we don't talk about all the times Komura saw Mie-san in R18
  levels of pervert. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... man did I not expect softcore porno.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay okay not really that, but heck, this might as well be it.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Or else how would you even explain Komura's nosebleed? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We
  are near the final episode already which is next week by the way, I had a good
  laugh, so let's see where this goes. I mean, with all adaptations unless you
  are asking for a sequel this will not conclude. Or will it? Let's see if we
  need to be hiding behind the alley to see a confession or something hehe time
  is of essence I guess WE ARE DOING IT IN THE PLAYGROUND??? What did I say
  about this being a porno lmao

    <div>
      [TL:DR; "I feel like we have been going home together lately. I wonder if
      it's okay. People aren't getting the wrong idea?" You want to read back
      that again, bro? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

        </div>
      </blockquote>
      Then again, are there any antagonists in this series? I feel like at this
      point we only have the one evil witch who died...? Haha maybe the sister
      should join her ranks lmao in this new episode where we enact an IP I'm
      pretty sure is still outside copyright infringement at least the author
      isn't suing yet haha (#ShinigamiBocchan23), we go to the magic school in a
      train. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, this train doesn't have a concealed platform and I'm
      pretty sure we aren't in London so we should be fine. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, you
      should be suspicious of what is happening so far just like how Viola-chan
      has been as her brother is deep in thought of planning to go to the
      witches' school where Nico and Ichi are, with Cuff and Zain and all in
      order to prepare for the battle against Sade... in the past lol.
      Ironically, it's not Viola's interest in this nor is it Walter's
      determination in finding out the brother's curse so he can take over the
      family, but the mom's approval of societal experience which is funding
      this week-long trip into wherever the "Spirited Away" bathhouse was at.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, they just didn't go from the back door like that main
      girl did. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Well of course I would assume the mom doesn't know of
      the trip since it'll be crazy to explain to the mother they are going to
      deal with witches to gain experience in life considering what the heck
      happened to Sharon her bestie haha, but you know, we got more people to
      introduce. Apart from the two we have known in the previous episode, Zain
      and everyone else not including me (haha uhm?) would be pleased to see we
      have FOUR new girls in the house which isn't a lot because Nico the
      headmaster did mention about dealing with Sade back then with hundreds of
      magic users so uh... maybe times are tough these days- Or yeah, Sade did
      kill a lot of them back then for procreation to even be possible so
      <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> haha but four is enough if we can see them in the bath- No?
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of which, Zain finally got to talk to Ichi just to find
      out why Cuff was triggered to be stronger even though we know her limits
      anyways, but heck, why not help out in this upcoming battle, yes? That'll
      be cool. Not like Zain's time travel powers will look cool anyways it
      doesn't have fire in it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Moving on, I think all this time you
      may have noticed some bug that is following Walter from the start and that
      is Daleth's pet what's up haha, but yes, she is FULL ON STALKER LEVEL NOW
      haha as mentioned by her underling Teto-chan and thanks to Viola-chan I
      think she should just forget her past and take on Sade's place
      legitimately even patching her face with makeup to BE her, really. Yeah,
      the "I shall become the Sade now that she is dead" Daleth strikes upon the
      world- What am I even saying haha but seriously though, why not? Not
      anyone alive to stop her now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But from what we saw at the end of
      the episode though apparently summoning of some minions I assume... Daleth
      is going to do the bad guy thing by attacking the palace? Hmm... So looks
      like what will happen from here on is (and I am just second guessing
      myself at this point but) everyone is hanging out with the witches from
      another gang and Daleth is likely doing something for the final episode
      for the season... yeah we might have another sequel incoming. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I
      mean, I have to accept it right? Just like Nico with the curse put on him,
      and how Zain can't go in to the female hot springs (lmao), we might have
      to fight Daleth in order to even know what exactly we are dealing with, if
      she and/or her sister is technically someone not to be trifled with. We
      shall see, I can see the story progression (and the sequels) and I don't
      know if I should be happy with it haha someone just kill Sade already lol
    </div>

      Well, doomsday is here, you guys have anything else to say? Oh you like
      Aya-chan as MVP? Alright wait till I call the FBI on you using the One
      Order. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this final episode of a blockbuster you wish it
      wouldn't end lol (#BungouStrayDogs61), well spoiler alert it didn't, so
      yeah we will see more action happen, if this one isn't enough to deal with
      already. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, let's talk about what happened. Firstly, Aya-chan
      MVP isn't a joke, she threw herself into being the weight that the world
      and/or the author is depending on lmao, but seriously though, maybe it's
      just Bram overcoming with the pain that is from pulling the holy sword out
      of him, that actually made the vampire control reversible, as Bram turns
      back into his original form. So yeah, Aya-chan is in the Agency now,
      right? She's the new intern? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, no surprises, vampire was
      the way to stop all this, and as such Akutagawa did not kill Atsushi and
      instead saved Aya-chan from the fall, and apart from a few missiles which
      managed to hit the waters after being fired, everyone else surrendered...
      under Fukuzawa's orders. Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next up, Fukuchi's orders.
      Of course there must be a shtick in order to ensure Fukuchi's fall, but it
      was born from Fukuzawa actually losing and trying to find a break in this
      eventuality so that he can take his buddy down? Also, by using both hands
      on the sword too? This is the
      <a
        href="https://myanimelist.net/character/909/Kenpachi_Zaraki"
        target="_blank"
        >Zaraki Kenpachi</a
      >
      method, actually, shout out to when he fought with any opponent so far in
      "BLEACH" specifically Nnoitra. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> This allowed him to be able to
      gain control of the sword to say the least, and take his friend down
      before he can tell him all about his plans so far especially considering
      he ALSO wrote something in the pages. Remember, as a recap, there's this
      one guy in the Angels who wrote the final page, Fyodor told him to write
      it, but Fukuchi, with the power in his sword learnt from the future (<a
        href="https://myanimelist.net/character/40882/Eren_Yeager"
        target="_blank"
        >Eren Yeager</a
      >, is that you?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) that there will be a world war that will kill a
      huge chuck of the human population, thus set out to ensure he gets control
      of the world so that world piece will be achieved and no one will declare
      war no more? Well, if getting rid of war is to get rid of everyone who has
      power, I don't think that'll resolve anything revenge will always be on
      the horizon have you watched

        href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50590/Koukyuu_no_Karasu"
        target="_blank"
        >"Koukyuu no Karasu"</a
      >?? Haha sorry for Anime reference again, but ironically and that's where
      we stand now as a planet, Fukuzawa argued that the absolute power will be
      absolute and will turn evil so no point doing that, so sorry for more
      spoiler dump anyways but that's likely what happened in the future too if
      we have to talk about travelling there or something...? *ahem* This is
      just walking into spoiler territory just like how Atsushi thought of
      walking into an emotional scene but Teruko stopped him on his tracks,
      reminding you that they all know about Fukuchi's plan and not Fyodor's
      plan but not like the latter's plan matters now to be honest. Because
      lastly, the prison break. Turns out, Dazai's explanation of Fyodor's
      weakness being trusting his allies was rather reasonable, citing that
      Ranpo-san will be in time to make Bram order the vampires under control to
      backstab Fyodor himself, and Chuuya pretending to be a vampire this whole
      time!! Wow, tricked us all really- Happy Halloween, everyone. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
      Let's just assume, he's dead dead, alright? Because I hope so, Sigma's
      already done for. *prays* All in all... what a way to end this season! Hmm
      the problem seems to still lie with the final page which will still work
      though, so looks like we are getting another sequel!!! Haha I mean I don't
      even know what to say now, this is basically

      already prepared to fight whatever the heck that is with the space time
      sword (likely what Fukuchi planned from the start) so uh... why aren't we
      sealing the heck out of that thing yet? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Regardless, it's still a
      decent conclusion to what would have looked like Fyodor's win but hey no
      one said that from the beginning or else I would be glad this series is
      going to end, but looks like it isn't going to so see you next time again
      I guess! I just pray that I will live to see the conclusion of this
      series, honestly. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> The author is older than me, right? Good, see
      you next time then. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

      [TL:DR; This season has a serious lack of the following: Kunikida to be
      frank because even Kenji-kun got his own story, Mori Ougai just because
      (haha) and Elise-chan!! Haha but also, I really thought like, Natsume
      Souseki will be here to do something but as expected it didn't really need
      to involve him since only Yokohama is his business so maaaaybe he'll be in
      the fights in the future if it takes place there? Haha who knows but I
      miss him already lol GAY <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah also serious lack of common sense
      lmao but this is Anime so I'll forgive that since Aya-chan is OP now hehe]

      [Serious talk though because I can talk about this for days, is that
      instead of having Sigma's allegiance to the Agency and/or to Dazai this
      season which I also thought would've happened but it was to feed Fyodor's
      mind tricks, we have Bram's allegiance to Aya-chan of all people! Yeah I'm
      like they just heavily dropped a single drip of lore from Bram's past
      (where they showed what was a princess' face) and that made this all
      happen smoothly I'm so impressed and so invested in more of that lore I
      can't even]

      No, right? No love hotel portion this is not a porno? Haha ah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
      this new episode where we are going to rent a girlfriend lol will this
      ever get old (#KanoKari35), this is effectively a date showdown between
      client Kazuya and his rental girlfriend servicewoman (lol)
      <strike>Chizuru</strike> Ichinose as we will call her for now for
      professional purposes (hehe), so let's see how well he did! Because
      remember from the previous episode, Kazuya intended to let Chizuru have a
      great time because just like how Mini-chan and Sumi-chan have hinted to
      him, Chizuru would like to have a good time in these trying times because
      we all know losing family is rough yet she doesn't even twitch a bit which
      is kind of serious in the mental health industry (lmao) so let's! Firstly,
      we go to get the girlfriend a set of new clothes! Bro, I legit thought
      Kazuya will dress himself up too (because why won't you make her happy if
      she has something to see what a guy likes to wear <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>) but looks like
      the girl went ahead to choose what he wanted which is basically anything
      but more revealing haha same, so I think this worked more on the dude.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay Kazuya 0 Ichinose 1, not good, we have to move on, with the
      new outfit too by the way. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Girlfriend mode strikes again, but
      not until Kazuya's ingenious move by bringing her to a cinema to watch a
      movie made by a producer she liked, got her into it enough that not only
      did she break her character oh boy was that interesting to witness, but
      Kazuya also broke his character because he just realized his understanding
      of the drama is more appropriate put into the nearby trash bin. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Legit disappoint, and boy would I actually ask Ichinose-san here to
      explain to me what happened, but hey, I think we won here, guys, so that's
      good he did something for her to be crazy about. Alright Kazuya good one
      we are tied 1 to 1 now just like you two. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Although I would argue at
      this point now that they have a time to take a break for lunch, looks like
      Ichinose here already found out about what this fake boyfriend (lol) is
      trying to do to her and literally is planning everything in secret even
      bringing her to high-end restaurants to eat good food, is definitely
      trying to cheer her up if not for the fact that this slob is not eligible
      enough to show her a good time in the dead of night. I know, right? It's
      like he's going to convince her to go to a love hotel tonight. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

        >I'M HOT TONIGHT</a
      >
      lol sorry for 80s music reference. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Even with the rock climbing
      and Kazuya just seeing how great his rental girlfriend looks lol he
      should've picked an outfit for this segment LMAO I don't think you won
      bro, so even burning his wallet on fire so that the couple (hehe) can have
      some high quality crab meat <span class="emoji" title="😚">*chef's kiss*</span>, as you can see Kazuya is really
      trying to lose hope in capitalism lose all his assets so that Chizuru here
      can have a good time...? Not yet though, because for the final part, he
      chose, of all things, to play with fireworks. Literally. Specifically
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senkouhanabi" target="_blank"
        >sparklers</a
      >
      though, surprisingly reminding Ichinose-san here about her grandparents.
      You know those things. You light them up on one end and see it burn and
      live brightly. And then it just dies. Just like in real life. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I
      better shut my mouth up you can watch the flashback for the tears if you
      need to, but yeah thinking back probably brought her much deja vu just
      like what she saw in the restaurant earlier, and it's probably bringing
      her back to the times she had. She's still keeping up the front though,
      but not for long. All in all... all of them are liars, the lot of them.
      <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay maybe not Sumi-chan, she can't lie she's too pure. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Now that we have Kazuya trigger all of this right as we would have
      expected haha this is expected drama by the way in case you don't
      understand how drama works I know I watched 15 years of it <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, but
      yeah, I wonder what one would do at a time like this. BEAR IN MIND that,
      we are dealing with THE MOST ANNOYING OF WOMEN (lol) who is also a
      professional actress dealing with the departure of her grandmother
      recently, so you tell me. For me though? Even I feel like a hug from
      behind is kind of cringe, but at least I'll know not to walk to her like a
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">normie</a> and
      say "I got the water" or whatever because that'll be most awkward. We
      shall see how, dear author, I want to know how you end this arc and
      season.

      Haha heck I gotta learn how to tie a ponytail now. I like that hairstyle,
      ain't letting my next chance of tying up a girl's hair go to waste.
      Actually, it'll be my first chance if that ever happens. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this
      final episode of a series we asked too much for (#HorimiyaPiece13), we
      graduating (again), people! Yeah, with that hair from Hori-san, by the
      way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course she is not going to tell anyone it's done by her
      boi hehe and that she was still sleeping as she dressed up without making
      her hair so he was doing it for her lol #CoupleGoals but for the
      girlfriend only by the way, but you know, it's different than the usual
      longer hair I like but it's cute so whatever it doesn't matter. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
      Hey, I don't have any girls to compliment in real life so I'll compliment
      Kyouko-chan, why not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also Remi-chan, Yoshikawa, Sakura-chan...
      <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Haha so many memories, but as she goes around the school to talk to
      everyone about her hair, Hori-san sure has met a lot of people in school
      ever since, and we are even reminded on how late Miyamura joined the group
      just because. Yeah, it was to feed Hori's masochistic fetishes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Okay I don't really remember, maybe I should go back and watch again. Then
      again, it's better than remembering that Sengoku is the weakest person
      among them all including his own girlfriend who aims to carry him one day
      lol don't let the dad know though, Iura just wants to see everyone in the
      beach which would have been SO MUCH BETTER than the sports festival haha
      remember the cheerleader groups? And people like Yanagi (lol) joining in
      the gang at this point even going as far as be involved in... is there
      even a love rectangle between Yoshikawa and Yanagi at this point? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Nonetheless, it's not hard to recall the smaller times when all this
      started especially considering Hori-san herself is already a sociable and
      outgoing person, only then realized Miyamura and all of his problems with
      the tattoos and dealing with people and stuff, somewhat similar to her
      childhood friend Sengoku if you think about it. And even now, we have
      cases where Miyamura is just dragged into her life or even her family's to
      be frank, still enjoys it every time even if it means going back to sleep
      again in the morning and arriving 4 hours later only for the girl to be
      mad because someone screwed up her haircut and he has to be the first one
      to see it. Uh... send me a photo on the phone first? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Overall
      though, this season provided much content that we otherwise would not have
      seen if not for the comprehensive summary of the first season, still
      really tried to avoid modern references which is why you didn't see social
      media or phones even so much compared to other series since
      <a
        href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/36615/Hori-san_to_Miyamura-kun"
        target="_blank"
        >the original work</a
      >
      was done like, more than a decade ago at this point where smartphones
      aren't really a thing yet. Still, what must be the appeal of this series
      despite being so far off the perpendicular all because we knew the love
      stories and how much Sakura-chan has suffered NO ME NO haha <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>, is
      probably the comedy in the series and how light-hearted slice of life we
      are experiencing from a romantic's perspective, and even without, one
      could laugh at the many things in this story that are intriguing for one
      to take interest in the colour palette of hair colours representative of
      all the Anime characters in the series, in case you didn't notice. I still
      liked this series in general though it's rather obvious they had to write
      this season with respect to the first season so that's kinda rough, but
      thinking back, this is done way better than I would have expected and also
      dropped to us really quick, so I guess this isn't bad after all. I would
      recommend you go back and watch the first season though, I really don't
      remember what happened apart from those stuff that made me depressed lol
      this always makes me depressed I'm single like Iura but twice his age haha
      what
    </div>
    <div>
      [TL:DR; I think the ending for this final episode is a good reminder for
      this series in general: If you need your blood to keep flowing, get
      yourself a girlfriend with a temper haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>]

      Oh yeah this was the father uh oh OOPS KILLED YOUR DAD <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this
      new episode where I swear this flashback wasn't a thing in the original
      work so thanks Kubo-sensei for the info (#BLEACHTYBW24), no that is
      Yhwach, that is him before he got defeated, in case you forgot what
      happened 200 years ago. You know, that's why he doesn't know. Even if he
      is the son of the Soul King, it's like if you haven't been contacting your
      father for what, 2000 years now? Yeah, you guys can lose touch. I know
      it's hard to imagine if you have a dad but think about it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So,
      there's a lot to talk about here, so let's quickly summarize what
      happened, definitely. And without Ganju because who gives a damn about
      that anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, apart from Ichigo and the gang going up
      to the Royal Palace in which case the path was opened by Ichigo himself
      when he came down so Yhwach used it to go up because of all reasons there
      was a cooldown to the closing of the opening haha, the Quincies managed to
      infiltrate the Palace. Welcoming them isn't the King though, no, but
      everyone else in Squad Zero since they were literally ambushed on arrival
      though Senjuumaru did like, play with them for a bit as much as Yhwach
      also played with them by sending Sternritters a shortcut path up here
      because in case you forgot this Quincy lord has like, power distribution
      so he can bring people up to his level, so to say. Still, they were
      swiftly taken out <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> so apart from whoever that kid is that can bend
      anything away from himself but not Senjuumaru's needle lmao, everyone else
      got a real taste of what it's like to fight against Squad Zero. We have
      some heads on with Hikifune, ex-Squad 12 captain preceding Urahara-sensei
      that many years ago in case you forgot, and I would argue that really
      people who innovate are likely the only ones worthy of being in Squad Zero
      because look at her, she just did enough to make a cage that never gets
      destroyed. Like, how? Kirge Opie WISHES his power was this OP. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So
      yeah, Tenjirou was cut out of the action haha LAME, we have infinite
      shield regen lol, we have the noclip video game mod haha Senjuumaru is
      basically that, and we have zanpakuto bro!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I feel like I don't
      know Squad Zero if I don't call him "bro" so you're welcome, 10, 9, 8, 7-
      Nope, nope. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on haha, he has a sword to show off, and I
      wish I can call that sword by Yhwach's foretelling powers lmao that'll be
      even more cool it definitely feels like it though, but this is
      <em>the</em> ultimate weapon. We had infinite defence, infinite
      modifications, now this is infinite... sharpness? Attacks you can never
      miss? It can't even be warped? It has to be stored in a liquid that helps
      it float so it can't touch anything? Namaiya-san, you make some
      interesting weapons, my bro, Mayuri would like to make an enquiry.
      <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Man, what a sharp sword, innit? Can it go through space time
      though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Shout out to "Stray Dogs" with Amenogozen) All in all
      though... uh sorry for the spoiler drop but you can skip to the next
      sentence if you don't mind I make long sentences so be sure to skip all
      the way into next week lol, but yeah both sides haven't actually shown
      their prowess especially the Sternritters, so I doubt this is the end.
      What is in the end for though, is this season because we are left with one
      big hour special which I will cover next week when half of the people in
      this list are done for hehe, so we can actually sit down again with Ichibe
      and Yhwach to talk about renegotiation of the treaty someone thought of
      doing all those years ago. No? We can't do the treaty no more? Oh... is it
      because they don't have names to fill in the signing? Hmm, how would that
      go though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> On other things, if you have read till here, you would
      be pleased for me to estimate that (haha) we are likely kicking off next
      season with the Quincy King in trouble *ahem* and Ukitake of all people
      will have to help out. Oops, really too much info here, so let's at least
      enjoy the times where they were all alive, yes? The King and Ukitake and
      Royal Guard and everything- Ah too much info again!! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

      [Oh yeah, I should talk about it since we're here, about how Namaiya's
      sword in a block of jelly inspired me to come up with a zanpakuto myself.
      This sword would have the ability to manipulate oil and sand, thus
      poisoning and/or cutting through enemies even easier than a super sharp
      blade. Well, at least, that's what I think haha I don't create swords bro

      Okay, let's talk about the train wreck of a week this week!! Hehe well
      good news, it all went as planned as in it went great to that's good news
      for just this month along to be frank. Not going to get such a ride next
      month with such a weak release schedule.

      is alright, it's easy to give the song to say the least but it's hard to
      like them, similar to Ikimonogakari's single earlier this month honestly.
      Thank goodness I don't have to review this one since this has no physical
      release. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Can't wait for it to release a CD a month later like
      freaking King Gnu did 2 years ago)&nbsp;<b

      is actually great, I did give one of the songs released earlier this year
      a few months ago as digital single, but damn am I so obsessed with the new
      songs in the release I actually ended up clearing HALF the album??? Is
      that even legal on mainstream artists? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It is apparently, as seen
      from interviews they are trying for change since they are also in a major
      music label now no surprises, still waiting for that Anime "BLEACH" from
      them though. Kubo-sensei? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

      I really hope f**king Elon doesn't stop me from editing these links to
      Twitter and block the domains of new posts on the old domain name because
      damn that would have sucked and you guys would understand what web domains
      mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Other than that, we have more news about music to share!

      she is doing a single on for Anime releasing next month, and if this is
      any indicator we are definitely getting some real fanservice in so if you
      aren't excited, I am. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

      so that's cool, new song dropping on music subscriptions end of next month
      if I'm keen on listening to new stuff from them that isn't just rapping,
      fingers crossed.

      of the new digital single from back in June so that's cool, would love to
      see more of these done live to be honest, I know this doesn't give them
      much money but still. Audio's kinda low maybe fix that also lol.

      for Anime and I CANNOT BELIEVE I'm still so into the title song so here's
      hoping my maiden ride into their newest songs will make me stay in the
      long run.&nbsp;<br />

      <br />
      Oh wow, I can Klassic Note forever but heck, they put in Teshima Aoi's
      earlier songs in music subscriptions, I can't help but give a listen again
      to
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >her album in 2008</a
      >
      which Koko-chan introduced to us on Instagram some time ago. Her music
      tastes are great, Teshima Aoi is only making this better, and her singing
      is just less coarse back then which makes it somehow better in my opinion
      compared to her softer singing now. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyhow, Teshima-san is
      someone I'll go to if I need a break from mainstream music, so if you need
      some help go listen to a song or two from her. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you guys next
      week, actually next month already by then, and until next time... maybe we
      talk more about Anime sometime soon, yes? I've got a little something
      prepared- Yes it's Isobe Karin's photobook what of it haha it's spoilt to
      hell online though I feel like I'm just going to not be surprised no more
      SHE JUST SHOWED IT ON HER INSTA LIVE WITH LYNN-SAN Lynn-san kawaii~!! Haha
      her photobook is also great but Karin-chan might win, just a little. And
      wait till I show you marupi's- Why are we reviewing not Melonbooks now?

      I will mention it again next week but yeah, this is going to conclude the
      main story so that's cool. Kinda expected that from a mile away and
      totally still hate it like Walter is in the image (lol) but I'm just glad
      this unlike many others gets a full adaptation. <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span>
