Oh damn, it's that time again, huh. Looking back at this week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I really
should not do this anymore dude, I've got better things to do than to think
about how boring it is to earn money-
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Alright if you need good news, I've got a few.

  haha and that is just awesome in general, I forgot how I ended up playing some
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a>
  <a href="https://6699.jp/play/?appid=sekutori" target="_blank">online game</a>
  (lmao) but damn I just did on Tuesday night somehow and I promise you I didn't
  watch porn that day (or maybe that's the problem haha ah), so yeah, it has
  been a busy week. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No nudity in all of these though, ironically.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe I should not make it a point to reveal all my desires lol yeah
  I want to be a CEO and have many ladies work under me what of it
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anime and music instead I guess! We are SO CLOSE to be done with this batch of
  shows I can't even <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not BLEACH though, I'm talking about-<br />

      "That kind of fanciness only looks good on certain types of people" Man,
      Komura have you never been more cynical about humans lol
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Wait, why is my Anime mom telling me to get piercings? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, Komura,
  I kind of understand why you don't want to do this. We don't want to
  recalibrate your image for your gal again, she keeps losing her glasses after
  all. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where image isn't everything and I say that
  because I'm not in Anime lol (#SukiMega11), maybe we need something on Mie-san
  that will give Komura a turn-off. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> There's none, by the way. As seen
  by how Komura thinks about his gal even on the stuff that won't look good on
  himself, he would've thought that Mie-san would look better than him even with
  dyed hair and piercings. Also, middle schoolers dye their hair? I'll take
  notes. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, soon we will see even throughout this episode alone,
  that Komura is just way too concerned about his own image and how he presents
  to Mie-san, but that's the thing, she doesn't really mind. She might like him
  a lot more than he thinks, but we'll put that aside first, because the school
  festival is up! Well, what can middle schoolers do besides run stalls?
  Apparently, do handicraft. Mie's one looks like a pillow lol, and yes I guess
  I'll agree with Komura one that his sucks since he didn't even put effort into
  it. Then again it is likely not due to his mom who wants him to look even more
  trendy than her somehow, I still think the problem is Komura hasn't been
  taught on how to exhibit one's creativity. Hey, they don't teach you that in
  school, by the way. Somehow. So I won't blame him, but Mie-san is enjoying
  looking at his exhibit, so I guess we are fine. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What is not fine
  though, is that the students were to stay back to set everything up late into
  the evening, and I guess Mie-san isn't exactly ok with leaving her boi to
  mingle with the other female students in class (hehe) after school (lmao) for
  another hour (HAHAHA okay me), she decided to break her curfew set by her
  parents and stay a little longer. Ironically, this is by the way NOT the same
  curfew set for normal underage in Japan which is what, 10pm? Yeah, so you want
  to tell me she has terrible parents now? Well, what a surprise, the mother
  started spamming on her phone, and just about half an hour past 6, she left
  the school in a hurry, even running home without changing her shoes out
  because she couldn't find them. Not like Komura appearing at her place (lol)
  made this a good explanation, she did technically miss her next morning cocoa
  if not for her nice dad haha <em>nice</em>, but you know, I don't want to talk
  about parenting at all, actually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, even reading through
  Mie-san's recent events, this part is the truth be told portion of like,
  "Tenshi-sama" series where we have to find out that their lives suck and it's
  because of their parents. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Why are we even doing this, Japan already
  has a declining population. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not like the evil will correct themselves
  by watching this anyways, why make the good guys here (lol) sad? Oh well, time
  to find another happier Anime series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And finally, I'm not sure if
  the couple (lmao) sitting down together while everyone is in the hall in
  school, is an adequate reflection of how much they want to be with each other.
  I mean, you gotta get around your parents first. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... okay
  Mie-san your mom is evil confirmed- FUCK YOU MOM <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like, BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Look, they always say there must be a nice parent and a bad parent. This
  one... the nice one just so happens to be Komura. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also, not that I'm
  not trying to make dad jokes here, but what is this, The Great Depression?
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I know this somehow had a build-up, but heck, can we not talk about
  the sad stuff and talk about Mie-san and her dad and Someya-san (lmao) and all
  those good stuff? I much prefer that. Even next week's episode preview with
  Azuma and cooking would be more interesting even if Mie-san is hanging out
  with him and NOT Komura. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Uh oh haha oh come on we know he won't even
  take confessions this should be alright...?
  <div>
    [TL:DR; "Thank goodness I wasn't suspected of being a stalker!" Oh Komura
    you're TOTALLY a stalker haha what are you talking about]

    You asking me? Hmm... considering I've watched 15 years of Anime, voices? I
    know if I like a female voice I'll fall in love with. Not within this cast
    though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where okay maybe Viola's voice is my
    type and we only talk about boobs here lol what (#ShinigamiBocchan22), let's
    talk about none of those but then again we have Zain when can we ever NOT
    talk about those? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Alright, plot first, we got a lot of things to
    talk about. Firstly, we know who the new characters are. Not going to use
    their names because how are they technically lamer than Bocchan's name I
    don't even know lol, but little boy and old woman found their way into
    Bocchan's mansion mainly because Cuff and Zain did it too just to escape
    from the same people. But we now do know their intentions for searching them
    down, mainly because of Zain's magic again of manipulating time what a
    surprise, but now it's sweet coated with the ultimate solution to deal with
    everyone's problems: killing Sade before she can put the curse(s) on anyone.
    Yes, there are more than one cursed being in this house, and it's the little
    kid that is cursed with youth transformation AND immortality. Yup, can't
    believe that is what everyone would have wanted if I didn't feel like I want
    to die already lmao, but problem is, they made him waaaaaay too young, in
    case you didn't notice. So young, he doesn't even fit with his wife who also
    happened to just kick Cuff's butt&nbsp; because they've lived that long. And
    here comes their proposition: to train everyone including I guess Bocchan to
    fight along with them in their wizard's school, in order to take down Sade
    in the past before all this has happened. Yeah, before she turned evil. I
    only wonder if this is even possible because is there any fixing if someone
    is innately evil lmao, then again Zain did not manage to bring back dead
    people so I wonder why they would want to even do this in the first place.
    Also, we'll also have to go back REAL far Daleth is like a century and a
    half ago these guys ages combined aren't even- Anyhow haha, I guess this
    might just be a joke and I assume they can bring their future selves back to
    the past, but even then, Sade is one to be scared of, so I wonder if this
    will even be possible at all. As for Cuff? She just wants to be stronger for
    some reason. Well not like there is a real threat going on, Daleth is hardly
    a threat and these guys just came in recently, so I don't know. For me the
    thing about this is more of what Bocchan thinks of this whole killing thing,
    and not that he has the power to do so, but whether he has the power to NOT
    do so because he's that nice. I sometimes wonder if Sade put on curses
    corresponding of their character which makes them all the harder to remove.
    Yeah, like that old man who got turned into a kid where his biggest fear is
    being a kid- We're not done yet though?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, as I've seen
    so far... So wait, we going to have a magic school arc or something? I don't
    suppose training can take an episode or two only right? How much are we left
    with this season? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> What did I just say about not giving me another
    season of this adaption, huh? <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> Anyhow, looks like there is way more to
    this than this looks, also maybe slipping into times of the past to find out
    Sade's intentions might be easier lest we accidentally kill too many people
    even Sharon wouldn't be alive lol too much uncertainty is the thing, but we
    AT LEAST have to see the girls in their wizard school. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> They got
    Hermoine in there? HAHA I sure hope so minimal requirements of admission are
    judged in terms of face and in figure-
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; "I don't want to kill her just because she's an evil witch" DUDE
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Bocchan has a point though, we don't have alternatives?]

    I mean, the whole reason that you are still alive, Aya-chan, is because you
    cute- It's because you got connections with the Agency, dude. Then again, is
    anyone in the Agency left to take this bait? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, I guess Atsushi
    lol. In this new episode where there are no good people left RIP Dazai and
    even Sigma by the way (#BungouStrayDogs60), everyone's in pain this episode.
    Bram, Atsushi, Dazai, Fyodor... wait, what? Haha yeah, since there are so
    many things to talk about, let's consolidate what we have seen so far and
    make a summary about it. I'm getting tired with too much action, by the way,
    can't believe I'm saying that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For starters, let's talk about the
    prison. Dazai and Sigma managed to get out of the elevator/lift with some
    smart thinking, but not like both of them got out unscathed, at least not
    for Dazai. I thought I would be able to see Dazai pull a something to save
    Chuuya and/or stop him from killing literally the one who was his.... I
    don't know what Dazai is to Chuuya but well he's a vampire so I don't think
    that works, also Fyodor. What doesn't work though also is
    <strike>Akutagawa</strike> Sigma because I'm pretty sure we all know and
    think like what Sigma does who is taking Dazai's side, would be better than
    taking Fyodor's side to he honest, and don't worry I woke up to the hypnosis
    Fyodor has set on me because this dumb idiot has no idea what his Ability is
    and bro it's not double personality you jerk lol, is that he kills anyone
    who touches him lol also Fyodor making all of that stuff up is what people
    see when they talk about the power of the Internet 20 years ago lmao. So
    Sigma now is as good as dead, I suppose. More dead than Dazai? Not if you
    are a vampire! So yeah, on the airport side though, things are getting
    messy. Apart from Fukuchi preparing the One Order to be released on his very
    command just because he is God right now haha maybe deputy God the real God
    is still in prison <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, he also set Akutagawa (in vampire state) to guard
    against Bram and Aya-chan lest someone wants to come save them *pft* but yes
    we are technically left with Atsushi and seeing how this goes they can only
    fight since it's impossible to talk sense into this thing already. And
    Aya-chan came out with the 200 IQ power move to try a last minute effort at
    pulling the sword out of Bram by uh, dropping a table down from a height by
    a cord pulling against the holy sword? How old is she, 10? Her physics, no,
    science lessons are paying off here real well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Child prodigy, we
    call them. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, it's not her fault, she didn't have a degree in
    Mechanical Engineering. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> With this, I would like to propose a
    challenge to all undergraduates out there- What am I, the next Engineering
    professor handing out a project? Piss off. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So as expected lol I
    thought gravity changed a bit in the Anime to make this happen lmao that
    would have been funnier, but yeah, at least start with a longer cord, girl.
    More time for mass to accelerate. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Ironically though, the point why
    Bram did not bother to fight back against all the bad things this girl has
    done to him including kidnapping him (lol) is also likely because she
    resembles someone he knows... long time ago. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>&nbsp; All in all
    (haha cringe), hey the One Order did happen as expected it's the order from
    Melonbooks with
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/doujinshi" target="_blank">doujinshi</a> I
    enjoyed that last week thank you very much haha *umph*, and yeah, don't
    think anything new will happen from here on. Though, we <em>are </em>near the
    end of the season and this has to conclude <em>somehow</em>, so looks like our
    biggest draw (get it?) might still be from Bram's side who are controlling
    the vampires, as everyone left in the Agency is in the brink of death so we
    don't have much to do to them already lol. Hmm... unless you tell me the
    walkie talkie item (haha) has something in it that will make this fail
    immediately or from here on, I can't think of anything else. Maybe I can't.
    I can do less than Aya-chan and Atsushi honestly, I don't even know the plan
    of the Angels. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, watch the world burn as I've always done, I
    guess. Bram already witnessed centuries of that anyways, not really an issue
    witnessing another one. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

    FINALLY some comedic relief. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Get it? The soft voice in the morning
    quote? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Sorry man, I just feel like I can't take this series seriously
    anymore, after all the sad stuff that has happened. Well, at least for this
    episode (#KanoKari34) we are starting with Sumi-chan and some normal rental
    girlfriend dating action? Hey, say this isn't business as usual. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    It's not, no, it's not. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Well, let's not say too soon haha, because
    this week, we hang out with Sumi-chan! Hey, just even a bit will suffice, I
    mean, look at how happy Kazuya became after just booking her for an hour
    which was part of the job, but ended up being the rest of the afternoon and
    evening apparently. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> No, no one expected that, but it's just the
    point that since we had to break the news about Sayuri to Sumi-chan here
    too, even she might need some relief from all this bad stuff and for Kazuya
    to face Chizuru once again, but hey, didn't say it had to be by the beach
    out of the city. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See, the good thing about Anime is that we don't
    have to show the money spent on all the things done. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Really, they
    went as far as Fujisawa (West of Yokohama which is West of Tokyo) to see the
    sandy beaches, and since they can't do much as it's not the summer period
    where they let people down to the waters, Sumi-chan decided to climb the
    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/4GSdRW4w1g35Ebcm9" target="_blank"
      >Enoshima Sea Candle</a
    >
    to watch the spectacular views, all in an effort to ease the pain away.
    <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> This wouldn't have worked if it's my mom, she only likes to shop.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But at least for this couple here (hehe), it's working. Kazuya did
    just forget he was enjoying himself and breaking his wallet at the same time
    haha Sumi-chan is employing her rental girlfriend powers to burn her
    clients' money as much as possible but at someone she calls her friend haha
    <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, Sumi-chan did end up pushing him to make sure he will not think too
    much about what has happened in the movie production process and all that
    has happened to the person he likes so far. Not for Sumi-chan who is there
    for him all the way even not saying that she likes him, and definitely not
    <strike>Naobou</strike> Ruka-chan (haha) who just hates his guts but still
    can't do much about someone's passing and doesn't want to stir the pot too
    much and will then still let Kazuya do whatever he wants in order to...
    cheer Chizuru up? Is that even possible though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, think
    about it: We have come so far to even talk about the pro level actress that
    is Ichinose&nbsp;<strike>Sayuri</strike> Chizuru (lol I'm sorry I promise
    this is the last one) who doesn't even budge after all the events that has
    happened around her in her life once she knew she has chosen this path, even
    her grandfather will think this kid not crying at his funeral is being real
    cringe and a most likely robotic action. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Still, this won't stop
    Kazuya picking up on Sumi-chan's advice which isn't that surprising and that
    is to do what he would do to see someone else in pain and/or in trouble.
    Give them money (haha) even going as far as to work more shifts at the
    karaoke so he can book Chizuru once again, not to settle things out because
    damn maybe we should just not, but do what Sumi-chan knows what to do best.
    Yeah, Kazuya cheering Chizuru up. When has this been a roaring success?
    Hopefully this one, possibly. We are near the end already, looks like we are
    really ending the season with the thing I was actually expecting this
    episode haha but looks like it's next week, so yeah, this might be it, guys!
    Well, not the confession that will never happen not even in the latest
    chapter of the original work lmao (I honestly don't know tbh), but at least
    we will help Chizuru get over her loss, or even more, her own feelings.
    Let's hope this works, people! Or else all the money Kazuya worked for would
    have been in vain, and the manager of the karaoke would have been lying.
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Chizuru man, you can't hide your feelings all the damn time. Ain't
    anyone family around you to remind you of that no more. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See you
    then I better shut up already

    Wow okay I knew the episode title was about the Hori family but (apart from
    the super long intro) I didn't expect Kyousuke to be in a huge part of this.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where the flashbacks never end because remember
    they didn't even do the actual love story in chronological order let alone
    about their parents haha (#HorimiyaPiece12), oh this is young Kayanon.
    <span class="emoji" title="😚">*chef's kiss*</span> Haha yep they got the parents to voice when their characters
    were younger. Much younger. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And boy, did we cover all the grounds
    that we should know about the Hori parents and Sengoku's father, if you
    still aren't aware, but let's go over the stuff that happened. Firstly, the
    flashback. Love story goes that Kyousuke (the father) met Yuriko (the
    mother) in high school. Kyousuke was kind of a bada** but technically isn't
    he's just not that hardworking and dresses up like a delinquent, and
    Yuriko... yeah let's say she works for the student council. You know, those
    people who just run errands to hopefully get into the student council
    someday? We've all been there, Mitsumi-chan from "Skip and Loafer".
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, manipulated, just like Sengoku's father would have wanted.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still, we all see a different view of them, from how Kyousuke
    stands up for his girl towards Sengoku and also likely the case how these
    guys get into some form of relationship only people in the Hori family today
    will understand lmao, to Sengoku being the serious dude he was haha, to
    Yuriko just being the normal girl and totally not like her daughter... it's
    all in the day's work haha until you realize Kyousuke is a bit of a women's
    guy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay it's lame saying this but what isn't though, is when
    Yuriko shows her true colours. Hey, they say if a certain Anime character
    has never opened their eyes, they are best kept closed. For when they are
    open, they are going to do some bad, bad things. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that's when
    Kyousuke thought she was for him lmao, and explained to Miyamura he will
    take on his footsteps as he has to deal with an easily-tempered Hori-san who
    doesn't have the eyes closed ability, mind you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This will likely
    explain most of the episode already honestly, as we see Miyamura barge in to
    the weirdest of situations and had to deal with them differently, I guess
    specifically Souta and his sister and not the father because he's a problem
    in itself, actually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But rest assured, we are all thinking adults
    haha well only Miyamura is <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, so at least he will be more rational and
    appeal to everyone in the family lest he gets pushed out of the spaceship by
    the captain. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's great seeing Souta playing around like a kid, and
    boy not like Hori-san didn't make a mess before or even helped wash the
    dishes (dude, he's even better than me when I was a kid haha ah), but it
    feels like taking sides is going to make you lose oxygen faster in this
    space (get it?) so maybe Miyamura just choose to appeal to the other family
    members first before thinking of how to console the girlfriend, isn't it?
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean, do we need to console her? All she needs is a scolding and
    spanking from the boyfriend- All in all... it's business as usual in the
    Hori family. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I feel like I've said that many times just in this
    season let alone the whole series, but heck, what's more stories to tell
    that is dumb and/or funny at the same time now that I've said it I have to
    explain to Kyouko that she is not part of this? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, it's a
    good laugh, Miyamura MVP in this family according to Souta haha, but now
    that we have the final episode ahead of us even with new visuals for the
    Anime, this might really be the end as we experience graduation once again.
    Haha at least it won't be the same, right? RIGHT?? Haha we shall see, we
    shall see...
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; "Don't touch me." I'm pretty sure that if Hori-san doesn't want to
    get touched at her place we can send Miyamura home. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

    Man, the last time I saw this blood lust was when Hitsugaya was testing
    Ichimaru out because he talked sh*t about Hinamori, you guys remember those
    great times? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Me neither. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though where
    zombies roam wild and I don't mean the Arrancar lol (#BLEACHTYBW23), well,
    we have to deal with Hitsugaya first. Just a head's up, I don't want you to
    be surprised in any way in case you have not realized since previous
    episode, Mayuri knows what's up. All of it. So dealing with Hitsugaya is not
    too much of a deal despite being able to fight as captains (boy you remember
    when's the last time this action happened?) and boy did the clashing of
    swords make me smile (hehe), but the thing about Mayuri and his drug lab
    (haha) is that, he is very smart about the power to deal with ways to stop
    battle, not end battle. He essentially doesn't have to kill people, in his
    case. If he has enough knowledge about the opponent and/or his allies which
    in this case it's the
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>
    themselves being controlled by an external entity, then all he needs to do
    is to whip up drugs so they may never fight again. Well, for now. We have
    seen that in Szayelaporro with the superhero drug, and this time around, we
    let Hitsugaya travel back to the past. As if his past isn't sad enough with
    Aizen trying to use Hinamori as his hostage lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, the idea is that if
    I didn't remember wrong, as long as Mayuri shouts out his name before he
    dies, it's all back to square one. Well, where they started because damn if
    you noticed when he started, you can take his rank in genius below
    Urahara-sensei, something I don't think I will ever. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, play
    that drug long enough as with all his drugs, there are crazy side effects so
    this is enough to stop Hitsugaya (and later, the others) from fighting. Even
    bringing in Kensei and Rose revived as zombies won't help your case,
    Gizelle. You are dealing with a inquisitive mind- What am I even saying I
    don't even like the guy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But in his defence though, that's how much
    we are giving attention to arguably author Kubo-sensei's most beloved
    character to draw. Moving on, Byakuya is in the mix dealing with PePe (not
    that Twitch frog with the emotes lol
    <a
      href="https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/5e1eb57cbca2995f13fb7ce7/3x.webp"
      target="_blank"
      >peppoGiggle</a
    >) the Stenritter with his "love" power, it's not like Byakuya hasn't dealt
    with someone like him before, so yeah, you chose the wrong enemy kekeke
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You get the idea haha and honestly, Mayuri shouldn't have bothered.
    Mainly because there isn't a Rukia to take control of haha I wonder where
    she is now though, but also, that it won't take much to deal with what, a
    love possessed Hisagi and <strike>Ueshama</strike> that power Sternritter?
    But this is still Mayuri's highlight episode in case you didn't realize, so
    we gotta give him some credit for helping the noble out, I know Byakuya is
    more popular with the female audience, but still. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all,
    GREAT EPISODE by the way, as I said many of these stuff including the blood
    (haha I recall when it was all spit) is all UNFORSEEN in this series thus
    far I missed the days where shinigami fight each other over Aizen HE is the
    guy to fight over with haha says Hinamori <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, swords are so less of a
    thing I cringe when I see that Sternritter Robert hold a gun too. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    Still, many things here are more than creepy like the injection and stuff, I
    know this is all canon material but making it this good is just *chef's
    kiss* making my dreams come true to make this an action series classic I've
    grown to love. Thanks to all who have done this so far- Oh, we're not in the
    final episode yet? We got <strike>Lilotto</strike> Lililotto to deal with? I
    wonder what's up her sleeve <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> No really I don't remember what's up her
    sleeve maybe Ao-chan can remind me of what that is haha I'm not a masochist
    I promise you- Not as masochist as the Squad Zero who are asking to get
    their a**es KICKED haha oops spoilers lol we wish them the best of luck
    *prays* they are strong they can deal with the Quincy lord
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; No really, enjoy this episode and the past few ones a little more
    you ungrateful brat next episode onwards will be DEATH lol I'm not joking
    btw]

    is why we saw Robert release his <strike>Volla</strike> V-power yup I

    transformation from PePe I've ever seen. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Is this what I look like

    This week on music is kinda rough, I gotta say. I don't know, maybe I just
    wasn't in the mood anymore to give emotional songs considering I wasn't sad
    all week but I did somehow got mad in a meeting (yes the thumbnail in one of
    the Anime is IRL real) and that changed everything. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah,

    for starting the duo formation strong and letting this appear on my shelf so
    I can actually conclude where to buy nasuo's single from like, last month
    because I had to. Damn single-track singles haha *looks at Chatmonchy in
    2012* Anyways, perhaps the harder part was trying to give

    which isn't too surprising but more interestingly I was able to give one of
    the other songs in the release first than the one Anime ending theme song I
    was supposed to give in the first place. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, that has been all
    solved, so don't worry about it, I have already given. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And we

    is the first song I gave in her recent album and boy is it good now it's a

    good so don't mind the collab.

    is rather emotional which is nice, we hardly hear things like this from them
    which is good, so I'll remember this for the album when it's out next week.
    I don't think

    >&nbsp;won't change my mind to like her new single at all (Kurari-san on the
    B-side you are an exception and even then) I would not even care especially
    when this isn't even a cute video or song to begin with. We got more new

    is as boring as can be, but this is an encouraging song from the single
    released this week anyways so I can't imagine anything otherwise but be
    thankful the song isn't like, 7 minutes long and the video is all taken in a
    stadium. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let's move on haha, okay apparently I love this trend of

    so hype because damn did I tell myself throughout the year that she is still
    the only artist I've followed for a decade which didn't
    <strike>suck</strike> disappoint me in new songs so I'm just glad she is
    just coming back with more songs to please, I take those. In contrast to the
    winter and love themes back in February, this one will be Autumn-themed,

    <br />
    So next week, hell yeah we are back with <b>SIX LOUNGE's new album</b> so
    that will suffice in the "making me happy" department which hopefully
    <b>fuzzy knot's new digital single</b> will not do so and pale in comparison
    so maybe we will give the latter first. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I still want to explore
    w.o.d. after I've heard of some band trailer on their YouTube channel so
    unless these guys disappoint then maaaaybe I'll get to that. Or else it'll
    be for a period without new releases so that I can enjoy the luxury of
    hearing fresh tunes on a weekly basis which apparently not many appreciate.
    I guess it's me and Klassic Note then. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span><br />

    though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, drape beats, dude. I'm still young, by the way,
    I still listen to this shit. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also worth of laughter is the final
    (season) final (part) final (chapters) final episode of Attack on Titan
    (lmao) which will FINALLY air at the start of November so be sure to watch
    this till the very end- I think I'm just hallucinating, honestly, for
    following this for almost a decade. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> AND THIS IS WHY ANIME SEQUELS
    NEED TO STOP- Who am I lying to, can't wait to watch more sequels next
    season lol. See you guys next week then, and until then I think my hands on
    Saturday might be itchy enough for me to (Audience: Continue APoL??) restart
    the Fanfiction series again next month haha so stay tuned for that everyone-
    Why is everyone leaving? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    P.S. I can't wait for the day where I have to change ALL of the x dot com

    to buy it back from that idiot? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
