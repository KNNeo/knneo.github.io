As I count the days and especially weeks passing by with every update of a blog
title on this weekly series, I just can't help but wait for this year to finish
so I can get new new year goals for myself. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, not been doing that
for years already haha, but you know, maybe I should. Watch me ask her out on
her birthday in 2 weeks-
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways haha welcome to the new month ignoring which week of the year we are
  on now lol I'm sorry for the post title I guess, still! There is much
  anticipation for just the month of September alone and I still don't know if
  that's a good thing or not considering the upcoming packages are all over the
  place haha, but we shall see. At least I know we got more CD reviews coming my
  way- I know right, reviewing CDs not even vinyls- Welcome to 2023, by the way.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  This, and a lot more hope on my gacha rolls just this weekend alone, let's
  Anime and music! Oh? We have an absentee again it seems... Good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  FIELD TRIP LET'S GO!!! In case you wonder how the groups work in this, we
  allow mixed genders. Haha who am I joking they are only middle schoolers.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where we get to go to everyone's favourite
  outing location in school haha well at least one isn't that (#SukiMega09), I
  like how the two being a thing is a thing in class now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, do we
  even need NINE episodes for this to happen? BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also TRIPLE DATE
  LET'S GO- Ah hey, if the girls aren't interested in you, the other two guys,
  I'm sorry. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But heck, maybe this isn't as exciting as I would have
  expected. It's not a school trip, after all. Those are different. In this one,
  they had to go visit I would assume a museum, and do up reports. Boring, but
  damn, still more interesting than being in the classroom the whole day, so why
  not? Problem is, if you need a reminder of the show title, someone will forget
  her glasses. A certain someone, not gonna say who. Not even the 3 guys who
  joined in on the girls' group just in case we need a Komura to take care of a
  particular Mie-san. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> You get the idea haha, but Mie-san did come
  prepared though, bringing her spare glasses in her bag in case she, you know,
  forgot to wake up on time and ran out of her house without her glasses as
  usual. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But heck, this time around she broke it, so yup still within
  expectations, just that she didn't bring the right pair of spare glasses.
  Really though, why buy a fake pair of lens and you can't even preserve the
  ones you have? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Haha oh well, at least we got Komura here. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So
  as you would have seen, she did fake her viewing of the exhibits in the museum
  in Kamakura so she can do the report, but considering she can see close to
  nothing and can't get close to it, this is going to be rough. Thankfully
  Komura saw that from a mile away haha, and told her to see the writings on the
  walls, those accompanying text, to get an idea of what is happening. Genius
  play right here, but this also made Mie-san feel real bad for not being normal
  and be able to do things by herself like the rest of her classmates,
  including, and Asuka she is spot-on once again, finding her way around. And
  this isn't even a school trip level thing, by the way, we all go to the same
  place to gather. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And she is feeling pretty apologetic about it too.
  Uh, I mean,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/donmai" target="_blank">don't mind</a>!
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah, what else is new. What is new though, is how Mie-san actually
  feels real bad right now, but still does not get why Komura would go all the
  way out to help her. We're just friends, don't worry about it. Oh, this is
  just a draft by the way, can't get the actual proposal thing out yet.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also we love you lose your glasses so the author can keep up with
  the lore haha she can't know that. But in an effort to know that, and I like
  where this is going I also expect this too, is the secondary character romance
  lore from Asuka hanging out with her boyfriend-to-be? Let's just say it is,
  Mie-san. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And Mie-san saw the same expression on Komura when she
  stares at him good even with contact lenses. You see where this is going now?
  AND DON'T YOU DARE SAY YOU DON'T KNOW OF LOVE YOU ARE 15- All in all... dear
  Komura, how bad do you think you will lose all hope for not being with
  Mie-san? Huh, what do you think? You want to look at my love life and compare
  right now? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyway, it's always fun to notice a girl with a GLARING
  weakness haha get it because with glasses especially a new pair? Haha because
  guess what, it's hard to find someone like this no more. At least, weaknesses
  not obvious to the human eye. Or maybe I'm dumb, that's probably the case.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I like the progression (not lenses) here though, and hopefully,
  fingers crossed, that Mie-san will figure this infatuation from her classmate
  sitting next to her. Or whatever they are kissing, we can't do this for real
  anyways. Haha see you then this is already more interesting than last week imo
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "She might just forget about her glasses, after all." Yup haha I'm
  going to make this joke every week as long as I remember my glasses <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>]

  bad- Says Komura when they are married to each other lol foreshadowing right

  HELL YEAH VIOLA haha did you even see the intro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That's how you do
  character design dude, just make the cutest girl in this series. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In
  this new episode where I'm hyped up on something apparently
  (#ShinigamiBocchan20), looks like it's hype about plot, and boy did we get a
  lot of that, so let's. Firstly, Viola-chan came in to visit Cuff-san haha yes
  not Zain and not like he cares about Viola too BOOM got her chest, is probably
  trying to fill up the empty noblewoman hole by hanging out with others unlike
  her loner mom whose husband is probably dying soon lol, is slowly but surely
  taking in some advice from Cuff-san at a time where she is in love and also
  she has no parents so nothing to stop her from doing anything. Though for
  Viola if being a fashion designer or stylist is her passion, heck, why not?
  Also, the mom might not even have a say if Walter takes over and I can't wait
  for that to happen. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I know right, screw Bocchan being the oldest in
  the household I like Daleth's flashback of an illusion more where Walter's the
  elder brother. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of which, we gotta deal with the intruders
  into the Sabbath earlier. Well, there's the Daleth getting high from Walter's
  gentlemanliness which I do not possess so damn you second son haha. Also, he
  is still totally right on how useless the brother was but mostly due to lack
  of exposure. Because really, how are we even going to build his social skills
  up if he keeps killing the people he meets just from shaking hands? So yeah,
  bit of a problem which comes out from the same hole as the one Daleth just
  opened, where she shows the rest to Sharon's current resting place... but not
  really she is just asleep. Yeah, like in Sleeping Beauty, just that one kiss
  won't wake her up. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Walter, you want to try? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh heck,
  considering this and Bocchan's curse stemmed from the same witch and who knows
  if she is still alive she might as well not be at this point, then I rather
  just be asleep instead of walking about anyways. In Daleth's flashback though,
  the only thing we really missed until now was Sade showing up near the mansion
  with Daleth herself, and if this sister had even considered stopping Sade for
  whatever reason, things would have been different. But just seeing her in her
  flashback is giving her the creeps, so maybe we save that for next time. But
  after showing us all this? Yeah, we can trust Daleth I guess. On the other
  hand, there's someone else we can't trust now. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Somehow Rob is under
  so much suspicion I wonder why we haven't got to that lol maybe for another
  episode, but more suspicious is how a genie lamp appeared on their doorstep,
  once again courtesy of Zain. The genie is able to remove his curse though, but
  only by moving it to another person. Sadly Bocchan can't bear to see someone
  else suffer instead of him lol implied is Rob if you didn't notice he's old
  though so he'll be fine lmao, and we are back to square one. You know, a
  glimpse of hope but not really. Just like how the two actually shared a kiss
  but not really actually. All in all... <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> haha I can't be more sad
  already, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Serious talk though, we are that desperate already,
  by the way because SAME lol. Two seasons in already. Walter's going to take
  over the household already as he should. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, Zain and Cuff are
  dating already. What else? Haha yeah just these two main characters to be
  honest. And boy am I glad we didn't get to see Viola-chan die someday while
  touching Rob lol that would suck, among other things that might happen
  considering the garden of the mansion just turned brown all of a sudden haha.
  Still, great progress, we are clearing things up, I know this story has an
  ending it's just whether they are going to conclude it in this adaptation, and
  I can't wait to be satisfied if they give us the proper ending. Only one way
  to find out by watching it till the end, I guess.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I would argue though, that if we are going to move the curse and not
  be able to destroy it, then maybe move to someone who already wants to die.
  But uh... maybe we have to ask around for this haha maybe they won't die by
  then and be evil and wreck havoc- Okay maybe not then lol]

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Oh well, if we want the Hunting Dogs in I guess we have to be their dog- Wait.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I am just waiting for the drop and it's not
  when Atsushi drops Teruko on the airport carpet lol (#BungouStrayDogs58), well
  Atsushi's ending came in real fast once he realized that Ranpo-san is always
  telling the truth while the Hunting Dog member in front of her is still most
  definitely not trusting him in any way possible, so he's pretty much done for
  at this point. This is the direct opposite for Tetchou's case though as he
  continues his fight with Kenji haha yes "continue" means his opponent is still
  very much alive, and as he tries to deal the final blow, he was informed of
  Atsuhi's fate and not like Kenji didn't hear it, so he raged and boy do we not
  want to anger this farmer. Just like how farmers will rage if a landslide
  comes ruining their harvest for the year haha ask those American farmers now
  at this time of year with the seasonal floods, as heard from Kunikida, Kenji
  once saved his village from disaster mainly because his rage was incited by
  the death of his buddy, leading him to move Earth as if his mother is really
  the planet itself, which piqued Fukuc- Fukuzawa (lol rookie traitor mistake)
  as he visited the lands to find out what happened back then. So turns out,
  this is likely Kenji's ultimate power as we have seen with Akutagawa and
  Chuuya and yes trust me I Ranpo-san'ed this out last night thinking about how
  Kenji would have survived this, and this is pretty much it. No human power
  will be able to deal with this even if they are trained or even genetically
  modified human, because you are dealing with essentially The Terminator.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or mother nature itself, one would argue. So there's that, the two
  did end up in a draw since Kenji's rage can't carry him that far... yet.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Then again Tetchou might have realized his mistake for not following
  Bram and Aya-chan but heck, does that even matter at this point. Hehe hints
  for later, but let's bring ourselves back to the prison. Remember the
  30-minute game Nikolai set out for the 2 prisoners? Well, instead of figuring
  out how to get the antidote, Dazai thought of killing his opponent first.
  Makes sense, easier than escaping this hell of a prison, but it's also because
  Sigma kind of figured out why he's this relaxed. Well, to keep the steady
  heartbeat transmission for sending messages to outside of the premises of
  course, but also, how that can be done in reverse. He didn't need to I guess,
  if orders are always sent out Ango-san can figure something out. Something
  like making an agreement with other prisoners (by the way) to stop time in the
  prison so Dazai can take over the control room because what better way to make
  sure you are in charge is to kill the people in charge and never tell anyone
  about it? Haha yeah, this is basically an Aizen-controlled Central 46 for you
  "BLEACH" fans out there haha, where central command has been taken over from
  the beginning, to influence decisions made from the top. Easy. Even say now,
  if Dazai wanted to kill Fyodor, it's as easy as changing all the passcodes on
  the cards so Fyodor is doomed to fail from the start, even if he thinks
  security bypass is the hardest thing to go around which, I assumed he tried,
  and didn't know he was dealing with this much resistance. Well, Fyodor has his
  way of communication too, so he might get out. And we don't talk about
  Aya-chan's fate with Bram in the carpark haha. I mean, Fukuchi's a military
  expert, right? Eventually he will catch on to her plans. All in all though,
  damn this is quite the development, and I'm still glad this series still has
  stuff we don't know about that can change things around, as much as we really
  do not know a lot about them anyways. From Kenji to Dazai to Bram with the
  stick up his rear TWICE lmao, each of them delivered their own part of history
  related to the story without forgetting we are essentially dealing with a
  bunch of geniuses, so yeah, I admit defeat. Just stab me in the head with the
  sword for the third time, please. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I've been thinking of way to kill Chuuya for the past 7 years" I
  mean, yeah Dazai, are you? Haha]

  No guilts picking up the potato chips, Mini-chan, no guilts whatsoever.

  with Mini-chan and her plans to celebrate Kazuya breaking out of virginity
  lmao. Of course, Kazuya had to explain to a disappointed Mini-chan everything
  that has happened, she liked it lol, and thought that her great master plan
  has failed terribly because the guy didn't do anything to the hot chick in the
  hotel room? BRUH where can I get a Mini-chan in my life? To make sure I get
  laid? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, and a real girlfriend who will be pissed by all this.

  on their movie screening. Hey, the movie is about done at this point, and
  looks like they've secured a location to air this for the backers and likely
  for limited screening if the ones shown here of Anime are anything to go by,
  all the arrangements have been made so that grandma Sayuri gets to watch this
  fantastic production along with her granddaughter and will no doubt cry
  buckets after all of this. But she is crying already? Even crying, we need to
  do a rehearsal. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Heck, can we not have the vision I think will happen
  come true? As in, I will tell you if it happens? Haha let's not say that's
  true. For now though, even just at this point, Chizuru herself can't help but
  say more thanks to this producer of a not boyfriend who suggested making this
  a reality so that her elders will be proud of her pursuing of her dreams, just
  like the grandpa egged her to do so. But I mean, we've heard of all the thanks
  already, where's the

    >"special thanks"</a

  though? Haha get it, the ending theme song joke (also if you'll check out
  <a href="https://twitter.com/specialthanks_7" target="_blank"
    >the band with such a name</a
  >
  that'll be swell too, not the same thing by the way- I love Japanese music
  references) but then again, will she say more thanks though? Man, this is only
  going to so sideways real quick, I already saw that drop happen from a mile
  away at this point, but problem is, this isn't new. Then my question is...
  when? Turns out, this isn't far away from us as the drama takes a turn, and
  Sayuri is once again in hospital. Problem is, this one, she might not live
  till Kazuya's grandmother comes to visit her. Yup, it's that time now. All the
  lies that they said, all her dreams she wanted to achieve right now with a
  substitute because damn this was for the grandfather too... So now what? As
  the couple (lol) argue in the hospital about the lies that they said, and
  Kazuya did also hint that to Sayuri even though it doesn't even matter the old
  woman wanted to record it for her late husband by the way hehe, when will this
  be the truth? And Chizuru has no reason to say it's anyone's fault: All of
  them went along with her further than the reverse. Yeah, Chizuru is going to
  go to her grandma and tell her Kazuya is going to break up with her unless she
  wakes up, right? This is it? This is how the drama works? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> All in
  all... <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> As I listen to the ending theme song which I think the artist

    >Amber's mentioned before this was their first version</a
  >
  before the studio version was made... <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I can't. Hey Chizuru chasing your
  dreams is fine though, but are you chasing a dude? Asking for a friend.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, they can make this not a lie, isn't it? Ruka-chan will be
  devastated but that relationship is also not real so why not settle for this
  one right now? They say it's a great time to walk into a woman who suffered
  from a traumatic event... heck, which drama didn't make use of that to tell a
  love story? Maybe Kazuya you can try this out. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, really
  trying to make this light-hearted but I guess we don't have much time even for
  that now we are burning through this like Sayuri's life depends on it, so we
  shall see what happens next. Yes, my vision is basically as Kaoru in Japanese
  movie
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_to_the_Sun" target="_blank"

  then.

  [TL:DR; "My life isn't for you to control remotely!" Basically Kazuya in the
  past few episodes lol hey bro maybe being with Mini-chan here is better if
  you're into such plays-]

  Now that I think about it, we are given a sad opening theme song but yet
  there's no sadness and it's nothing but jokes so far? HOW?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways
  haha, let's change pace in this new episode (#HorimiyaPiece10) where we talk
  about me- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah new guy time apparently, this one is definitely
  not in my dictionary haha I don't even know what he smells like, we talk about
  Watabe. About him though... he likes dudes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, is that same voice
  as Kenji-kun from "Stray Dogs"?? BRO, we just listened to you just now!
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, it's not? Haha oh more like the guy in "Just Because!", got it.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways coming back, let's just say Watabe idolizes Miyamura for some
  reason? Yeah, not to the comprehension of us heterogender beings but hey, you
  do you, bro. And I guess the problem is that Miyamura just goes along with his
  antics to you know, not offend him even though much like Ishikawa I would love
  to tell him to leave him alone and put down that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/garakei" target="_blank">old phone</a>
  camera lol, much like Miyamura deals with his girlfriend. Speaking of which,
  uh... <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Watabe, you aren't scared of Hori-san at all? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just
  give me a minute to <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> because DAMN this guy grew balls from a factory I
  can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on haha he will learn his lesson someday just not
  right now haha, because Miyamura is getting the short straw here, as Hori-san
  is basically security sniffing him like the dog she is (lol) on the times he
  drops by her place and still wondered why she is so particular about this, but
  maybe, just maybe, she is a <em>little</em> bit on the j-j-j-jealousy side, who
  knows. Then again, even Miyamura has a hard time figuring this woman out
  including her tastes in his sadist actions towards her which damn I hate to
  say Watabe would be happy to deal with too, will not get that honour because
  if he ever does it'll be Watabe's last...? Haha you will never live to see
  Hori-san again if you do that, bro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not like I know what the author
  is thinking creating such a character, so let's go back to a more predictable
  character Hori-san...? Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, all in a day's work pissing her
  off, it's totally her fault for thinking all of the above so I have to write
  all of this out lol, but yet, she is not apologizing. Mostly because of the
  wall she hit afterwards lmao, but also, it's against her family code. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  No, not that, she just isn't such a person. And Miyamura knows that. Apart
  from upsetting everyone with their lover's tiff and particularly Hori-san
  wanting to erase Sengoku saying sensible words if she can lmao, Hori still
  won't give in and that's what the Hori family is about in general just ask the
  dad haha. But yeah, Miyamura will get worried of his gal so he went to check
  her out after Yasuda-sensei ensured he checked&nbsp; in all the places he can
  illegally check on her on. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still got kicked in the front though, poor
  Miyamura, but apparently if I pity on him I will get sniffed out so yeah,
  serves him right for all of this even though it's the girl's fault. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  All in all... much in a day's work, innit? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I can do without Watabe
  though. Also Iura. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Definitely more insight to the lives of them in
  general and that's still more interesting than some of the weaker episodes in
  general, so that's good. We are at the final stretch here, and not like there
  will be a drop here this isn't "KanoKari" you know haha ah, but we shall see.
  Maybe we will have to bully Watabe so he will not go around disturbing
  Miyamura again lmao I didn't suggest that

this second season. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I might as well already at this point I haven't by
the way in case you wondered. Moving on, GRANDODEO's new single released this
week isn't actually too bad at all, it did make me want to give chance to their
B-sides until I didn't, so maybe we not talk about also

which also did not get me where I hoped it will as I still struggle to give the
title song. Maybe we ended this week on a bad note, huh. Hey, at least August is
over and done with in terms of Anime songs...? Haha not yet though we still got
another week.<br />
<br />There are news happening in the music industry this week and I meant
specifically in Japan and within my reach.

is for his new song which I still haven't given yet and probably will anyways
because damn I really don't like this style of music.

and am still not impressed haha let's forget about this and give it objectively
in a couple more days.

when the music video appears next week.

for their upcoming single so be sure to tune in to listen to their newest and
classics.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Next week though, we aren't quite done with Anime, so I'll deal with
<b>Omoinotake's new single</b> considering this is for Anime and Limited Edition
I can't buy it though, and of course <b>their new album</b> when it drops by
just because I'm such a nice guy to give them chance. What I can buy though is
<b>w.o.d.'s new single</b> which I forgot to check if it exists but turns out it
does, and I've effectively given the single at this point already so maybe I
should spend some time thinking of where to get the CD from. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

which was delayed and did not appear last month, will be a good time to appear
this week instead so let's see if we can give a couple more songs from at this
point, Klassic Note's most aspiring music artist. Well, it has already come out
but still. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span><br />

I did promise to do a roundup of The Fanfiction series I've done in the past
couple of months but since I'm lazy and I want to take more naps haha don't mind
me, I shall do a quick summary of what Aozaki Shouhei is and where he is at with
the ladies around him to far:<br />
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      Recently moved to the Natsukawa family with my single parent and now have
      three new stepsisters including Natsukawa Shiina
    </li>
    <li>Currently working in the same company as Takahashi Rie</li>
    <li>
      Confessed to Amamiya Sora during our high school days and got rejected
    </li>
    <li>Good at cooking due to being mocked at for not being able to</li>
    <li>
      Might only be an acquaintance to Asakura Momo, but she is secretly
      infatuated with me
    </li>
    <li>Occasionally live with Natsukawa Shiina at her family's place</li>
    <li>
      Currently living in a personal bungalow, near the bottom of a hillside
    </li>
    <li>
      Once sheltered Hanazawa Kana from a pouring rain, in that very bungalow
    </li>

      Indebted to Minase Inori for saving my live due to an unknown incident
    </li>

      neighbourhood
    </li>
    <li>
      Currently dating Koga Aoi, who has doubts about my relationship with other
      women
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    Wow, that's a lot to take away from just two months of short stories.
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Moving ahead though, I might focus on doing APoL or probably not,
    then I'll think of other stories which will make sense and I can find
    material for, specifically the images. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you next time for more
    lore if I can come up with more, but until then I may have to start
    preparing for the upcoming blog posts which will require a lot more time to
    think about and/or prepare for considering the next package is where I
    replicate an online experience on going to the recent Comic Market 102 ie.
    Comiket, if I were in Japan. I hope I will be ready by then I am already
    closing my eyes as I pay for the shipping fees needed to bring them to my
    room hehe
