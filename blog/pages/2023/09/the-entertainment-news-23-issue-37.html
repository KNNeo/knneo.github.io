Wow, this week was great. It was a wise choice to ship the package early as in
two days early because I got it real quick since it was a huge package and thus
it cannot be delivered by the post office (thanks FedEx!) and so I got to do up
that post for THE WHOLE WEEKDAY no seriously don't take my word for it this has
got to be MY BIGGEST EFFORT in making a blog post so far. Yeah, big as in
breasts-
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyhow haha, welcome to the weekend again! As if celebrating Waki Azumi <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
  and Aizawa Saya (hehe) and Takao Kanon(?) birthdays aren't enough, I enjoyed a
  good amount of *ahem* 2D artwork this week because I basically spent all my
  free time reading TWELVE books and didn't even realize 3 of them are super
  thicc (lol) I had to spend even more time, so I had to pace it out instead of
  clearing all of them in one day. Yes, including doing up some research of all
  of them on Monday. Well, I should be able to clear them if they were all less
  than 20 pages long but NOPE. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well you can see the marvel for yourself but please remember to come back and
  find out what new stuff has happened in my world of Anime and music! Now that
  was a sleek transition hehe<br />

  I think we are at the stage where Mie-san is very intentionally appealing to
  the guy, that's good, that's good- If we can keep the "Takagi-san" lore going
  that'll be dope <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> in this new episode where we are at the final stretch
  (#SukiMega10), well Komura we'll take whatever you are thinking as a yes.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay, this episode is actually easy to talk about actually, because
  now we know, I think we know, that someone has taken a liking to Komura. Oh,
  not the other girls in the class though haha that'll be asking for death,
  because you know, Mie-san's getting jealous with her boi hanging out with
  Someya-san of all people. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But not really that since Someya took it
  upon herself to think that some middle schoolers are smooching in class lmao,
  but more of that though, Mie-san is getting desperate? Hmm, maybe not that.
  Serious? We're taking about Komura's feelings here. Yeah, and not like a
  confession is incoming so Mie-san is CLEARLY enjoying herself and making sure
  she can CLEARLY see her boi even without her glasses. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Unlike what
  Komura thinks that her gal can't see her friends because damn even if I'm
  blind I can also hear my friends, Mie-san wants to see Komura up close just
  because. She even ended up setting rules for this so that Komura would think
  this way, like, gotta see my boi's face once a day in school if I didn't bring
  glasses. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah it's like "RikeKoi" with the hugging for a minute rule
  from Himuro. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Oh boy if you have seen Yukimura's reaction to this
  lmao basically looking like Komura) So you see, this is how you stay in love,
  guys. I know everything; I'm a virgin. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Even throughout the episode
  and/or preparing for the school festival, we can clearly see that Mie-san is
  taking every chance to talk to her boi in the nurse's office, and even just
  wanting to help him out without her glasses, or even walking to the art
  storage room to get more glue... together, it's at every corner we see Mie-san
  trying to spend her alone time with her boi. Seriously though, how can no one
  know what that means? Yeah Azuma, how the heck do you not link the black marks
  on Komura's face to Mie-san's hands?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Thank goodness Someya didn't
  figure that out or else someone's going to die with embarrassment. I guess
  this is how we get compensated for not having that sports storage room landing
  on top of one another "accident" most high school romance series tend to have.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... f**king
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">normies</a>.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I would have lesser to talk about at this point I'm actually enjoying
  what Mie-san is doing to Komura that he doesn't seem to understand. We are
  ending with the school festival it seems, and it looks like Mie-san is only
  getting bolder in her advances to Komura so... bro, I wish you all the best,
  dude. You got a girl you like, she might already be on her way to liking you
  back... We need to tell him the good news or it'll be too late- It won't.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you then.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "She gets anxious on days she forgets her glasses because she can't
  see her friends. But she feels better someone's face up close... That's why
  she wants to see my face" Nope, not that bro haha he doesn't know]

  Then again, don't think I've lived any time of my life sitting by firewood so
  I will never understand what it feels anyways. In this new episode where Cuff
  is learning English and can't go past "F" lol definitely not her cup size haha
  it's higher than that lmao (#ShinigamiBocchan21), well I'm glad we can still
  make jokes while still pursue the lore in this, and that's what keeps this
  going I suppose. Firstly, Daleth seems to be making the trip of apologies on
  Walter's behalf?? Haha heck, this second son (lmao) is taking care of
  everything it seems, and as much as Daleth likes to be the bad guy, she is
  going around apologizing to everyone what she has done and also revealed the
  truth behind her sister's actions to Bocchan and the others. Especially the
  reminder from the first season, where she told Zain who stole some book
  containing Sharon's notes? I forgot already to be honest, which will explain
  more of the lore behind what happened. What we do now know though, is some of
  the history of the household according to Rob as he explains to Alice, some
  time ago Bocchan's grandfather picked him up on the streets to work in the
  mansion (the one they are in, not the one with the rest), and he witnessed
  some guests different from the usual bunch as the elder makes connections as a
  noble family. It would seem like old Bocchan (lol) has dealt with
  practitioners of magic before, saying that feels scary already, and maybe in
  revenge Sade chose to put a curse on some of the people living in it,
  including his descendants and Sharon, who is still unable to wake up from her
  eternal slumber. Man, didn't know the lore is this deep, but seeing as what
  happened it kind of makes sense. Daleth is obviously trying to avoid this
  awkwardness again, even encouraging witches to be friends with humans well at
  least be friends with the human who can kill them by touching them lmao, as
  Teto even went to their place to fix Alice's small abode into something fancy,
  something that would otherwise never have been approved through autocratic
  procedures of the rich. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, maybe the fixing of the house is
  also rather appropriate for such an occasion, as it has also been 2 years (I'm
  sorry Walter) since Alice worked in this mansion, thank goodness, and all of
  the above happened so fast as Bocchan tries to reach for the truth, and no
  matter how far that might still be right now, they are getting close. And just
  as we get closer to Hugo's bunch of pickpocket "friends" and see them get
  owned by a couple of weird people, looks like we may have more things coming
  all of their way, and I don't mean just Zain and Cuff anymore. All in all...
  who are those guys, really?? Haha not talking about Hugo's old gang, but
  those... let's just say they are witches from another place, the place where
  Daleth doesn't rule. Hmm... hey, what did I say about progression in the
  story? Now that we really found footing compared to the start of the season, I
  hope they see this through. We are so close to the truth, but heck, maybe a
  couple more episodes won't hurt. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> We shall see where this goes then,
  please no season three please no season three haha you can keep the jokes
  coming but remember to finish the story I beg of you

  Uh Akutagawa? You can't kill Bram bro, if you kill him you will reverse
  everything actually. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where friends don't matter
  lol (#BungouStrayDogs59), as usual we have a lot more story to go through, so
  let's talk about what happened. Well, the Agency is screwed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean,
  they put Atsushi in the bed, what do you want me to do? Well, I guess I wanted
  Teruko to release him, but more than that, she knew to convince Atsushi to not
  do anything on his side after releasing him, unlike the many other members who
  have been taken hostage by Fukuchi and are in the same position as him just a
  while ago. Uh, we will not dabble on the truth just yet because honestly
  saying we have no idea what that is, and let's just say even if it's justice,
  Atsushi chose to leave so that he can do something about it, or well, at least
  try to talk to someone about it. Problem is, the fates of many of his comrades
  are pretty much sealed. I guess we don't need to talk about Kunikida and
  Tanizaki, Ranpo was taken out immediately by Fukuchi for he already knows
  beforehand this will be an issue and Ranpo will be better off just hiding
  himself into the book Poe gave him honestly, and Fukuzawa... let's just say
  he's done for. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Becuase even in the long flashback we were provided,
  we see that Fukuchi and Fukuzawa were meant to take different paths even
  though they have the same ambitions as kids to hone their sword. I mean, times
  change and the war did happen outside of Japan which was way more exciting
  and... uh, deadly? I don't know what Fukuchi saw in that, but even Fukuzawa
  wasn't right in thinking Fukuchi is doing all of this right now for revenge.
  At least I will deduce that all his buddy did is definitely in spite of
  Fukuzawa not being by his side after knowing him for so long. And the lack
  thereof which is likely bringing upon his own downfall, for Fukuzawa.
  But&nbsp;I think we can all agree Fukuzawa made the right choice, unlike
  Fukuchi. That's why he's the nice guy haha he can't be

    target="_blank"
    >2way nice guy</a
  >&nbsp;but still, one way will do. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Sorry for song title joke) Even
  in ending the war, Fukuzawa made the right(er) choice compared to that
  bloodbath of a killer who just cheats his way into taking over the world or
  something, even the United Nations leader is under his orders at this point,
  believing he can save the world. I mean, there will be no humans to save no
  more so yeah sir you might as well let him rule the world of vampires.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Easier to control, right? And we don't even need to resort to
  Communism- Moving on haha, the prison lore got even deeper (literally) where
  history repeats himself? And Dazai and Sigma found themselves in the exact
  situation he set up for Fyodor and Chuuya. Well, not really, just a reminder
  that the footage we saw last week was probably not real I don't know if Fyodor
  can even do that (choice of illusion, they did this with the cave music too
  some seasons ago), but apparently they escaped unscathed, don't know how that
  works. But yeah, considering every corner can be a vampire and we just need to
  have not Sigma to tell it off to our new god Fyodor (lmao), then I guess it
  shouldn't be very hard to fight against the actual brains of the Agency, isn't
  it? Heck, I really thought we are going to get Sigma as the new guy in the
  terrorist group, but oh well, we're all dead now, great. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all,
  exciting development which kind of makes no sense at this point apparently
  since we don't know the truth just yet and it really feels like they are
  picking up the pace with Fukuchi's meeting with Fukuzawa, and Aya-chan is
  still in pieces hopefully just one piece and the rest is just hair that she
  can grow back lol we believe in cute girls living forever <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, but yeah,
  considering we haven't even talked about that many people around the world
  that hopefully aren't vampire yet I sure hope Ango is still human and Natsume
  Souseki is still cat haha, we might still have a way out. Logic reasoning in
  this series? Not if this is the final episode haha see you then
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I'm going to master the sword alongside you" Damn Fukuchi? The moment
  you pulled out a sword that can travel time and space, I don't think you
  honoured that no more lol what a bloody loser, literally]

  If you don't want to talk to your grandma, then maybe Chizuru, let your stage
  person talk to her then. Nice, Kazuya. In this new episode where I'm glad this
  isn't going to be the last thing I watch this week (#KanoKari33), but for
  Sayuri here, the movie from Chizuru might be her last. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Alright, let's be
  serious for a bit now, and let's talk about why Chizuru till date still chose
  to be the liar that Sayuri also did all these years. To be real though, not
  that I don't think Sayuri's belief are right in that we live in the 99% lies
  because damn am I not a good enough liar, but also, that we would like to
  think that at least Sayuri did fall in love and have a husband, for Christ's
  sake, and Chizuru is still struggling to lie more than 99% of the time just so
  she can get people like Kazuya off her back. But see, even if it doesn't make
  your old lady sad, won't it make you sad? See, Chizuru. Just tell her the
  truth, but then actually do the deed. Then it won't be a lie, won't it? *taps
  brain* 200 IQ plays here might I recommend, but heck, she's not going to do
  it. Nonetheless, Kazuya dropped in with the sudden last-minute screening in
  the hospital room <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> and gave her the last wish just in case we are dealing
  with Chizuru grandfather's case where we won't even have time to watch it at
  all, still I don't think this is fair even to Sayuri, but you know, Chizuru
  has always been like this all the while, and will continue to not flail
  outside of her family and that means she will never from here on... I don't
  think this will be good for her mental health too but what do I know. Moving
  on, Kazuya and her grandmother did visit the wake some days later, and even
  then Kazuya was thinking of how to even approach Chizuru at this point.
  Seriously thinking for a bit though? If I'm Kazuya I might start asking my
  grandma about Chizuru. Hey, we can't take Mini-chan's advice so uh... maybe
  third-party opinions count? Gramps can't carry the secret long anyways- All in
  all... I really need to stop making jokes, this is above all a serious
  episode. I don't think I want to elaborate more since this is such a heavy
  episode in itself, but you get the idea. Chizuru is sad and alone without any
  family right now, she is putting on such a brave front only Mini-chan can see
  that is not the case but who is going to break it to her? Kazuya likely, of
  all people. So looks like, he will do this the way he knows best: by hiring
  has as a rental girlfriend again. Damn, well not like Chizuru needs
  compassionate leave, she isn't compassionate even to herself. So let's see
  next episode around to conclude this arc, if Kazuya can do anything, and I
  mean <em>anything</em>, to get her to spill it all out. Literally. Heck, at this
  point even I know it's bottling in her. I wonder what happened on the
  grandfather's death, if she has been this strong. Maybe not, she was still a
  student back then. Now though? It'll take some knocking on which will probably
  knock us some tears again I'm glad I'm only using my shirt so far lol note to
  self bring in the tissues next week, but yeah, for once I will cheer on for
  Kazuya. You got it, bro. It's all in now no one can stop you- Okay maybe
  Mini-chan but don't tell her about your plans, just never haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I would say, above all else, the conclusion to this end, is very
  adequate. Please, there are dramas that will show you the hand drop on the bed
  (which I was totally expecting) and that will probably make it worse. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>
  Thanks, Anime, even if the lack of budget made that an excuse, or the author,
  thanks for not making this sadder, I won't be able to take it. I'm not that
  strong lol]

  (yes to all gentlemen, yours is in White Day but same same) to anyone without
  restrictions on budget or how thick your skin is lol, who would you give?
  Maybe I'll send one to each of the female voice actresses I know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  We're talking about in school, by the way, so that doesn't count. In this new
  episode though where people are pondering about Valentine's Day gifts
  (#HorimiyaPiece11), I gotta say this is the one episode that might have
  covered the most grounds and heck, even introduced us to new characters even
  at this time?? Okay, Anime, you do you. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Of course, most of the focus
  is on Honoka here, where even just in wrapping she is worried about how it
  looked, unlike Hori-san who just wrapped hers in shrink-wrap. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyways, problem isn't about her or how Miyamura is going to give her a Love
  Day gift, apparently it's more on that classmate of Honoka's? Yeah, she wanted
  to give a gift to someone among the third-years which Honoka knows a lot of,
  but ironically, it's not any of those she mentioned that will likely be the
  target. Alright alright let me pause the video and take a guess... that joker,
  right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If I know how <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> this series' comedy
  works <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> it has gotta be <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Alright I may have laughed too much
  here. *pft* Yes, I am of course talking about Iura because how do you think
  this series gets its comedy relief? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You brave girl, giving chocolates
  to this slob. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, since Iura is desperate like I do every
  Valentine's Day in school (lol not true I just give up on all hope) unlike the
  others, you can give him anything, just as Honoka asked Iura about and gave
  him the middle finger. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, Honoka only likes Hori-san, bro,
  you have no chance. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Moving on haha, Hori-san is just so troubled
  about actually doing the logical thing on Love Day instead of making White Day
  happen first haha. Well, Miyamura owns a bakery he will whip up anything good
  anyways, so as Remi-chan said, it's kind of up to her if she wants to do
  something for her boi. So she tried, she asked Sakura about it so she only has
  one person to kill if this leaks out early (lmao), and Sakura told her about
  her
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kurorekishi" target="_blank"
    >dark history</a
  >
  of learning to make desserts, starting with a book in the library they were
  in. The Hori family immediately rushed to see how the one Hori Kyouko is going
  to make chocolates in the kitchen considering how bad she is at cooking lol,
  but it turned out quite well. Apart from the roasting from Souta-kun which for
  once makes me want to roast this brat on a fire pit lmao, it doesn't seem too
  bad, not even when it was given to Sakura to try too. I mean, as Sakura-chan
  (hehe) said, this is probably good enough. Also, added bonus for Miyamura to
  talk about it too. If it's too good then what else is there to talk about? And
  then you can drama this out and make him mad just like you wanted, Hori-san.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See? It's not that bad. Well, it's not that bad at all, Miyamura
  ended up liking it actually, and thank goodness it's small so you can continue
  to serve your poison slower- And we don't talk about the rest of how
  Valentine's Day went. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Like, you want me to talk about how there were
  two boxes in Sakura's gift to Yoshikawa and her boi Ishikawa- OMFG I THOUGHT
  WE WILL NOT BE TALKING ABOUT SAKURA PROBLEMS THIS SEASON- Well thanks Anime, I
  hate you now. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> All in all... do you think Hori's chocolate tastes better
  or Yoshikawa's? Wrong answers only. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Whatever Honoka's classmate did
  not give to Iura probably tasted better. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But hey, all is in a day of
  life in Anime school, isn't it? I recall having a hard time not giving
  chocolates to someone I like, we've all been there. It's just a matter of
  whether you can give the gift indirectly haha yeah watch Honoka give it to
  Iura and make him think what he assumed was true lol f**k off dude haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "When I started making desserts, I borrowed this book a lot" NO SAKURA
  NOT FOR HIM lol]

  Yeah, WE are the ones beating Ishida up haha uh... they not gonna talk about
  Inoue's rack, huh. Understandable. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we found
  out Ishida doesn't like us no more (#BLEACHTYBW22), yeah we gotta do the
  20-year-old plot thing by sitting here and thinking about how Ishida just
  sh*tfaced us, longer than any of their ages and this series too, ladies and
  gentlemen. And those flashbacks, dude. Too many of them is bad though, not
  good for airtime. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Let's talk about what happened in the battlefield
  instead, eh? More interesting than Inoue apparently. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's talk about
  Gizelle, and finally it's her time to shine. I know we still have Renji and
  Rukia and Byakuya but heck, since Urahara-sensei made mention of Mayuri we
  shall talk about his initial involvement in the war. Because for Gizelle, her
  powers are kinda gross, and not like I would rely Ikkaku and Yumichika to
  fight Bambi-chan but the latter is already smarter than what, Shinji? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  So yeah, at least they have some fight in them if they used their brains.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also, hell yeah as a Kido user I shall celebrate the first Hado used
  in this arc, a rare sight not seen in years lol. Thanks Yumichika, I really
  needed that. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sniff*</span> Now that I got the fuel to talk about the rest haha,
  lucky for these two, their brains won't be used by Gizelle to power zombies
  since they aren't dead yet, but for Bambi-chan though, this might give them an
  issue. Cue Mayuri and his assistant Nemu dropping down like Buddha
  reincarnated lol (this is not true, Buddhist believers, your God isn't Mayuri
  FYI) (or maybe...?) (haha) and learning about the lore of Gizelle's powers,
  quickly devised a way to deal with Bambi-chan. Delays aren't anything special
  it's just a fuse according to him, but heck, it works and blew her into
  pieces, so that works. What didn't work though is Gizelle trying to power her
  back up, so I don't think Bambi-chan will get her reward that soon which I
  have NO idea what that is so <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'm not exactly
  <strike>sadisfied</strike> satisfied by this scene either so we're good.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Married woman, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The husband will understand.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, it is still problematic to be outnumbered on Mayuri with
  shinigami soldiers now under Gizelle's control, but ironically, and I think we
  can talk more about this now that Yumichika and Ikkaku are still around,
  Mayuri has a solution to that, since we now know the secret that is hiding in
  Szayelaporro's lab. It's the fallen Espadas if you would recall they are
  elite(?) Arrancar who lost their posts (and to Szayel lol) that upon Szayel's
  loss to Mayuri, did end up finding them and giving them new life which is
  ironic to say compared to what Gizelle did with just
  <strike>her</strike> their blood lmao, but hey, real happy to even just see
  these guys back in action once in a while and hear Cullhorne fire their super
  long-winded named Cero. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Brings back memories, but not like we have
  too much time for that, because remember Hitsugaya who is half dead after
  stopping one of the Sternritters? HE IS BACK but as a zombie? Uh oh. You want
  to take your own life by betraying the Gotei? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, this has
  been great so far. We have made crazy progress as usual, and for me? I just
  like to see more variety. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You know, Mayuri, the Arrancar, and even
  Hitsugaya into the mix? Damn, this is going to be fun, it gets me excited not
  exactly aroused, per se. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> No, I'm not Gizelle, I'm not that homo.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on with the many jokes you might have missed and some they
  have cut down to fit into this adaptation, in case you don't know Mayuri is
  going to win this fight with Gigi and he will deal with another enemy which
  will be way worse than this. Since in this case, he was clearly prepared for
  this, so let's see where Ichigo and the others end up next. Not going to be
  good news from here on though, just so you are aware. I'll enjoy the fights
  for now though! LET'S GO MORE KIDO haha what

    This week in Klassic Note is great we started September strong which will
    make the other weeks in the month pale in comparison, and so are the songs
    too. Maybe

    can join those weeks also since it really isn't that great imo but I'll
    still give the title song just because, I'll ignore the B-side.
    <b>w.o.d.'s new single</b> is already a given I've already bought the CD
    already so stay tuned for my once in a blue moon review of an alternative
    rock band haha. MVP this week definitely will be

    because I feel like a deja vu to Suda Keina but with a different vocalist
    and slightly weirder songs as this band gives me more than I can handle, so
    I just ended up giving 2 more songs other than the one Anime opening theme
    song I was here for.&nbsp;

  yes it's their first Anime tie-in and I might just watch the show just
  because, but don't quote me on that yet. And if you can't wait that long you
  can hear it in a month when the digital single is out.

    So for next week, I think we have <b>Ikimonogakari's new single</b> which if
    all goes well from the previews I have heard some time ago this will likely
    join the others on the shelf with the recent batch, and
    <b>Aida Rikako's new mini-album</b> which is so freaking overdue, you won't
    even know which Anime this one popped out from. "Skip and Loafer", yes, the
    Anime last season's ending theme song. And if I get bored of the latter I
    might find some songs to listen to, who knows. Even just reviewing
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/doujinshi" target="_blank"
      >doujin illustration books</a

    has given me some songs to take a peek into somehow.&nbsp;

  Well, somehow I'm ending this week while watching the bunch of new Hololive
  members as if I'm not bored of them but yeah, not watching the streams though,
  totally relying on clippers as I have been since the start. Not particularly
  keen on any of them but Ichijou "<a

  whose illustration book we totally did not miss in my Melonbooks review this
  week so uh... you can tell me which new girl won. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I guess I will
  continue to find out more by watching more clips to see if they are any
  different from the current bunch of jokers (lmao) and since they are a
  music-based group, maybe we will listen to their original songs in a couple of
  years time after what seems to be a trend in me picking up VTuber songs
  inconsistently. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you guys next time then, and maybe until then I
  will be spending more time preparing for more important blog posts I want done
  in due time, not forgetting that KN15YEARS is still a thing. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Wish me
  luck lol
