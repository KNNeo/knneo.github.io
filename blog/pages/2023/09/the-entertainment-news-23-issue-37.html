It was a wise choice to ship the package early as in two days early because I got it real quick since it was a huge package and thus it cannot be delivered by the post office (thanks FedEx!) and so I got to do up that post for THE WHOLE WEEKDAY no seriously don't take my word for it this has got to be MY BIGGEST EFFORT in making a blog post so far. Yeah, big as in breasts-<div><br></div><div>Anyhow haha, welcome to the weekend again! As if celebrating Waki Azumi <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> and Aizawa Saya (hehe) and Takao Kanon(?) birthdays aren't enough, I enjoyed a good amount of *ahem* 2D artwork this week because I basically spent all my free time reading TWELVE books and didn't even realize 3 of them are super thicc (lol) I had to spend even more time, so I had to pace it out instead of clearing all of them in one day. Yes, including doing up some research of all of them on Monday. Well, I should be able to clear them if they were all less than 20 pages long but NOPE. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Well you can see the marvel for yourself but please remember to come back and find out what new stuff has happened in my world of Anime and music! Now that was a sleek transition hehe<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SukiMega10><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Suki na Ko ga Megane wo Wasureta</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I think it was when I took (the glasses) off because they got fogged from my cocoa" EXCUSES lol</div></blockquote>I think we are at the stage where Mie-san is very intentionally appealing to the guy, that's good, that's good- If we can keep the "Takagi-san" lore going that'll be dope <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> in this new episode where we are at the final stretch (#SukiMega10), well Komura we'll take whatever you are thinking as a yes. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay, this episode is actually easy to talk about actually, because now we know, I think we know, that someone has taken a liking to Komura. Oh, not the other girls in the class though haha that'll be asking for death, because you know, Mie-san's getting jealous with her boi hanging out with Someya-san of all people. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But not really that since Someya took it upon herself to think that some middle schoolers are smooching in class lmao, but more of that though, Mie-san is getting desperate? Hmm, maybe not that. Serious? We're taking about Komura's feelings here. Yeah, and not like a confession is incoming so Mie-san is CLEARLY enjoying herself and making sure she can CLEARLY see her boi even without her glasses. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Unlike what Komura thinks that her gal can't see her friends because damn even if I'm blind I can also hear my friends, Mie-san wants to see Komura up close just because. She even ended up setting rules for this so that Komura would think this way, like, gotta see my boi's face once a day in school if I didn't bring glasses. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah it's like "RikeKoi" with the hugging for a minute rule from Himuro. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Oh boy if you have seen Yukimura's reaction to this lmao basically looking like Komura) So you see, this is how you stay in love, guys. I know everything; I'm a virgin. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Even throughout the episode and/or preparing for the school festival, we can clearly see that Mie-san is taking every chance to talk to her boi in the nurse's office, and even just wanting to help him out without her glasses, or even walking to the art storage room to get more glue... together, it's at every corner we see Mie-san trying to spend her alone time with her boi. Seriously though, how can no one know what that means? Yeah Azuma, how the heck do you not link the black marks on Komura's face to Mie-san's hands?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Thank goodness Someya didn't figure that out or else someone's going to die with embarrassment. I guess this is how we get compensated for not having that sports storage room landing on top of one another "accident" most high school romance series tend to have. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... f**king <a href=https://jisho.org/search/riajuu target=_blank>normies</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I would have lesser to talk about at this point I'm actually enjoying what Mie-san is doing to Komura that he doesn't seem to understand. We are ending with the school festival it seems, and it looks like Mie-san is only getting bolder in her advances to Komura so... bro, I wish you all the best, dude. You got a girl you like, she might already be on her way to liking you back... We need to tell him the good news or it'll be too late- It won't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you then.</div><div>[TL:DR; "She gets anxious on days she forgets her glasses because she can't see her friends. But she feels better someone's face up close... That's why she wants to see my face" Nope, not that bro haha he doesn't know]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPaqLjb0LBtTNRAsM4RekHUxSK3tbxW82IBA7XgMAzvHYvReNmmSzJyXaL1xicFmLyb9oLJmyEsv__HbHcLYgrlFMoKBgxttfeJc1JuzVgZGahtirLMZ4jYYfexGfVZEDsX7DuDMQunh5puxQiG4YDcWLtf_Q2vCpdz6AC4OrSon3vciS45XYNdS2KGMc/s320/sukimega10_recorders.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Not gonna lie this is also what happens in schools IRL haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6KTOATk4E66zAOE6hifAOpMmWs3sHk7VmKNLDB6JIkoK0Zw9yZ5KO0NTOW-Loxgl1dYNirLz7eSyDpOiIWCakqOj5Y2IK6zZ-lJ8W_qTxcpXVWaX5bTedSzmSr8vqmGRvgaajiBROHipZdWeiBFcrFl2Ds5g6zW0mPCCcsCCy3NWoMWo6BQ2oTeqxGug/s320/sukimega10_wink.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That's the "you know what to do, bro" stance right there lol</table></div></div><div>P.S.

In this new episode where Cuff is learning English and can't go past "F" lol definitely not her cup size haha it's higher than that lmao (#ShinigamiBocchan21), well I'm glad we can still make jokes while still pursue the lore in this, and that's what keeps this going I suppose. Firstly, Daleth seems to be making the trip of apologies on Walter's behalf?? Haha heck, this second son (lmao) is taking care of everything it seems, and as much as Daleth likes to be the bad guy, she is going around apologizing to everyone what she has done and also revealed the truth behind her sister's actions to Bocchan and the others. Especially the reminder from the first season, where she told Zain who stole some book containing Sharon's notes? I forgot already to be honest, which will explain more of the lore behind what happened. What we do now know though, is some of the history of the household according to Rob as he explains to Alice, some time ago Bocchan's grandfather picked him up on the streets to work in the mansion (the one they are in, not the one with the rest), and he witnessed some guests different from the usual bunch as the elder makes connections as a noble family. It would seem like old Bocchan (lol) has dealt with practitioners of magic before, saying that feels scary already, and maybe in revenge Sade chose to put a curse on some of the people living in it, including his descendants and Sharon, who is still unable to wake up from her eternal slumber. Man, didn't know the lore is this deep, but seeing as what happened it kind of makes sense. Daleth is obviously trying to avoid this awkwardness again, even encouraging witches to be friends with humans well at least be friends with the human who can kill them by touching them lmao, as Teto even went to their place to fix Alice's small abode into something fancy, something that would otherwise never have been approved through autocratic procedures of the rich. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, maybe the fixing of the house is also rather appropriate for such an occasion, as it has also been 2 years (I'm sorry Walter) since Alice worked in this mansion, thank goodness, and all of the above happened so fast as Bocchan tries to reach for the truth, and no matter how far that might still be right now, they are getting close. And just as we get closer to Hugo's bunch of pickpocket "friends" and see them get owned by a couple of weird people, looks like we may have more things coming all of their way, and I don't mean just Zain and Cuff anymore. All in all... who are those guys, really?? Haha not talking about Hugo's old gang, but those... let's just say they are witches from another place, the place where Daleth doesn't rule. Hmm... hey, what did I say about progression in the story? Now that we really found footing compared to the start of the season, I hope they see this through. We are so close to the truth, but heck, maybe a couple more episodes won't hurt. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We shall see where this goes then, please no season three please no season three haha you can keep the jokes coming but remember to finish the story I beg of you</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWxNtpej4RJK-FNGn2CKtJF4UAaDrsxyQHA94IurVYPjA2osggTK0Kzlo-ILv17QPxxK3CQFnefHd_jSWCgtlSV9SzzJBXCaUE43QFFqdo-rVM2gj4pIVk2AfjiCTFMqtSftfHYR1x-cf7aqtUbHSBOBHz1MbF2ue6x2IwOBqlYHlyhe3PMOrz2Fnqchw/s320/shinigamibocchan21_bocchan2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Bocchan just confused at seeing rack lmao I thought you got Alice-</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_Ume9xtJxh2_XW6oV0kw1OTpzmemIQWnFAiO7xtfmBlYfp2G2Jt9X46chc2IgRKlNLH6nssNeO1Ab-WyT4zo0ZpRQNXPWEcUpE2FydmfLAmB1st_zqPygf21DSxDEzfQwtouR_L-Ug0XupzxKIB03eZp_WcbKjMC6CYsWAshQXnGBM3j8TMVB-oRcl7o/s320/shinigamibocchan21_viola2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Viola just sad I can't even<br><span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div></div><div>P.S.

Thanks.</div></blockquote>Uh Akutagawa? You can't kill Bram bro, if you kill him you will reverse everything actually. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where friends don't matter lol (#BungouStrayDogs59), as usual we have a lot more story to go through, so let's talk about what happened. Well, the Agency is screwed. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, they put Atsushi in the bed, what do you want me to do? Well, I guess I wanted Teruko to release him, but more than that, she knew to convince Atsushi to not do anything on his side after releasing him, unlike the many other members who have been taken hostage by Fukuchi and are in the same position as him just a while ago. Uh, we will not dabble on the truth just yet because honestly saying we have no idea what that is, and let's just say even if it's justice, Atsushi chose to leave so that he can do something about it, or well, at least try to talk to someone about it. Problem is, the fates of many of his comrades are pretty much sealed. I guess we don't need to talk about Kunikida and Tanizaki, Ranpo was taken out immediately by Fukuchi for he already knows beforehand this will be an issue and Ranpo will be better off just hiding himself into the book Poe gave him honestly, and Fukuzawa... let's just say he's done for. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Becuase even in the long flashback we were provided, we see that Fukuchi and Fukuzawa were meant to take different paths even though they have the same ambitions as kids to hone their sword. I mean, times change and the war did happen outside of Japan which was way more exciting and... uh, deadly? I don't know what Fukuchi saw in that, but even Fukuzawa wasn't right in thinking Fukuchi is doing all of this right now for revenge. At least I will deduce that all his buddy did is definitely in spite of Fukuzawa not being by his side after knowing him for so long. And the lack thereof which is likely bringing upon his own downfall, for Fukuzawa. But I think we can all agree Fukuzawa made the right choice, unlike Fukuchi. That's why he's the nice guy haha he can't be <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/2way-nice-guy/1638257258?i=1638257262" target=_blank>2way nice guy</a> but still, one way will do. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (Sorry for song title joke) Even in ending the war, Fukuzawa made the right(er) choice compared to that bloodbath of a killer who just cheats his way into taking over the world or something, even the United Nations leader is under his orders at this point, believing he can save the world. I mean, there will be no humans to save no more so yeah sir you might as well let him rule the world of vampires. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Easier to control, right? And we don't even need to resort to Communism- Moving on haha, the prison lore got even deeper (literally) where history repeats himself? And Dazai and Sigma found themselves in the exact situation he set up for Fyodor and Chuuya. Well, not really, just a reminder that the footage we saw last week was probably not real I don't know if Fyodor can even do that (choice of illusion, they did this with the cave music too some seasons ago), but apparently they escaped unscathed, don't know how that works. But yeah, considering every corner can be a vampire and we just need to have not Sigma to tell it off to our new god Fyodor (lmao), then I guess it shouldn't be very hard to fight against the actual brains of the Agency, isn't it? Heck, I really thought we are going to get Sigma as the new guy in the terrorist group, but oh well, we're all dead now, great. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, exciting development which kind of makes no sense at this point apparently since we don't know the truth just yet and it really feels like they are picking up the pace with Fukuchi's meeting with Fukuzawa, and Aya-chan is still in pieces hopefully just one piece and the rest is just hair that she can grow back lol we believe in cute girls living forever <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but yeah, considering we haven't even talked about that many people around the world that hopefully aren't vampire yet I sure hope Ango is still human and Natsume Souseki is still cat haha, we might still have a way out. Logic reasoning in this series? Not if this is the final episode haha see you then</div><div>[TL:DR; "I'm going to master the sword alongside you" Damn Fukuchi?

In this new episode where I'm glad this isn't going to be the last thing I watch this week (#KanoKari33), but for Sayuri here, the movie from Chizuru might be her last. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Alright, let's be serious for a bit now, and let's talk about why Chizuru till date still chose to be the liar that Sayuri also did all these years. To be real though, not that I don't think Sayuri's belief are right in that we live in the 99% lies because damn am I not a good enough liar, but also, that we would like to think that at least Sayuri did fall in love and have a husband, for Christ's sake, and Chizuru is still struggling to lie more than 99% of the time just so she can get people like Kazuya off her back. But see, even if it doesn't make your old lady sad, won't it make you sad? See, Chizuru. Just tell her the truth, but then actually do the deed. Then it won't be a lie, won't it? *taps brain* 200 IQ plays here might I recommend, but heck, she's not going to do it. Nonetheless, Kazuya dropped in with the sudden last-minute screening in the hospital room <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> and gave her the last wish just in case we are dealing with Chizuru grandfather's case where we won't even have time to watch it at all, still I don't think this is fair even to Sayuri, but you know, Chizuru has always been like this all the while, and will continue to not flail outside of her family and that means she will never from here on... I don't think this will be good for her mental health too but what do I know. Moving on, Kazuya and her grandmother did visit the wake some days later, and even then Kazuya was thinking of how to even approach Chizuru at this point. Seriously thinking for a bit though? If I'm Kazuya I might start asking my grandma about Chizuru. Hey, we can't take Mini-chan's advice so uh... maybe third-party opinions count? Gramps can't carry the secret long anyways- All in all... I really need to stop making jokes, this is above all a serious episode. I don't think I want to elaborate more since this is such a heavy episode in itself, but you get the idea. Chizuru is sad and alone without any family right now, she is putting on such a brave front only Mini-chan can see that is not the case but who is going to break it to her? Kazuya likely, of all people. So looks like, he will do this the way he knows best: by hiring has as a rental girlfriend again. Damn, well not like Chizuru needs compassionate leave, she isn't compassionate even to herself. So let's see next episode around to conclude this arc, if Kazuya can do anything, and I mean <em>anything</em>, to get her to spill it all out. Literally. Heck, at this point even I know it's bottling in her. I wonder what happened on the grandfather's death, if she has been this strong. Maybe not, she was still a student back then. Now though? It'll take some knocking on which will probably knock us some tears again I'm glad I'm only using my shirt so far lol note to self bring in the tissues next week, but yeah, for once I will cheer on for Kazuya. You got it, bro. It's all in now no one can stop you- Okay maybe Mini-chan but don't tell her about your plans, just never haha</div><div>[TL:DR; I would say, above all else, the conclusion to this end, is very adequate. Please, there are dramas that will show you the hand drop on the bed (which I was totally expecting) and that will probably make it worse. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Thanks, Anime, even if the lack of budget made that an excuse, or the author, thanks for not making this sadder, I won't be able to take it. I'm not that strong lol]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN0nz0szWX8Hp_uUUx9PFiwt-6HFHDptOcx6VlrnoHTqphyaUEuyjwVYHHPn41tYmgeHkoiDJPmPJ0n8t44d0mz7dVLjgMkTpINJEWwpoCSyMMwrwW2MNBTeTsV6OXpnYOFUEzw2Q8knyLWLS-n7irNz7m8ARb0SrA6C_2opUxZPA96nL-9YcsrwRdtAw/s320/kanokari33_kazuya9.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Basically me the whole episode</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimT049FnnpE-eB2plUzzQKwIWwjc7HgIUQe6xoMAPDkvaOqC24XLFT1cEt__m9S5A22UJqBih9dfJ2k_tFw6uXi2JP7SskoNCG2UKdnBVyapxT84-kiUmrZ7INgtxf_9o03nz2wpgs-TvjCntFiKeGmNsOGJ11DaZYfehTlcg2YuQGrNPVeUXb4rxhIac/s320/kanokari33_mini1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Basically me the whole episode<br>(Okay not this cute but)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I can't wrap the present unless I know what ribbon to use!" Man, I wished Mocho had that much care to me as Honoka did to Hori-san lol</div></blockquote>Hey asking everyone including myself, if you have the power to give chocolates (yes to all gentlemen, yours is in White Day but same same) to anyone without restrictions on budget or how thick your skin is lol, who would you give? Maybe I'll send one to each of the female voice actresses I know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We're talking about in school, by the way, so that doesn't count. In this new episode though where people are pondering about Valentine's Day gifts (#HorimiyaPiece11), I gotta say this is the one episode that might have covered the most grounds and heck, even introduced us to new characters even at this time?? Okay, Anime, you do you. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Of course, most of the focus is on Honoka here, where even just in wrapping she is worried about how it looked, unlike Hori-san who just wrapped hers in shrink-wrap. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, problem isn't about her or how Miyamura is going to give her a Love Day gift, apparently it's more on that classmate of Honoka's? Yeah, she wanted to give a gift to someone among the third-years which Honoka knows a lot of, but ironically, it's not any of those she mentioned that will likely be the target. Alright alright let me pause the video and take a guess... that joker, right? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> If I know how <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> this series' comedy works <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> it has gotta be <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright I may have laughed too much here. *pft* Yes, I am of course talking about Iura because how do you think this series gets its comedy relief? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You brave girl, giving chocolates to this slob. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, since Iura is desperate like I do every Valentine's Day in school (lol not true I just give up on all hope) unlike the others, you can give him anything, just as Honoka asked Iura about and gave him the middle finger. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, Honoka only likes Hori-san, bro, you have no chance. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Moving on haha, Hori-san is just so troubled about actually doing the logical thing on Love Day instead of making White Day happen first haha. Well, Miyamura owns a bakery he will whip up anything good anyways, so as Remi-chan said, it's kind of up to her if she wants to do something for her boi. So she tried, she asked Sakura about it so she only has one person to kill if this leaks out early (lmao), and Sakura told her about her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kurorekishi target=_blank>dark history</a> of learning to make desserts, starting with a book in the library they were in. The Hori family immediately rushed to see how the one Hori Kyouko is going to make chocolates in the kitchen considering how bad she is at cooking lol, but it turned out quite well. Apart from the roasting from Souta-kun which for once makes me want to roast this brat on a fire pit lmao, it doesn't seem too bad, not even when it was given to Sakura to try too. I mean, as Sakura-chan (hehe) said, this is probably good enough. Also, added bonus for Miyamura to talk about it too. If it's too good then what else is there to talk about? And then you can drama this out and make him mad just like you wanted, Hori-san. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See? It's not that bad. Well, it's not that bad at all, Miyamura ended up liking it actually, and thank goodness it's small so you can continue to serve your poison slower- And we don't talk about the rest of how Valentine's Day went. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Like, you want me to talk about how there were two boxes in Sakura's gift to Yoshikawa and her boi Ishikawa- OMFG I THOUGHT WE WILL NOT BE TALKING ABOUT SAKURA PROBLEMS THIS SEASON- Well thanks Anime, I hate you now. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> All in all... do you think Hori's chocolate tastes better or Yoshikawa's? Wrong answers only. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Whatever Honoka's classmate did not give to Iura probably tasted better. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But hey, all is in a day of life in Anime school, isn't it? I recall having a hard time not giving chocolates to someone I like, we've all been there. It's just a matter of whether you can give the gift indirectly haha yeah watch Honoka give it to Iura and make him think what he assumed was true lol f**k off dude haha</div><div>[TL:DR; "When I started making desserts, I borrowed this book a lot" NO SAKURA NOT FOR HIM lol]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYhthVwbTkT2FYY9wGipLDO1sO-Mw6kqxbEPTtW7t0hDDw72Ukmcd3MenGNUOAlg7t0Qerdbw2rXqcjCKcVlfGpzEfwlgVK5uNc-kCmiXDjyYWtZUbOIuFuFAj5nX45sE1ZoE-2YMi7nqoBXqzWif627koBhW-nQNtg9WlX2OoKLdir9yJORF0w1k7hjI/s320/horimiyapiece11_chef.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What girls want men to look like<br>(Haha with tattoos?)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiH3rwBhvJXkXdGFF2Gke998zWnZ3bEkEYvtnMWIMRNkfg9pa3jf0bPbwSxF7LGyU3jbDpCCjEfj5GsFL7M_Hf-Bto0SCxilH77sEp3Wa5AW2um_9Ei5guDXWHZBDZS5r25SDDXeUiYzI-iwAkXehvMpXQU9FVsbwd1wKRFYnmapdeCzhoUPkUshLqGzOU/s320/horimiyapiece11_boys3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>In case you <em>still</em> need help understanding how girls think, we can thank Honoka for that haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEguUtNmPZjutZuOpuq6aUXc1YI14IiHYoGntmv6vMhvIRLpZ_wUjRcx24zV_yfO0cDrHmnIKc04LSxqgJyUNWKmopYcxnS5ydOx5z7ehcF4WVVRTMNeLdqka5S_ySgm5SY-EKpzHAsPXqP-cxDC-tYdrL3g9uUs5LctIfSjjyQy8VhAINKz4Wff5UONnzs/s320/horimiyapiece11_iura5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Because boy, did Iura not understand women lol<br>(Also, lightest image in Anime history)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Understandable. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we found out Ishida doesn't like us no more (#BLEACHTYBW22), yeah we gotta do the 20-year-old plot thing by sitting here and thinking about how Ishida just sh*tfaced us, longer than any of their ages and this series too, ladies and gentlemen. And those flashbacks, dude. Too many of them is bad though, not good for airtime. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Let's talk about what happened in the battlefield instead, eh? More interesting than Inoue apparently. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Let's talk about Gizelle, and finally it's her time to shine. I know we still have Renji and Rukia and Byakuya but heck, since Urahara-sensei made mention of Mayuri we shall talk about his initial involvement in the war. Because for Gizelle, her powers are kinda gross, and not like I would rely Ikkaku and Yumichika to fight Bambi-chan but the latter is already smarter than what, Shinji? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, at least they have some fight in them if they used their brains. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also, hell yeah as a Kido user I shall celebrate the first Hado used in this arc, a rare sight not seen in years lol. Thanks Yumichika, I really needed that. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sniff*</span> Now that I got the fuel to talk about the rest haha, lucky for these two, their brains won't be used by Gizelle to power zombies since they aren't dead yet, but for Bambi-chan though, this might give them an issue. Cue Mayuri and his assistant Nemu dropping down like Buddha reincarnated lol (this is not true, Buddhist believers, your God isn't Mayuri FYI) (or maybe...?) (haha) and learning about the lore of Gizelle's powers, quickly devised a way to deal with Bambi-chan. Delays aren't anything special it's just a fuse according to him, but heck, it works and blew her into pieces, so that works. What didn't work though is Gizelle trying to power her back up, so I don't think Bambi-chan will get her reward that soon which I have NO idea what that is so <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm not exactly <strike>sadisfied</strike> satisfied by this scene either so we're good. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Married woman, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The husband will understand. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, it is still problematic to be outnumbered on Mayuri with shinigami soldiers now under Gizelle's control, but ironically, and I think we can talk more about this now that Yumichika and Ikkaku are still around, Mayuri has a solution to that, since we now know the secret that is hiding in Szayelaporro's lab. It's the fallen Espadas if you would recall they are elite(?) Arrancar who lost their posts (and to Szayel lol) that upon Szayel's loss to Mayuri, did end up finding them and giving them new life which is ironic to say compared to what Gizelle did with just <strike>her</strike> their blood lmao, but hey, real happy to even just see these guys back in action once in a while and hear Cullhorne fire their super long-winded named Cero. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Brings back memories, but not like we have too much time for that, because remember Hitsugaya who is half dead after stopping one of the Sternritters? HE IS BACK but as a zombie? Uh oh. You want to take your own life by betraying the Gotei? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, this has been great so far. We have made crazy progress as usual, and for me? I just like to see more variety. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You know, Mayuri, the Arrancar, and even Hitsugaya into the mix? Damn, this is going to be fun, it gets me excited not exactly aroused, per se. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> No, I'm not Gizelle, I'm not that homo. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on with the many jokes you might have missed and some they have cut down to fit into this adaptation, in case you don't know Mayuri is going to win this fight with Gigi and he will deal with another enemy which will be way worse than this.

MVP this week definitely will be <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A0%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%83%AC%E3%83%A9-ep/1697302628?l=en-US" target=_blank>Omoinotake's new album</a></b> because I feel like a deja vu to Suda Keina but with a different vocalist and slightly weirder songs as this band gives me more than I can handle, so I just ended up giving 2 more songs other than the one Anime opening theme song I was here for. </div></div><div><br>Okay I didn't change this I just copy links but if you noticed something different, I'm sorry. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But still, we can still talk about music news. <a href="https://twitter.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1699792140329783409?s=20" target=_blank><b>Hitsujibungaku's new music video</b></a> is kinda emo and kinda cool, it's for Anime which <a href="https://twitter.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1698695453364384234?s=20" target=_blank>their single will release end of the month</a> so I'll take a listen then. (I hear that <a href="https://twitter.com/cwondo_/status/1697595399492817109?s=20" target=_blank>Cwondo will be doing a remix</a> on the physical release which is nice; I'll likely listen to the digital release though) <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1698652133287944682?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</a></b> is for the B-side of their new single which I did not give so don't ask if the video is good. <a href="https://twitter.com/KroiOfficial/status/1698656257924862228?s=20" target=_blank><b>Kroi's new single is confirmed to be out end October</b></a> yes it's their first Anime tie-in and I might just watch the show just because, but don't quote me on that yet. And if you can't wait that long you can hear it in a month when the digital single is out. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1699074912831553811?s=20" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new song</a></b> is out for pre-listening already (lol) and as I've heard from the radio show I'm not going to be too hyped for this despite its hype melody, I'm just not into this Inorin I guess. <a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1700796260834594986?s=20" target=_blank>Her music video will be out upcoming Tuesday</a> though so be sure to at least see her sing this song. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/POLKA_fukuoka/status/1699364229621727454?s=20" target=_blank>Polkadot Stingray's new song will be out on digital</a></b> and music video too two weeks from now for Pokemon Anime series apparently, can't imagine what that would sound so here's hoping it's good. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1699408612920287732?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai did a studio live for their new single</a></b> this week if you missed it, it's always a good time to catch up on familiar tunes. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sambomaster_txt/status/1699346706918477825?s=20" target=_blank>Sambomaster's new song will be another credit</a></b> for the same drama in a new season, and looks like for their music video they are creating fan involvement whatever that means, and <a href="https://twitter.com/sambomaster_txt/status/1700438618958180540?s=20" target=_blank>from the likes of it of them singing in the studio</a> so far I think it's not bad. This might be a great start to their new album in November if you would recall. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuzzyknot_staff/status/1699754394432995480?s=20" target=_blank>fuzzy knot's new digital single will be out in two weeks</a></b> and I can't emphasize how much I've waited for this so <a href="https://twitter.com/fuzzyknot_staff/status/1700103668564205877?s=20" target=_blank>let's hope it's good</a>. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1700071486961094784?s=20" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new live video</a></b> is a song I've been brainwashed for months in her radio show but still not in my library so... you tell me if it's good. It is good though, I just have high requirements. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/pg_koushiki/status/1700071880399749485?s=20" target=_blank>Porno Graffitti is once again on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> and I should not need to intro you this YouTube channel (backed by Sony Music Japan btw) this time singing a song I know of, so that's a good start, don't mind the orchestra behind though. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1700086575911055422?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new music video will air the same day as their new single</a></b> next week specifically that night so if you like the songs be sure to check those out. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1700117297523044613?s=20" target=_blank>TrySail's live digest for their upcoming live Blu-Ray release</a></b> is as great as I thought it would be despite not knowing half the songs on the list haha someday I will know and love all their songs just like their fans do. I'm not a true fan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1700512297247297574?s=20" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new song preview</a></b> is uh, well it's written by Ooishi Masayoshi so at least we are not getting the dark themes she likes, so maybe we start with that. <a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1700502127603552604?s=20" target=_blank>Music video will be out end of the month</a> though, do take note. Last but not least haha this is the last I promise, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lounge666/status/1700782734267068872?s=20" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE's new album will feature a whopping 14 tracks</a></b> including the digital singles released this year alone, and maybe I'll take a good listen when it's out in two weeks. </div><div><br></div><div><div>So for next week, I think we have <b>Ikimonogakari's new single</b> which if all goes well from the previews I have heard some time ago this will likely join the others on the shelf with the recent batch, and <b>Aida Rikako's new mini-album</b> which is so freaking overdue, you won't even know which Anime this one popped out from. "Skip and Loafer", yes, the Anime last season's ending theme song. And if I get bored of the latter I might find some songs to listen to, who knows. Even just reviewing <a href=https://jisho.org/search/doujinshi target=_blank>doujin illustration books</a> has given me some songs to take a peek into somehow. </div></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div>Well, somehow I'm ending this week while watching the bunch of new Hololive members as if I'm not bored of them but yeah, not watching the streams though, totally relying on clippers as I have been since the start. Not particularly keen on any of them but Ichijou "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/31gmQvwCBdTBdhsFB1gHxu?si=ee5940155d08496e" target=_blank>bouncy bouncy lady</a>" <a href="https://twitter.com/mmnummn/status/1698606825946382830?s=20" target=_blank>Ririka is character designed by Nakamura-sensei</a> whose illustration book we totally did not miss in my Melonbooks review this week so uh... you can tell me which new girl won. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I guess I will continue to find out more by watching more clips to see if they are any different from the current bunch of jokers (lmao) and since they are a music-based group, maybe we will listen to their original songs in a couple of years time after what seems to be a trend in me picking up VTuber songs inconsistently. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys next time then, and maybe until then I will be spending more time preparing for more important blog posts I want done in due time, not forgetting that KN15YEARS is still a thing. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Wish me luck lol</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
