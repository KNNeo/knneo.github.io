      >"Alternative Girls" announced a commemorative livestream for their 7th
      anniversary</a
    >?? Like, <b>HOW??</b> <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, maybe the devs earned enough dosh
    from the "IDOLY PRIDE" mobile game to pay this back, so this may range from
    a revamped game introducing new characters and toning down on the borderline
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> stuff
    which will make me miss touching the girls on the home screen (lmao) to even
    replicating the latter's formula and maybe restart with
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn0dq4TNEkY" target="_blank"
      >an actual Anime series adaptation</a

    won't expect to see Futon-chan in that stream haha she is a Twitch b*tch now

    GREAT INTRO haha I feel like I say that every week and it's not because of
    the damn scenery they spent a lot of money on that technology though,
    everyone!! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Just like Mie-san we can't just let her go. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    In this new episode though where cuteness is based and jealousy is cringe
    haha (#SukiMega03), you think an Anime has a problem if they keep dumping
    all the good stuff on you? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> "<a
      href="https://jisho.org/search/esa"
      target="_blank"
      >Bait</a
    >", we call it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, about the "forgot her glasses" story.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From seeing a plastic bag on the ground as a cat *meow* haha, to
    just literally the most stereotypical of forgetting your glasses by wearing
    them on your forehead... I think this series still has a lot to joke about,
    and that isn't a bad thing considering we are at the pivotal episode to see
    if people will want to stay on this train of slice-of-life closeness of a
    girl who can't stop forgetting about her glasses. At this point, you should
    realize that she will forget like it's no one's business because it'll
    firstly make of a great joke, like how she picked up a letter on the ground
    but can't read it so she asks Komura to help her. They can only make
    anything about to happen ahead even less likely than you would think. Yeah,
    even the assumptions that were previously made will change drastically
    depending on how she doesn't have her glasses on. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> For example,
    just her thinking of someone helping her out on her desk must be Komura even
    though it's the
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> in
    class Azuma who of course like everyone else in class knows about the
    relationship between these two, can't help to oil the train and keep the
    engine running and probably making Komura overly anxious or confused
    depending on if you forgot your glasses or not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So that's good,
    good to know this will not be a drama-heavy driven environment or else it'll
    become toxic after a while. I mean, the only toxic thing right now must be
    the girl itself, isn't it? Always asking for... I don't know, something in
    return? Like, if you dropped your glasses you would just ask your boi to put
    it back on you? I mean, if you aren't lovers why would you do this? Or I
    guess when you're above 15 haha middle schoolers don't know nothing- Unless
    you're Komura, he knows everything he's Jesus and antimatter and the
    universe in between. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe it's because of that which makes him
    think too much though the result will likely be the same which I would say
    lucky you haha then again isn't him also employing the ikemen strategies?
    Like how he told Mie-san to walk over to him to avoid a cockroach so that
    someone else can shout it out so the girl will climb (literally) onto him??
    Haha I like a genius play of a middle schooler- Why didn't I do that back
    then? Oh, she's not afraid of bugs. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Wait till I show her MY- Code.
    My code. My messy JavaScript code on Notepad++ haha programming joke. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
    So wait, all we learnt this episode was that Komura was a liar. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    I'll forgive him because he's just a middle schooler, but damn next episode
    you better not lie about whatever glasses you are going to put on her
    adorable face and DON'T YOU DARE SAY ALL OF THEM haha we have a budget and
    she is no Sichuan face-changing performer lol great cultural reference (ie.
    she can't wear all of them at once), SO I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE READY ESPECIALLY
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/megane" target="_blank">MEGANE</a> STANS-
    Oh, that's just me. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I'm already in what are you talking about I
    did not forget my glasses I'm typing this out right now haha

    before reading this? Damn, you're lucky if you didn't because I thought it
    was not spoiler when they showed a video "oriented to female audience" and
    saw something out of Anime "WORKING!!!" and almost wanted to punch myself
    (yes, Inami-san) so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where anything can happen
    even changing out the sauce on the omelette haha (#ShinigamiBocchan14),
    looks like everything happened in our favour WE HAVE PLOT PROGRESSION!!
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Man, can I be less happy about that, please? I mean, for starters
    I think Alice's teasing has improved, so maybe I should be. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Learn a
    thing or two, Takagi-san. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, how can we not talk about
    the... main? Man, no one can even say this is the main with the rest going
    on so let's call this the SECOND main thing this episode. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> FUCKING
    GOT HIM haha we are talking about Walter, yes. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Don't ask me why he
    will agree to cross dress as a woman and think that's a way to convince
    anyone to make him be the heir haha I don't know his logic, but turns out
    <strike>he's kinda cute</strike> *ahem* (haha) he just can't speak as Viola
    brought him to the mansion to see Bocchan of all people and saying "she" is
    a fan, then played some golf in the corridor and I'm STILL surprised that
    female Walter did not touch the dude in any way- You are a fan, right? No
    physical contact? I mean, if I'm a fan of Alice I would just be dead- Moving
    on and MAY WE NEVER MENTION ABOUT THAT ANYMORE lol, let's talk about the
    main plot this week: How Zain is a genius at magic and why it matters. Turns
    out, according to his own monologue and Daleth's intel in her secret meeting
    with Bocchan lol she just created a time space just like how the Flame Haze
    did it lol me this is not the Guze (haha no one else is getting this "Shana"
    joke guys, <em>literally</em> no one), then threw Bocchan in and talked to him
    about persuading Zain to reveal more of his time magic in public. I mean, it
    was a secret as Zain told Cuff in the first place when he also demonstrated
    it as a kid and to him, but as much as he is powerful in that, not like this
    magic prevented the death of his parents who sent him out to the real world
    to avoid getting hunted for the same reason basically Daleth is trying to
    get him right now. So yeah, not good news, but this woman has a reward in
    place. She can find someone capable of getting rid of Bocchan's curse. Uh
    oh, human blackmailed successfully. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He did tell Alice about it
    before he gets CPR-ed by her though lol can she even do it, and that might
    be a problem moving forward. CLEARLY it's a trap that will get Zain into
    trouble repeating history on himself and he did want to be with Cuff for...
    many other reasons and this relationship is kinda mutual even among the
    circus people so well Cuff YOU WILL GET YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT haha I uh...
    learnt that from some English drama. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But seeing what has happened
    recently AND with the promise of removing the curse though? This is as
    vexing as it sounds awesome. But damn, never mind Zain, can whoever this not
    yellow octopus (lol I'm sorry not
    <a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/character/65643/Koro-sensei"
      target="_blank"
      >Koro-sensei</a
    >) even help Bocchan in any way? We have so far seen no one successfully try
    this at all- Maybe Zain can turn Bocchan back to before he was 5 and we're
    done? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, plot hole discovered haha we know it's not that
    simple, so let's see if the harder solution will pan out.
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; "I'll make (Bocchan) fall in love with me and tell Mom about it. And
    then I shall become the heir!" I don't think that's how that works Walter

    Hey, the human factor, amirite? For the fools who don't believe in Ranpo,
    and for Fyodor's methods of attack. Whenever that lacks, that's their
    weakness anyways. Fyodor will win in a century when robots rule the world
    though. For now, at least with this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs52) we
    should be good on letting the law enforcement deal with themselves until
    another higher authority had to interfere, which hopefully by then the
    Detective Agency will have more wiggle space to fix this mess. Hopefully
    man, because we just got started. <span class="emoji" title="😌">*phew*</span> Okay okay, where to start again?
    Haha I feel like this is a problem every week with this series' pace, huh,
    but good, means there will be no boring fillers. Well, we did start off
    rather slow and even light-hearted(?) with the talk about the UN creating an
    anti-terrorist organization which works without borders but we know that is
    not true check reality if you need help understanding why just humanitarian
    aid is already a pain in the butt in that level, actually are coming in to
    ask for help from the Hunting Dogs to form this very force to stop all this?
    This time around, we are talking about the leader of the Hunting Dogs
    Fukuchi. A long time friend of the Detective Agency's president so much so
    Ranpo believes in him understanding the situation and he can be on their
    side despite the chaos, a famous character enough that he has starred in
    multiple movies in his name somehow haha I gotta say though, maybe get the 3
    movies Fukuchi was starred in as spin-off films in cinemas? THEN I'll pay to
    watch those haha and then get the Agency members to voice the antagonists??
    Haha perfect, someone pay me to Hollywood. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Really, at the rate they
    are going today? Disney can pay me more. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But also coming back,
    Fukuchi is a bad, bad man. Like, gone through war bad man. Hey, watch enough
    modern day movies and video game plots and you'll know a bit about being in
    the army and war crimes, but heck, here too?? BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So turns out,
    remember that Hunting Dogs dude who is the perfect disguise of Port Mafia
    and Hunting Dogs? Well, he's not the best one out there, no surprises, and
    not like anyone of them need to be wary about it, but looks like the leader
    himself is on another level. The thing about Fukuchi though, if you
    understood what happened without Ranpo and his glasses, is that he is on
    everyone's side. Let's count who they are: Hunting Dogs haha that's rather
    obvious he is in the outfit already, Detective Agency lol he is a long time
    friend of the president despite Ranpo's doubts about his way of justice
    especially when we found out the truth haha wait we have a bit more, THE
    WORLD I guess haha he is technically more important than the Washington
    Monument lol they didn't even build that shit up until half a century later
    HAHA GOT 'EM, and thanks to Fyodor, the Angels. Yup, you heard that right;
    This old man is also Kamui in one of his disguises. Man, this is what
    happens when you have ALL the power. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, Fyodor has also
    successfully convinced the man of the world to be on his side, which also
    kind of complicates everything that has happened so far, really. Of course
    Ranpo-san isn't spending time convincing anyone including Fukuchi to help
    them; They already know it's on the page, they just need to know what is
    WRITTEN on the page. Think about it. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> And that's precisely the
    problem we are facing right now, that by the time Ranpo finds out the logic
    behind the page that someone familiar was involved, then his deductions
    would be too off and too late, now basically implicating Atsushi in this
    mess and hiding himself in Poe's book, he is letting his buddy fight alone
    with... I mean, I can put the church guy who is in Atsushi's childhood in
    front of him and Fukuchi still would be scarier than him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Uh... now
    what? It's like the "Attack on Titan" approach of last stand, right?
    Fighting till the end even if it takes you apart? Haha, Atsushi can't. Since
    we know he is too wimp to do this himself, looks like we have some help.
    Remember the double agent for the Hunting Dogs on Port Mafia? I think that
    guy has something to do with Akutagawa's appearance on the ship they were
    escaping on. This will be interesting to see what happens next week I might
    have wrote too much haha

    [Okay this is too much but I just wanna do some *brings up glasses*
    deduction lmao, on how to deal with Fukuchi/Kamui. If he can make any weapon
    way stronger than it is, what does it take to break it? Can I give him a
    branch like in Minecraft (lol) and he'll still chop me into pieces like in a
    video game mod? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moreover, if he doesn't have a weapon then he's
    done? Hmm... the latter I'm more keen on though, because then that'll be
    easy haha just throw them into a wrestling ring lmao]

      href="https://myanimelist.net/character/190326/Haya_Magari"
      target="_blank"
      >Haya-san</a
    >, no. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Coming back to this haha yes voiced by the same woman I
    would love to be with for the rest of my life not gonna lie, but yeah, let's
    talk about the proceedings about the movie now that we are getting Mini-chan
    on board. It should not be a surprise to anybody and I did mention last week
    that, because Mini-chan plays such a pivotal role in this story arc, she
    will be all in in helping Kazuya out any way she can, and for the final
    stretch of the crowdfunding goal... maybe getting a streamer to help would
    be nice. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But hey, before we employ that strategy which is the most
    capitalism of capitalism, let's talk about her experience in crowdfunding.
    Yeah, why not right, she is a cosplayer after all she does events which are
    seriously under budget and photo shoots of them cost money so why not get
    the funds from people in the Internet who want them? In reverse though, that
    also means she can help Kazuya out basically as someone who has been through
    this before, successful or not. And she did want to help her "<a
      href="https://jisho.org/search/shishou"
      target="_blank"
      >master</a
    >" out (lol that's weird you're right Ruka-chan) any way she can so I mean,
    if you really want to help I guess this is part of that progress, right?
    Just really, really far from the parallel haha. Still, her being a junior
    and not that interested in the guy and basically being a third party is why
    she can gather everyone together to deal with Ruka-chan's possessiveness of
    the boyfriend literally trying to do his job regardless of what connections
    that may be we will talk about that in a bit, and hopefully deal with
    Mami-chan when the time comes. What, you don't think she will make a dumb
    comment and ruin the whole project altogether? Don't second guess yet, me,
    we are not even close to the end. Moving on, and that's why Mini-chan here
    has to basically act as the wild side (GO AWAY MAMI-CHAN lol) of the story
    arc now, as she lists out all the damn things you would need to do to get
    the crowdfunding stuff going. And unless you are American band Murder By
    Death releasing their new album lol, you better come up with something
    better than just a thank-you message if you are a beautiful actress trying
    to make a movie by yourself. That also means all the personal stuff that can
    be (cleaned and) packaged used by Ichinose Chizuru herself (which very much
    Kazuya wants as treasure lol) and boy did Mini-chan try to go overboard as
    horny manager ravaging the *hot* attractive woman's abode for basically
    anything in her possession that she won't say no to. So yeah, no underwear
    though this is not a porn vid- MOVING ON haha yes they do that in those by
    the way, but yeah, not going too far, at least they can try to make this
    funding project a success, besides trying to get it to the site's frontpage
    and giving out flyers (with Sumi-chan!!) for publicity purposes. Mini-chan
    did also go further by making hints or even indirectly slapping Chizuru's
    face to tell her that someone loves her not because she's rental lol, and it
    seems to be working somehow. Not like a flashback in this long of a series
    will remind me where that came from lol, but Chizuru might be in her first
    time ever, getting the message. Yeah, all the lies Kazuya told you? Time was
    a factor for those lies to sound like reality, woman. *taps brain* Haha
    Chizuru is not going to confirm this neither is the dude but hey, it's all
    Mini-chan's fault amirite?? Just let it sink on her, I guess. She is already
    thinking about him in the shower HAHAHAHAHA see you next time

    [TL:DR; "Whenever I've had enough and fall down on my butt, I can feel her

    Oh okay these guys, welcome to the Hori household again, everyone. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    In this new episode where I most DEFINITELY DID NOT MISS HER DAD lol
    (#HorimiyaPiece04), this isn't an Anime about violence it's all flowers and
    laughs but if the dad wants to do something stupid I will beat him up on
    your behalf, Hori-san. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Says Miyamura lol yeah right his tattoos
    don't mean SHIT- So, exam time it seems. No, not exam time. I noticed the
    episode title. Is this literally an episode of nothing but just a
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kotatsu" target="_blank">kotatsu</a>??
    Slice-of-life Anime, everyone. Ah, some of the audience left. ANYWAYS haha,
    well at least for the first half and periodically throughout the episode
    this time around, we are surrounding most of the stories around the
    (Japanese) family favourite coffee table-like living room household item
    mainly not because we can get all the damn legs entangled together or
    nothing I want to entangle my legs with Tomatsu Haruka not gonna lie haha
    <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, but you know, apart from the thing itself, I guess the stories
    around them are more interesting even to the average person, so let's cover
    them real quick. So first, about Miyamura wanting to go to the bathroom.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, not gonna do that, numb legs and/or entangled ones I'm not
    interested even with one woman in the equation. ESPECIALLY with only one
    woman in the equation. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that's all I remember actually haha that
    one dragged on real good, but also, we get to learn a little about
    Hori-san's childhood and her family's relationship with the Sengoku family.
    Okay, more like Sengoku family's relationship with the Hori menace of a
    household. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Introducing Sengoku's dad we just met him on the
    streets, suddenly just got dragged into the Hori abode sometimes with or
    without his son haha the one we know and not love but whatever, turns out
    are somewhat in an unpleasant relationship with these guys boldly trying to
    ruin their lives with whatever perspective they deemed pleasing. From
    Sengoku's dad and his high school graduation speech (also as student council
    president I assume) ruined by a sneeze from Hori's dad, to the daughter just
    changing out her clothes (nice) in front of Sengoku in school basically
    inside the student council room... it looks like we have more than
    similarities between these parties, whether the Sengokus like them or not.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Wow that was quite a summary lol, but we did get more out of the
    main bunch of people seeing photos of Sengoku and Hori's childhood which
    damn Miyamura is loving elementary school Hori-san lmao, and how we know
    Sengoku is dating Remi-chan (lol INSECTS) and no one in his family knows
    about it considering the dad is so against it either way, it's more of a
    compromise in their household more like it's also an opportunity to get back
    at them depending on which Hori-san we are talking about, though we are all
    targeting on the same Sengoku. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, if you didn't fancy the
    childhood stories and got a laugh, I'm pretty sure you liked the flirting
    between the main couple, you'll wonder where Miyamura learnt all his love
    and tactics from, really. I... I'm just here for the ride, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

    Please, Byakuya's barely alive now; We&nbsp;can't even see hope anymore, you
    want to see sakura petals?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where all hope is
    lost once again (#BLEACHTYBW16), maybe we check in on all of them who are
    still having a pulse, yes? So not Matsumoto lol RIP dude haha who dies in
    this series anyways, really. But first, let's talk about what Urahara Kisuke
    has up his sleeve to resolve this lack of balance in battle so far. If you
    would recall, there are these Bankai medallions from the Quincy army which
    were designed to steal the shinigami's highest manifestation of power which
    is basically their weapons, and ideally killing them with it if possible.
    Thankfully, the solution was easy to find, as unlike the relationship
    between shinigami and the Quincy which was man-made thanks to a war a couple
    centuries ago, the relationship between Quincy and Hollows are organic and
    very locked in nature, which will explain how they can never just purify
    them, and how that will become their own poison if they come to contact with
    it. Thus, the Hollowfication pill for Bankai is created. This quickly
    brought back the powers of Soifon and Hitsugaya who are active in the field
    just waiting to die to be honest, but thanks to this, we get to see once
    again Jakuhou Raikouben in FULL HD!??? GLORIOUS DAY IN THE DAY OF ANIMATION-
    DAIGUREN HYORINMARU TOO?? Okay dude the Karakura Town Arc is the same why
    now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (It just looks better HAHA is it though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) So yeah,
    wonderful to see those once again though I would say they aren't exactly in
    a state to fight any further, so we shall see about that. We also got to
    witness everyone fighting so far, from Shinji's Bankai which isn't canon
    material unless you reach out to the official spin-off novel series not
    written by Kubo-sensei but concepted by him, and since Shinji's sword can
    only be used where no allies are around, I wouldn't be surprised this is the
    only way we can see it work normally. Otherwise, you would be glad to see it
    being used to confuse the heck out of Bambietta on the field trying to find
    her missing friends lol, who is herself trying to fight the doggo she took
    the Bankai from, but ended up having to play catch with Shinji so much so
    she got pissed and blew herself up- Well that's her power by the way, she is
    called "<a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/character/117225/Megumin"
      target="_blank"
      >the explosion</a
    >" too. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (Yes, I'll make that reference until I'm blown into
    pieces) Apart from witnessing the most tame of anger in this series so far
    haha Ayachi I don't know what to say but you just sound cute, we also got to
    see some fighting with the usual vice captain gang against The Superstar and
    his little buddy James which basically speaking is there to hype him up so
    he can beat the cr*p out of Yumichika lol poor dude, and not like we are
    getting Ikkaku to reveal his Bankai anytime soon but hey Hisagi maybe you
    should use yours...? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah no way, not in this case I don't think
    unless we have enough time to play around. Speaking of, looks like the
    Sternritters have had enough of that so they are releasing their ultimate
    move too, if you would recall from that prison guy I hate his name lol, the
    <strike>Vol</strike> <strike>Voru</strike>
    <strike>Vollag</strike>&nbsp;Vhatever haha (get it? because German), because
    the Bankai medallions were what stopped them from fighting at full force in
    the first place. I mean, valid strategy, no point to use your own powers if
    you can kill using the powers of your opponent, but now that they have taken
    it back (<a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/take-it-back/1463352224?i=1463352234&amp;l=en-US"
      target="_blank"
      >"take it back, take it back"</a
    >
    lol), it seems like we finally have capacity to fight all guns loaded. Which
    isn't good news for the shinigami because our dad Yhwach is making a grin
    between his teeth so uh... YIKES?? Haha we will talk about some of the
    Sternritter powers real soon I would hope. But looks like Komamura Sajin is
    up for the run next week! Yeah let's get the boring stuff out of the way
    AMIRITE FELLAS lol we will talk about his family line and how some of us
    became furries because of this Anime next time.

    [TL:DR; Seriously, who is the smart aleck that asked for Shinji to be cool
    in front of Bambietta with that sweet soundtrack?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

    This week will be the busiest week in Klassic Note this month, and I'm glad
    I have the time to sit down at home to listen to it while working, knowing
    full well that it'll be hard to give anything because I still have a
    splitting headache back then. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm good now, so let's see what I
    have given based on first impression.
    <b

    is not disappointing to say the least, but seeing that the mood of the
    release is already heavily attributed to the topic song I felt like I can
    only give more lively summer-like songs so the emotional ones are not in my
    league now. Though
    <b

      ></b
    >
    did get me on the emotional song which is just a hitch on putting me with
    the "sailing" theme lyrics we all know and love all this time which is fine
    it's also a euphemism for their somewhat smooth sailing journey so far, but
    I did give other new songs in the release though. Just, not the topic song.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And of course

    wins even if I didn't give half the album because I'm an instrumental band
    simp and it's also easier to give the melodies anyways this is basically
    SPECIAL OTHERS if I wanted them to stay as great as they are. Going from the
    previews of the new songs released every month so far? Damn do they not need
    too much creative juices for the wrong reason. There will be competition in
    the music market this year in Klassic Note, I'll tell you that much.

    isn't as interesting as the last time I saw her but it's still fine I am not

    is finally out and if you can recall it's the one where they asked fans to
    submit videos of baseball and it's them doing it too. The song? Eh, it's
    better than the last time we heard of them, so I might just give the
    mini-album a listen when it's out in a month.

    in view of her new album releasing next week so if you are that impatient to
    wait a couple of days help yourself. And we don't talk about bilibili music
    event in China. I seriously don't care. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

    For next week, as I said I won't go through Sambomaster's long list of Rock
    n' Roll songs so I'll skip that and instead give the other a chance
    including

    for Anime "Horimiya" which I hope this will be the black horse and all I do
    now is listen to female artists. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, Sambomaster will not balance
    that out we have done that by listening to like, OGRE YOU ASSHOLE last week
    already we will be fine haha<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Okay that was damn rushed sorry for the late post for the week. I forgot my
    mom had the celestial ability of ruining my evening with just one foot
    massage session. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Since that's the case, I'll keep it short lest
    more Twitter news appears as the clock strikes 12 in Japan haha please don't
    we'll leave those out for next week anyways. See you guys next time then,
    and boy I think I still have a lot to talk about including the new package
    which dropped by this week and the new package which has nothing to pad so I
    might just visit the MusicRay'n store once 3rd time coming for the year.
    <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Maybe I should not do that lol until next time everyone just look
    at the
