  Wow, this blog is getting busy this weekend huh, thanks to that dream I had
  last night. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div>
  <br />Nothing to do with the one we will be talking about next though, damn
  this is such a last minute decision too, but I think I have an idea of what I
  would do to this... woman haha let's not spoil this too much yet, but hey, one
  can fantasize this much, yes? I mean, you will get the idea- Don't say I'm a
  simp I follow so many female voice actresses in Japan we can't talk about just
  ONE of them haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

  Maybe we start soon, yes? I can only get high about someone wet for this long-
  It's summer, people. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

      >In front of my front porch under its roof stood what looked like Hanazawa
      Kana, drenched from her hair down to her torso. She decided to ask around
      for directions to a certain bungalow in this hilly area, but did not
      manage to escape the sudden rainfall upon her despite seeking the nearest
      shelter. I told her it can be confusing up these parts, felt bad for her
      so I let her in to dry up lest she catch a cold.</i

        who she was. She looked back at me and we stared at each other for a
        couple of seconds. She asked if there was anything wrong with her, I
        said no and looked away in embarrassment. She contacted the owner of the
        lodge she intended to visit and left soon after.</i

  Yeah putting in Kana-chan... was a choice. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I thought of what I can
  do to her in a situation (lol) and I saw this image and wondered if I can make
  myself not even know of her in the first place. Well, in person of course, who
  doesn't know Kana-chan if you watched Anime. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, real awkward
  way to write this because the scope of this is rather vague assuming how large
  my abode is in this story lmao I will need more lifetimes to earn this much at
  my rate, but I think it made sense for me to exhibit my kindness to a passing
  idol. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I REALLY am trying not to write anything
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> that can
  make this more wrong than I think because seriously, who talks about idols in
  revealing clothing? *looks at Isobe Karin photobook cover* Okay maybe not with
  this married woman- AND getting wet?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
