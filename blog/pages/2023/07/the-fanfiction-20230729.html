<div>Wow, this blog is getting busy this weekend huh, thanks to that dream I had last night. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br>Nothing to do with the one we will be talking about next though, damn this is such a last minute decision too, but I think I have an idea of what I would do to this... woman haha let's not spoil this too much yet, but hey, one can fantasize this much, yes? I mean, you will get the idea- Don't say I'm a simp I follow so many female voice actresses in Japan we can't talk about just ONE of them haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Maybe we start soon, yes? I can only get high about someone wet for this long- It's summer, people. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Hanazawa Kana with a towel above her head" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=359 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl109941.jpg title="Hanazawa Kana" width=140></div><em></em><blockquote><i>It was a sunny afternoon where all of a sudden, the sky went dark and it created a huge downpour. After a couple of minutes it did stop, but what greeted me by my doorstep was more amusing than the change in weather.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>In front of my front porch under its roof stood what looked like Hanazawa Kana, drenched from her hair down to her torso. She decided to ask around for directions to a certain bungalow in this hilly area, but did not manage to escape the sudden rainfall upon her despite seeking the nearest shelter. I told her it can be confusing up these parts, felt bad for her so I let her in to dry up lest she catch a cold.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>I passed her a clean towel to wipe her hair, and only then did I notice who she was. She looked back at me and we stared at each other for a couple of seconds. She asked if there was anything wrong with her, I said no and looked away in embarrassment. She contacted the owner of the lodge she intended to visit and left soon after.</i></div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Yeah putting in Kana-chan... was a choice. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I thought of what I can do to her in a situation (lol) and I saw this image and wondered if I can make myself not even know of her in the first place. Well, in person of course, who doesn't know Kana-chan if you watched Anime. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, real awkward way to write this because the scope of this is rather vague assuming how large my abode is in this story lmao I will need more lifetimes to earn this much at my rate, but I think it made sense for me to exhibit my kindness to a passing idol. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I REALLY am trying not to write anything <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> that can make this more wrong than I think because seriously, who talks about idols in revealing clothing? *looks at Isobe Karin photobook cover* Okay maybe not with this married woman- AND getting wet?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
