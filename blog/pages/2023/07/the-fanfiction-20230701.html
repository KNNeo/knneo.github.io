  Well, happy 4th anniversary, this blog. And to celebrate, I shall start with a
  new segment since I have not done these in a while, and also probably to
  replace the dreams that I have because I keep forgetting them like an old man
  and instead of dreaming at night why not dream during the day? <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  <br />To start us off, and I promise she is not the motivation for this hehe
  <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜‰">*wink*</span>, we have Takahashi Rie-san!! Haha what is with this formality image

      It was my first day of work in Japan, and I did not realize how many of
      them can't speak good English. Seeing as I felt awkward as a newbie,
      Takahashi-san called to me to ask me to join them for lunch with everyone
      else. We went to a restaurant nearby the office, and everyone was in their
      groups. Everyone was taking their orders and some of them are handing out
      plates and utensils. The ladies were talking about what they did in the
      weekend, while the guys were mad about the baseball match the day before.
      I sat down at the end of the table awkward and alone, preparing to take my
      phone out to kill the time. It was then, she handed out an empty plate to
      me. Our eyes met for a second. For whatever reason, her sincerity to me
      was much different as she was to others, I wonder why.

  This shall be it, maybe next time there will not be an outro to explain what
  happened. Still cannot imagine
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/OL" target="_blank">OL</a> Rieri though, she
  did put herself in this situation in the recent Seigura magazine. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>
  Also, I've never worked in Japan so I don't think it will be anything like
  this. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span> Bear in mind this will not be just about me simping on voice
  actresses (although it might as well be haha <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜Ž">*dabs*</span>), because maybe I'll talk
  about me in Anime worlds next time. Yeah, not
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a>. <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ˜†">*laughs*</span>
  DATING RIERI IS REAL see you next time then
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. The idea of this series will be to write of stories of fiction to
  complement (not replace) my life as a Japanese aka Aozaki Shouhei, in
  imaginary situations. Meaning I won't do stuff that isn't represented in
  images before so no sex (haha), or change myself into an
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a>&nbsp;just
  to get all the chicks or something. You will get it when the time comes I can
  imagine it anyways <span class="emoji" title="ðŸ¤­">*giggles*</span>

<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Okay dude you need to take less time to do this up we are an hour in
  already lmao
