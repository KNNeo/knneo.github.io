<div>Well, happy 4th anniversary, this blog. And to celebrate, I shall start with a new segment since I have not done these in a while, and also probably to replace the dreams that I have because I keep forgetting them like an old man and instead of dreaming at night why not dream during the day? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br>To start us off, and I promise she is not the motivation for this hehe <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span>, we have Takahashi Rie-san!! Haha what is with this formality image sponsored by <a href=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/ target=_blank>Suruga-ya</a> by the way and yes I ordered myself another batch again lol we need to start</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Takahashi Rie in a office lady outfit, handing out an empty plate" title="Takahashi Rie" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=357 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl940091.jpg width=139></div><div><i><blockquote>It was my first day of work in Japan, and coming back from overseas, I did not realize how many of them can't speak good English. Seeing as I felt awkward as a newbie, Takahashi-san called to me to ask me to join them for lunch with everyone else. We went to a restaurant nearby the office, and everyone started sitting in their groups. Some were taking their orders and others are handing out plates and utensils. The ladies were talking about what they did in the weekend, while the guys were mad about the baseball match the day before. I sat down at the end of the table awkward and alone, preparing to take my smartphone out to kill the time. It was then, Takahashi-san handed out an empty plate to me. Our eyes met for a second. For whatever reason, her sincerity and affection to me was much different as she was to others as she engages me in conversation, I wonder why.</blockquote></i></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This shall be it, maybe next time there will not be an outro to explain what happened. Still cannot imagine <a href=https://jisho.org/search/OL target=_blank>OL</a> Rieri though, she did put herself in this situation in the recent Seigura magazine. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> Also, I've never worked in Japan so I don't think it will be anything like this. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Bear in mind this will not be just about me simping on voice actresses (although it might as well be haha <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜Ž>*dabs*</span>), because maybe I'll talk about me in Anime worlds next time. Yeah, not <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>isekai</a>. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> DATING RIERI IS REAL see you next time then</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. The idea of this series will be to write of stories of fiction to complement (not replace) my life as a Japanese aka Aozaki Shouhei, in imaginary situations. Meaning I won't do stuff that isn't represented in images before so no sex (haha), or change myself into an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a>Â just to get all the chicks or something. You will get it when the time comes I can imagine it anyways <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Okay dude you need to take less time to do this up we are an hour in already lmao</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
