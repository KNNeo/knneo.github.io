Well, might as well do this early and not be lazy about it because even without
all the damn sequels I'm already watching (up to) FIVE, no, SIX shows this week
already. <span class="emoji" title="😌">*phew*</span> Thank goodness one is ending this week haha and then I will just
not give the other new romance shows because "KimiSomu" will live up to ALL the
hype and Nakami will not disappoint me- I'm already not in the mood to watch
those new ones I want to watch lol well my bro watched the one with the glasses
girl and I just got myself a pair of new ones with the larger lens size like
those in Anime and I think I can understand why she always forgets them
<span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> <em>It's on purpose</em>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Other than that, hope you have read my... fantasies on the not real world on
  yesterday's post, and yes idiot me actually had lore prepared to talk about
  for the rest of the month for this new series so let's see if can keep up the
  momentum or I screw up the logic. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> will
  always be imouto I won't screw that up. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For next month's posts
  though, I gotta think ahead on what to put. Summer themed, maybe? Maybe I get
  Lynn-san's chest in here-
</div>

<div>
  Anime and music!! Manga was just for funsies last week so don't think too deep
  into it I won't mention too much of them unless there is like, major
  development haha that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>
  making
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ramen" target="_blank">ramen</a> won't have
  much progress until that dude gets all 20 stamps so see you then lmao no no

  And the mom throws in the surprise and arrived early to pick her up and it's
  game over? Haha you wouldn't. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this final episode of a wonderful
  series I did not regret watching though (#KimiSomu13), you know it Nakami, you
  know what you are doing, and we know too. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, they packed up in
  the day and set off to their final destination - the Mawaki Site - to take
  their final photos which they hope&nbsp;will clinch the prize for the
  Astronomy Club. There, I think it's better if you experience it yourself. It's
  no sad news, everything went well, they took the photos, but more importantly,
  it's their confession to each other. I mean, not like Isaki gave a reply haha
  what a chad, but hey, does that kiss from last time not count? I count that as
  a debt to pay, and that of course, is what Nakami set out to do, above all
  else, to make sure his girl gets the message. So before he carried on with the
  photography, somehow at the right time where the stars are full, he set out to
  declare his love for Isaki. Aw... Anyways, experience it yourself I don't know
  how to explain such stuff without thinking that they might as well bang lmao
  but they didn't, also it's rather subtle unless you count Isaki's reaction
  haha. I'm just somehow disappointed that it was not an actual confession, that
  "go out with me" line did not surface. Otherwise, you would be glad to know
  that everything went as planned: Nakami took the perfect picture, the photo
  won the national photography contest, Isaki was grounded... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah that
  last part was rough according to her friends talking about her ever since that
  day haha I was not wrong in thinking that the parents will go far up to get
  them though in the middle of the night lol legit spoiling the mood haha I hope
  they weren't sleeping with each other then LMAO, but yeah, it went as well as
  you would think. Now, let's talk about why even so this might still be
  unsatisfactory for an ending. First of all, the confession. BRUH. NO REPLY??
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well maybe we got used to hearing them too much (or not because
  rejections are a thing too lol) that maybe we aren't used to such a feel, but
  trust me, it would have been much better if that happened. If Isaki said yes,
  everything else would be different. But hey, what do I know they were holding
  hands already dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Next up, I felt like the theme songs had the
  reverse effect compared to whatever
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37171/Asobi_Asobase" target="_blank"
    >"Asobi Asobase"</a
  >
  served up haha because the songs here are emo but the show is basically lively
  and depression-less Isaki-chan haha I'm just... not... sad <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, did still
  serve up the right drama without you know, other grown-ups ruining everything
  for us to be honest. Hey, not every story has that terrible dad or mom, you
  know. At least this couple got together, or not, who knows. What I do know
  though is that yeah, despite some flaws and Shiromaru-senpai turning out tops
  as best character in this series lmao, this is still likely the best series
  I've watched this year. It's chill, there's too many real life location
  references lol not the point, the characters are interesting, and most
  importantly, the love is real. Well, does it count without an actual reply to
  the confession though? Haha dammit Magari Isaki why are you ruining this for
  us lol it's fine no one will die here I legit thought this will be a

  Just a reminder that the title is basically very straightforwardly summarizing
  what is going to happen in this series, so don't mind them I also had a crush
  on a girl but she never forgets her glasses- She wore contacts in middle
  school. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new series I might just pick up despite watching a
  boatload of sequels (#SukiMega01), I think we have good reason to watch this
  no matter how bad this goes, so let's talk about what they are. For starters,
  this dude, this guy... he is, I should say, VERY TOKED UP on this girl in
  class. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I guess that's what infatuation means, right? Then again, back
  then when yours truly had such a trouble lol, I think I let my heart do its
  job so I can make my usual straight, depressed face? Should've shown it all in
  my face, actually. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean, even just finding her textbook I can
  already point to my bag so she doesn't have to find it herself but <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> yeah
  I guess we shouldn't be too aggressive in this aspect, huh. They are only
  middle schoolers. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also, the guy already freaking out even just
  pointing somewhere on not her so why not just let the girl come to you
  instead?? Tell me this is not a porno. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course, the selling point
  in this series, if you haven't noticed apart from the dude Komura getting
  hyped up on his own drug, the girl Mie-san just supposedly forgot to bring her
  glasses to school. Like, I wonder how she hasn't been hit by a car at least
  once coming into school let alone go home, and I guess bring close to school
  means you don't see any roads with cars so that's understandable, but still.
  They even demonstrated the issue when Mie-san had to find back her shoes on
  the rack (in Japan no shoes are allowed indoors so they take them off and put
  them in racks) and accidentally took of course, the guy's shoes and even
  wearing them thinking they are too big... I mean, this Anime knows how to make
  the jokes itself I just laugh at this point. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Coming back haha this
  isn't the point by the way, that Mie-san just forgot which closet she placed
  her shoes on? Well, I assume someone helped her earlier in the day like her
  friend told her where to put her shoes probably not the frog though lol, but
  as you can imagine this series is very focused on Komura's degenerate
  reactions (lol) to his idol (haha) in school and we are not even close. The
  story is on point maybe slower in pace but we will talk about why later, and
  they can make as many plot twists on the jokes as they can, for example
  sleeping in class and telling the teacher she is reading on the textbook lol
  how high is her degrees again? Haha to like, how she went up close to Komura
  despite wearing contacts... this series managed to get me every corner of each
  turn and honestly I'm impressed. That hair animation quality though... I hope
  it's just me but maybe turn down just a liiiittle but on the quality scale.
  Yeah, turn off the ray tracing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Heck, even the overall animation
  quality is disturbing; The frame rates between background and foreground being
  here and there, the drawing on the angles of the buildings and such with the
  moving camera... is it just me?? Static scenes would have been fine, really.
  Maybe seeing that hair should've hinted you long time before anyone watched
  this but damn, is it really getting in the way. Her long hair, that is.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, the animation of 2D characters drawn along with super vivid
  3D backgrounds is really making me rage haha I mean just look at the shoe on
  the ground of
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/getabako" target="_blank">shoe racks</a>,
  but seriously just like Komura's love for Mie-san, what is stopping me from
  picking up this series which might have its flaws so blatantly in front of my
  eyes I don't need my new glasses to see them? Hmm... I'll give the
  three-episode rule and see if I can forgive the animation by then. My guess? I
  didn't experience what Komura did in middle school so I'll live it in the
  world of Anime. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you then- THEY GOING ON A DATE NEXT WEEK!?? Okay
  you got me haha see what I meant about the turns
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "Well, I guess this can happen sometimes." This series in a nutshell
  lmao "I hope Mie-san forgets her glasses again" Also this series in a nutshell
  haha gotta say though if you live close to school then why not go back and get
  it? *taps brain*]

  Can you believe I am now watching the SECOND new Anime series about some guy
  having a crush on a girl? Touch some grass, me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey probably also to
  main guy Sajou as in this series of romance slightly different from the usual
  (#YumemiruDanshi01), we have a persistent dude who keeps declaring his love
  for the girl he likes in school enough for the whole school to know. Yeah, I
  have a feeling I had this power too but only in class level so how does he...?
  Anyways haha, I'll keep this write-up short because damn is this series trying
  to not get me just like how Sajou is not trying to chase Natsukawa (not

  but) Aika because somehow, and I don't think it's because of a soccer ball
  which did not hit his head lmao, he stopped doing what he has been doing all
  school year, being a creep to the girl. That's the premise I was sold on when
  I saw the trailer and thought I should give this a chance, but going into it I
  realized what a trap (haha) I might have gotten myself into. The range of
  characters are there to emphasize what Sajou should be doing but ended up not
  doing which is be creepy about why he isn't sharing his crush's bento but
  going to the cafeteria to buy something alone lol is that weird? Anyhow,
  everyone else thinks it is even the teacher apparently haha remember the whole
  school knew, and of course apart from people around him being concerned about
  his... problem? Including Aika's friend and someone from another class Aikawa
  who is just here because she dumped her boyfriend so he can try to get his
  hands on what otherwise Sajou can't? Yeah it's too complicated and lengthy to
  explain just like this title so just don't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, at least from the
  start we get to understand what Sajou is up to with his own self realization,
  is that he rather idolize the one he had a crush on than you know, date her or
  make out with her on a corner or something- Is that what normal couples do? I
  don't know I'm a virgin. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> All in all... I don't think I'm giving this
  the get-go. Yeah, also so I don't have to give Ishihara Kaori again aka
  Kyari-san the opening theme song, actually. Listened to the music video last
  night and still wasn't that pleased anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just like how Sajou-kun
  here lost interest in making Aika-san his love, I think I will also not be too
  interested in this series after all. Besides, I can't bear to see myself deal
  with 12 episodes of whatever this not rejection of a comeback of a love story
  this might end up becoming despite having a somewhat interesting premise.
  Maybe give me a compelling main girl reply in Episode 1 (like "f**k me in the
  rear or something" lmao) and I'll reconsider. With this many sequels I have to
  watch though, I think I'll pass on this one.

  [TL:DR; "I feel like somewhere in my heart, there's a me who cooled off from
  being rejected too much." There you go, save you some time figuring this (and
  me) out]

Please, Sakura, we know who's the teacher behind the idea that all girls HAVE to
do cheerleading even if they suck. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I guess I
do have more to talk about in this new season (#HorimiyaPiece02), heck am I
still enjoying it while this lasts. Man, maybe this is how I got into this in
the first place, isn't it? So yeah, about the sports festival. Miyamura and
Sengoku can only get sadder because see the last time in the pool day haha, but
looks like Sakura-chan is in this week and joining the guys in praying that rain
will fall on the day itself because why not, the latter also did not want to do
mandatory cheerleading anyways, understandable. Well, not like we should do it
anyways did you even see what outfits they got for the girls? Even Miyamura is
disappointed in them, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Before we talk about sports though, I gotta
shout out to whatever mess Sengoku and Remi did in cooking lessons because apart
from them being perfect for each other already considering that neither can
cook... or know about cooking lol radish for curry rice haha, Sakura is also
really overbearing with their... I gotta say they are messing with her alright
though not intentionally I would argue, still managed to screw things up even if
it's heating up the curry that the class made for them and cooking rice which
damn, I wish I can confidently say how to do the latter but <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> haha please
don't associate me with them but you might as well. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, we have

type of level haha shout out to the longest running joke in this blog, and I
mean, we know Hori-san is always worried about guys getting near her boi so it's
no wonder she was mad when Miyamura <em>just</em> had to borrow someone his
textbook. I mean, you cannot just give Hori's textbook to her and then share
yours with your girl? Haha too complicated, huh. The teacher will understand.
<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But what's more interesting though, is when the guy also did somewhat
the same thing, as with the senpai giving Hori-san something to cover her legs
<span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> when she was alone painting signs out in the open. I meant her
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/namaashi" target="_blank">bare legs</a>
AMIRITE FELLAS- I better move on lest Miyamura kills me with his tattoos lol, he
is smart enough to know that she <strike>doesn't deserve others</strike> could
use something warmer so he took <strike>his top off</strike> his coat off
(ladies, relax) and wore the blazer that was given by the senpai instead lol. Oh
that guy noticed it though, totally. I also noticed beyond my superior knowledge
that Sakura-chan might be a klutz when doing cheerleading, but seeing her
practice on her own and even with Yoshikawa is making me heartache in many ways
you can imagine haha, but we don't know for sure yet since this was before
whatever happened that made me sadder than turning 30. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> All in all...
Tomacchan you can't keep getting me with voice acting in Anime this is 2023
already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I still really liked the characters in this series I guess-
NOT YOU SHUU-KUN haha, and despite their weakness and differences, it's still a
joy to see the jokes land on them, sometimes outside of the painted area. It's
okay, we can patch those up just like how we can make a cooking lesson possible
by faking it. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay I should keep my mouth shut it's all in a day of
school, yes? Why haven't I experienced such joy like this haha maybe it's just
different<br />

      Oh yeah, showing Chizuru's grandmother a film starring her, because she
      may not be able to wait that long. That'll get you laid Kazuya, I can see
      that much further ahead. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Serious talk aside we are just catching
      up on the actual lore, in this new season where we picked up from there
      (#KanoKari25), Kazuya also picked up on Chizuru I suppose- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      We are called "producer" now? You sure this isn't an
      <strike>Idolmaster</strike>&nbsp;iDOLM@STER ripoff? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay okay,
      let's talk about what happened first. We only scratched the surface of a
      crowdfunding project meant for Chizuru to raise funds to make a movie to
      let the grandmother see, but... what else? Is probably the first question
      the producer Kazuya talked to at the beginning of this season is hinting
      on, as he noticed whatever Kazuya did so far is telling him the chances of
      getting it funded is lower than my chances at getting SSR in
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gacha" target="_blank">gacha</a> which I
      did so screw you dude lol, probably is bummed out on how to deal with all
      of the minor details of this whole thing, hopefully not involving Chizuru
      as much as possible because you know, he wants to prove himself to her
      somehow. And also, talking on the balcony seems like a no-no with the new
      neighbour who popped in, but we also know a bit more about her in the
      school somehow lol she went to the same college as them as well no wonder
      she lived next door we got two other examples right here anyways.
      <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But unlike Kazuya, Mini-chan here does not know of Chizuru's
      situation and this business talk and everything, so the guy reminds her to
      keep mum about, uh... their relationship? Yeah, too complicated to explain
      to her anyways WE STILL HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT RUKA-CHAN!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah,
      girl, wait till you hear how noisy this neighbour is when the actual
      girlfriend drops by once in a while to try to get herself f- Anyhow lol
      not yet by the way, Chizuru did notice the neighbour wasn't too happy, so
      she decided to conduct their business... indoors. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Well, you know
      where this is going. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So go watch Kazuya getting high on seeing
      his crush be moving around at his place lol he is not this high watching
      adult videos alone by the way, did not do much to keep his stomach
      growling apart from takeaway and energy drinks (lol) so she decides to
      whip him up something nice- Food, by the way,
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/omuraisu" target="_blank"
        >omelette rice</a
      >, don't think too much into it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I think I missed
      seeing Kazuya's reactions throughout this episode, as much as I think this
      is as cringe as what I think, if not more. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know I said this
      series was probably a nuisance back in season two mainly because you know
      it's just nothing but drama, but seeing that this has a direction to go
      now isn't a bad thing at all, and I did miss Chizuru even if it's flat out
      just her rack which isn't flat at all <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, we shall see if this will go
      as much as we hoped it will. The romance, I mean. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> With Mini-chan
      likely not as rival but as backup seeing how this goes I don't think we
      will get another Mami-chan haha f**k off dude, I think this might go many
      ways than other, if this business will even go according to plan. As in,
      if Kazuya dumps in 100k yen and asks for a kiss as a tiered reward haha or
      Ruka-chan standing at the doorway or something <em>after</em> we saw her
      listed in the credits, I don't know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Do not forget guys, we are
      watching what is still a roller coaster of a drama series. See you then.

      Wow holy sh*t the opening theme animation is impressive!! I know like,
      this was done as ending theme before in the original series but rewwind
      that a bit and see this as a metaphor of what is coming up next in battle,
      won't you? Haha thanks Kubo-sensei, you have made wonders once again. So,
      moving on haha, I can only have compliments about this series reaching its
      final arc in animation, in the new episode where we ONLY simp on Yhwach
      lol almost forgot the spelling (#BLEACHTYBW14), let's talk about what
      happened. Firstly, Yhwach addressing the Sternritters. To everyone's
      surprise, Ishida Uryuu haha remember this idiot? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He is being
      designated as his successor whatever that means- Is this dude not going to
      get a son or something? Regardless, I guess not killing him in the
      whatever shift in all Quincies power takeover thing he has which killed
      all Quincy moms (lol) is easier than pleasing a woman and making a baby
      LOL MARRIAGE JOKE (I'm sorry), but still, maybe it's because it be like
      this that we will reach the point on what will be one of the main focus of
      this season: Ichigo vs Ishida. We will get to that later, so don't think
      too much from the title art and see how dumb the Sternritter reactions
      reacted to this instead, why don't you? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh Bazz-B, why are you
      basically Renji but dumber? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Looks like him too so no wonder.
      <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Moving on, looks like Ichigo is going through some weird training
      that is outside of normal shinigami powers and likely Renji and Rukia will
      too, also for Byakuya who has recently fully recovered he took a while he
      was almost a pile of meat the last time we saw him. And as for Kyoraku? He
      just uh, reminded Ichigo's friends (likely family too who knows) of what
      might happen to Ichigo if, Mizuno is right that is a big if, he will be
      too strong to be able to come back to the real world. I mean, if he's too
      strong by then might as well make him the next Soul King. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Main
      character title not enough for you, punk? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The Vizard gang, or
      whoever is remaining in Kurakara Town, is likely trying to recreate the
      Garganta gates for people to travel between worlds again specifically from
      Hueco Mundo to come back (with compliments from Shinji and Mayuri lol
      don't trigger our Hiyori thanks haha), in case you forgot some of them are
      still stuck in there thanks to one Sternritter who jailed them in the
      first place. We also finally got the full quote of the Quincy awakening in
      place, in case you forgot what happened at the very start of this final
      arc. Most importantly, the world will be taken over in 9 days, thus the
      episode title. Not true because if you have been counting, the Quincies
      did not exactly win so let's not spoil that too early hehe, so yeah,
      could've been less creepy with the shadows not dropping down instantly but
      yeah, I felt it was faster in the original work, I guess. Guess you can't
      be as sneaky as the Quincies- Why am I calling them names even? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
      All in all, great start to the second season of the final arc, we are
      picking up quite great here despite the lack of fights. As expected, the
      opening theme is great and the ending theme song makes me want to throw up
      so thanks Kamiyama You for ruining this for me I knew that the moment I
      saw your name lol. Also, can't believe how much I missed all the ladies in
      this series lmao okay mainly the new characters we are introduced with,
      but also Rukia and Inoue to be honest it has been a while, and you know,
      let's hope the shinigami don't die too early this time around, they still
      don't have a way to fight them by the way. Fingers crossed for Take 2,
      people.

        This week is quite strong for the month of July despite listening to

        older songs. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of which, and that's why I only gave the
        new title song from

        back then, plus new songs to pad the order if I'm not wrong. Not like it
        helped because I gotta their older Rock style is not rubbing off me so I

        which ironically their indie songs are shining off my back so I paid
        more attention to them somehow, which you know, isn't a bad idea at all
        I've not known them before the are in major music label. I also listened
        to

        years lol, I also see their member count subtracted by one haha shout
        out to the post I did for #KN15YEARS last week, so I didn't think too
        much and gave a couple of familiar tunes because all these guys can do
        is only print out music of the same style and can barely deal with
        emotional songs this time around. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I better move on haha.
        Earlier this week though, I did listen to Suchmos member split jazz

      <strike>do this at home earlier</strike> ensure its delivery into my hands
      just in case my dad decides to take a nap haha. So yeah, remind me to send
      the package out tomorrow, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you next time then by then

      give me so much hope on the series once again because not only did I know
      that the first up on the list to be animated will be the school arc and I
      know most of the story already, but also with the new arc about some
      magician? Oooooo haha that's what happens when you license the manga dude
      I just watch the Anime now lol. I'll be looking forward to all of this
      though, the last time we had this adaptation
