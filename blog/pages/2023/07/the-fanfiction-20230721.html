  Oh I'm writing this a day early because I'm going to be busy this weekend and
  yes it's because of Anime but also I'm going out so I'm not spending the usual
  Saturday evening doing this up. Besides, I can do this WHENEVER I WANT it just
  has to be a weekly post. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Or not, we might not keep that momentum if
  I can't find something for next week to end the month. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <br />Well, this week's guest is most definitely coinciding with their
  birthday a couple of days ago so

    >I won't spoil who they are</a
  >
  (lol why the link then), since if you read the first sentence and not think I
  picked this up from my own book of life where I hang out with my sis for
  breakfast which is technically earlier in the day than this... don't ask
  anymore NO MORE QUESTIONS haha let's just do this

    <i
      >It was a great start to my day off in the Natsukawa family. The light
      shining into my room was so bright and warm it woke me late into the
      morning. Knowing that Shiina also had her day off today and it has been a
      while since we hung out, I messaged her if she wanted to join me for
      brunch. Not long after, we left home together for the nearby Starbucks.</i

    <i
      >The shops started to open on the shopping district as we made our way
      back after getting some groceries. Shiina then saw the capsule toy
      machines by the stores and begged for me to give her some coins to play
      them. Surprisingly, she got what she wanted immediately without breaking
      my wallet, but instead gave it to me. I told her I was not interested and
      she can keep it as a gift from me, but the smile on her face is
      irresistibly cute (and she was real pushy about it) so I had to accept it.
      It has been hanging&nbsp;off my carry bag ever since.</i

  <br />Man, do I really wish I was involved with Natsukawa Shiina (lol) or be
  in the Natsukawa family somehow. If it had, it HAS to be stepsiblings, right?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again I cannot imagine my mom being with a Japanese lol nor my
  dad, though thinking about a bit more in the shower just now make me see that
  the latter might be more possible. My dad's already into Vietnamese women
  singing traditional Chinese songs, what else is new? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay not going
  to be too pesky on this, being Japanese male sucks anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And
  that's saying about their work life even without conscription. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay
  maybe I should stop tanking on them, but seriously having Nan-chan as
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>
  sounds great, I don't mind being single forever! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I will get to know
  her other two sisters too. Who knows, maybe they are cuter than her-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Speaking of capsule toys, tomorrow's reason for not doing this...
  tomorrow lol is to go to one, specialized ones from Bandai opening in
  Singapore, and if you heard of me saying it and saw the plural on the previous
  part of this sentence, I will be going with my friends again but this time to
  their new 2nd branch. So yeah, we shall see if there is any different and if I
  will NOT regret to not roll a Hololive keychain instead haha maybe I should
  huh, me.&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Is there a TrySail capsule toy I can roll? That isn't MusicRayn'
  Capsule because I can't pay there? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
