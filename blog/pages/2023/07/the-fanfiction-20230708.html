<div>This time around, it'll be a little different in setting. Yes, I'm totally going bonkers on this one though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, this is what I'd imagine recently is my background and circumstances for IF I do live in their world, so just hear me out, yes? Is this long enough of an intro no one will get spoiled who is featured in this? Oh yeah, this is all a mirage. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I hope so though because this time around...!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Amamiya Sora dressed in red and white striped camisole below a thin pajama blouse, holding on to a burger" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=357 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl949088.jpg title="Amamiya Sora" width=139></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>Yesterday was quite a night as it was my first time I had a sleepover with my younger stepsister Natsukawa Shiina and her friends Asakura Momo and Amamiya Sora. Since I lost a bet playing games with them last night, they forced me to sleep on the sofa and wake up early to make breakfast for them.</i> </div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I heard footsteps from the staircase leading upstairs the following morning as I was in the kitchen. I turned around to see Sora was the first to come down, with unkempt long hair from what I assume was a morning shower, walking out smelling fresher than a bed of roses. We both greeted each other in the chilly morning. She looks around the kitchen I just cleaned up before she sat down across the table. She showed me a grin in her face without makeup as she takes a small bite off the burger I made.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><i><abbr title=へ、そんな料理できるんだ。>"Oh wow, so you can cook up something like this now."</abbr></i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>Yes, Amamiya-san, for passively mocking on my cooking abilities. It was because I was rejected by you in high school that I learned how to cook.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I know right, I would never be able to date her, even in fiction. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Heck, Ten-chan just be my girlfriend it can just be rental haha get it that's a reference to <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/53050/Kanojo_Okarishimasu_3rd_Season target=_blank>Anime "KanoKari"</a> she voiced main girl Chizuru go check that out it's on season three this week.</div><div><br></div><div>In context though, just a little more because I thought of setting a character limit on the above to keep the story concise screw you Twitter haha, yes I chose to make Ten-chan my first ever confession and rejection, when I was in high school. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I was rejected probably because she was being practical and targeted on stuff I could not do to support her since she wanted someone who can cook on the days she doesn't want to. I mean, fair point <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>, so guess what happened to me since then. Nothing, that's fiction, I never learned cooking, not in real life. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Let me confess to Ten-chan in real life and I'll try.</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I'll leave the context of living with the girls for another time haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> I promise you once again this will make sense- It's in the same world dude</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
