  This time around, it'll be a little different in setting. Yes, I'm totally
  going bonkers on this one though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, this is what I'd imagine
  recently is my background and circumstances for IF I do live in their world,
  so just hear me out, yes? Is this long enough of an intro no one will get
  spoiled who is featured in this? Oh yeah, this is all a mirage. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I
  hope so though because this time around...!

      >It was a very different morning. It was my first time staying the night
      in an abode with the TrySail girls. Since I lost a bet with them last
      night, they forced me to sleep on the sofa and wake up early to make
      breakfast for them. I hear footsteps from the staircase leading upstairs.
      I turned around to see Amamiya Sora was the first among them to come down,
      with her unkempt long hair from what I assume was a morning shower,
      smelling fresher than a bed of roses. We both greeted each other in the
      chilly morning. She looks around the kitchen I just cleaned up before she
      sits down across the table. She gives me a grin in her face without makeup
      as she takes a small bite off the burger I made.</i

        I know right, I would never be able to date her, even in fiction.
        <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Heck, Ten-chan just be my girlfriend it can just be rental

  In context though, just a little more because I thought of setting a character
  limit on the above to keep the story concise screw you Twitter haha, yes I
  chose to make Ten-chan my first ever confession and rejection, when I was in
  high school. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I was rejected probably because she was being practical
  and targeted on stuff I could not do to support her since she wanted someone
  who can cook on the days she doesn't want to. I mean, fair point <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>, so
  guess what happened to me since then. Nothing, that's fiction, I never learned
  cooking, not even in real life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let me confess to Ten-chan in real
  life and I'll try.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. I'll leave the context of living with the girls for another time haha
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> I promise you once again this will make sense- It's in the same world
