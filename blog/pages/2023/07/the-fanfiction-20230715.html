  Hey, welcome back to every weekend ie. the haven in my pathetic life so far,
  where I talk about how ideal or at this point imaginary, my life would have
  been as a Japanese... but surrounded with ladies I like. Specifically of voice
  actresses though; I can't keep writing how much I want to bang porn actresses
  or whatever haha-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well, continuing on the story last time, this time around we are greeted with
  someone else familiar too, at least to me. But I feel like I don't know her
  too well, so might as well know less as I write my own lore into it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Maybe I should listen to

  <blockquote>
    <i
      >The sun shines into the cabin as I board a train to meet up with the
      TrySail girls a few stops away out of the city. Holding on to the handrail
      with one hand as I face outwards into the scenery looking into my phone, I
      felt a tap on my shoulder. Turning around, with both hands holding on to a
      handrail and returning a faint smile, it was Asakura Momo on the same
      train with me, who was en route to our meeting point. A soft call of
      "Aozaki-san?" melted me more than the hot sun, and we started some chit
      chat, talking about food and recent TV shows and all. As I went on about
      my monologue, Asakura-san listened attentively. I felt like she did not
      just return a passing smile, but was behaving more like someone who was
      just keen being a listening ear. To me, the conversation make me feel like
      she was such a nice person overall. Perhaps maybe, she was just interested
      in knowing more about me.</i

  What do you think? Well, what do <em>I</em> think?? In this case though, maybe
  it's not obvious enough because I assume this needs a lot more context, Mocho
  here will be the most left out of the bunch, but will also be the one I'll be
  most interested in. Yes, and it's not because of chest. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Because
  recall last time where Ten-chan is the one who rejected me (and maybe she'll
  try to give me chance again) and there's the imouto haha so this one is
  neglected as much as I have the best chance to be together with. And the
  feelings will be vice versa too, in case you don't think this will happen.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>&nbsp;Now you get the idea, yes? I just want to p-

<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Please, me, that is <strike>"put my d-"</strike> "put my lips against
  hers" haha that is the nicest I can make it
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Imagine me making out with Mocho in front of the other two. Imagine
  their reactions. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
