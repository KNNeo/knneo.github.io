Man, was this a way to end the month and into the new one. As you have seen, I
have been doing blog posts every day ever since my last day of work for the week
and month, only to realize that unlike my expectations, the replacement phone
AND the new package came in on the same day! So yeah, rushed to update the phone
enough to take photos and I have been checking on its issues ever since.
<span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> The speakers not working too well though haha guess I don't need
notification sounds no more LMAO<br />
<br />
So yeah, let's welcome back the entertainment news triforce of Anime, Manga and
music!! Wait, what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Manga reading in this column? WHAT YEAR IS THIS??
Haha oh don't worry, I can tell you how it started- It's those YouTube videos
who get voice actors to voice the comics dude, that's a thing now. So yeah,
thanks Anzai Chika for that. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

      haha

  You see, when you oversleep also means it's a good sleep also means it's cool
  outside also means the rain will never stop and you can't do photography. So
  unless their theme is rain or my final year project in university lol, in this
  new episode (#KimiSomu12) unlike my university life okay maybe just the one
  day hehe don't narc, the couple (hehe) decide to go on a date! Haha, come on
  we know it's not but it totally is one- Shiromaru-senpai you can leave now.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, they didn't go out anyways it's was an indoors date lol, since
  it's also a good time to sort out the photos Nakami took while Isaki does her
  summer holiday homework lol same dude, and thank goodness the weather cleared
  up so they can get some shopping done, but even then, the weather's not doing
  too good for the next couple of days, so they might not be able to take photos
  after all. Their rations are also running out and they can only "sustain" each
  other for so long before they- JUST FUCK ALREADY haha okay dude we still have
  one last episode after this, relax. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the friends came in to
  help so thanks especially to Nono-chan and Ukegawa haha, as not only did they
  bring in supplies to help them last the final release <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>, but also, you
  know, maybe just the two of them is getting boring lol so the more the merrier
  and
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/okonomiyaki" target="_blank">okonomiyaki</a>
  I guess haha thanks Kanikawa. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The fireworks would've been better HAHA
  okay I'm sorry for the burn. Also, Ukegawa slaying puss with the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ukulele" target="_blank">ukulele</a> by the
  way, got spoiled on the thumbnails and the livestream last week though. So
  this is original? Let me check that out later, probably is in the soundtrack.
  It's cool though, having such a insert song that is unexpected and out of
  nowhere, we don't see many Anime having such a budget now. What also had
  budget now is this Astronomy Club training camp, because now we should have
  enough to last will the final photo shot that the two will be embarking
  hopefully as the weather clears up. Sadly, looks like Isaki's parents found
  out about the sister and they are probably (too) worried about the girl being
  alone with the guy in case anything kinky happens (hehe) (haha) (HAHAHAHAHA)
  (mom pls), so they will pick her up by nightfall. And in between deciding on
  how to proceed from here on, I'm still glad Nakami was smart enough to know to
  finish his quest AND disobey Isaki's parents orders of not pulling out (lmao
  s*x joke) by leaving (memories) (haha) on nightfall and then doing the final
  stuff all night. Again, not like they need to sleep for the night or anything
  they awake is the same as not needing to carry Red Bulls to survive the night.
  They can survive it, we know that already. And that might be how we end with
  this series, an adventure of a journey I can't get more excited about
  happening soon. All in all... maybe you guys don't get married. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What
  you can do though, is at least keep the image of you guys being together
  forever. You know, so maybe Isaki can just last until the honeymoon then we
  don't have to deal with the housework problems together- Moving on lol, I
  guess that's the next best choice coming in from Nakami, as if you would
  recall, he had to do the confession properly in response to whatever happened
  the previous episode hehe, so we are not going to let the future
  parents-in-law ruin this for him- Wait. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I know right, Haya-san, it's
  all your damn fault. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's see how we can achieve all of the above
  next week. We are so close to the declaration- Heck this is going to be the
  actual Anime I watch *last* season that ends with a formalized couple. I'll be
  looking forward to that hehe

  Please me, stop crying over whatever happened that last season, it can't get
  any worse from here. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this sequel of a romance story known to
  reach its conclusion, we are back with more stories to tell, it seems. So for
  the first episode (#HorimiyaPiece01) looks like we're talking about their
  school trip to Kyoto. Was this before or after the rejection- ALRIGHT haha
  looks like it's before <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> anyways but we have everyone introduced though
  because why not, so let's recall who they are. We have middle school
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yanki-" target="_blank">yankee</a> Miyamura
  who recently in high school (I assume specifically around this time too) got a
  girlfriend Hori-san who really likes him for pretty much everything especially
  his sadist tone to her lol don't quote me on that, is going on a field trip
  with the other classmates which thank goodness we only have to talk about
  Miyamura's buddy Ishikawa who knows of his body lol as in the tattoos,
  Yoshikawa who is Hori's buddy which just so happens these two side characters
  have a thing for each other but we don't talk about that haha, Shu who is just
  a dumba** and he is still the reason why I hate the story is whenever he's
  around, Sengoku and Remi who were in the student council who just so happens
  to be a couple already, and we don't talk about Sakura-chan, thank goodness.
  *laugh* Anyways, I like how they only focused on the bath part because I mean
  if you haven't been to Kyoto in animation (RIP KyoAni) or in real life just go
  watch every other high school drama out there to learn about that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kinkakuji" target="_blank">gold temple</a>
  everyone loves but it's not lit in here. Nonetheless, according to the
  schedule the boys have to shower in a public bath before dinner, and that's
  when Miyamura ran into some problems. If you would recall and as Ishikawa has
  also recalled after being seriously hinted by his buddy... yeah he's on his
  period. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So&nbsp; yeah, he just had to hide his body marks even if it
  means he can't bathe for the couple of days which I would say is sad
  considering this isn't the winter season he's gonna sweat with the layers of
  clothing. Hori-san kindly offered the bathroom in their rooms because of
  course women have all the human rights lol Anime doing something right for a
  start haha also to prevent that teacher in the second half of the episode to
  do anything haha voiced by Tsuda Kenjirou by the way I already know him from
  TWO pervert roles the other being Anime "Ao-chan" lol, this main girl did
  literally just allow some dude into her room without asking any questions. You
  know, even asking if the guy wants any more "service" after the bath or
  something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Second half is just the rooftops. No really, don't mind
  those dudes again- Wait, this is the strange deja vu I've witnessed in the
  first season where the guys talk sh*t? Alright. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay not really that,
  because we get to talk about actually this episode is all about that, why
  Miyamura and even Sengoku have to be clothed. We know from Remi-chan it's
  because her boi doesn't want to show his chopstick-level skinniness which I
  gotta say is me in middle school and I guess high school too I got fat thanks
  to the Army lmao, and Miyamura... well literally, we can only use the f-word
  to describe his situation. The teacher did come up with a solution
  <strike>to see the girls on pool day</strike>&nbsp;to get these two nerds out
  of the pool though, which also means they had to end up cleaning the already
  clean pool while the guys play around on this mandatory pool day not meant for
  female students haha. All in all... at least it's funny. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, if I
  can recall how I watched this a couple of years ago, it's probably also
  because of this reason. Heck, I'll take that I guess. Just... maybe not a
  sequel? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Hey, I didn't ask for this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, probably have to
  try to give quite a compelling beat for an opening theme since that also made
  an impression on the promotional video back in a while when I watched it the
  ending theme is really a no-go I thought it sounded alright until it doesn't,
  and remember when I mentioned last week this was going to be that lowest
  ranked sequel on my list? I'm just glad it started early haha more laughs next
  time I guess.

  I, uh, don't know if I will continue to watch this. But I did finish watching
  this first episode of an original series this season though (#AYAKA01), so
  that's a start. Not going to give a full write-up you can watch it yourself,
  but I'll talk about what's good and bad. Gotta say though, hard to say no when
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/869/Saori_Hayami" target="_blank"
    >Hayami Saori</a
  >
  is your mom. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways, that's not the point, but the cast in this series
  might be a thing to talk about.
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/591/Kenjirou_Tsuda" target="_blank"
    >Tsuda Kenjirou</a
  >
  is your dad who died for some reason we don't know yet probably not because of
  that dragon in the Ayaka Islands from so many years ago.
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa" target="_blank"
    >Hanazawa Kana</a
  >
  is one of the underlings of a... rival organization of dealing with the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ayakashi" target="_blank">ayakashi</a> in
  this world? Yeah, apart from the stellar cast though, we actually do have some
  decent action scenes going on here. With the trailer I've seen a little and
  here I've seen a little more because that's how this works anyways, it's just
  like ayakashi fighting action which isn't too bad, main guy is just brute
  force what else is new *looks at Ichigo*, and his buddy in action is way
  cooler than I would have imagined, dealing with just one ayakashi turned evil
  so far. That's all I will say though, because damn is everything else not
  great. The animation isn't fantastic which is what makes this bad compared to
  series like
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50709/Lycoris_Recoil" target="_blank"
    >"Lycoris Recoil"</a
  >
  even though that is just guns and the seconds I saw it in here it's not the
  worst, but damn when you have hand to hand combat and weapons this is going to
  be rough. Character design is also just a meh, obviously worsened by
  animation, and I just feel like they didn't pace this storytelling good
  enough. I know they are going for the controlling of emotions story to explain
  how the main guy can accidentally kill the people around him, but the turns
  are very rough in this one, I'm sure we have plot twists that have been done
  better than this, making this really anti-climatic for some reason. Yeah, just
  like the main guy actually. Not to associate with angela singing the opening
  theme song though, but this feels like a Anime
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/9479/Coppelion" target="_blank"
    >"COPPELLION"</a
  >
  feel style of work. Drawings are alright maybe on the negative side, character
  design is kind of a mess, and storytelling is just telling us to stay away
  apart from the once in a while action scenes and stellar cast which are
  boosting this so hard, I have sequels to watch this seasons so I'm going to
  say no to this one. Not gonna accept this foster family- I was living so well
  in middle school in the mainland who cares about my dead father. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Also mother, doesn't even exist in the story she can be a demon for all we
  know haha

  And as I browse the YouTube channel in which I found the above series, I
  chanced upon two (released at once) (now three as of writing) chapters of this
  (I'm not into
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rorikon" target="_blank">loli</a>) cute but
  deadly whatever ramen shop that serves you death as and when you need it, ie.
  can you give me a bowl too? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Jokes aside, the main guy doesn't die
  though and it's Chapter 2 so uh... Problem? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And yes, half this
  appeal is apart from the mystery itself as it will not be revealed for 200+
  chapters if it ever gets there, I will second guess that because of love or
  whatever the main guy can NOT be killed hehe please prove me wrong, and the
  other half appeal is the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>
  herself. Yes, I stand with the guy she is damn cute haha voiced by

  by the way great cast choice. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Maybe just being in that state of
  paradise (with the girl too?) and not dying also works- Can he even die of old
  age? Haha so many questions

  though as much as I was kinda reluctant to do so, but I suppose this is as
  close as they can make their style without the composer around, so I'll cut
  them the slack for this time. More new songs, guys? Last year kinda sucked for
  them imo lol. I also ended up giving whatever

  Okay Twitter's going to suck at some point so maybe we report as many of these
  news in detail as possible lest I do not have evidence to show that I'm not
  lying about stuff no more. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  is for their new song from last month and not like it'll change my impression

  and title song reveal in full should catch my interest more because even
  though it has lesser frames (lol why) it still will be the song to make summer
  this year for me, not going to lie. And in case you haven't heard of their new
  song then

  with the latter for Anime "Horimiya" so maybe we can give the album a chance
  if the other is actually good. Hey, I appreciate them not forcing us to listen
  to the album for one song *looks at Suda Keina* haha but I can change my
  mind.&nbsp;<a

  released literally today is not bad at all, I'll look forward to the major
  release. Last but not least because no one was able to see the newer tweets

  for Anime is definitely something interesting for the songs she has sung so
  far but also very relevant for a fantasy series such as Atelier, no wonder.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let me go back to listen to mol-74 if you guys don't mind hehe<br />
  <br />
  Next week starts the new month with a bunch of not new songs in new releases
  though, so maybe those will be lower priority. Perhaps after listening to
  <b>SPYAIR's new song</b> from their new vocalist YOSUKE which will make or
  break my following of them from here on, and maybe if I listen into&nbsp;<b

      target="_blank"
      >Mrs. GREEN APPLE's new album</a
    ></b
  >&nbsp;(we are left with three members already??) and dive into their
  worldview again, then I'll take a listen to
  <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's re-release of their 2008 album</b> and
  <b>LUCK LIFE's best album</b> which man if I dare say there are new songs in
  it but I'm relying on the old songs to impress if I haven't given them, by the
  way. Haha I will see about that, or I might as well give the newer songs,
  eh?<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />

  Oh yeah, Twitter might be out of its use sooner than we think. People in Japan
  are jumping into Instagram on a whim from what it looks like looking at their
  trending page. I always thought Blogger will die out earlier and that's why
  I'm thinking of what I should deal with for the 10th anniversary of this blog
  (which is next year this month btw) but maybe I should worry about all the
  embeds I'm going to lose association with. Heck, even Instagram with their not
  so customizable embeds will be better now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, I hate WordPress
  so we are going to be here a while. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Time to host this blog myself then!
  Haha anyhow, see you again soon, and if my Twitter account fails at least you
  can still read this on my blog archive on GitHub if anyone wants to read all
  this trash without letting me know you're just a spam bot. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See you
  there haha I need to think of what to write next week for fanfiction actually
  lol<br />

  this is the game's second and first being Yomu-sensei author of "Douki-chan"

  complaining. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I did not spend money to get a roll on Loberia's
