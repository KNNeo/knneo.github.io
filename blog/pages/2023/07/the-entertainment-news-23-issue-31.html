Oh boy is this weekend full of blog posts haha hey Anime is one thing but to
dream of Japanese voice actresses? I need to do that more often lmao
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah, just writing them down isn't helping much anyways I should go back to
  sleep I'm tired lol, but seeing that I still have to deal with the crazy
  amount of shows I have to "review" every week at this time of year, and
  between balancing this and my own free time (yeah this isn't part of it
  anymore lol) I, uh... still am stuck on what to add to the next package
  incoming. Maybe Suruga-ya, maybe I'll get a replacement of a CD player from
  Japan(?), I don't know, we shall see. The clock of storing my stuff at the
  forwarding service is ticking though...
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Let's! We gotta send off this month so next month will be better- Don't ask if
  I got any SSRs this week if I don't talk about it then this month is not great
  lol<br />

  Shout out to my first year in university when I had to do this lab session...
  yes, kids learn these at 12 now spare me the shame, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this
  new episode of an OVA series we should be done with long time ago but I'll
  follow the simulcast timings (#TonikawaJK02), seeing that the girls knew of
  their new teacher's private life... why not poke in more, yes? And I dare you
  to say gender has nothing to do with this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, more of the high
  school life... as a teacher for Nasa-kun I guess. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Firstly, we are
  introduced formally to Miyako and her side job which, I hope you have watched
  the Anime "Kaguya-sama" series for me to make this joke, makes her effectively
  more powerful than the Four Ramen Kings combined lmao and that is if not for
  the couple meddling in her review of the new hot thing (get it?) in town that
  she was going to talk about in her social media account later. But yeah, she's
  feeling the heat from the married couple that's for sure- Do you think the
  Japanese government sponsored this series so the people can combat their
  dwindling population growth? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If they are they sure aren't promoting
  copulation BOOM haha moving on, and someone wants to drain a pond. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  You know, Aya-chan being the author when they ran out of jokes or this show's
  getting dry (get it?) so what a surprise, Nasa-kun can do anything as long as
  he has the Internet community backing him up (or ChatGPT when he gets access
  to it soon?) so he starts to dig a pond just so she can drain it? Sure, kiddo.
  And ironically I know of this and this is how them Westerns make their own
  pools, it's everything they mentioned besides adding reinforcements for the
  pool walls and optional heating if any because in case you want to swim in
  winter... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, not like we remembered that part but we did
  remember how the girls knew of the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sensei" target="_blank">sensei</a> and his
  private life and he literally just told them he was living in a bathhouse for
  no damn reason so I guess instead of them going to his place to study which
  will drive Tsukasa madder than she had to dress up as one of them lmao, the
  girls chose to come over to take a bath instead. So yeah I'm going to get
  cancelled seeing them in just bath towels lol, but that was something.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Overall just another day in the life of Nasa-kun's teacher life and
  the wife is getting more jealous every day so we gotta remind her she is cuter
  than everyone else which we will see when the dude will change his mind lol
  what if he saw Kaguya and just got a boner lmao he wouldn't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But not
  even seeing the girl on a written programming test she is doing better than
  the whole school body and yes we included teachers in this test haha, Nasa-kun
  still did not have the chance to see or even talk to her in person but do we
  need to? Remote work is a thing so why not remote... teaching? Does Kaguya
  here need teaching? I thought Miyako was the genius here. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah,
  we're halfway already and hopefully someday we will hear more of Sakura Ayane
  talking lol. We shall see where this goes.

  P.S. "I'm an overachiever at school" Oh yeah Miyako you are smarter than that
  masked girl? F**KING GOT HER DUDE "For all of my blessings, I'm still not
  satisfied" Hey same but you are a woman so you can't say that lol
</div>
<div>
  P.P.S. "Would someone this cute eat something (this spicy)?" Miyako-san just
  go look at the mirror before you say things about Tsukasa, alright? Haha is
  that a pick-up line
</div>
<div>
  [You think like, Uesaka Sumire voicing Aya-chan saying "There's no such thing
  as too much cosplay" is a bit too real for her personally? Haha we need her as
  some form of ambassador so that we can encourage more girls to cosplay
  specifically female voice actresses lmao]

  It's not that the world's full of traps, Mie-san. You're just landing of them
  without your glasses. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where the cold weather is
  everything but (#SukiMega04), I mean... I'll just drink anything, right? It's
  an indirect kiss and all so I'll take her crotch- In order to not make
  anything I say here sound like a porno, damn the camera effects are just weird
  but I'll forgive them with my own jokes, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But seriously bro,
  even just in front of the vending machine, you don't really have to craze
  about making contact over drinking some black coffee. Just pour it all over
  your face. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, you get the idea, just distance it or whatever.
  Also, just select the right one for her too, I guess. So yeah, more stories of
  this slice of life series I won't get sick of, and they just keep feeding me
  with good bait so I can't even complain. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Firstly, the vending
  machine. Of course, we assume Mie-san glasses off mode ie. she forgot to wear
  them again what a surprise lol, as she tries to hit the machine with the hot
  stuff she wanted which is MOST DEFINITELY NOT black coffee so now Komura-kun
  has to drink it. Komura? You not drinking it because it's an indirect kiss?
  Welp. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Imagine he gets a boner drinking coffee- MOVING ON lol remember
  to at least tap on the one she wants to drink please, we have stuff like
  Komura not wanting to grow taller or else his girl can't see him lol screw you
  Azuma, but more interestingly is how we have reverse effect story going on
  from last week where I guess not that someone hits on Komura like what Azuma
  kind of did to Mie-san, <strike>nut</strike> but (haha typo) Komura did do a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kabedon" target="_blank">kabedon</a> on
  whoever Someya-san is (ooo voiced by Alex-san from Anime "Tada-kun" it has
  been a while) (ooo same year as me too hehe) and somehow the eyes on Mie-san
  got focused real well so see her boi enough for her to push him away from
  whatever he was doing because damn if you did not experience wearing glasses
  just higher than your degree and I also mean when you have perfect eyesight,
  it makes you giddy but I've never put some girl against a wall because of that
  so that kinda sucks- I should buy new glasses in front of someone I like
  someday. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of which, and yes this is definitely the highlight
  of the episode as teased in the preview and episode title, instead of bringing
  her dad and we say sorry to him again I guess, Mie-san brought Komura to the
  glasses shop we saw last time to, you know, get another spare because she
  literally broke the previous one the next day what a surprise. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But
  yeah conversely though, no surprises for guessing otherwise, not that
  Komura-kun has a glasses fetish like I do <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> but even then what else do
  you think he's going to say if all Mie-san is doing is changing out the frames
  of her glasses, eh? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I consider this a personal win and a part of the
  reason why I would even pick this series up, to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, my
  first question is how many does she intend to buy. If it's only 1 then Komura
  is screwed. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's like asking me which is the best girl in Anime-
  Seriously f**k you Takina from "Lycoris", I like this girl more now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  AND NEXT EPISODE IS VALENTINE'S DAY?? BRO <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, this series keeps
  its engines going at full power so I can't complain, this is rather niche of a
  series anyway not everyone is into cute girls in glasses but I do haha also
  this school has an unproportionate level of people donning them but that's not
  surprising, so more surprising is that I'm actually enjoying this more than
  ever, and probably why this is the <em>only</em> new series I picked up this
  season despite having to watch sequels on end. So yeah, still on this train
  either way haha and yeah, don't ever stop with the jokes though <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  Yeah, still cannot imagine not being able to touch the one you love. I don't
  have anyone who loves me so <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Moving on haha, in this new episode where
  their love life is interesting than mine by way too much
  (#ShinigamiBocchan15), let's talk about more progression this series? Man, the
  pace may be slow but it's okay I like something to happen every week, this
  isn't just slice-of-life anyways we need some story talk. Yeah, not like
  whatever that ghost is haunting Alice for the past couple of days (I really
  thought it was the production just using the other character we will talk
  about, but it's Akasaki Chinatsu?? lol) who just dropped by because she wanted
  to find a replacement for her own wedding ring which was too big for her?
  Actually more like just she suddenly died leaving her husband alone and she
  wasn't able to pass on, but seeing how nice the couple is to help her out, I
  guess she got over it, huh. I mean, you can stay a bit for tea Bocchan can't
  kill you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And finally this is indeed the highlight of the episode, is
  the arrival of whatever witch shaped like an octopus that will FINALLY break
  Bocchan's curse. Man, I wished it was this easy already- It's only Episode 15
  guys. 3 episodes in this second season. Of course it's not happening. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  So that aside lol, we got more lore to talk about. Introducing Amelia, I
  already got spoiled it was voiced by Ueda Reina haha I was also spoiled by
  Ueshama's lovely voice hehe, married but sadly I'm not the husband because
  <span style="font-size: xx-small;"
    >I won't even be allowed to watch any other tentacle p*rn now anyways</span
  >
  LMAO, arrived on land to the mansion from the seas almost half dead to
  hopefully put an insight into Bocchan's curse of killing whatever living being
  he touches. Yeah, it's a damn curse alright, and seeing how
  <strike>Ueshama</strike> Amelia lies between the seas and the magical world,
  just a short display of magic is already enough to impress the couple and let
  them have some underwater date or something sadly without swimsuits. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Jokes aside, the real problem is that we now know that (1) the obvious is
  Amelia did not break the curse haha and more importantly (2) she knew who did
  this curse of such power. Turns out, Daleth had a twin sister and that will
  explain many things going through my brain now. Sadly, none of them involve
  the sister Sade's motivation to curse Bocchan, but I'm pretty sure after I
  told you everything else, you might be able to figure out somehow. Just like
  season one, it's likely to do with Sharon ie. Alice's mom, but let's say
  Daleth was chosen to lead the magical world because her sister is the first
  likely candidate and died for whatever reason we don't know. Which will be a
  reality soon for this family here if Bocchan doesn't find a way to remove his
  curse oh boy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Daleth, you have problems being second in this?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well I guess to a lesser extent they are twins anyways. You came out
  of the womb second, right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay she is not Walter she won't be
  triggered. Great episode though haha I like the idea of the circus leader
  being the lover of an octopus and boy did they help drown my impression of
  some yellow octopus in Anime I actually don't mind dating Amelia if she's fine
  with not ruining the ship I was on or something. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Now that the couple
  knew of the truth, I guess Zain should know about it, yes? Circus visit time!
  Just uh, don't kill anyone there, yes, Bocchan? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "How happy would I be if I could still be with you when the curse is
  broken?" This series in a nutshell by the way]

  </blockquote>
  Okay FLASHBACK oh what the heck is Dazai involved here?? Fyodor, did you even
  know about this part? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well in this new episode though
  (#BungouStrayDogs53), we continue our fight with the most fearsome person in
  the world by far now, Fukuchi Ouchi or his other dozen profiles he is in or
  whatever, but let's just stick to this name now. So, let's go through what the
  couple (lmao) did to this OP dude the author just hacked into the database of
  this awesome action series story. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The guys thought they will need a
  plan, well at least Atsushi did, and they had to plan a bit before dealing
  whoever this monstrosity is. Though I would argue that might be useless if
  they had more rapport from the start to know when to use this tactic properly.
  So just a reminder: Fukuchi here is a war expert, so he thinks very much like
  a soldier. And if you need a recap or just find out the plot of video game
  "L.A.Noire", they will do anything to achieve victory. So they fear assassins,
  or more like ruthless single killers and the unpredictable. If that is what
  this couple (lmao) is, then we have chance. So yeah Atsushi, don't bother
  coming up with a plan: You better follow Akutagawa's pace on killing this guy,
  or else you two might as well die together. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> That was kinda sad but
  we are in a battlefield right now so MORE ACTION SCENES LET'S GOOO- And that's
  why I say this is better than "BLEACH", need I say more? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> They tried
  head on and it obviously did not work, Fukuchi can just take the railing of
  the ship and slap your face and half the ship will be chopped, just in case
  you wonder how this Ability of his works now. So yeah, the two only knew of
  fusing their abilities together but then will only have one chance to strike,
  which Fukuchi himself said would be useful to do it earlier than ever but damn
  it's the trust thing again despite whatever Dazai mentioned to Akutagawa and
  ESPECIALLY Atsushi just not giving a damn about this collaboration so
  Akutagawa you win this weretiger doesn't even trust Dazai anyways. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Because damn, did Fukuchi's reveal of his ultimate weapon (it's good old-)
  which is also responsible in his victorious battles so far, ensure their loss
  even in time and space with an ancient Ability weapon that can do what
  Einstein dreamed of doing in his time. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that's the hack to why he
  can never lose, because apparently he's smart enough to be able to go back in
  time and fix his own mistakes or even sudden ambushes (which I would note is a
  useful strategy until time space came into play) so that he will never lose.
  It's not like he can never be defeated, but with his own Ability and the sword
  itself, it's basically impossible to play with him... in another timeline
  even. Damn, we have to wait for another week to see the conclusion(?) to this
  fight?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Thanks for the opening theme song at the end, guys. My hands
  are shaking in fear now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So uh... how can you defeat him if this guy
  traverses time and space? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Like, we have to not be there in the first
  place? Yeah maybe, and he has to not know when that happened. But that's like,
  impossible for his power to not notice so... Fyodor has this guy on his side,
  huh. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> We might be screwed lol- Dazai can touch this guy before he
  gets slashed in half? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, we shall find out if Akutagawa even
  survives this or not actually, would be meaningless if he didn't. Can we
  summon a main character trump card here so he can't die? Yeah dear author, did
  you write a fail-safe into the final page? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Atsushi, get a pen, we
  can find one on this ship. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Damn, this week-long wait is going to be
  ROUGH haha see you then.

  P.S. Well I suppose a tactic worthy of killing Fukuchi does exist but that
  will involve manipulating every single timeline he can change too (since
  Akutagawa has proven that 100 times isn't like, infinite since his attacks can
  be blocked), he also can't traverse everywhere especially not to the time he
  wasn't even born lol, but I have no idea what Ability can even do that. Fyodor
  has no backup on this plan, huh. But hey, does he need to though? He just
  recruits everyone and hope they they don't betray him. And even so he's
  technically in jail which is the safest place on the planet so don't mind him
  I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />

  Kazuya is such a horny bastard Chizuru, you have no idea. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know
  right, shout out to the very first episode of this whole series where he-
  Moving on haha this new episode though (#KanoKari28) yeah Chizuru isn't wrong
  they can't really get serious anyways. It's rental, there's no way we are
  involved in their real lives unless we are their neighbour and go to the same
  college as them. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Mini-chan isn't wrong too, what's more than
  coincidence, eh? I want that and I don't even have it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Putting them
  aside though, and boy did Kazuya get disappointed just trying to catch her at
  the front porch not knowing what happened between these two girls, but yeah,
  it didn't take too long for Mini-chan to have to apologize to her shisho for
  whatever hole she had dug out for him to jump into. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All is well
  though I hope, not like Chizuru is that concerned about this even though
  pretty much this episode itself is just asking her the same question haha we
  will get to that in a bit, because damn did her effort of asking someone of
  influence to help promote this campaign going to fire back at her real quick.
  It all started with Umi-kun asking for something in return for even just a
  sharing of the campaign on his social to help out his own kouhai out here, but
  more than that, and maybe it made sense, to just go to some famous troupe
  alone isn't exactly great it's sad actually, so getting Chizuru to fill the
  slot is great. But Kazuya is definitely worried about something, just like the
  other season when he was too where he saw his girl with the same dude.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Mini-chan is right though haha I like how they need to debate on
  this, but sometimes, you just gotta do it for the entertainment industry. Just
  look at all those scandals. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, we need the drama so shut your cake
  hole, Kazuya. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, just bearing the uncertainties of whatever Umi-kun
  here might just do to our dear main girl over here Kazuya is just frothing
  over his mouth despite Ruka-chan totally not worried of what will happen to
  those two anyways on the last day of the campaign, just ended up handing out
  flyers with no way to know what happened on their end. Not even when Umi-kun
  literally dropping nuclear bomb sized hints of picking this girl up. Just be
  on your toes, girl. No one is going to be there to help you out when you are
  f**ked- Like, literally. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The show is over, looks like nothing
  happened... until there was a follow-up. I mean, Mini-chan said you could go
  so... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course Umi-kun knows about whatever relationship this is
  happening between the main two even someone blind would realize, but I feel
  like Umi-kun will be the Mini-chan No.2 over here, I don't know. Asking
  similar questions as Mini-chan on why anyone would do so much for her... Yeah,
  dude is telling you Kazuya is doing it for you, Chizuru. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And
  thankfully she did not go along with his after plans... so yay? Dude just
  broke up with his own girlfriend recently he's trying to get another one?
  BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Throughout this episode I definitely stood along Kazuya's
  standpoint that Umi-kun here is definitely up to no good, and he still
  probably is if Chizuru went along with it, but yeah, I guess this series isn't
  such a thing for drama huh. Even though it's drama-themed all along and we
  have literally people on top of each other. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, as pure as I
  like this to be, I really don't mind the drama to be scaled up, but now that
  we have the crowdfunding campaign up and going, maybe we will see more of that
  ahead of us. Kudos to Umi-kun for not ruining all of this haha, also Ruka-chan
  because damn she wouldn't even mind. Who else will make this project a flop
  though? Maybe we will know next time.

  Are they going to do like, family case studies because they don't have
  progression to talk about in this sequel anyways? If so I'm glad this specific
  one will be done and over soon haha because in this new episode
  (#HorimiyaPiece05) oh we talking about Iura's
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>? I'm in.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay maybe not, your brother is such an idiot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah,
  sister business. That is CLEARLY not his. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Alright, let's analyse
  whatever is going on with Motoko-chan here first. I mean, if you haven't been
  watching the episode itself lol they have summarized it perfectly thanks to
  Miyamura, but let's go through if you haven't got it. Iura's sister is
  bringing someone to her place to study, just purely so, but of course why even
  agree when it's not just aiming for the same high school eh? But not like
  Motoko-chan here is expecting anything though, which is kinda sad? Not for the
  brother it isn't. It is Kitahara we are talking about her though who is coming
  in to study with HIS sister. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Considering he likes a girl who has a
  boyfriend and you like him... I say Motoko-chan we still have a chance.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, Iura (Shuu) takes this situation offensively and boy he
  should not have bothered, but then again Motoko shouldn't have messaged him
  about the meetup anyways, on the other hand she may have saved the actual high
  school gathering after the test which obviously if wherever Shuu is he is a
  pain in the neck, so at least one of these groups will be saved. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Guy
  called Kitahara came over to drink some bitter, bitter tea after being shown a
  sword battle(?) among the siblings in which piqued his interest? Then got even
  more interested in Motoko's family affairs I'm pretty sure because the guy you
  like here, girl, is already hooked to some dude the moment he walked in. So
  yeah&nbsp;he likes your brother alright. We have come full circle. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  You're screwed, Motoko. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And that's why we can't have nice things.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What's worse, and boy you can laugh at all the guys being late to
  school on the wrong day lmao, is what happens when there are middle schoolers
  visiting their high school some days later. I mean, it's no Motoko appearance
  though that will also be chaos, but the point that this is an Iura (Shuu)
  focus episode I suppose we need to give him hell, and what more hell to give
  him than even after everyone has gotten hold of the situation where there
  exists someone in his sister's middle school who thinks he's cool? I mean, I
  wish girls think I'm cool, that I don't even mind if they are from middle
  school. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Haha hey Motoko-chan, what do you think of me? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I
  don't want to deal with your brother though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all this is
  basically a joke episode because the person in question is already one
  himself, and we cannot put in more jokes into this series? That is not trying
  to remind us this could've been put inline with the previous season to make
  the overall series flow better or be more palatable to an even larger
  audience. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Sadly, we didn't have that. We have Miyamura going to the
  convenience store to get breakfast and saying he's late running down the
  streets though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See what I mean about this series? The comedic timing
  is just too good already I'm just laughing all the way- This should be obvious
  just from the above text haha see you guys for more next time.

  Well, I haven't been typing anything while watching so... you tell me if it
  has been good. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode though (#BLEACHTYBW17) we had
  great progress ever since everyone got back their Bankai that's for sure. Or
  else I cannot even imagine Komamura ever being able to land a finger on any
  Sternritter to be honest. Yeah, piss on yourself, Shinji, you loser you just
  lost to a doggo even with the reveal of your Bankai. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't think
  Kubo-sensei intended him to be insulted to this degree, but yeah, we just had
  to. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Clearly the first half of the episode is dominated by whatever
  Komamura did to humanize himself in order to get to Yhwach, unfortunately had
  to use his power on Bambietta who just quite literally blew off Shinji without
  care which is kind of ironic to see but what else is new. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, I
  wished this upon Aizen at any point but just turns out to show Sakanade just
  isn't as good as Kyouka Suigetsu, innit? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, we learnt a bit
  about Bambietta's... Vollag- Whatever that thing is maybe we call it V-power
  from here on haha I like that <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, that this b*tch can explode in your face
  not because she throws bombs at you to explode which means if you can deflect
  it one would survive, but more of if it hits anything living it will explode.
  Now that kind of changes things a bit, for I wonder even with my own powers
  (yes, referring to Aozaki Shouhei and his zanpakuto, don't mind me) I would be
  able to deal with her but I guess not. Not like Shinji is a Kido user or else
  he won't be on the ground lmao, Hinamori thought she could use her fire-based
  Tobiume to try to counter her but I think that's as valiant an effort as her
  getting stabbed by Hitsugaya back then in Karakura Town lol that's a Aizen
  reference, so looks like Sajin(?) is here to take the front. Not that he's any
  different from the lot of them... but he did just rip off his heart to the
  elder doggo making him invulnerable as long as he is in human form and that's
  kind of sick because above all... he is effectively not living being anymore.
  That goes directly against whatever Bambietta has believed of her own powers,
  and immediately took herself down without a hitch. She can't even protect
  herself against her own powers is kind of a joke though, reminds me of
  Barragan and his "ultimate" aging power haha. We will not talk about why the
  other girls ditched her alone and THEN came back to pick up what's left of her
  I can only tell you how hype I will be on the naughty <em>naughty</em> things
  Giselle will do to her- Moving on haha we need to avoid spoilers, is what
  Komamura did in sacrifice to obtain this power. Well, turns out time is its
  limit lol the elder doggo got him good there, so before he can even take a
  swing at the castle the new Quincy king(?) is on, it was already
  over.&nbsp;Yeah Yhwach is looking at the prophecy and be like "Oh, we're good,
  this doggo can't get us" haha uh oh spoiler alert. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Komamura
  transformed back to the doggo he was all along, and Tetsuzaemon brought him
  back to retreat knowing that the 7th Squad now
  <strike
    >will have someone dumber than
    <a

    >
    to lead the group</strike
  >
  will have a pet dog to play with after the war if they survive it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  (Sorry, I can't imagine which joke is funnier so you get both <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>) What is
  ahead of its time to realize though, is the Superstar Sternritter and how he's
  dealing wins to the shinigami. Gotta say though spoiler alert, that's his
  whole shtick by the way, with the Officers gang beating him up and old small
  man not kid James cheering him up and that keeps him going, so this will never
  end in favour of the latter as the former will only get stronger. So yeah, we
  need a bigger force. I guess next week will be us focusing on what Kensei and
  Rose will do to this guy. If I didn't remember wrong they did give him a good
  Round 2. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I'm just here for more powers we have not witnessed yet in
  animation and haha yes that will be Rose's music-manipulating zanpakuto
  Kinshara, so I'll look forward to that. And who cares about Ichigo's training
  anyways I bet all this is just the old man covering Ichigo's eyes and
  strapping a vibrating b*tt plug into him anyways- <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  because despite listening to all versions on Apple Music (because the Regular
  Edition CD only has the first 3) I still only gave like the one B-side which
  reminded me of her mini-album some time ago and that's not helping so maybe we
  can get better Anime theme songs to sing? I don't know, I'm giving up. Also

  dip into what it feels like to be in summer 15 years ago. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> You won't

  isn't too bad considering this will be released in conjunction with the ending
  theme song for Anime "SukiMega" for next week so man is this going to be hard
  to not review them considering they are singing off each other but I'm more
  positive on the opening theme song ie. not Hoshimachi Suisei so we shall see
  if she can impress me. There's a&nbsp;<b

  >&nbsp;(the one I care about) is kinda alright I'm not complaining the song
  isn't written by her anyways and that says things, and seeing that it's
  another single-track release I might have to talk about it when it's out in a
  month. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Man, Anime music releases for next month, huh. So cringe to
  be honest. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <br />Well, starting August which is arriving soon we will have not many
  releases to talk about actually, so specifically for next week I'll focus on
  the <b>Anime "SukiMega" singles</b> then and hope I can talk about both of
  them in their CD forms in due time, so virtual singer Tsuzuri for opening and
  an Ooishi Masayoshi collaboration with the voice actors of the main couple for
  ending. Chances are I will so I'm stating it here first just in case.

  apparently, and as I looked back at the archive because I had something
  earlier lol it was the foot massage, the devs were talking about how this all
  started and stuff, so yeah, that. Oh boy, you were expecting an Anime
  adaptation huh, me? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, kind of repeating the formula of IDOLY
  PRIDE, but just on the merch side apparently. I... might just get myself
  something in here haha my bro thought about gifting me something so maybe
  these will do. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you guys next time then, I hope you saw all of
  what my blog has to offer even just this week alone lol we are not doing blog
  introductions until next year this time again, so until then maybe help me
  come up with ways to not show that I'm a terrible otaku and a hopeless
  romantic who wants like,
