Well, this was quite a week. Apart from me getting a headache when I should not
be since I'm working from home from half of this week till the next (even right
now UGH), I am still going to lose all my weekends due to Anime. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And
to make it worse, my mom suggested foot massage (will report if any of them look
good like it should be lmao) on Sunday morning so I guess we can't watch all of
this on Sunday at once so uh... I'm starting on Saturday if you guys don't mind.
You won't know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
<div>
  <br />So enjoy this hectic and SUPER LARGE ISSUE this week haha special
  edition and maybe for the next couple of months I think, but heck, I'll watch
  them all. Also, this time around since I never set any standard for this
  anyways, I'm watching them FIFO (first in first out) just like a stack and
  because it is, so whichever comes first I'll watch, except that...<br />

  So yeah, no wonder Nasa-kun was to be a teacher in a high school. I'm like
  "didn't he drop out of high school?" haha yeah he's just in one not as a
  student. In this new special series which is a spin-off of the original
  marriage story (#TonikawaJK01), this is about high school. You know, the stuff
  Nasa-kun did not go but is going now as a teacher? What a chad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And
  because Yanagi-sensei can't code for sh*t haha, I guess this genius student
  who is coding as a job can help her out. Oh boy did he not have to worry
  because with his young age and good looks and *ahem* being married and all
  haha let's ignore the last part, are you sure the girls in class won't be
  crazy about this dude? IT IS AN ALL GIRLS SCHOOL IT'S EITHER THEY ARE AFRAID
  OF GUYS OR ALL OVER GUYS haha not Anime

  reference I promise you there are dudes on the streets still. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Anyways, this is just a clusterf**k, right? That's all I got out of this?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course, this isn't without all its spoilers and I'm not going to
  list them all, so let's talk about what this generally is. Thanks to
  Yanagi-sensei, Nasa-kun gets to teach in a girls' high school. That can be
  good or bad if you think about it, considering he's basically the age of a
  graduate in that role, and of course all the j-j-j-jealousy on Tsukasa which
  is still the least of our problems, Nasa-kun is already getting quite a
  lashing due to revealing his age and marital status which isn't too surprising
  for us at this point we are already two seasons in, but you know, these are
  the 10th-50th people who knew about this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (I don't have the numbers
  Nasa-kun you can do the calculations haha) Among them are Kurenai-san who
  can't stop talking about his gamer boyfriend (here's my loner a** advice, the
  point that he's only talking to you about things he liked, is why you matter),
  Usa-san who just slapped him in the back for some reason lol, the chairperson
  Shirogane (not
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/136685/Miyuki_Shirogane"
    target="_blank"
    >Miyuki</a
  >) (also
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/43303/Rika_Nagae" target="_blank"
    >Nagae Rika</a
  >
  haha *umph*) who is probably the most serious in class until she is also
  shocked about the marriage haha, Inukai who I don't know much of also Miyako,
  there's someone named Jessie in this bunch lol, and (not
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/136359/Kaguya_Shinomiya"
    target="_blank"
    >Shinomiya</a
  >) Kaguya who just wears her mask on and is a genius and is probably a
  tsundere because why not take this time to not like your
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sensei" target="_blank">sensei</a>. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
  Anyhow haha, a vibrant cast over here is sure to make waves in the series, not
  to mention on the impact vice versa as Nasa-kun tears through all these idiots
  (except Shinomiya) about programming knowledge and how he just created a
  software for them to monitor the students' results without asking for anything
  in return. I know right, can I have s*x with the principal Azumamiya though??
  She hot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not as hot as Nasa-kun right now literally oozing with
  appeal to even just the girls in class, is probably not going to have a peace
  of mind when the girls find out (by stalking him I assume) how he has a wife
  on his hands. Again, married means romance knowledge maxed out? I would argue
  not since he didn't even do anything to get her, and of course, just because
  he
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> doesn't
  mean I don't have a way to be envious of him haha dammit, but you get the
  idea, they are making sure we all take the bait. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And we haven't even
  got to the reactions of the people in the bathhouse!! Haha yeah, that would be
  for next <strike>week</strike> time then I guess, the preview shows the girls
  in high school going to his... abode? I promise you this is actually easier to
  write a story on because imagine the awkwardness if all of them dropped by his
  small apartment and not the bathhouse. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let's not imagine too much
  into that haha Tsukasa might just bring out the sharp objects lmao I mean the
  kitchen knife to cook for them <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>

  [TL:DR; "Nasa-kun teaching at a girls school huh... There'll be a lot of young
  girls there!" This mini-series in a nutshell haha]

  No seriously, all the guys crying at Mie-san serving them stew is such a weird
  thing to listen to. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where oh well
  stealing scenes from Episode 1 with that opening theme animation
  (#SukiMega02), I mean Mie-san, do we have to repay back to Komura? He's got
  all of it back already, and more! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, Komura just being in
  class with her is already a joy, as seen from the lunch duty where the (not
  yet) couple (hehe) are handing out bread and stew for the people in class, and
  what else do I need to explain when you can't see for sh*t because you forgot
  your glasses. Think of what will happen if she did bread duty though, think
  about it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still though, I have an easy solution for this, and all
  she needs is another spoon to level the scooped ladle. *taps brain* But you
  know, middle school and limited resources so <span class="emoji" title="🤫">*sshh*</span> haha. Then again, what fun
  is it to not tease Komura with more potatoes like he deserves it so... maybe
  he is a masochist for all we know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Girl said it's to repay for last
  time where he tied her shoelaces for her and got rid of the frog from her shoe
  closet but really we know Komura is into legs so he already got everything
  back. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This guy will eat it all up either way, I meant the stew lol.
  Please, I hate vegetables yesterday I love them today if they were made by
  you. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Don't steal that line that was for my next date. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Speaking of, they did actually go on a date?? Well, likely as friends I don't
  think Mie-san sees him (get it?) that way yet haha this is too early to say,
  but yeah, hanging out outside as classmates though? I mean this guy's got a
  thing on her so I wouldn't even argue anything else already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They
  even got each other's <strike>LIME</strike> <strike>LINE</strike> social media
  contacts because damn the only contact I get is of electrical circuits lmao,
  so that you know, Mie-san can basically do SOS whenever she needs to ie. when
  she forgets her glasses, since all is well when you walk out of your house
  with your eyes closed without noticing anything wrong. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We also kind
  of learnt of why Mie-san doesn't want to tell her family about it. Well, I
  just hope Episode 12 isn't family problems. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Anyways, she is stuck
  somewhere so she asked Komura out... to help her haha we aren't there yet
  chill, and they went on what is practically a date even though Komura is
  leading Mie-san along the way so she can eat cake? AND THEN GET THE NEW
  GLASSES?? Hey, maybe she gotta eat the cake first, it is limited time only.
  Also limited might be you have to go as a couple. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And what's better,
  Mie-san also continued the date even though it's evidently obvious we're done
  because you know, she can see now haha. So yeah, tell me the girl isn't
  interested in you. Ironically, she hasn't figured out yet. Yeah, maybe use
  more of your senses to notice Komura over time and maaaaybe you'll figure
  something out yourself. Hey she's a middle schooler, give her time. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  All in all... Komura is as always so brave, so brave- It's the Mie-san Anime,
  dude, he said it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, maybe leave your glasses with him instead,
  he'll bring it to school. *taps brain* Also MVP plane- This series has a lot
  of good jokes, I'll tell you that much. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If you ask whether I will be
  concerned about the drawings in front of scenery graphics? Eh, I'll get used
  to that. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, I'm giving this alright. The theme songs are okay
  which isn't bothering me too much (Edit: The combinations though oh hey Ooishi
  Masayoshi it has been 3 months), it's kinda obvious they don't have many
  scenes to show so the plane for example haha, but I don't mind this is
  basically what the slice-of-life genre is feeding us all these years anyways.
  And moreover, there's everything else. Like seriously, you think Komura is the
  only one getting high with all these words coming out from a girl who doesn't
  know what she's saying as a middle schooler? DAUM BROTHER <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah then
  again #ThisFuckingVirgin is just so hyped up on this girl- I would argue that
  I have never held the hands of my crush so he wins. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I should stop
  watching these just to laugh at my lonely self haha more lonely self talk next
  week, yes? OH NO HE IS GOING TO BE LONELY WE HAVE COMPEITITION lmao
</div>

  [TL:DR; "This is also possible??" This series in a nutshell haha also Komura
  you don't wear glasses so SHUT UP lol]

  [My new glasses? I felt like it's a good time to relate to Mie-san now haha,
  mine is somewhat red and stylish, I kinda missed smaller lens as these will
  hit the top of my cheeks and make it oily lol, but you know how they suffer
  when fog comes up on their glasses? These fogless lens though... they just
  made it less censored lol it's like wipers on a car in the rain? Yeah haha
  also I like the excitement in Wakayama Shion in the

  <div>
    Oh boy did you just reuse the opening animation and burn Walter while you're
    at it? Okay good joke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new season where we picked up where
    we left off (#ShinigamiBocchan13), yeah it's just spending some time to
    recap what happened to the mothers, I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Well, Alice's mother
    is easy she is in some coffin where Dahlia is and that's still a mystery
    since the last time we saw that at the end of the first season, and
    Bocchan's mother... let's just say she is going to relief him off his duties
    either way whether his curse is removed or not. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> That sounds boring
    and all, but Bocchan still does want to be with Alice for as long as
    possible but with the physical contact part enabled, so maybe we should do
    something about the curse that was quick dropped on him when he turned 5. On
    side characters though, we finally get to see the circus Zain and Cuff were
    in, of course in disguise so people don't know they are witches and moreover
    that Cuff is also human too, they are still in good standing (get it?
    because the tightrope) being in the circus and making the other humans good
    money, so they are fine for now. Just the hard part is that Cuff isn't as
    free to be able to do what she wants, which apparently are to be by Zain's
    side aw we know that already girl, burn the mansion down using her fire
    powers because it's hard to not tell her to commit arson haha, and swim in
    the pool in the middle of winter? Okay girl, relax- And she took it off.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, as expected Alice gets to join in while Bocchan suffers from
    the heat because he's asked to observe lol why, but this is definitely
    giving us all the fanservice while making sure Zain is cut out of the action
    haha he doesn't deserve this, we all know. But he is deserving of the gift
    he entrusted Cuff to give Bocchan though, since that really is just a box of
    desires where once dropped into the box, it will expose your innermost
    desires- Ooooo haha I wonder why we didn't drop Alice in though. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    Okay for Bocchan's case though? Yeah, who cares about Alice-chan cosplay
    when it can be a wedding dress. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> That's too much spoilers I'm sorry
    haha that's the door to the script for the closing chapters of the manga
    lol, but damn I really hope that will happen someday, whenever it is, and
    not just cosplay or other desires. All in all... "sweet dreams", huh. Man, I
    hope this will not be just a sweet dream after another 12 more episodes,
    please and thanks. So far, it's definitely catching up to the lore and
    dumping us with more random stuff that is the life around Bocchan's mansion
    which again, isn't a bad thing at all just that every time they touch a bit
    of lore, they had to take a break- It's like me with work. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
    great episode we got to see everyone back again and yes learning about the
    desires of Zain and Bocchan is of great help haha what else is new, and
    maybe we can talk about the reality where Viola is still a sadist to the
    brother because I LIKE THAT LMAO see you then.

  OH SHIT KUNIKIDA GOT HIS HANDS CHOPPED?? BRUH is this even legal? Well,
  nothing is legal in this world of crime and fallacy so let's hop back in to
  another season of this hype stuff because man in this new episode
  (#BungouStrayDogs51) in case you need lore caught up because I've seen a bit
  of the manga beforehand haha I didn't cheat you would have watched this
  already. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yes, sorry for saying that I know a bit of the stuff
  ahead of time since I got really keen and very disturbed and can't sleep (lol)
  because I found out that Sigma is essentially alive and saved by Nicholas, but
  now we actually know why that is so. Not surprising, Nikolai is attempting to
  kill Fyodor for what a good friend that he is to listen to what he says about
  free will but you know, if you watched that gameplay footage of the video game
  "Starfield" where the guy takes out his gun to shoot the friend who brought
  him to the planet they stand on... you get the idea. Betrayal man, that's
  freedom. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Oh well don't teach the wrong stuff to kids, people. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  So at least we know there is some in-fighting at this point, and maybe assume
  these two are essentially dead, and since we aren't living in a world where
  people can detect spiritual energy haha me good reference to Anime
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach" target="_blank">"BLEACH"</a
  >, they are free to do... well whatever they have planned, but we don't have
  time for that! If you would recall this is still a story arc about how a story
  as been written (lol) and the Detective Agency is essentially screwed... or
  not, because and I keep forgetting this, is that the final page has been done.
  They cannot put more effort into it, just like my efforts to pass that open
  book exam I can't write more formulae I can reference. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Anyhow, which
  also means they can essentially take the story and make it theirs. So, about
  the Agency's "strongest man". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He saved Kunikida from some prison in
  which he was held hostage by the Hunting Dogs since he tried to kamikaze
  himself with the tip extending guy (hehe) and basically used him as a shield
  so that's cool he survived, but not for long since the other Hunting Dog is
  trying to give him a way out which is to join them, and that will go against
  his ideals slashed in half so... uh... maybe just die then lmao apart from
  waiting for the sniper who is going to get him? Haha, not that simple though,
  as with our resident doctor Yosano too who was heading for death, got out of
  it without a trace so that's weird, and Katai in a futon still stuck in
  protective custody even as a former member of the Agency, got sucked into some
  novel in a phone and I really thought he will die to an explosion, only to
  discover that it was like Poe's doing (I hope it's an easy mystery lol), so
  not surprising if you haven't figured out that, spoiler alert, Ranpo is behind
  all of this so far. Interesting, eh? His plan though, was to take the
  accusation of being terrorist at full force: To do the stuff the bag guys
  intend to do first. To be the victim and let the world prove them innocent.
  For starters, he will have to expose of the story written by the "page", so
  hey look at your trash bin the evidence is there lmao, and even if the world
  won't save him, the people whom he knew will, and ironically, the Angels won't
  be able to stop all of them. Not with Fyodor in jail essentially, not with the
  two who "died" and are free, who else is left... oh not the guy who is dead
  writing the final page, and lastly not even Kamui the leader of the Angels
  because his plan to assassinate the Agency members so they can put an end to
  this earlier and this will not be possible since Ranpo took some time but
  still did it first and that's the attempt from the "page"...? All in all, I
  cannot be more hyped than the theme song animations haha the opening animation
  reminded me of "BLEACH" actually I miss Aqua Timez already lol, and boy I have
  ZERO IDEA what will happen next. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Just put me on the rollercoaster
  ride and turn up the speed to max, baby! I don't know what is going to happen
  next anyways but who knows if Fyodor has anything else up his hands. If not,
  this might be a shorter season. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I highly doubt so, so maybe, we still
  have something we don't know about the final page.

  Yeah Mini-chan, this is quite an incident indeed. Hey, benefits of living next
  door, right? One would wonder how to put the new girl to be more involved in
  this drama series, and there you go. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though
  (#KanoKari26), thanks to one Sarashina Ruka-chan we are just outside Kazuya's
  apartment COOKING UP A STORM like a typhoon I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Gotta say
  though, Ruka-chan is EASILY convinced after Chizuru sat down with her to talk
  about what they have been doing behind her back lol, which really explains how
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/choroi" target="_blank">EASY</a> she is as a
  woman, really. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Come on, Kazuya is disappointed at the lack of future
  prospect of Ichinose omelette rice already. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Of course Ruka-chan is to
  be involved in this too, just so she can keep watch at this prospective couple
  which would otherwise break her heart if these two were to go flirt with each
  other or anything just like Chizuru's grandmother would have wanted. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Come on, we all want that ending, it's just better. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay Ruka-chan
  though, I will sacrifice herself so she won't be too sad crying over sad milk
  in front of the apartment... which Mini-chan saw. Uh oh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The thing is
  here though, as we have learnt shortly after if pulling guys into their
  apartments isn't a thing already lol remember Chizuru and what she did? Haha
  yeah, but this
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kouhai" target="_blank">kouhai</a> of a
  Mini-chan though... heck, everyone's hot in this series besides the dudes so
  let's just skim over that image analysis part lmao, she is what we would
  call... what do you call the new generation of millennials? *asks AI chatbot*
  Oh Gen Z, we still stuck there huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, yeah, she is totally
  that, and despite being a cosplayer and a streamer and everything, she isn't
  out there to take someone's boyfriend even if that guy technically is the
  boyfriend of two girls lol hey
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/186040/Naoya_Mukai" target="_blank"
    >Naoya from Anime "KanoKano"</a
  >
  I found a friend over here if you would like to know of him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> At this
  point, Mini-chan seems more than interested and enthusiastic of the drama that
  is unfolding in front of her like most of this series' audience demographic
  watching this so religiously this original work already is on their 32nd
  volume (we are still animating like, the 11th volume FYI haha HOW), so yeah,
  just that she is late to the party and is in fact, reading up on the latest
  chapter as we speak. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But she is right though, Kazuya is living the
  harem life like my bro intended him to be. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, looks like she is
  support role right now but unlike Ruka-chan who can give him sites to find
  scripts to use for the movie, this girl <em>miiiiight</em> be able to help us as
  an influencer. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> You will see where I get to from here now. I like to
  believe it's working in that direction, or else how we are going to expect
  this new girl here to join in the trash fire that is loving Kinoshita Kazuya,
  isn't it? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... man, this is quite a development, especially
  on the Kazuya side it would seem. Yeah, it's like Kazuya is going to act all
  mature and all with the movie production and Mini-chan
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31646/3-gatsu_no_Lion" target="_blank"
    >comes in like a lion</a
  >- Excuse me, lady cop? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, it feels like we have touched all the
  <strike>grass</strike> ground we can have with these girls for our main guy
  here haha, and since it doesn't take a lot to get it going even for Chizuru
  waiting at the balcony hehe, so let's see if this will get going at some point
  in the future. It's not about what anymore; It's more of a when thing now.

  Ah, it's a bright and sunny day for the actual day of the sports festival
  today in this lovely high school- Okay how many people are in the queue
  waiting to punch me now? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh at least 3? I'll take note. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In
  this new episode where the only people who aren't hyped are the ones with a
  problem lol (#HorimiyaPiece03), let's just talk about the ones without
  problems that somehow have them, yes? Haha that will be rough to tell, so
  might as well explain them all. Looks like we do get most if not all the cast
  in this sports festival haha no wonder everyone is involved besides Sengoku
  who is trying to evade as much as possible lmao that's how much he hates it,
  but in retrospect you have to wonder if it's because most of the motivation
  for the others comes from supporting and cheering for each other, as Ishikawa
  has pointed out actually. Which isn't a bad thing, ask me what the first half
  of my middle school fuel is back then, ask me. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, more
  obvious is the support of Miyamura to Hori-san despite being in different
  camps, and I guess is a
  <strike>goof</strike> good switch (lol great typo, me) between this and
  Remi-chan trying to provoke Hori-san with her boi on her team and causing epic
  chaos just like the little devil she is doing it at the start line, only for
  the other to actually realize this b*tch has a boyfriend already and no one
  wants to exchange a skinny dude with another so <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> haha both of them are
  going to beat me up is what I mean. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also people lining to beat me up
  are Yoshikawa and Hori-san again since their cheering is enough for you to
  want to seek death (lol) instead of pursue them because damn is their cheering
  portion just catered for the female audience who think they are damn cool, but
  we guys all know we are suddenly into Remi-chan and even (lol) Sakura-chan
  haha poor girl tbh, but damn cheerleader outfits are so typical it's just
  good. <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span> Haha okay moving on, we also got to see a cast of characters
  we would otherwise forget just like how
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> Yanagi
  forgot his glasses isn't turning anyone on, and Sawada (<strike>Honda</strike>
  "Honoka", Mocho, I remembered the full name haha <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>) failing at tug of war
  because why wouldn't she with her small build, and I swear there is so much
  more on Sengoku's shoulder I rather not talk about them and let Miyamura's
  side win since he's just more scheming and that's what you need in a sports
  festival anyways. Also, women. And maybe a suspicious teacher in case we
  placed that on the scavenger hunt as a tip. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, fantastic
  episode to showcase what is the variety and drama that is in Horimiya series
  in general, and yes, the jokes are half the reason and I think the other half
  has to be <strike>the theme songs</strike> the vibe that I get from the
  various couples... or not yet or never whatever you think, that is going
  between all of them that makes this so good of a slice-of-life series to
  watch, ignoring the romance. Don't let people stop you from watching what is
  re-telling of this tale because they didn't know this will sell so they just
  made another season of it just for us to fill our palate. Heck, it's going to
  be dark horse this season even, just like... I forgot who is mentioned already
  so yeah, it's that good! More next week!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  this is 2023 I am 15 years into watching Anime of course not- Miyamura got her
  though, got her real good haha

  P.P.S. "Everyone loves having someone root for them" Yeah, been wanting that
  for years, Ishikawa, so do they even exist? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> "I don't think I have
  really cheered for anyone or vice versa at a sports festival before" Miyamura
  can you not be <em>too</em> like me? Haha thanks<br />
  [F**king serious talk though? How are the theme songs in this series still
  winning most of the ones I watch this season? Especially the sequels, some of
  them just SUCKED- I am not going to name names see the next one I'll talk
  about <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> but <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> should I expect more- And that's why sequels suck
  lmao welcome to 2023 everybody let's move on to more SAKURA-CHAN!!! Haha]

  Actually strictly speaking, taking away their Bankai isn't just about taking
  away their hopes of fighting, but it's also limiting their potential. The
  latter part is what we want to see, so we can't let that happen, eh,
  Kubo-sensei? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode (#BLEACHTYBW15) where we dive
  straight into enemy territory or is that the reverse? I don't know though, but
  at least the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a> are
  somewhat prepared for the next invasion from the Quincies I suppose, now that
  they literally stepped on their territory which wasn't theirs to begin with?
  Very confusing, so let's talk about what we know. Eh, uh, maybe we start from
  each squad, this is really troublesome, what did I just say? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> 1st
  Squad, they not doing too well after seeing the appearance of Haschwalth and
  literally just protecting themselves from a barrier more better used to teach
  the others, but then again not like everyone is Kido proficient like
  Nanao-chan here and keeping the Head Captain alive is kind of a manta since
  the previous one died in the enemy's hands so, uh... yeah, Renji can't Kido,
  we understand. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyhow, 2nd Squad. So brave, (Oomaeda) Marechiyo, but
  not as brave as his little sister because damn all he does is get rinsed by
  the enemy at this point, I rather see him cry as much as his family does for
  him at this rate but don't worry, not Yoruichi is here to save the day haha.
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Soifon though, at least did try to improve her Shunko to fight his
  enemy bare-handed and with speed, probably isn't playing this fast game fast
  enough than the enemy can crush her, so I wouldn't expect this to last too
  long, and he just pierced her arm so even her double-KO move will not work
  now. Then again I don't know where to piece this dude? Excuse me but where is
  <strike>his</strike> their heart though? <span class="emoji" title="🤷">*shrugs*</span> Moving on, uh... I guess
  10th Squad? Yeah, Hitsugaya and Matsumoto tag teamed what looks like things
  that will only happen in this series' own line of video games by the way, had
  to come up with new way to play with his ice (lmao) so that it can withstand
  something coming along their way. Bad news, first up is fire and without even
  one of his specialised fingers is already enough to play with his toy, let
  alone play till TWO fingers enough to slice him in half. BRO GIVE THIS KID A
  CHANCE <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And last but not least 12th Squad since Mayuri is just beaming
  with light again, learnt that Quincies stay in the shadows so at least he was
  the only wise one keeping his own lab covered in light
  <strike>so Kyoraku can't use his shikai on him</strike> so the enemy won't
  drop a fast one on him... not unless you're Askin who doesn't give a damn lest
  you fall into his (spoiler alert) poison trap first. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All too
  scheming, and unless you're in a training shed praying to the gods like 13th
  Squad's Ukitake and I promise you I am not joking on that haha, seems like
  everything is going as badly as we have expected, so yay? THANK GOODNESS dear
  Urahara-sensei is here to save the day, you plebs. Jeez, how are you going to
  live without my sensei here, honestly? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> My ear kinda tickles though.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I hope this is a general introduction to the fights we
  are expecting, and we will be focusing on each of them starting next week, I
  hope. It's hard to catch up switching between half a dozen channels at once to
  be frank. Yeah, doing animation just like the good ol' days- Can we not have
  that though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And looks like everything is going according to plan if
  you would recall what Haschwalth said as he took from Yhwach so uh... yeah!
  More of those soon I guess. I really cannot spoil anything though but yeah,
  everyone being able to go all out will be great as said from the beginning,
  dear Anime, if you don't mind. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you then.

  I kinda forced myself into listening more songs this week, really experiencing
  burnout here so maybe I should tone it down for a bit, I can do with better
  songs than those given on a whim, me. Earlier this week though, I gave a
  listen to the newer tunes on Apple Music and found out about

  which isn't bad but not enough for me to give a nod, mainly because I also
  found out that

    >out on streaming</a
  >, so I was just focused on giving that instead. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, some track
  was 12 minutes long, mind you. Later in the week, through a bunch of rock
  festival videos released recently, I have my chance to listen to

      target="_blank"
      >w.o.d's new song from earlier this year</a

  and it isn't too bad so I'm giving it just as initiation to be honest. And
  then I also listened to more of

    target="_blank"
    >their debut EP</a

  a chance because why not, and am kinda used to their style especially on the
  newer release so yeah you bet I will listen to more Kouno Marika. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  (Yeah, remember that they sang a song with her for a movie) And thanks to a
  livestream on Friday, <b>Yogee New Waves' live from last year</b> revealed a

  and I promise you I will not spam more of these if it isn't the actual song.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> The Amazon gift is pretty cute shows whole body. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe I
  should stop doing this segment after all; They want me to talk about EVERY
  SINGLE SONG- every single song I will reject. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  So for next week we have a bunch of releases to give which might just be the
  peak season for the month. We have great music if you aren't into those I
  understand but I know

  and I hope this isn't too disappointing considering I never give too much in
  these anyways I hardly even want to give the title song already. And we have
  mainstream songs which is of course chef's kiss,

    >YUUKI AOI POSTED ON INSTAGRAM ABOUT HER LIPS</a
  >
  LET'S GO haha get it because Twitter only her used this account to post
  Stories so far and posted recently about not herself so this is a surprise.
  (Note to Aoi-chan: I need more of this hehe) On other news, damn am I glad the
  new package will arrive next week when I'm at home (hehe) but then again it's
  still kind of a mess as
  <span style="font-size: x-small;"
    >I just placed an order from the same store where I got some Ayachi bromides
    eatlier (spoiler alert haha) which will be in the upcoming one, then could
    otherwise be delayed if I didn't order from Koko-chan's online store later
    and put Akarin's batch in with Ayachi so I- You won't understand how much I
    did to make sure packages made sense.</span

  Remember the one time I only shipped Inorin fanclub's newsletter worth 1yen,
  me? Haha those were the times, just make that mistake again. We'll talk more
  about that next week though, I still am worrying about how to orchestrate this
  though so... I don't know my head hurts. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you guys next time then,
  and until next time... maybe I stop buying stuff off Japan's internet.
