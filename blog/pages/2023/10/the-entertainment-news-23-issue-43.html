Oh yeah, I spent my weekday nights watching back "B Gata H Kei" again to jog my
memory and uh... it's probably better that I forgot lol there's Kana-chan with
rack though if that makes her feel any better <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  Hey, next week we are practically signalling the end of another month, we
  won't be ending with Halloween though I only treat myself because we will end
  it in style!! Once again determined by the one package yes this is the second
  one this month, but along with a lot of new stuff in place including a new
  phone <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, expect production quality to SKYROCKET in the year of our lord
  2023 where I type my reactions on a static website instead of whatever my
  friends were doing investing on grading Pokémon trading cards to sell and
  showing them off to that rich school kid.

  Yeah, Shino loves being an&nbsp;<a href="roshutsu" target="_blank"
    >exhibitionist</a
  >, what of it? Haha ah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we better refrain
  from hentai genres lol there are only accidents (#KanoKano15), we are kissing
  Naoya? Or is it the other way around? Anyways, we want it now!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Says
  Shion for her friend, because damn do they need to watch at least the final
  episode of the first season of "RikeKoi": You need the perfect atmosphere to
  kiss, dude! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Alright, the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hanabitaikai" target="_blank"
    >fireworks festival</a
  >. Well, with Shino staying with her in the long run, it isn't too surprising
  that she found out more of the progress of their relationship. Uh, that is
  between Saki and Naoya, by the way, we should be clear about that. Haha
  anyways, because they haven't kissed. Remember the first kiss of Naoya
  literally being stolen by some yellow-haired b*tch? Yeah, that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Shino
  is obviously worried since her friend doesn't get the edge on this two-timing
  relationship and also her backstory if you would recall, also she knew the
  friend will never be ready for one, so why not just do it now? In front of all
  of them? In the house at broad daylight? In case you wondered where's the mood
  though, Naoya was quick to set up one, but damn, did the other girls still
  have to witness it. So yeah, not possible, huh. Again, consult the scientists
  in "RikeKoi", they know what's up. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Moving on, the actual festival is
  here, and many things happened. We are not getting the kiss this episode, no,
  but we did manage to grope <strike>Rieri</strike> Shino-san on her flat chest
  and butt again, so I think this is a win. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> (Yes, I'm recording those
  lines down, totally) (Takahashi Rie I am not sorry hehe) This is because, as
  you would have known and now declared by Saki for some reason, Shino is kind
  of a klutz in terms of doing stuff in front of (I assume) guys and not
  remembering her composure, resulting her in various types of... uneasy
  situations, I would say. Or maybe just she just wants to get attention haha
  because despite her wanting Naoya to spend more time with her friend instead
  of her or some kid who got lost lmao, Naoya still went all out in... well
  everything that happened in front of his eyes, so that's kind of disturbing
  since even Milika who stood in his way gets to have some of his attention.
  I'll just punch her in the face if I were him. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't have to, my
  V-shield repels women who come close. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> So yeah, dealing with Shino was a
  joy maybe, dealing with Milika is only going to keep giving her false hope but
  she is definitely far away from the queue at this point considering Saki's
  friend wants him to stay true to <em>el primo</em> but then ended up accepting
  another woman. I mean, ask Rentarou from "Hyakkano" how <em>he</em> feels now,
  for a change. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, at least Nagisa is here to ensure everyone's
  chances on Naoya's time is equally distributed sonar the two of them (apart
  from accidents arising from Shino and Milika's interventions lol) so we shall
  see what next episode entails. All in all though, I like the episodes on this
  second season so far. Not much of a drag, it does have its serious moments
  unlike the the author's previous work lol, and yeah, each character is just
  clearly defined in their circumstances and objectives, it makes the main girl
  look pale in comparison to be honest. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Don't worry Saki-chan, as
  Naoya mentioned you are still cute and attractive. That's good enough all the
  food is on me lmao LET'S GOOO <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  [TL:DR; Is that the first time in 15 years of me watching Anime that they told
  me to not watch the next episode? NOW I gotta watch it out of spite lol
  gotcha]

  No seriously though, I can just start at Grade 1, I'll work my way up,
  probably more interesting than the newest cloud programming course. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  In this new episode where I don't know if I can make the landing on this
  (#UnderNinja03), man, how am I still not getting what is happening here?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, let's talk about the flashback, we have a lot to talk about
  here now that contact is made. So, let's talk about July that year instead of
  the actual fight that is going on since the opponent side has already lost
  pretty much. I think. Moving on, basically if you would recall, Kuro got
  assigned a task to catch some Russian assassin who has been roaming around
  Japan searching for ninja on his boss' orders or else he will never see his
  daughter again (not like he will even if he succeeds but), is now basically
  under cover at the temple because after what he did to that old man which I
  rather not recall meeting. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Regardless, Katou has contacted Kuro back
  then to finish the job and get the foreigner dead of alive, so he took light
  of the opportunity where there was a resident bra stealer around town, and
  told him he will show him more of the housemate Kadowa-san (lol) and her skin
  (lmao) in exchange for the sighting of the foreigner. Point taken, not that
  hard, but since the kid was lazy to even go to high school at this point, he
  entrusted the task to the little girl who in turn gets to play with his drone
  which he used to... uh, spy at people sometimes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways this show is
  weird, but nonetheless, and that is how the foreigner is found at the
  apartment, and the team was tasked to take him down. Interestingly, this is
  where we finally start to talk about everyone else in the team besides Kuro on
  the rooftops, other than that kid with a laser firing teddy bear lol. Suzuki
  was known for fighting another infamous foreigner years ago but now is working
  as an editor in a publishing company? (Too real though, praising the author
  and then telling him to rewrite lol) (In case you aren't in the industry,
  editors tend to make authors change their stance in certain storytelling to
  appeal to a larger audience or to prevent re-edits lest they get flagged for
  inappropriate content) But yeah, she suddenly got wind of the assignment which
  is literally at the building she is in so nice she gets to start first, but
  almost got herself in a rut mainly because that drone was involved which
  complicated the attack, it seems. And yes, that guy with long hair Hibi showed
  up. I guess we will know of him in due time since they are all in one gang
  anyways, but yeah, we did see more ninja gear modernized for the new era it
  seems, from tazers to airbag designed hoodies which are fairly interesting to
  use in various situations, somehow still is winning over that one Russian who
  just keeps using bullets on a makeshift gun because when did you see real guns
  in Japan? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Don't! Don't. No. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> RIP Abe. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> All in all I
  think this is a fun episode, lots of things to look forward to, so I'm still
  in on this I guess, maybe not for long though. Don't' know what to make of the
  future of watching this series though, I really wish there will be more
  intense fights, but the one with Suzuki wasn't too bad. I take subtlety and
  drinking beers with a woman who doesn't turn me on a thing in this, I suppose.

  What, you think it's "the" bra where there's only one? These things are cheap

  "The First Kiss" (1990)?? WE KNOW
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmHn1UCT7w" target="_blank"
    >the Kisara version</a
  >
  was better- I'm just glad I never listened to the originals and just the
  covers, we know those are better. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I should
  stop laughing at my own jokes lmao (#Hyakkano02), we continue on the antics
  between the two girls and one guy because you know, we can't have only ONE
  episode when we have TWO girls, right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See, one girl totals one
  episode. This logic works, just learn some math and watch this again. Yeah no
  really, especially the kissing part, it's only getting more complicated if you
  think about it. But then again, looks like this is basically the whole episode
  if you think about it, because of course when you date you gotta kiss...
  right? I mean, that was typically on like the fourth date or something? Don't
  quote on me I'm still a virgin. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Moving on, and with all the story set
  up which I would prompt you to understand it yourself especially the vice
  principal with the habit of kissing male students...? Uh, I'll crawl on the
  hallways, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Ah hey, crawl also can be at Mach speed, didn't
  you see how they do it at &lt;insert high school comedy series here&gt;) Let's
  determine who has the first kiss! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, if they both really
  x5 love you (lol not going to waste writing space here), who is going to let
  way? So let me guess, let me guess- <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's

    >the vice principal</a
  >
  who got it first, right? On Rentarou? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh boy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, as
  much as Karane-chan (hehe) is easy to read, we also know from Hanazono that
  she is super desperate in getting his first in her (lmao sex joke) but yeah
  that's where the guy suggested to do something on the rooftops: Devise a super
  detailed plan to ensure we get the illusion of the first kiss from all
  parties. Yep, all three of them. Even the guy won't know who he kissed first.
  <em>The perfect plan.</em> <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Call me dumb but this is why there can be as
  many accidents on this than one can predict so I'm not going to blame the cat
  here just because it is MVP. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, just call on the two friends you
  have, Rentarou, let them help. Then if they want one of them just say you can
  give them a spare. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways jokes aside I don't want any of them to die
  either, as you would expect things didn't go too well, and the girls
  eventually settled on kissing half of his lips... and each others too while
  we're at it. (Hehe you know, set up the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yuri" target="_blank">yuri</a> subplot while
  we are at it) Just... just do it quickly already, the third girl is gonna
  appear soon. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I'm still laughing off my belly and not
  fainted due to my heart pounding all around thinking of Hondo Kaede and Tomita
  Miyu, so I think we can continue as far as I can make it, hopefully till the
  final episode. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What more do you even want me to say anyways? If you
  think you have seen formulae for Double Integration, wait till you have to
  deal with Triple Integration, ladies and gentlemen. That's... an Engineering
  Math joke. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Apart from that though, you would be glad to know that if
  you haven't gotten bored of romance antics yet, and if

  isn't quite enough for you with that idiot, we got another idiot (lmao) to
  deal with here, so this might be on your alley too if you liked the
  <strike>characters</strike> voice behind those characters as much as I do.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Next episode looks like we are introduced to the new girl and boy do
  I know the voice behind her too hehe, so let's see if she is ever going to
  sound matured enough that I will fall in love with her for real. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Yeah no way, I got the hotline on the cops ready this is definitely going to
  be a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rorikon" target="_blank">lolicon</a> run and
  this isn't even the only one lmao *dials on phone*

  Well, if you want to know how "KanoKano" is different from this "Hyakkano",
  all I can tell you is that the former deals with some conflict with each girl
  having their own objectives and all, and the latter will not be dealing with
  conflict as they slowly focus on bonding the girls together to work towards
  something for the guy, if you understand what I mean. So yeah, pick your
  choice, dude. We got genre types for days over here in the Animeverse hehe

  from a week ago, honestly. If you wondered what I listened to that was new in
  my library this week though, and that's why I was clearing live videos from my
  backlog and I swear I have heard of them years ago, but congrats

  for joining in the ranks with your most popular song, I guess. Yeah, what did
  I say about listening to songs from 2 years ago? I'm getting old haha
</div>

  <br />Well, we always start with Nan-chan now on news considering I'm doing
  this *kinda* chronologically every week in news about music from social media,
  so let's!

  which was the title song for her upcoming album next month is alright but damn
  is this kind of a disappointment of a video (also unoriginal, did you see OGRE
  YOU ASSHOLE form 2009?) after what was Asakura Momo's from the same talent
  agency. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on, there's also

  which if you would recall is for an Anime I almost want to watch this season
  but it doesn't matter, I might as well give the song instead when it's out,
  it's just easier to give.<br />
  <br />There will be a lot to give next week in music by the way, specifically
  music because <b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new album</b> will be released by then even
  though we have heard almost all of the tunes already. I will also listen to
  <b>Kotobuki Minako's new EP</b> and boy it has been a while so I will enjoy
  some Rock songs as if I haven't gotten enough of them, and her. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And
  of course, this will be the first time I catch up with

  for Anime "Under Ninja" so if you didn't see me talking about THE ORAL

  don't ask me why, I'm busy. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span><br />

  I feel like I should do a round-up of all the Halloween costumes in the
  livestreams for the week since it's kicking off already and maybe for the next
  couple of weekly posts here so that I can refer back to them later. But yeah,
  just a good excuse for me to talk about Kanno Mai's monthly (paid) livestream
  where

    >she dressed up in a cat maid outfit!</a
  >
  Oh boy it was so cute, the "nyan" in the live was just fanservice as unwilling
  as she was to do them, and we humbly thank her for that. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also on
  that Thursday though, I also saw

    >Lynn-san's livestream with Sakuraba Arisa</a

  which damn seeing them play that vibration Jenga and somehow hearing the
  latter squeal sure is getting something going in me. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Sorry Lynn-san!
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> More coming up next week I guess as we get closer to the most
  exciting week of the month just because, since I also had to clear time off
  and chose to end next Friday early! YES next week will be the best week ever.
  Or worst. Or maybe this is as much as I will do in life anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See
  you guys next week then lol, and until next time... maybe I go back and watch
  how MaiMai turned from doing all the cute poses as if she was in a maid café
  and being cute to taking a break within 10 seconds lmao she is such a reality
  charm I can't even
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. I think as supplementary material (lmao) that since I'm watching lesser
  shows this season, I shall tune in regularly to the
  <a href="https://www.onsen.ag/program/hyakkano_radio" target="_blank"
    >"Hyakkano Radio"</a
  >
  which airs every Friday (with archives thereafter) every week, aligning to the
  episode number since I also watch on delay anyways. For this week,

  >&nbsp;with fan suggestions which boy was it awesome and I may have to record
  them down as the simp I am so I can set some of these as my alarm or
  something- I need better ideas haha
