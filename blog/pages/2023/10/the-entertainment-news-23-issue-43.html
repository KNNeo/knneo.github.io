Once again determined by the one package yes this is the second one this month, but along with a lot of new stuff in place including a new phone <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, expect production quality to SKYROCKET in the year of our lord 2023 where I type my reactions on a static website instead of whatever my friends were doing investing on grading Pokémon trading cards to sell and showing them off to that rich school kid.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Who freaking cares I enjoyed this more and the others did seem surprised when I handed over one of the MaiMai dupes (lmao) to my bro so I WIN I GUESS HAHA okay Anime and music for the week now!<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanoKano15><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Kanojo mo Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Shino's a natural born accidental pervert!" Oh boy haha you sure SakiSaki here is your friend?</div></blockquote>Yeah, Shino loves being an <a href=roshutsu target=_blank>exhibitionist</a>, what of it? Haha ah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we better refrain from hentai genres lol there are only accidents (#KanoKano15), we are kissing Naoya? Or is it the other way around? Anyways, we want it now!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Says Shion for her friend, because damn do they need to watch at least the final episode of the first season of "RikeKoi": You need the perfect atmosphere to kiss, dude! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Alright, the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hanabitaikai target=_blank>fireworks festival</a>. Well, with Shino staying with her in the long run, it isn't too surprising that she found out more of the progress of their relationship. Uh, that is between Saki and Naoya, by the way, we should be clear about that. Haha anyways, because they haven't kissed. Remember the first kiss of Naoya literally being stolen by some yellow-haired b*tch? Yeah, that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Shino is obviously worried since her friend doesn't get the edge on this two-timing relationship and also her backstory if you would recall, also she knew the friend will never be ready for one, so why not just do it now? In front of all of them? In the house at broad daylight? In case you wondered where's the mood though, Naoya was quick to set up one, but damn, did the other girls still have to witness it. So yeah, not possible, huh. Again, consult the scientists in "RikeKoi", they know what's up. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Moving on, the actual festival is here, and many things happened. We are not getting the kiss this episode, no, but we did manage to grope <strike>Rieri</strike> Shino-san on her flat chest and butt again, so I think this is a win. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> (Yes, I'm recording those lines down, totally) (Takahashi Rie I am not sorry hehe) This is because, as you would have known and now declared by Saki for some reason, Shino is kind of a klutz in terms of doing stuff in front of (I assume) guys and not remembering her composure, resulting her in various types of... uneasy situations, I would say. Or maybe just she just wants to get attention haha because despite her wanting Naoya to spend more time with her friend instead of her or some kid who got lost lmao, Naoya still went all out in... well everything that happened in front of his eyes, so that's kind of disturbing since even Milika who stood in his way gets to have some of his attention. I'll just punch her in the face if I were him. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't have to, my V-shield repels women who come close. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> So yeah, dealing with Shino was a joy maybe, dealing with Milika is only going to keep giving her false hope but she is definitely far away from the queue at this point considering Saki's friend wants him to stay true to <em>el primo</em> but then ended up accepting another woman. I mean, ask Rentarou from "Hyakkano" how <em>he</em> feels now, for a change. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, at least Nagisa is here to ensure everyone's chances on Naoya's time is equally distributed sonar the two of them (apart from accidents arising from Shino and Milika's interventions lol) so we shall see what next episode entails. All in all though, I like the episodes on this second season so far. Not much of a drag, it does have its serious moments unlike the the author's previous work lol, and yeah, each character is just clearly defined in their circumstances and objectives, it makes the main girl look pale in comparison to be honest. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Don't worry Saki-chan, as Naoya mentioned you are still cute and attractive. That's good enough all the food is on me lmao LET'S GOOO <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; Is that the first time in 15 years of me watching Anime that they told me to not watch the next episode?

It's called "Grade 2 Operator in Romance Entanglement Actions" now" How do I get certification on that? Asking for a friend <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>No seriously though, I can just start at Grade 1, I'll work my way up, probably more interesting than the newest cloud programming course. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where I don't know if I can make the landing on this (#UnderNinja03), man, how am I still not getting what is happening here? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, let's talk about the flashback, we have a lot to talk about here now that contact is made. So, let's talk about July that year instead of the actual fight that is going on since the opponent side has already lost pretty much. I think. Moving on, basically if you would recall, Kuro got assigned a task to catch some Russian assassin who has been roaming around Japan searching for ninja on his boss' orders or else he will never see his daughter again (not like he will even if he succeeds but), is now basically under cover at the temple because after what he did to that old man which I rather not recall meeting. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Regardless, Katou has contacted Kuro back then to finish the job and get the foreigner dead of alive, so he took light of the opportunity where there was a resident bra stealer around town, and told him he will show him more of the housemate Kadowa-san (lol) and her skin (lmao) in exchange for the sighting of the foreigner. Point taken, not that hard, but since the kid was lazy to even go to high school at this point, he entrusted the task to the little girl who in turn gets to play with his drone which he used to... uh, spy at people sometimes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways this show is weird, but nonetheless, and that is how the foreigner is found at the apartment, and the team was tasked to take him down. Interestingly, this is where we finally start to talk about everyone else in the team besides Kuro on the rooftops, other than that kid with a laser firing teddy bear lol. Suzuki was known for fighting another infamous foreigner years ago but now is working as an editor in a publishing company? (Too real though, praising the author and then telling him to rewrite lol) (In case you aren't in the industry, editors tend to make authors change their stance in certain storytelling to appeal to a larger audience or to prevent re-edits lest they get flagged for inappropriate content) But yeah, she suddenly got wind of the assignment which is literally at the building she is in so nice she gets to start first, but almost got herself in a rut mainly because that drone was involved which complicated the attack, it seems. And yes, that guy with long hair Hibi showed up. I guess we will know of him in due time since they are all in one gang anyways, but yeah, we did see more ninja gear modernized for the new era it seems, from tazers to airbag designed hoodies which are fairly interesting to use in various situations, somehow still is winning over that one Russian who just keeps using bullets on a makeshift gun because when did you see real guns in Japan? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Don't! Don't. No. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> RIP Abe. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> All in all I think this is a fun episode, lots of things to look forward to, so I'm still in on this I guess, maybe not for long though. Don't' know what to make of the future of watching this series though, I really wish there will be more intense fights, but the one with Suzuki wasn't too bad. I take subtlety and drinking beers with a woman who doesn't turn me on a thing in this, I suppose. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "The thing about tech is you can't rely on it at the heat of the moment, when your life is on the line" Why does this Anime have the best quotes?

WE KNOW <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmHn1UCT7w" target=_blank>the Kisara version</a> was better- I'm just glad I never listened to the originals and just the covers, we know those are better. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I should stop laughing at my own jokes lmao (#Hyakkano02), we continue on the antics between the two girls and one guy because you know, we can't have only ONE episode when we have TWO girls, right? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See, one girl totals one episode. This logic works, just learn some math and watch this again. Yeah no really, especially the kissing part, it's only getting more complicated if you think about it. But then again, looks like this is basically the whole episode if you think about it, because of course when you date you gotta kiss... right? I mean, that was typically on like the fourth date or something? Don't quote on me I'm still a virgin. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, and with all the story set up which I would prompt you to understand it yourself especially the vice principal with the habit of kissing male students...? Uh, I'll crawl on the hallways, thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Ah hey, crawl also can be at Mach speed, didn't you see how they do it at &lt;insert high school comedy series here>) Let's determine who has the first kiss! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, if they both really x5 love you (lol not going to waste writing space here), who is going to let way? So let me guess, let me guess- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's <a href="https://x.com/hyakkano_anime/status/1713565390402642051?s=20" target=_blank>the vice principal</a> who got it first, right? On Rentarou? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh boy. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, as much as Karane-chan (hehe) is easy to read, we also know from Hanazono that she is super desperate in getting his first in her (lmao sex joke) but yeah that's where the guy suggested to do something on the rooftops: Devise a super detailed plan to ensure we get the illusion of the first kiss from all parties. Yep, all three of them. Even the guy won't know who he kissed first. <em>The perfect plan.</em> <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Call me dumb but this is why there can be as many accidents on this than one can predict so I'm not going to blame the cat here just because it is MVP. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, just call on the two friends you have, Rentarou, let them help. Then if they want one of them just say you can give them a spare. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways jokes aside I don't want any of them to die either, as you would expect things didn't go too well, and the girls eventually settled on kissing half of his lips... and each others too while we're at it.

Yeah, what did I say about listening to songs from 2 years ago? I'm getting old haha</div><div><br>Well, we always start with Nan-chan now on news considering I'm doing this *kinda* chronologically every week in news about music from social media, so let's! <b><a href="https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1713857326405288030?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new music video</a></b> which was the title song for her upcoming album next month is alright but damn is this kind of a disappointment of a video (also unoriginal, did you see OGRE YOU ASSHOLE form 2009?) after what was Asakura Momo's from the same talent agency. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on, there's also <a href="https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1713872422439625109?s=20" target=_blank><b>a new song reveal</b></a> too if you fancy that. <b><a href="https://x.com/oral_official/status/1713902864228299049?s=20" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new song releases next week</a></b> and I think I will take a listen next week if the schedule isn't already packed and damn I am already pulling away from their newest songs unless you think <a href="https://x.com/oral_official/status/1714657589756346485?s=20" target=_blank>a teaser video</a> will help you make that decision. <b><a href="https://x.com/gincle_cho/status/1714243609443127764?s=20" target=_blank>yuiko was a guest vocalist in what I assume is a doujin music artist</a></b> like her so to show her support, I guess, this is quite a duet song. <b><a href="https://x.com/Finlands12/status/1714612299112014332?s=20" target=_blank>FINLANDS' new music video</a></b> is for a song from a single released this week I didn't give, so hey, not like their music videos will change my mind anyways. <b><a href="https://x.com/miyustaff/status/1714567002881507432?s=20" target=_blank>Tomita Miyu is releasing a new song on her birthday next month</a></b> for her 5th anniversary as a music artist (oh damn and so it is, her 1st single was for Anime that I watched) and interestingly they also revealed a new album release next year so yay more Miyu-chan! <b><a href="https://x.com/honkidance/status/1714627606719652026?s=20" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance's new music video with Kenmochi Hidefumi</a></b> won't change my mind I still didn't enjoy that song anyways. The video is cool though, colour cool. Oh this is not Japanese but the only Australian band I listen to <a href="https://x.com/stereogum/status/1714656089503871197?s=20" target=_blank><b>Middle Kids is releasing a new album</b></a>... thank goodness it's next year since my schedule is packed for the rest of this year. <a href="https://x.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1715235916640620633?s=20" style=font-weight:bold target=_blank>ClariS is going to release their full music video library to celebrate their 13th anniversary</a>(?) which obviously only includes those with the Clara and Karen combination so don't expect their 1st ever music video to surface online... officially haha there's fan uploads. Also not going to give <b><a href="https://x.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1715363071563350337?s=20" target=_blank>their new music video</a></b> despite the scientist dress-up and stuff because damn I still will never get over the awkward pauses in songs these days. <b><a href="https://x.com/lounge666/status/1715337067033477188?s=20" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE's new music video</a></b> is for their new album song which I didn't give so whatever lol. <b><a href="https://x.com/_YuNiofficial_/status/1715670995447791726?s=20" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's collaboration cover song with doujin music artist YuNi</a></b> who you might recall sang for Anime "Uzaki-chan" before, is from a song I have loved all these years, and it just got cuter. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1715925949034963318?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single will be released in December</a></b> which if you would recall is for an Anime I almost want to watch this season but it doesn't matter, I might as well give the song instead when it's out, it's just easier to give.<br><br>There will be a lot to give next week in music by the way, specifically music because <b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new album</b> will be released by then even though we have heard almost all of the tunes already. I will also listen to <b>Kotobuki Minako's new EP</b> and boy it has been a while so I will enjoy some Rock songs as if I haven't gotten enough of them, and her. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And of course, this will be the first time I catch up with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hyper-ep/1708528255?l=en-US" target=_blank>Kroi's 1st single</a></b> for Anime "Under Ninja" so if you didn't see me talking about THE ORAL CIGARETTES, Fujifabric or even amazarashi who are releasing songs next week don't ask me why, I'm busy. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span><br><br><br><br><br> I feel like I should do a round-up of all the Halloween costumes in the livestreams for the week since it's kicking off already and maybe for the next couple of weekly posts here so that I can refer back to them later. But yeah, just a good excuse for me to talk about Kanno Mai's monthly (paid) livestream where <a href="https://x.com/heihei_kissa/status/1715033885183266955?s=20" target=_blank>she dressed up in a cat maid outfit!</a> Oh boy it was so cute, the "nyan" in the live was just fanservice as unwilling as she was to do them, and we humbly thank her for that. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also on that Thursday though, I also saw <a href="https://x.com/daberi_ba/status/1715249126823297526?s=20" target=_blank>Lynn-san's livestream with Sakuraba Arisa</a> which damn seeing them play that vibration Jenga and somehow hearing the latter squeal sure is getting something going in me. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Sorry Lynn-san! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> More coming up next week I guess as we get closer to the most exciting week of the month just because, since I also had to clear time off and chose to end next Friday early! YES next week will be the best week ever. Or worst. Or maybe this is as much as I will do in life anyways. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> See you guys next week then lol, and until next time... maybe I go back and watch how MaiMai turned from doing all the cute poses as if she was in a maid café and being cute to taking a break within 10 seconds lmao she is such a reality charm I can't even</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I think as supplementary material (lmao) that since I'm watching lesser shows this season, I shall tune in regularly to the <a href=https://www.onsen.ag/program/hyakkano_radio target=_blank>"Hyakkano Radio"</a> which airs every Friday (with archives thereafter) every week, aligning to the episode number since I also watch on delay anyways. For this week, <a href="https://x.com/hyakkano_anime/status/1715593758627279120?s=20" target=_blank>they started their ASMR segment</a> with fan suggestions which boy was it awesome and I may have to record them down as the simp I am so I can set some of these as my alarm or something- I need better ideas haha</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
