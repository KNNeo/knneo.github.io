  Damn, when they make me do reviews they make me do them all month!! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Well almost, I totally could've done one every week though.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Yes, we are back and just in time before the end of the month! This is not
  scary at all I promise you because unsurprisingly, we are back 4 years after
  we have left her in the ditch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, I didn't I promise you, but it
  did take this long for me to review another one of her singles again. Thanks
  Anime, I may not have watched you but you did give me a fabulous ending theme
  song I can't even. *winks*

<div>
  (You see, if you want her to look back at you, you have to pay for the more
  expensive Limited Edition. Idolism in a nutshell, by the way. I'm just
  grateful for the close-ups.)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: I think many of us do not know of her from her songs, but might have
  known of her through Anime. Being a voice actress from the days I knew of her
  voicing in romance stories I liked, to singing super cool songs to please,
  Kitou Akari has all the talent. And I think this is a long time coming just
  because, when we finally have an excuse to let her sing love songs through and
  through, she is once again singing for Anime since she started in 2019, but
  now putting her adorable image on the line. This time around, this is
  undoubtedly the love song single and do not let the title deceive you, and we
  shall talk about what makes this work special.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (1) Magie x Magie [Trans.:
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/majimaji" target="_blank">Unblinkingly</a>]
</div>
<div>From the first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "(I) wish (you) would like me back the same
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Even if (you) are constantly hesitating</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    The (idea, that we) both like each other
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (If) wish came true (doesn't) that count as love?"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  I think my first impression of this song wasn't from the music video which is
  basically fanservice, so I can talk about what's good about it. It's a love
  song, for starters, and it's a catchy tune thanks to Arte Refact (this single
  is composed and produced by them too), and most important of all, thanks to
  the lyricist for coming up with lyrics to make us love Kitou Akari all over
  again. With the word "like" sprinkled all over the place it really feels like
  overkill, but with meaning, this suddenly becomes more than a song of
  flirting, as reflected by the Anime it is credited on where the main girl has
  a crush on the main guy who she has known for a long time. The bridge might be
  a little long, little imperfections here and there, but overall, she sung it
  cutely and I have been liking this song as much as it liked itself, I think it
  has delivered the message. The music video is basically the artist in person
  showing all her love on camera, and I cannot thank that enough.

<div>Rating: Lovingly Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Afterglow</div>
<div>From the first verse:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "The reason (our) eye sights entwined (was) coincidence
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Reason(s) other than that</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Because thinking about (otherwise) is pointless
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">It is coincidence (and) that is fine"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  As usual, the B-side is what makes of this single a whole, and I think this is
  easily one of the most complete feels I can give on a love song: the feels of
  sunset, the feelings of love growing uncertainly, and everything else in
  between. Clearly this song's lyrics talk about a maiden falling in love over
  time, and afraid to show her feelings. This cannot get better than that, I
  know this is rather typical to tackle on such a theme for a song, but the
  lyrics just makes it all the more complementary than it should have. The
  melody overall is sweet to listen to, it has a short bridge part which turns
  everything around even in terms of the lyrics which might have been excessive
  in those extra notes in the melody, but I just adore the general chill feels,
  so that's good enough for me.
</div>
<div>Rating: Sweetly Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: If you are a fan of Kitou Akari, you will love this single as much
  as I do. If you aren't, I feel like this also captured the Anime's mood real
  well, the songs are decent to catch anyone's first impression of her which is
  definitely a good start, and I wished they did something like this sooner.
  This is that typical one-two punch of love songs in a single that will make me
  purchase this without hesitation: It's the underlying fuel that keeps the
  music sung by idols going.

  (Okay if you really want me to nit pick on this beautiful single of love, I
  gotta say, unpopular opinion lest I get cancelled, is that Akarin doesn't
  sound that great to sing love songs. I know, but that's also why I think music
  label PONY CANYON put back on giving her love songs to sing but sing cool
  stuff which is much more her forte in my opinion.)

  I think we have seen the packaging on CD releases like these, so it should
  come as no surprise that its rather barebones even if I know this is an
  idolism package. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, the booklet has more to offer which I will
  not show just because, but you can take more beautiful-looking Akarin at your
  own dosage because as much as her fluffy pink outfit is the theme of her
  single this time around, I still liked normal-looking her with the long hair
  and even glasses, as you would see in the special gift bromide photo that
  comes with it.

  just because in case you do not know I have a glasses fetish hehe, still is
  somewhat better than the others mainly because of the close-ups which is my
  other fetish lol, and since I just mentioned how I didn't like the themed
  outfit then I would say only

  came close to what I wanted out of this. So yeah, no hesitation on this one,
  those glasses got me good there. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  I'm doing this first a day before because next up!! Since I didn't buy just
  this just to pay a truck load of international shipping for no reason, this
  was bundled with a package which I will be talking about to end the month!
  Let's just hope the real horror is just the amount of money I had to pay and
  these high quality images I'm serving up with my new phone because damn, did I
  pad my order too much as usual. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I know right, who am I lying, this
  is pretty much what's up every month. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See you then haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. I feel like this is a trend but are singles of solo female artists in
  Klassic Note Review all just because they contain love songs? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay
  that's not true Asakura Momo's single from last year isn't it even though I
  gave two years worth of love songs from her lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
