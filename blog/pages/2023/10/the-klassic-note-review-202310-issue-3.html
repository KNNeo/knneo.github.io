This is not scary at all I promise you because unsurprisingly, we are back 4 years after we have left her in the ditch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, I didn't I promise you, but it did take this long for me to review another one of her singles again. Thanks Anime, I may not have watched you but you did give me a fabulous ending theme song I can't even. *winks*</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://x.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1713849765815828925?s=20" target=_blank>Happy solo artist 4th anniversary</a> and of course, happy birthday Kitou Akari from 2 weeks ago!!

Idolism in a nutshell, by the way. I'm just grateful for the close-ups.)</div><div><br></div><div>Origin: I think many of us do not know of her from her songs, but might have known of her through Anime. Being a voice actress from the days I knew of her voicing in romance stories I liked, to singing super cool songs to please, Kitou Akari has all the talent. And I think this is a long time coming just because, when we finally have an excuse to let her sing love songs through and through, she is once again singing for Anime since she started in 2019, but now putting her adorable image on the line. This time around, this is undoubtedly the love song single and do not let the title deceive you, and we shall talk about what makes this work special.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Magie x Magie [Trans.: <a href=https://jisho.org/search/majimaji target=_blank>Unblinkingly</a>]</div><div>From the first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"(I) wish (you) would like me back the same</div><div style=text-align:center>Even if (you) are constantly hesitating</div><div style=text-align:center>The (idea, that we) both like each other</div><div style=text-align:center>(If) wish came true (doesn't) that count as love?"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>I think my first impression of this song wasn't from the music video which is basically fanservice, so I can talk about what's good about it. It's a love song, for starters, and it's a catchy tune thanks to Arte Refact (this single is composed and produced by them too), and most important of all, thanks to the lyricist for coming up with lyrics to make us love Kitou Akari all over again. With the word "like" sprinkled all over the place it really feels like overkill, but with meaning, this suddenly becomes more than a song of flirting, as reflected by the Anime it is credited on where the main girl has a crush on the main guy who she has known for a long time. The bridge might be a little long, little imperfections here and there, but overall, she sung it cutely and I have been liking this song as much as it liked itself, I think it has delivered the message. The music video is basically the artist in person showing all her love on camera, and I cannot thank that enough.</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uh1bCtneq54?si=5DE9S92ubclJCm3J" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Lovingly Above Average</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Afterglow</div><div>From the first verse:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"The reason (our) eye sights entwined (was) coincidence</div><div style=text-align:center>Reason(s) other than that</div><div style=text-align:center>Because thinking about (otherwise) is pointless</div><div style=text-align:center>It is coincidence (and) that is fine"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>As usual, the B-side is what makes of this single a whole, and I think this is easily one of the most complete feels I can give on a love song: the feels of sunset, the feelings of love growing uncertainly, and everything else in between. Clearly this song's lyrics talk about a maiden falling in love over time, and afraid to show her feelings. This cannot get better than that, I know this is rather typical to tackle on such a theme for a song, but the lyrics just makes it all the more complementary than it should have. The melody overall is sweet to listen to, it has a short bridge part which turns everything around even in terms of the lyrics which might have been excessive in those extra notes in the melody, but I just adore the general chill feels, so that's good enough for me.</div><div>Rating: Sweetly Average</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: If you are a fan of Kitou Akari, you will love this single as much as I do. If you aren't, I feel like this also captured the Anime's mood real well, the songs are decent to catch anyone's first impression of her which is definitely a good start, and I wished they did something like this sooner. This is that typical one-two punch of love songs in a single that will make me purchase this without hesitation: It's the underlying fuel that keeps the music sung by idols going.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(Okay if you really want me to nit pick on this beautiful single of love, I gotta say, unpopular opinion lest I get cancelled, is that Akarin doesn't sound that great to sing love songs. I know, but that's also why I think music label PONY CANYON put back on giving her love songs to sing but sing cool stuff which is much more her forte in my opinion.)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8jpeVj57ViUFIwc3VWf2_NXbokTfXPR9Nf0DBDidqqkdBYTiSYmO5v3N7G7WIE8KucFqm7sjevTSiUH3KIuZe4NlqwNCkwWHsOD8r75P7pw6P5jlD_yCLxV1C2Xs_IOTzmgeRn8RuN6QSxsA15ClK2zlk_Fhc4aqCRFS5oKVWqrtM-Bi9QH8MQzoW79s/s4080/PXL_20231026_131245330.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3072 data-original-width=4080 height=241 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8jpeVj57ViUFIwc3VWf2_NXbokTfXPR9Nf0DBDidqqkdBYTiSYmO5v3N7G7WIE8KucFqm7sjevTSiUH3KIuZe4NlqwNCkwWHsOD8r75P7pw6P5jlD_yCLxV1C2Xs_IOTzmgeRn8RuN6QSxsA15ClK2zlk_Fhc4aqCRFS5oKVWqrtM-Bi9QH8MQzoW79s/s320/PXL_20231026_131245330.jpg width=320></a></div><div><br></div><div>I think we have seen the packaging on CD releases like these, so it should come as no surprise that its rather barebones even if I know this is an idolism package. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, the booklet has more to offer which I will not show just because, but you can take more beautiful-looking Akarin at your own dosage because as much as her fluffy pink outfit is the theme of her single this time around, I still liked normal-looking her with the long hair and even glasses, as you would see in the special gift bromide photo that comes with it.</div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfVKd_UUHTSmx4AjtVfVTIbgZZ3QzeJC7FWJB_K7uf7gg31ZPA0sf8KraviEye6cHcWlibzBV8EQhkp3ljIQKJEPAzixcvPL9NId2TntsKwQgzgcauBJ2EvqOZOmLh-yrsJ0w8uzpY_5MOeYvoBzuA9PScRuksDduIWmBheyuR9DH2pT1cdv841J2L1o8/s4080/PXL_20231026_131408735.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3072 data-original-width=4080 height=241 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfVKd_UUHTSmx4AjtVfVTIbgZZ3QzeJC7FWJB_K7uf7gg31ZPA0sf8KraviEye6cHcWlibzBV8EQhkp3ljIQKJEPAzixcvPL9NId2TntsKwQgzgcauBJ2EvqOZOmLh-yrsJ0w8uzpY_5MOeYvoBzuA9PScRuksDduIWmBheyuR9DH2pT1cdv841J2L1o8/s320/PXL_20231026_131408735.jpg width=320></a></div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of which, the special gift this time around I chose PONY CANYON's own store <a href=https://kitoakari.com/wp/wp-content/themes/kitoakari/assets/images/common/magiemagie/img_magiemagie_canime_02.png target=_blank>Canime</a> just because in case you do not know I have a glasses fetish hehe, still is somewhat better than the others mainly because of the close-ups which is my other fetish lol, and since I just mentioned how I didn't like the themed outfit then I would say only <a href=https://kitoakari.com/wp/wp-content/themes/kitoakari/assets/images/common/magiemagie/img_magiemagie_gamers_02.png target=_blank>Gamers</a> came close to what I wanted out of this.

Since I didn't buy just this just to pay a truck load of international shipping for no reason, this was bundled with a package which I will be talking about to end the month! Let's just hope the real horror is just the amount of money I had to pay and these high quality images I'm serving up with my new phone because damn, did I pad my order too much as usual. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know right, who am I lying, this is pretty much what's up every month. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> See you then haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I feel like this is a trend but are singles of solo female artists in Klassic Note Review all just because they contain love songs? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay that's not true Asakura Momo's single from last year isn't it even though I gave two years worth of love songs from her lmao <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=4080 data-original-width=3072 height=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnP0YaDqcg6p03TQZVLjnOUiyY8MwkLM83hAnkIKA__ld_1DkXkdWHdeyqUB6zymGBIwrBtoOVcREw1b_77y9aGJuIZYd0CNKR-SCLW-x7aRa5aS_brxDO5UpYdAEhZxHWFAm7iEQaO78aQ3tYMR9zDGNr7jrYJRb0qI_XqKKmGPhIwu3J43yPyV3ndVM/s320/PXL_20231026_114738625.jpg width=241><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>"Does glasses suit me?"<br>Oh you bet they do, we know <a href="https://x.com/kitoakari_1016/status/1716415345773391916?s=20" target=_blank>how you look like with glasses</a> in private hehe <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span></table><div><br></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
