No, not talking about Disney. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As such, I apologize for the lack of time I will spend on this post particularly, but that doesn't mean I have been slacking though! Since Thursday, as the new package has arrived on Tuesday, I did start writing on the new stuff that arrived which also includes a more in-depth analysis of my 15 years of watching Anime when it started. Yeah, when I started writing about me watching animation regularly and that was kinda cringe. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, more Anime and music talk if you don't mind, I am a very busy person on the Internet despite communicating with no one lol, so let's get started!<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Hyakkano03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na Hyakunin no Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Why do you not open your mouth?" This episode has audio, I promise you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Wait, she is a princess? I thought that was the other Anime with Sumipe in it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, I rather take Naganawa Maria as princess so who cares about that we are watching now, so in this new episode I can't wait to watch first (#Hyakkano03), okay the princess thing is her ideal, I get it. Introducing Shizuka-chan here because damn her family name is as weird as her mom <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span>, this girl is rather quiet for a librarian and someone in the same class as the rest of the cast so far. Oh is she also a "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/dandere target=_blank>dandere</a>" by chance? Uh, I learnt this from a livestream recently. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, those quiet types. And I'm assuming everyone's lovestruck so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And the guy replies in sign language thinking he can't speak in the library? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright, guess if someone loves you it doesn't matter if you screw up communication. *looks at Komi-san* Not about that of course, but throughout the episode, I kept wondering what would be the catch on here for the confession to happen, and in some ways, I am impressed. For starters, we quickly realize that Shizuka-chan here isn't a fan of talking. Okay, maybe in the enactment of the book she is ever so familiar with so at least we can pay her voice actress minimal wages lol, but otherwise she is real quiet, and relies on people reading off quotes she points at to converse with others normally. Normally? I mean, and that's where the backstory starts I assume, when people want to talk to her but all she does is then asking them to read off a quote from the book. Probably bad as response since she will get bullied to hell anyways even the other librarian (who has a rack lmao) is also giving her some leeway, still, she did help Rentarou find some books to read while her two girlfriends are off reading cookbooks apparently. We learnt about the story in the book Shizuoka was reading too, her ideal I suppose, some knight to fetch this princess into happiness whatever it takes, and I think this is also a reflection of what is up next too, since if you did not realize the biggest obstacle is to let your other girlfriends accept another one so we can all be lovey-dovey together lol, her lack of communication still touched Rentarou's heart to want to do something... that is not reading the next volume of the novel. Instead, he chose to, of all things and instead of what I expected which was memorizing the book in order to talk to her the same way to not discriminate her, help her out by using a text-to-speech app on the smartphone (yes we have smartphones now this is not <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/42897/Horimiya target=_blank>"Horimiya"</a> lmao) (sorry, the original one, "Miyamura to Hori" anyone knows that?) to you know, read out the stuff she points to people for the purpose of, and boy this one got me good, maintain eye contact with others to show sincerity. That's... something I lack so I know how that feels. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha cringe me activated, in order to do that though, the book had to be manually written down which took him several nights to work on, just so we have a pocket translator on our hands. Well, on Shizuka-chan's hands, and she could not be happier. And I assume you know what's up next like I did, she used it to confess, and what is his reason to reject? Only he knows how the lightning works lol. All in all, if it hasn't come as surprising for any of you guys yet, unlike <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/43969/Kanojo_mo_Kanojo target=_blank>"KanoKano"</a> where the guy can't justify having another girlfriend lol, this one can always justify going out with more girls because reasons haha, but also, the girls will be fine with it because lovestruck. So long as you remember that, the lore will work. And I don't think that's a problem, it rounds itself pretty well anyways. Can't wait for this love rectangle to become love dodecagon or whatever the longest enough weird we can come up with for polygons. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, we are in foreign territory now no one has gone this far as the narrator has mentioned, so we shall see what is (Rentarou going to feel some girl) up next haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span><div> [TL:DR; "Is there no way for us to defy this fate?" Man, bro, if you think 100 soulmates is too much, maybe let us be you instead. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'll just open a sweatshop lmao]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhA8RGWxVKJ6god1ae7N-Br3506u4cE-MvlV17Xrzgz0ZtNoFqp8hyphenhyphenKM-M9oqlT2TC3R_ZdR_1BGNdfllJhvdr27rcqOu2qntSjBifJJf5059yfPp3oh5TDjWkd95drg4D37bNSjKQMIspoJh1YbgFYP1AHKCs9Xgh_gG8WAzlvGxRKT0i8LguzGMSlsWs/s320/hyakkano03_heal.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't know what happening down there, and so shouldn't you<br>(lmao)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0UMXRsYwWteeRc4NTmKsAMIirmNIOvbwCON4pW4qUpBA_oiDBR2VrIqzcFW35u5aTJ9nvBps6PRxXpx8uKFcOb3Hqg-tNQTy0MDXZmjnzRPSPMkG7nEdJOcm5pJzNoQq0cRf43dePTawWbs0V8TyxZD7Eq2wwjU6KNfGRTOrDllo4nmRXyqK6SJX-i1w/s320/hyakkano03_hug.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Basically me with the voice actresses in this Anime right now hehe <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kSsBFrGs7FKpEx6V9DgRfqDJ9ZOmKIlWs3W4kZzQYZwafLBJ_FJx7xvnKXnLFBHNPoMRo_I-Wf5BvrnkMJzMdC_fWH-v8MqjDUARALQCVd8YWAZfJd3ZuBPcCeWuHZ-Y6-5XJIHJNXhJfDnnqhjapDWKcAas6NPEkq-CSMShD6xJZ-0F_cuz-sRRYWs/s320/hyakkano03_books.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The amount of books required to quote in order to ace your final year project<br>(Haha you know what I mean)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Oh boy Nagisa you tell them that haha</div></blockquote>Wait, I don't know we have more girls in this! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again yeah, we need at least <em>some</em> people who don't know about this two-timer relationship. Not that it's their business but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> in this new episode where we try to make good time of Saki-chan in the festival just because (#KanoKano16), hey yo Saki-chan's friend you cute though you want to join this sh*tfest? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (This is not "Hyakkano" we can't do this lmao) Okay we have better thing to talk about, can we not get aroused at everything? Haha this episode I think is easily split into two parts, from Nagisa, to Saki-chan. Firstly, about Nagisa. She sure is bold there considering she is No.2 haha, but looks like she did have a promise with Saki-chan that whoever finds Naoya first (or vice versa) gets to spend time with him until the other arrives at their meeting point. And because it's funnier for Saki-chan to spend a lot of time getting lost and enjoying the food stalls lol, we have Nagisa here spending some time with Naoya even if it isn't kissing. I mean, do we need to though? From Naoya piggybacking Shion, to landing on top of Milika-san haha, Nagisa should already be happy with the hugs and finger crosses, considering everything that was on the guy moments ago honestly. And yeah, not like I'm talking with respect to Saki-chan over here haha I am by the way, but looks like the 1st (haha) is noticing all this too soon despite being ok with many more girls involved with her guy. I mean, how much for a high schooler to silence any girl who comes near her guy? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Deep down, you gotta think this is a problem, right? Saki-chan being this positive. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> And so does Naoya apparently, so in the second half despite all the jokes where Saki keeps talking about other girls' involvement with him, we get to talk about possibly the most emotional thing this series so far: How Saki-chan feels so far. And I meant that as not just a shallow question because our author here likes to joke around too, but this time we are a little more serious, not to drop the ending bait here yet, but she does know her friend Shion is telling the guy all the bad things of a polygamy with her own reasons that no one knows. I feel like they have to circle around this issue just like how Saki-chan is circling around those <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senkouhanabi target=_blank>sparklers</a>, since as you would have known this being a comedy series, we are likely not getting an answer out of this. Still, Naoya did try to ask, and Saki maybe, finally, somehow felt that agreeing to the two-timing might be a bad idea. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This is kind of real in prospect and unlike "Hyakkano" this has its consequences as we have seen in many episodes already, so I really wonder if the author will think in that direction or otherwise. And we are feeling it on all the other girls too to some extent, and just the smell on Naoya's T-shirt already shows this dude can only be dedicated to charity because he is being so kind to everyone and not just the one. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Good guys get girls, dude, what can I say? What I can say though, is the extent of them carrying on for this lore, even though we are quickly reminded from Shion that those two haven't kissed yet which was the whole purpose of the evening after all. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I might have taken this episode too seriously <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> despite all the laughs, and I don't think this will carry on the conversation much further, the one between Saki-chan and Naoya, just because there can never be a right answer. Not especially after we have gone this far. Well, looks like next episode we are going to abduct Naoya again so what else is new. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Let's hope the many years of Naoya confessing to Saki-chan will carry us till the end, I guess! I feel bad for the guy now lol he asked for it though</div><div>[TL:DR; Yeah you heard that thud when Saki-chan sat down on the bench? It was not the bench LMAO SHE THICC "I'm pretty happy for the time being" I KNOW RIGHT haha same]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiHDjmpM4sFZBhEp6yhzcHbDslHP4kfgKQi2y1pQA7Qn2ksh6hQ3sgdByV6loTx2SXMJCV8LnARtnz8wtftzhpOYEN3RBbWgF0tL4tzl8jHPpONKgAwHkYxpOc566eU5c3oToBgIEfSDM8dtuQ07gcUxIF-xwagMr4HBpMV3jdv1R-rycZxjIDsxeJ_Us/s320/kanokano16_punch2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This week in violence we have:<br>Haha you know, the infamous karate chop</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5BIK1o04iAuhjXx7GSWf7_32EXz_1PR8n8M_5_NHyamJPs6sQb0oE0jaNgSQy_H0w__ICrgm8sW8xMSXxyaJtcVFVzWq29JtEQuQ7XFXw3_OLsjbUIB8VrSuXOfxcB9t_dYM3YNTPDW2icD8WedgRXstuFC4o06ZRLkhPjyRowSuQrTevxGtbNRqiu7g/s1600/kanokano16_swinging.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You know, just in time to end summer lol</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Yeah true dude haha</div></blockquote>Really makes me wonder though: Does the ninja invisibility power leave any trail on contact? For example, if they leave fingerprints on their swords? Do ninja use swords? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#UnderNinja04), wait, Katou was the chief coordinating all of this?? BRO <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This lore, dude. I may have to check my deliveryman next time, can't let them do contactless delivery no more. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So we go back a bit to not that "interrogation" that kid with the teddy bear was doing to the leader of the enemy, that is probably just a way for the ventriloquist to engage in relationship with the enemy in case we need a traitor in hand. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> What is not a traitor though was everyone else in this series somehow, as we go back in time to the scene where the foreigner (I feel like writing his nationality down every time is going to get me cancelled and there's the only one so I shall not) is engaged with not just Suzuki-chan (lol), not just Hibi who just arrived at the scene and took the fight to the guy, but also Kuro-san who is also there at the scene quite literally hopping in as a sidecar (get it?) to the car who is driving towards the apartment block with that girl and the guy who plays with drones. Together though somehow, they managed to apprehend the foreigner, but maybe the guys were right but I hardly doubt so, that they aren't working together, but independently so that things will go according to the one plan regardless of the complication. Which should explain why Kuro-san should not be getting the credit for taking the guy down even though he likely masterminded all this, from engaging to the kid with the drones since he noticed him around his apartment block, to knowing that the girl had a father who was strict about her staying at home and stuff, putting civilians on the line such that the foreigner will take pity on this, even at all. Regardless, they already know who this guy's background is, and after getting him to a super remote place in the countryside I assume, and I don't even find this surprising anymore after we know Katou was one of the ninja chief who assisted in stopping the bomber at the very start of this story, was effectively ordering Sasama <strike>the old man breasts-</strike> the not so old woman, in apprehending this terrorist suspect before he finds out more about the ninja. So yeah, my deduction isn't very far off, because the other way that an old man would have a woman's torso would be, and I joke you no more, if that was a woman in disguise. Which probably made more sense at this point now that I think about it, I know right, thinking that some dude did a surgery to put a woman's torso on himself. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, much of the info is still kind of a blur I don't think the I paid attention to this as much as the foreigner did, but looks like as of this point if you would recall the lore, Japan's ninja is under control by the government as ordered by the international body <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> to behave after the war so their capabilities are limited, and to find out who amongst the ninja is about to bring down the current government to break this "status quo", also known as the "Under Ninja". Oh yeah, and we dealt with your daughter, dear foreigner, she is safe. Not that the guy who has been threatening you is but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... you know what? I'll stay, I'm part of the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinobi target=_blank>shinobi</a> now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But really though, I'll take this as another <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/48849/Sonny_Boy target=_blank>"Sonny Boy"</a> mystery down the line but with more action, I would expect. For what is easier to understand so far, I don't know, maybe conveyance of the plot isn't that great? But otherwise, everything else is within expectations for an action series albeit with a slower pace, and that's fine by me, realization takes a little more time when you're older and away from the battlefield for a while. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah, welcome to the organization I guess, can't wait for you to tell me that the high school I was in a decade ago had ninja history lol</div><div>[TL:DR; "They are the ones called Rear-Enders, yeah?"

"Do you really need to know? We're better off just busying ourselves with the work" Too real dude, me as an employee be like "Wait, I didn't get to do anything" Also me as an employee lol?<br> [Okay lore analysis time: To set the stage here, we are basically finding out who is trying to tear this place apart, or more likely, who is going against the country and not bowing down to post-war standards. And that force might be something not to be trifled with, it's only getting harder from here. We may have more weird old men waiting for us lol]</div><div><br></div><div><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span style=font-size:large>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well, this week's offerings are a good conclusion to this month alone honestly, and I'm glad they are all here to tell the tale. I know <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hyper-ep/1708528255?l=en-US" target=_blank>Kroi's new single</a></b> is not going to hold up as much I wanted it to so we are not giving the B-side by any means. But I have to say, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/curious-ep/1711402243?l=en-US" target=_blank><b>Kotobuki Minako's 1st EP</b></a> impressed me more on not the Rock music style that she was famous for especially when it was also what the title song eluded us into, the Pop songs in this are way better than I expected so I took the bait. <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/journey/1711130183?l=en-US" target=_blank><b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new album</b></a> is also a welcome listen after not listening to them for so long and I mean a year long lol, so not going to be too surprised I won't have more mood to give the tunes here considering they keep printing these out without much break in between. Still gave them like the simp I am, though my tastes are changing over time so I hope they will keep up. I know right, where's the primetime classics as from their albums in 2008 and 2009? I missed those days honestly these guys need to learn a thing or two from PHONO TONES they did it better-<br><br> Let's go through what's new on the world of Japanese music around me as posted on Twitter I guess haha gottem. <b><a href="https://x.com/specialthanks_7/status/1716423329270378758?s=20" target=_blank>SpecialThanks is releasing new songs for 3 months straight</a></b> which includes this month and it's ending soon so if I have any update I will inform again next week. You can hear <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1716450652476280869?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new song</a></b> in a promotional video about newspapers in Japan? Yeah, that was cringe but the song is great and it's likely on the album in December so stay tuned on that in your nearest paper media. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1716741326564179975?s=20" target=_blank>SHE'S will be releasing a new song upcoming Wednesday</a></b> to kickstart the month of November, so I'll listen to that when it appears. After Touyama Nao did a public event streamed to her Instagram account, apart from distributing a newsletter (which this isn't the first time) <b><a href="https://x.com/naobou_official/status/1716777076316135459?s=20" target=_blank>(Touyama Nao) is also releasing new songs for 3 months straight</a></b> in celebration of her 7th year as solo music artist, with the first song out already by the way. It's... different, I gotta say. Not keen on the rapping though, I've said that before with her single last year. <b><a href="https://x.com/oral_official/status/1716832166280130572?s=20" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new music video</a></b> is for their new song released this week, and I don't think it's that great and I say for that a couple of years already so... I don't know. We have next week I might just listen to this again, the title mention in the song isn't exactly creative by any means. <b><a href="https://x.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1716831923698590089?s=20" target=_blank>Earphones' new song</a></b> which started streaming this week which I assume will be in their album next year, might be too real in lyrics in case the cover art isn't representative enough lol. Moving on haha I would also not like to talk about the final "Attack on Titan" episode and its theme songs I will deal with that next week when I have to watch it too. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This is probably bigger news that I have expected, but now <b><a href="https://x.com/primary_yuiko/status/1718129668556218399?s=20" target=_blank>doujin music artist Primary/yuiko's music library is finally all on subscription services</a></b> starting today so if you have not heard of the perfect combination of Meis Clauson and yuiko-san this is a good time to catch up. In <b><a href="https://x.com/kioon_official/status/1718469300124819909?s=20" target=_blank>SID's major music label 15th anniversary movie</a></b> I suppose you have heard of many of their classics, but this is basically Klassic Note's connection with this band, and I cannot be happier listening to this back. Maybe I add this to #KN15YEARS haha. Last but not least, <b><a href="https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1718583460724707583?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new song preview</a></b> is revealed from a radio show she was in so I guess social people are slow now lol then again not like I can listen to the radio and/or this song is worth all that effort so take that on your own stride, the beat is strong on this one. <span class=emoji title=🤮>*pukes*</span> Haha<br><br> So next week? Damn do I not have anything to listen to to start November apart from <b>Misaki Nako's new single</b> from Anime "Hyakkano" which yes I will give it a listen even if I didn't watch it now at this point. But I will go back and listen to many new songs that have released this week alone in case I have missed any mentioned above. Yes, and <b>SHE'S new song</b>, how can I forget about that? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><br><br><br><br><br> Okay, didn't expect YouTube to recommend me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWk4cQyeXbQ" target=_blank>Ogura Yui's halloween livestream</a> yesterday, it was pretty good for what it is, she just naturally gave us fanservice I can't even. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVpFGyckOJU" target=_blank>The new song's music video</a> though, not that great. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Is Apple Music Web broken for me though? I can't sign in somehow. Oh well, time to use YouTube Music and sign up for Premium since they are blocking ad blockers now and might as well pay for my parents' retirement entertainment plans. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys next time then, I will be busy proofreading everything I wrote for the week for the whole of next week haha, and until next time maybe you would be interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2fHKluuJIw" target=_blank>Sakura Ayane and Yuuki Aoi appearing in a Halloween livestream on YouTube</a> after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy_F_neBsMS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target=_blank>the former did an Instagram live in the makeup room</a> before this just as I was doing this post. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I have a busy Internet life, huh. </div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Dear <a href="https://x.com/utamille/status/1718568361377006014?s=20" target=_blank>Hanai Miharu</a>, I have no idea why I keep falling in love with you, but I did. Happy Halloween though, and thanks for <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/211306/Mell target=_blank>Mell-chan</a> in Anime "Arsnotoria", that kid was so cute I still can't believe you can one up her hehe <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
