and how they were talking about their sub tiers being censored so fans can sign
up for "half naked" or "full naked" content-
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well, not that all of them are bangers and some are just on their monthly
  livestream payment obligation lol looking at you Disney+ with the cra**y real
  life movies of your stories, but you know, doesn't hurt to watch them all as
  mentioned in that blog post intro a couple of days ago. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> As such, I
  apologize for the lack of time I will spend on this post particularly, but
  that doesn't mean I have been slacking though! Since Thursday as the new
  package has arrived on Tuesday though, I did start writing on the new stuff
  that arrived which also includes a more in-depth analysis of my 15 years of
  watching Anime when it started. Yeah, when I started writing about me watching
  animation regularly and that was kinda cringe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, more Anime and music talk if you don't mind, I am a very busy person
  on the Internet despite communicating with no one lol, so let's get
  started!<br />
  <br />

  </blockquote>
  Wait, she is a princess? I thought that was the other Anime with Sumipe in it.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, I rather take Naganawa Maria as princess so who cares about
  that we are watching this now, so in this new episode I can't wait to watch
  first (#Hyakkano03), okay the princess thing is her ideal, I get it.
  Introducing Shizuka-chan here because damn her family name is as weird as her
  mom <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>, this girl is rather quiet for a librarian and someone in the
  same class as the rest of the cast so far. Oh is she also a "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/dandere"
    target="_blank"
    >dandere</a
  >" by chance? Uh, I learnt this from a livestream recently. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah,
  those quiet types. And I'm assuming everyone's lovestruck so <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And the
  guy replies in sign language thinking he can't speak in the library? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Alright, guess if someone loves you it doesn't matter if you screw up
  communication. *looks at Komi-san* Not about that of course, but throughout
  the episode, I kept wondering what would be the catch on here for the
  confession to happen, and in some ways, I am impressed. For starters, we
  quickly realize that Shizuka-chan here isn't a fan of talking. Okay, maybe in
  the enactment of the book she is ever so familiar with so at least we can pay
  her voice actress minimal wages lol, but otherwise she is real quiet, and
  relies on people reading off quotes she points at to talk to others normally.
  Normally? I mean, and that's where the backstory starts I assume, when people
  want to talk to her but all she does is then asking them to read off a quote
  from the book. Probably bad in struggle as she will likely get bullied to hell
  anyways even the other librarian (who has a rack lmao) is also giving her some
  leeway, still, she did help Rentarou find some books to read while her two
  girlfriends are off reading cookbooks apparently. We learnt about the story in
  the book too, Shizuka-chan's ideal I suppose, some knight to fetch this
  princess into happiness whatever it takes, and I think this is also a
  reflection of what is up next too, since if you did not realize the biggest
  obstacle is to let your other girlfriends accept another one so we can all be
  lovey-dovey together lol, still touched Rentarou's heart to want to do
  something... that is not reading the next volume of the novel. Instead, he
  chose to, of all things and instead of what I expected which was memorizing
  the book in order to talk to her the same way to not discriminate her, help
  her out by using a text-to-speech app on the smartphone (yes we have
  smartphones now this is not
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/42897/Horimiya" target="_blank"
    >"Horimiya"</a
  >
  lmao) to you know, read out the stuff she points to people for the purpose of,
  and boy this one got me good, maintain eye contact with others to show
  sincerity. That's... something I lack so I know how that feels. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Moving on haha cringe me activated, in order to do that though, the book had
  to be manually written down which took him several nights to work on, just so
  we have a pocket translator on our hands. Well, on Shizuka-chan's hands, and
  she could not ever be happier. And I assume you know what's up next like I
  did, she used it to confess, and what is his reason to reject? She doesn't
  know how the lightning works lol. All in all, if it hasn't come as surprising
  for any of you guys yet, unlike
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/43969/Kanojo_mo_Kanojo" target="_blank"
    >"KanoKano"</a
  >
  where the guy can't justify having another girlfriend lol, this one can always
  justify going out with more girls because reasons haha, but also, the girls
  will be fine with it because lovestruck. So long as you remember that, the
  lore will work. And I don't think that's a problem, it rounds itself pretty
  well anyways. Can't wait for this love rectangle to become love dodecagon or
  whatever the largest number we can come up with for polygons. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah,
  we are in foreign territory now no one has gone this far as the narrator has
  mentioned, so we shall see what is (Rentarou going to feel some girl) up next.
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

    [TL:DR; "Is there no way for us to defy this fate?" Man, bro, if you think
    100 soulmates is too much, maybe let us be you instead. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'll just
    open a sweatshop lmao]

    P.S. "Do you have any recommendations? My favourite genre is romance. I'd
    like something with a good ending, where the characters overcome
    difficulties to live happily ever after." This is not lying,
    <em>basically</em> my preferences- Just go look at the 15 years of Anime post
    I did yesterday- So don't recommend me

    Wait, I don't know we have more girls in this! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again yeah, we
    need at least some people who don't know about this two-timer relationship.
    Not that it's their business but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> in this new episode where we make
    good time of Saki-chan in the festival first just because (#KanoKano16), hey
    yo Saki-chan's friend you cute though you want to join this sh*tfest?
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (This is not "Hyakkano" we can't do this lmao) Okay we have better
    thing to talk about, can we not get aroused at everything? Haha this episode
    I think is easily split into two parts, from Nagisa, to Saki-chan. Firstly,
    about Nagisa. She sure is bold there considering she is No.2 haha, but looks
    like she did have a promise with saki-chan that whoever finds Naoya first
    (or vice versa) gets to spend time with him until the other arrives at their
    meeting point. And because it's funnier for Saki-chan to spend a lot of time
    getting lost and enjoying the food stalls lol, we have Nagisa here spending
    some time with Naoya even if it isn't kissing. I mean, do we need to though?
    From Naoya piggybacking Shion, to landing on top of Milika-san haha, Nagisa
    should already be happy with the hugs and finger crosses, on top of
    everything that was on the guy moments ago honestly. And yeah, not like I'm
    talking with respect to Saki-chan over here haha I am by the way, but looks
    like the 1st (haha) is noticing all this too soon despite being ok with many
    more girls involved with her guy. I mean, how much for a high schooler to
    silence any girl who comes near her guy? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Deep down, you gotta think
    this is a problem, right? Saki-chan being this positive. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> And so
    does Naoya apparently, so in the second half despite all the jokes where
    Saki keeps talking about other girls' involvement with him, we get to talk
    about possibly the most emotional thing this series so far: How Saki-chan
    feels so far. And I meant that as not just a shallow question because our
    author here likes to joke around too, but this time we are a little more
    serious, not to drop the ending bait here yet, but she does know her friend
    Shion is telling the guy all the bad things of a polygamy after all with her
    own reasons no one knows. I feel like they have to circle around this issue
    just like how Saki-chan is circling around those
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senkouhanabi" target="_blank">sparklers</a
    >, since as you would have known this being a comedy series, we are likely
    not getting an answer out of this. Still, Naoya did try to ask, and Saki
    maybe, finally, somehow felt that agreeing to the two-timing might be a bad
    idea. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This is kind of real in prospect and unlike "Hyakkano" this
    has its consequences as we have seen in many episodes already, so I really
    wonder if the author will think in that direction or otherwise. And we are
    feeling it on all the other girls too to some extent, and just the smell on
    Naoya's T-shirt already shows this dude can only be dedicated to charity
    because he is being so kind to everyone every time. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Good guys get
    girls, dude, what can I say? What I can say though, is the extent of them
    carrying on for this lore, even though we are quickly reminded from Shion
    that those two haven't kissed yet which was the whole purpose of this after
    all. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, I might have taken this episode too seriously
    <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> despite all the laughs, and I don't think this will carry on the
    conversation much further, the one between Saki-chan and Naoya, just because
    there can never be a right answer. Not especially after we have gone this
    far. Well, looks like next episode we are going to abduct Naoya again so
    what else is new. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Let's hope the many years of Naoya confessing to
    Saki-chan will carry us till the end, I guess! I feel bad for the guy now
    lol he asked for it though
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; Yeah you heard that thud when Saki-chan sat down on the bench? It
    was not the bench LMAO SHE THICC "I'm pretty happy for the time being" I
    KNOW RIGHT haha]

    Really makes me wonder though: Does the ninja invisibility power leave any
    trail on contact? For example, if they leave fingerprints on their swords?
    Do ninja use swords? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode though (#UnderNinja04),
    wait, Katou was the chief?? BRO <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This lore, dude. I may have to
    check my deliveryman next time, can't let them do contactless no more.
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So we go back a bit to not that "interrogation" that kid with the
    teddy bear was doing to the leader of the enemy, that is probably just a way
    for the ventriloquist to engage in relationship with the enemy in case we
    need a traitor in hand. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What is not a traitor though was everyone
    else in this series somehow, as we go back to the scene where the foreigner
    (I feel like writing his nationality down every time is going to get me
    cancelled and there's the only one so I shall not) is engaged with not just
    Suzuki-chan (lol), not just Hibi who just arrived at the scene and took the
    fight to the guy, but also Kuro-san who is also there at the scene quite
    literally hopping in as a sidecar (get it?) to the car who is driving
    towards the apartment block with that girl and the guy who plays with
    drones. Together though somehow, they managed to apprehend the foreigner,
    but maybe the guys were right but I hardly doubt so, that they aren't
    working together, but independently so that things will go according to plan
    regardless of the complication. Which should explain why Kuro-san should not
    be getting the credit for taking the guy down even though he likely
    masterminded all this, from engaging to the kid with the drones since he
    noticed him around his apartment block, to knowing that the girl had a
    father who was strict about her staying at home and stuff, putting civilians
    on the line such that the foreigner will take pity on this, even at all.
    Regardless, they already know who this guy's background is, and after
    getting him to a super remote place in the countryside I assume, and I don't
    even find this surprising anymore after we know Katou was one of the ninja
    chief who assisted in stopping the bomber at the very start of this story,
    was effectively ordering Sasama <strike>the old man breasts-</strike> the
    not so old woman, in apprehending this terrorist suspect before he finds out
    more about the ninja. So yeah, my deduction isn't very far off, because the
    other way that an old man would have a woman's torso would be, and I joke
    you no more, that it's a woman in disguise. Which probably made more sense
    at this point now that I think about it, I know right, thinking that some
    dude did a surgery to put a woman's top on himself. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still, much of
    the info is still kind of a blur I don't think the foreigner paid attention
    to this as much as I did, but looks like as of this point if you would
    recall the lore, Japan's ninja is under control by the government as ordered
    by the international body <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> to behave after the war so their
    capabilities are limited, and to find out who is about to bring down the
    current government to break this "status quo", also known as the "Under
    Ninja". Oh yeah, and we dealt with your daughter, dear foreigner, she is
    safe. Not that the guy who has been threatening you is but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in
    all... you know what? I'll stay, I'm part of the
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinobi" target="_blank">shinobi</a> now.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But really though, I'll take this as another
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/48849/Sonny_Boy" target="_blank"
      >"Sonny Boy"</a
    >
    down the line but with more action, I would expect. For what is easier to
    understand so far, I don't know, maybe conveyance of the plot isn't that
    great? But otherwise, everything else is within expectations of an action
    series albeit with a slower pace, and that's fine by me, realization takes a
    little more time when you're older and away from the battlefield for a
    while. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, welcome to the organization I guess, can't wait
    for you to tell me that the high school I was in a decade ago had ninja
    history lol

    [Okay lore analysis time: To set the stage here, we are basically finding
    out who is trying to tear this place apart, or more likely, who is going
    against the country for bowing down to post-war standards. And that force
    might be something not to be trifled with, it's only getting harder from
    here. We may have more weird old men waiting for us lol]

    is also a welcome listen after not listening to them for so long and I mean
    a year long lol, so not going to be too surprised I won't have more mood to
    give the tunes here considering they keep printing these out without much
    break in between. Still gave them like the simp I am, though my tastes are
    changing over time so I hope they will keep up. I know right, where's the
    primetime classics as from their albums in 2008 and 2009? I missed those
    days honestly these guys need to learn a thing or two from PHONO TONES they
    did it better-<br />

    to kickstart the month of November, so I'll listen to that when it appears.

    in celebration of her 7th year as solo music artist, with the first song out
    already by the way. It's... different, I gotta say. Not keen on the rapping
    though, I've said that before with her single last year.

    is for their new song released this week, and I don't think it's that great
    and I say for that a couple of years already so... I don't know. We have
    next week I might just listen to this again, the title mention in the song
    isn't exactly creative by any means.

    which started streaming this week which I assume will be in their album next
    year, might be too real in lyrics in case the cover art isn't representative
    enough lol. Moving on haha I would also not like to talk about the final
    "Attack on Titan" episode and its theme songs I will deal with that next
    week when I have to watch it too. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This is probably bigger news that
    I have expected, but now

    I suppose you have heard of many of their classics, but this is basically
    Klassic Note's connection with this band, and I cannot be happier listening
    to this back. Maybe I add this to #KN15YEARS haha. Last but not least,

    is revealed from a radio show she was in so I guess social people are slow
    now lol then again not like I can listen to the radio and/or this song is
    worth all that effort so take that on your own stride, the beat is strong on
    this one. <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span> Haha<br />
    <br />
    So next week? Damn do I not have anything to listen to to start November
    apart from <b>Misaki Nako's new single</b> from Anime "Hyakkano" which yes I
    will give it a listen even if I didn't watch it now at this point. But I
    will go back and listen to many new songs that have released this week alone
    in case I have missed any mentioned above. Yes, and <b>SHE'S new song</b>,
    how can I forget about that? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span><br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Okay, didn't expect YouTube to recommend me

    yesterday, it was pretty good for what it is, she just naturally gave us
    fanservice I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

    though, not that great. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Is Apple Music Web broken for me though? I
    can't sign in somehow. Oh well, time to use YouTube Music and sign up for
    Premium since they are blocking ad blockers now and might as well pay for my
    parents' retirement entertainment plans. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you guys next time
    then, I will be busy proofreading everything I wrote for the week for the
    whole of next week haha, and until next time maybe you would be interested
