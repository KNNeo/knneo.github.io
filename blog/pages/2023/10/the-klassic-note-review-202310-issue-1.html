  Yes, we already know Issue 2 is coming, just... look at tomorrow. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I
  gotta say though, we might even get an Issue 3 if I love Akarin so much I'll
  give her new single but not the Anime she was singing the title song for.

  Moving on haha, we shall start the month of music reviews by talking about my
  new favourite band in town! Oh yeah, it's a rock band, no surprises there, but
  thinking that it came from an Anime I've watched all these years only made
  this more cool and/or important than ever before. Let's dive in! Because you
  know, ducklings?

  (As much as Ichigo is cool, I don't like it defining my music release covers
  so)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: If you need the full name of the band name here lol, it's "webbing off
  duckling" if you visit their official website and I don't think finding out
  their name's origin is any important, so let's talk about how I knew of a new
  generation of major label artists for the past year thanks to Sony Music
  Japan. It's Anime series "BLEACH" and its final arc split into four seasons,
  so no surprises I will be getting new names for every season just for variety
  and because not like we can get Aqua Timez to sing no more (though ASIAN
  KUNG-FU GENERATION will be rad). Moving on from its past 20 years though, we
  were introduced to wonderful artists of this generation like Kitani Tatsuya,
  SennaRin who was backed up by the music producer behind the "Attack on Titan"
  series, and specifically this time around, of mention (at least for me) is
  w.o.d. itself. How are they different from the pack though? Maybe I'll let
  their hard grunge rock music do the talking.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>[1] STARS</div>
<div>From the first chorus, from the English Version lyrics:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Strain out your voice, slash away the night
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Shouting at the top of your lungs</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    My heart is full of fear, please shoot through it with your voice
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    I don't have to be able to smile just like those days
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Sadness and scars and everything</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Take it all away with me</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">You can't kill my vide, oh baby</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Burning out now, like a shooting star"</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
  This song will give you an impression of real rock music. At least, that is
  how it worked for me despite its weak first impression, and I'm just thankful
  that "BLEACH" series author Tite Kubo did get to be involved in the
  supervision of this final Anime arc, which also means he has some involvement
  somewhere in approving this masterpiece which is as unique as it is, to say
  the least. The rock style is quick with a single riff in the intro, and
  everything else is history. It's a catchy melody which you will need to get
  used to, it had a short bridge and even then its lyrics are meaningful,
  singing a song of what main guy Ichigo would have sung to the people he wants
  to protect, specifically his friends and people around him. I would say I can
  hardly pick on this song besides its rough style, because putting star ratings
  on this song won't do it justice, to be honest.

<div>Rating: 5-Stars Worthy Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>[2] My Generation</div>
<div>From first verse:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Oh rubbish, I did it my way</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Don't bother; Don't get in my way</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Well! Kick out, I kick it out now</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Hey listen, lights out"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  Ah, and of course B-sides are why I buy singles in the first place, this one I
  heard of it in a rock festival video back in July. And since I heard of them
  through the Anime announcement, it wouldn't have hurt to deepen my impression
  of them, and even though I hesitate to give this in first impression, this is
  overall a very decent song. Not like it'll hold much meaning because I don't
  think it's deliberately doing so it's just being cool as I've mentioned about
  this band anyways, but it is still a solid tune. It gives off the street vibes
  of a youngster to say the least, and that to me is more than enough to define
  a new generation. Rowdiness, being hot-headed, all that stuff. Ah, what it
  feels to be young.

<div>[3] STARS English Version</div>
<div>
  Refer to Track 1 for details of the melody and original lyrics, because I'm
  pretty sure this was directly translated from Japanese as it definitely felt
  the lyricist who is also the vocalist, was trying to fit the words into the
  song, and that is to say because he can write English lyrics with ease. That's
  all I will say though, just mention of the lyrics is already cool in
  retrospect.
</div>
<div>Rating: Not Applicable</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: I think this is overall a real good single and perfect
  representative to stand on the frontlines of Japanese rock music, and not to
  say just for my music library just this year alone. It's short and sweet, it's
  mainstream as its best it's like I'm back when J-Rock was taking over the
  world I was in when I was a kid. Even if you aren't an Anime fan of the
  series, this single will fit right up your alley if you like some intense rock
  music like I do.

  (On a side note, this must have been the EASIEST lyrics translation EVER in
  this history of Klassic Note Reviews ever since I introduced that section
  because damn, the vocalist can write his own lyrics in both languages, so he
  wins. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay onto the package itself.)

  Of course, you should have known, this was part of the monthly(?) package
  shipped from Japan to my room, and this was no exception. It was an easy pick
  once they announced a CD release despite the digital singles having already
  appeared in April and July for the title song, for Anime. Still, it was an
  easy choice to get it since I didn't have to deal with new songs as I have
  already given, so that's a plus. Nothing much to specify on the CD here the
  theme here is befitting of its title, so the issue is then what to choose from
  the store-specific gifts that will come with the release.

  The one I selected was from the major music label's own store SonyMusicShop
  where you will get an A3-sized poster of the main character in "BLEACH" series
  Kurosaki Ichigo, which I then found out that you also can purchase this from
  CDJapan? I feel stupid now lol but that was before I have a better idea of
  what this month's package was even going to be (or else I would've chosen the
  latter route as it'll save me in shipping fees; I'll talk about the other CDs
  in this in another post), so yeah, confusion overall, but I'm glad I got what
  I wanted.

  Wow this was an easy run. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Unlike yesterday which man, is it hard to
  decide when to buy my new smartphone now that it's out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In case you
  haven't heard, Google announced their <strike>new</strike> my generation (get
  it?) of Pixel phones as I've been waiting on this for a while, so much so my
  sis is into this, so plan is likely she will get her hands on one first while
  I wait for the holiday season discounts so I can justify buying a phone within
  my budget. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> You know, I'm just stubborn weird. Just like how Google
  made sure the base and Pro versions are so different, I might even be scammed
  even with the 7 years of updates with only 1 year of warranty. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay
  I can wrap this up now I will end this week with TWO more singles which I care
  less so I grouped them together instead. There's Ikimono dude how can I care
  less- Oh, one member less HAHA GOTTEM
