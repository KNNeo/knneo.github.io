  You asked for the CD reviews, you get the CD reviews. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Alright I asked
  for it, and even though my Friday evening is turning out to be a busy night
  somehow even with me wanting to do this, I shall gobble down whatever I had
  for Mac for dinner (lol) and press on! I know, this blog is more hectic than
  my work-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  This time, instead of just talking about stuff I like lol but this is just a
  mixed bag anyways, maybe we talk about others which fell into the
  requirements. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I don't think Ikimonogakari and/or nasuo-san here
  would be a great sample of this future decision but maybe, hear me out, maybe
  we ditch single-track releases. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey a double A-side counts as a
  single without B-sides and is SURE to sell...?
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Let's take the nostalgia trip to a month ago where all this began, maybe even
  further.

  (Damn, do they have to fulfil their credit obligations by putting both the
  main characters from the newest PreCure series, but the Regular Edition cover
  is actually representative of the band now and the theme of this release)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: It has been a while since we heard of them, so maybe we start with
  introductions. Ikimonogakari is a three, no, two-piece band now since one of
  the members left a couple of years ago and that was still the saddest thing
  for me 15 years into listening to Japanese songs, but with his departure also
  showed the remaining members a light into the new age of music, and how much
  they can be relevant after all these years from the days when they started
  this before me. Going ahead, looks like their plan was still to sing songs
  that touch the hearts of people, maybe keep the production up to what is
  relevant instead of being stuck with their typical ballad songs, but still,
  this did not stop composer Mizuno Yoshiki from writing masterpieces for her
  high school junior Yoshioka Kiyoe to sing, so many years later. And that I
  think is still what makes them great, despite not being whole. This single is
  also their first physical single release, showing that they will create new
  songs once again to please, and I think this is worthy of talking about, once
  again.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>[1] Ureshitkute [(Feeling) Happy]</div>
<div>From the first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"(I'm) so happy, shining</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Flying above, fluttering</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    It's like the feelings of pursuing (my) first dream
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Soar through the skies, shining</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Laughing and crying, fluttering</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Not being afraid, go ahead and hold someone's hand"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  Walking in, you should have heartfelt feelings of motivation and happiness,
  and this goes very far into making sure that is the case on the production
  side, making sure this orchestra-level opening will get you and I. As with
  most Ikimonogakari pieces, to be complete is also to be long, so this one
  takes that honour for now in their new set of songs going forward.
  Nonetheless, a long song doesn't mean it's a drag, but more of emphasizing the
  lyrics along with using choruses, telling a tale of how people are strong
  together, what makes us whole, and what then makes us happy. This feeling of
  happiness, very similar to the Anime movie "PreCure" they were credited in,
  truly making this a tearjerker in bliss. It does still suffer from the usual
  bridge issues, but I think it's minor considering the transition is a plus for
  the melody itself.

<div>[2] Tokimeki [(Heart) Flutter]</div>
<div>From the first chorus:&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"The world is shining once again</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">This was what I decided on</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    The light of smiles, once again, (shining) beautifully
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">It's not just someone's life</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">I will continue to dance, hey you</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    On those fluttering days, that will never end"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  This being a happy song even happier than the first song isn't just a
  coincidence, I would say this is even intentional, because for what was
  talking about encouragement and motivation, this one talks about the feelings
  of overcoming obstacles, not giving up, and having that feeling of heart
  flutter one will have to move forward. "Courage", they call it. Also on point
  to the Anime "PreCure" series theme of heroines, but that doesn't mean they
  have to put the relevance in so much so they lose their identity. And that is
  how their songs can still be relevant that is the professional from
  Mizuno-san, for he will churn up the best of songs to fit any use case, and I
  would say he has done this better than the former, but this is just my
  opinion. Otherwise, you would be glad this is an catchy, easy-listening tune,
  and an eye-opener worldview for its lyrics. These heartfelt words truly cannot
  get better than this.
</div>
<div>Rating: Belovingly Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: Saying nice things about an artist I've listened to all these
  years may be being biased, but seriously thinking about it they didn't do
  anything bad after all these years, it was I that has changed, thus today me
  will rather recommend other artists to listen to. At this point, Ikimonogakari
  is my comfort food, my motivation in life when I need them, and something for
  me to remember by. And for that, I'm glad I did not give them up just as I was
  as sad of them ending this journey with me. I'm glad they didn't, and I
  begrudgingly still want more. Mizuno and Yoshioka, I'm counting on you guys.
</div>

<div>
  (I mean, rather appropriate cover for an Anime theme song single, to be frank,
  we know that's not the issue here)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: This started months ago when I heard of the new season of Anime I
  intend to watch, and indie artist turned major music label was selected to
  sing the ending theme song. Among the many social media posts of her covering
  earlier theme songs for the series, somehow, I feel like we have come back to
  square one even though just a year ago, I have talked about this indie artist
  turned into major label nasuo-san with an Anime opening theme song. This time
  around though, I don't think this one left a better impression on me, but
  nonetheless, it does have its points, so we are here to talk about them.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>[1] Hoshikuzu Requiem [Requiem of Countless Stars]</div>
<div>From the first verse:</div>
<div>
  <div></div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">"(Somehow) I was talking and laughing</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">I wanted to be special to you</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">That day, (it was) always a full moon</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">(Saying those) magical four letters</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">The things (that were) said here</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">(Had a) terrible detour</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">(Even if) it hurts but (I) like it</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">(I) wanted to touch (you)"</div>
  </blockquote>
  <div></div>
</div>
<div>
  I thought I would be impressed by her once again, only to realize that unlike
  the season of Anime which had substance, this one lacked in areas because she
  has shown her true form from her indie days, with words to speak of inside its
  lyrics being the biggest problem in my opinion. I was never a fan of that, and
  I already know from her song covers in her indie days, that she was such a
  person, even on her compositions. I was then dragged into giving this piece
  which, and though the dreamy mood does bring forth a sentimental feel, the
  lyrics did not bring much meaning into making sure the feels are as
  sentimental as the melody itself. The singing is also rather damped in most of
  the song, delivering a slightly less mellow feel that I would have hoped. I
  still appreciate the unique feels that this song was produced and presented
  though, the lyrics speaking of what was related to the Anime, if I had to talk
  about what's good about it.
</div>
<div>Rating: Glaringly Below Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: I honestly do not know what to make of this single. For starters,
  I don't think I will recommend anyone on this unless you are interested in
  nasuo-san or are into the Anime series behind it. I am not exactly a fan of
  nasuo here, so I'll take the adequately presented mood of the song and support
  her once again. For a rather inexperienced indie artist, I would wish she will
  show us more what she can do without her indie flair, even if it's not as
  stellar as it should be. My hopes will be on when we meet again, and I'll look
  forward to that.

  Okay, now that you know where my biases are haha, let's talk about what is
  different between them. For starters, Ikimonogakari's single comes with the
  usual flair that I would have thought they did not continue on but they did.
  Just holding another of their singles is still unreal, maybe I'll need a
  reminder of when's the last time I got hold of one. 2016? Holy shit- And it
  only got worse when I saw the release-unique trading cards with one less
  person on cover. Though sad stories aside, this is actually rather fitting of
  the theme of company, that one other person to join you on your journey, and
  that wood cut-out describes it in all its glory, I would add.&nbsp;

  more compelling story. For nasuo-san's case not did her single cost more than
  the other, unlike the last time we reviewed her (also) single track release,
  this one DID NOT HAVE A SPECIAL GIFT?? IKIMONO AT LEAST CAME UP WITH SOMETHING
  YOU DUMB BITCH- Moving on haha, so I focused on Ikimonogakari's case and
  delayed the other single for as long as I can find someone else to ship it
  with. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Initially I was thinking of CDJapan again just because, but I
  learnt that as part of a list of supprting stores, the special gift for
  Ikimono's release will be character art from the Anime series which I do not
  need anyways, so I went for the artist cover postcard which will be available
  in supporting stores, in which I ended up with Tower Records because you gotta
  remember that the online store has to house BOTH singles and nasuo's isn't
  exactly mainstream (lol) so I went with this compromise, once again, to get
  what I want.

  Well, I guess I will stop here for now, TGIF. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I will enjoy my sleep
  tonight to the fullest while I- It's that photobook, dude. I gotta let it out
  somehow. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Alright TMI already, and before I GTFO I better remind you
  of the blog's weekend schedule! I will do up the summary for Isobe
  Karin-chan's photobook because I feel like I can know more of her and she
  doesn't have Q&amp;A segments like Lynn-san has lol why do we keep comparing
  to her friend here, and then we will dive into the new season of shows and
  hopefully kick half of them out! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I still have more plans on blog
  posts up my sleeve (hehe) and there's the #KN15YEARS thing I did not forget,
  so stay tuned for that in the next couple of weeks. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> See (whoever) you
  guys (are) on Sunday! lol

  P.S. Because Ikimonogakari's single has so much to talk about, and you can
  look at the postcard above for reference:
