Ikimonogakari is a three, no, two-piece band now since one of the members left a couple of years ago and that was still the saddest thing for me 15 years into listening to Japanese songs, but with his departure also shed a light to the remaining members the new age of music, and how much they can be relevant after all these years from the days when they started this before me. Going ahead, looks like their plan was still to sing songs that touch the hearts of people, maybe keep the production up to what is relevant instead of being stuck with their typical ballad songs, but still, this did not stop composer Mizuno Yoshiki from writing masterpieces for her high school junior Yoshioka Kiyoe to sing, so many years later. And that I think is still what makes them great, despite not being whole. This single is also their first physical single release since then, showing that they can create new songs to please, which I think this is worthy of talking about, once again.</div><div><br></div><div>[1] Ureshitkute [(Feeling) Happy]</div><div>From the first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"(I'm) so happy, shining</div><div style=text-align:center>Flying above, fluttering</div><div style=text-align:center>It's like the feelings of pursuing (my) first dream</div><div style=text-align:center>Soar through the skies, shining</div><div style=text-align:center>Laughing and crying, fluttering</div><div style=text-align:center>Not being afraid, go ahead and hold someone's hand"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>Walking in, you should have heartfelt feelings of motivation and happiness, and this goes very far into making sure that is the case on the production side, making sure this orchestra-level opening will get you and I. As with most Ikimonogakari pieces, to be complete is also to be long, so this one takes that honour for now in their new set of songs going forward. Nonetheless, a long song doesn't mean it's a drag, but more of emphasizing the lyrics along with using choruses, telling a tale of how people are strong together, what makes us whole, and what then makes us happy. This feeling of happiness, I assume very similar to the Anime movie "PreCure" plot they were credited in, truly making this a tearjerker in bliss. It does still suffer from the usual bridge issues, but I think it's minor considering the transition is a plus for the melody itself.</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kt-miAzM61c?si=6HAK5zRBiwulRUY-" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Happily Average</div><div><br></div><div>[2] Tokimeki [(Heart) Flutter]</div><div>From the first chorus:Â </div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"The world is shining once again</div><div style=text-align:center>This was what I decided on</div><div style=text-align:center>The light of smiles, once again, (shining) beautifully</div><div style=text-align:center>It's not just someone's life</div><div style=text-align:center>I will continue to dance, hey you</div><div style=text-align:center>On those fluttering days, that will never end"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>This being a happy song even happier than the first song isn't just a coincidence, I would say this is even intentional, because for what was just encouragement and motivation, this one touches more on the feelings of overcoming obstacles, not giving up, and having that feeling of heart flutter one will have to move forward. "Courage", they call it. Also on point to the Anime "PreCure" series theme of heroines, but that doesn't mean they have to put the relevance in so much so they lose their identity. And that is how their songs can still be relevant that is the professional composer from Mizuno-san, for he will churn up the best of songs to fit any use case, and I would say he has done this better than the former, but this is just my opinion. Otherwise, you would be glad with an catchy, easy-listening tune, and an eye-opener worldview for its lyrics. These heartfelt words truly cannot get better than this.</div><div>Rating: Belovingly Average</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: Saying nice things about an artist I've listened to all these years may be being biased, but seriously thinking about it they didn't do anything bad after all these years, it was I that has changed, thus today me will rather recommend other artists to listen to. At this point, Ikimonogakari is my comfort food, my motivation in life when I need them, and something for me to remember by. And for that, I'm glad I did not give them up just as I was as sad of them for making a turn. I'm glad they didn't change much, and I begrudgingly still want more. Mizuno and Yoshioka, I'm counting on you guys.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>And to wrap this up...

Among the many social media posts of her covering earlier theme songs for the series, somehow, I feel like we have come back to square one even though just a year ago, I have talked about this indie artist turned into major label, with a particular Anime opening theme song. This time around though, I don't think this one left a better impression on me, but nonetheless, it does have its points, so let's talk about them.</div><div><br></div><div>[1] Hoshikuzu Requiem [Requiem of Countless Stars]</div><div>From the first verse:</div><div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"(Somehow) I was talking and laughing</div><div style=text-align:center>I wanted to be special to you</div><div style=text-align:center>That day, (it was) always a full moon</div><div style=text-align:center>(Saying those) magical four letters</div><div style=text-align:center><br></div><div style=text-align:center>The things (that were) said here</div><div style=text-align:center>(Had a) terrible detour</div><div style=text-align:center>(Even if) it hurts but (I) like it</div><div style=text-align:center>(I) wanted to touch (you)"</div></blockquote><div></div></div><div>I thought I would be impressed by her once again, only to realize that this one lacked in areas because she has shown her true form from how she did songs from her indie days, with words to speak of inside its lyrics being the biggest problem in my opinion. I was never a fan of that, and I already know from her indie days that she was such a person, I even listened to her compositions. I was then dragged into giving this piece which, and though the dreamy mood does bring forth a sentimental feel, the lyrics did not bring much meaning into making sure the feels are as sentimental as the melody itself. The singing is also rather damped in most of the song, delivering a quirky mellow feel that I would not have hoped. I still appreciate the unique feels that this song was produced and presented though, the lyrics speaking of what was related to the Anime, if I had to talk about what's good about it.</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1fgbRgGVRho?si=4dytgHPYbSSGRFsN" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Glaringly Below Average</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: I honestly do not know what to make of this single. For starters, I don't think I will recommend anyone on this unless you are interested in nasuo-san or are into the Anime series behind it. I am not exactly a fan of nasuo here, so I'll take the adequately presented mood of the song and support her once again. For a rather inexperienced indie artist, I would wish she will show us more what she can do without her indie flair, even if it's not what she intended it should be. My hopes will be on when we meet again, I'll be able look forward to that.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(Damn, I feel like I should be less harsh but then again when's the last time I didn't like a single reviewed?

For starters, Ikimonogakari's single comes with the usual flair that I would have thought they did not continue on but they did. Just holding another of their singles is still unreal, maybe I'll need a reminder of when's the last time I got hold of one. 2016? Holy shit- And it only got worse when I saw the release-unique trading card with one less person on cover. Though sad stories aside, this is actually rather fitting of the theme of company, that one other person to join you on your journey, and that wood cut-out (by the way) describes it in all its glory, I would add.Â </div><div><br></div><table align=center cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhODuDzeqXTeOEDMIP1kCl67lQqQez4Bohrenoofs1XNL55eptBwKxAyEI08X_bHMnFvsCafaQc3wk08ZPjlylzmtsGFZzIfW9mgzoY92wxpURmt2_UFPl9JiofXyB-ySsKeaI46Nv1YmstIFc5UQNGp3ryfg6-5zXi2Y-snGAXKB-jvQc7ndHUTNrOzzM/s1600/PXL_20231006_122610736.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhODuDzeqXTeOEDMIP1kCl67lQqQez4Bohrenoofs1XNL55eptBwKxAyEI08X_bHMnFvsCafaQc3wk08ZPjlylzmtsGFZzIfW9mgzoY92wxpURmt2_UFPl9JiofXyB-ySsKeaI46Nv1YmstIFc5UQNGp3ryfg6-5zXi2Y-snGAXKB-jvQc7ndHUTNrOzzM/s320/PXL_20231006_122610736.jpg width=320></a><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMsq7r-33H7pYS1hB9VZM7W8IgawVHVPtae08MTZbqk9dTPC27et8tIMbTqQIH5T5tcf23eM4SmqzBNOOc-ciUR9AIl5CxuB8wCr6PXYXvREOe-r96PeiSrDPDqGtjTdphT4JpRbmaCdxJLRBGSxBUlRXg-93xcBdiV6clGlx-qfy7embsoe-txurByp8/s1600/PXL_20231006_123630271.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMsq7r-33H7pYS1hB9VZM7W8IgawVHVPtae08MTZbqk9dTPC27et8tIMbTqQIH5T5tcf23eM4SmqzBNOOc-ciUR9AIl5CxuB8wCr6PXYXvREOe-r96PeiSrDPDqGtjTdphT4JpRbmaCdxJLRBGSxBUlRXg-93xcBdiV6clGlx-qfy7embsoe-txurByp8/s320/PXL_20231006_123630271.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption colspan=2 style=text-align:center>nasuo's single (left) and Ikimonogakari's single (right), for comparison.<br>The left one has a serious lack of anything extra</table><div><br></div><div>If we are talking about special gifts though, then this is going to be an even more compelling story.
