<div>THE FIRST YEARS</div>
<div>
  This is not going to be an introductory post into the world of Japanese
  animation, so if you know nothing you are better off not being here haha bye
  everyone. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But if you DO know a little about Anime, you can stay and
  hear about my journey into this mess when I started this a decade and a half
  ago!
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  As mentioned in the intro, this marks the very first season I have started
  watching Anime on a weekly basis as of simulcast (in Japan, but even back then
  licensing has allowed same week airtimes) which yes, I'm sure many of us have
  watched Anime without realizing it, because back then "Pokémon" and the likes
  of "Doraemon" are also counted as Anime, even if it's geared towards a younger
  audience. Even that has a genre in itself (Seinen), and that sort of explain
  the many new grounds left untouched and the many times my sister who showed me
  to many shows I have seen before undertaking the exploration myself, from
  "Love Hina" to "Cardcaptor Sakura" which were aimed at a younger female
  audience (<a href="https://jisho.org/search/shoujo" target="_blank">Shoujo</a
  >), and even "Kekkaishi" was a recommendation. My classmates also introduced
  me to classics and that's how I ended up watching "BLEACH" and "Nagasarete
  Airantou", which were more geared towards a young male audience (<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/shounen"
    target="_blank"
    >Shounen</a
  >).&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  My first expedition was through back then cable TV where a new channel geared
  towards a younger audience started adding late night Anime airings to their
  schedule. (Remember this is not Japan, and there wasn't subscription TV
  anyways) Back then I even forgot on which nights but I think it's almost a
  week after it aired in Japan, "Toradora!" was aired right after "Code Geass"
  and that's how the ending theme song got me by the way, shout out to SunSet
  Swish. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And "Kuroshitsuji" aired not long afterwards right after, so
  yeah, that was quite a packed schedule considering by the time I've watched
  them all it was midnight and I still had school the next day. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span><br />
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Yeah, back then I didn't know much about *piracy* and watching online and
  stuff (the Internet was in a worse shape than today, trust me), but the idea
  of tuning in to Anime just like how I would for any TV drama was refreshing,
  even anticipating and exciting, to look forward too every week. And thus,
  unlike many who chose to binge them all once they are aired, I sank into the
  weekly schedule of watching Japanese animation.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <div>
    <div>THE BLOG IN TRANSITION</div>
    <div>
      As I was humbly blogging on the rise of the Internet back in 2008 (about
      my daily life in school, if you can believe), I never thought of ever
      writing about Anime. But as there wasn't an easy avenue to talk about
      Anime with others (I guess the classmates who introduced me to "BLEACH",
      but even then we were on different levels) especially with my very niche
      opinions about you know, liking theme songs to even liking the voices
      behind Anime characters (haha it had already started) which was hard to
      relate as many out there were more into the 2D world, and that's what
      everyone was trying to escape from. Too real to my own opinions and
      needing a channel to talk about this and my parents didn't fancy me
      talking to myself lol <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span>, I eventually transitioned to talk more
      about not my school life, and I think started with this new naming since
      2012 after I graduated high school.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      The blog has since then taken a slightly more formal tone(?) on everything
      in my life, which in this case, also for the Anime I watch every week. It
      started with short summaries of each week's episodes (yes, plural) but I
      still ended up regurgitating a lot of my opinions to myself, and over time
      i got comfortable to talk about them in detail more, and as my knowledge
      of them increased I also ended up talking about the faucets of what makes
      Anime what they are today. Learning programming only made this blog more
      fanciful and meaningful as I add more sections and add in images and GIFs
      over the years enough for me to want to look back at them from time to
      time.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      The focus in the future of this weekly post which I have aptly named
      "Entertainment News" for the past decade, will be to then allow easier
      search, filter and identification of content that has been written all
      this time, with a redo on most of the paging of the "series" so far, and
      including sitemaps and image archives if possible just as how I've done so
      for my GitHub page.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    <div>THE NOW YEARS</div>
    <div>
      This will be shorter than above I promise, because despite the many
      platforms and ways to watch Anime today (I personally have an active
      Amazon Prime account which you would know, has access to Prime Video which
      streams Anime, and then there's English licensed sites so Funimation and
      Crunchyroll), I still ended up wanting to dictate my thoughts somewhere
      where I can still take screenshots and write comments down where it
      matters (and that's how you get so many more quotes apart from each
      section's opening), because I spend time to reflect an think about stuff
      as I watch as many will do but in this case I just write them down, it's
      probably better to do the way that it has been so far, and (don't cancel
      me but) watch fansubs or get raw sources in order to make this so-called
      hobby of mine sustainable in the long run. Yeah, it's like YouTube
      reaction videos, but in text, that's how I view my Anime viewing
      experience now.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>
      In recent years too, I have also learnt enough Japanese to follow official
      sources (social media, official websites) to know more about the stuff
      behind Anime, behind-the-scenes stuff, special projects where the voice
      actors do stuff and honestly saying I like those a lot hehe, and if
      anything else, it was Anime that taught me Japanese. Well, not 100% I
      ended up listening to a lot of music and learnt stuff from the lyrics, but
      I would say this is the motivation to do so since great accompanying theme
      songs will make of great shows in the first place.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE ANIME PROFILE</div>
<div>
  At this point, I feel like I should talk about what my tastes and/or biases
  are in Anime, just go settle things right here and now so I can save you some
  time understanding me later down the post.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <b>
    I was initially very open to&nbsp;all sorts of genres walking into the world
    of Anime</b
  >, from the early days feeling the greatness of variety in comedic characters
  (WORKING!!!), blossoming romance in any situation (Hatsukoi Limited, cute
  girls in a band (K-ON!), exciting plot twists (at least, back then
  Kuroshitsuji was), mysteries for stuff that don't even relate (Yojouhan Shinwa
  Taikei), and much more. From adaptations to originals, I've had my share of
  seeing them in action, and this is what constituted my first 5 years from
  2008-2012.&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  It was afterwards picking up on more popular series (Attack on Titan, Nagi no
  Asukara) that started to make me think otherwise about my tastes in Anime.
  <b
    >I did still watch certain genres from time to time though that offer niche
    genres</b
  >
  because damn is it Anime if it's the same damn thing as real life drama
  series, but obviously, as you can see from the calendar below, I am more
  towards realistic genres along the lines of comedy and romance.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Why though? Because my focus changed over time. From the days of just seeing
  anything I liked, today I will consider things like animation, whether I liked
  the trailer and/or theme songs in it, and the voice cast because if you
  haven't been finding the people behind your favourite Anime characters you
  aren't as in this as I am. So you know,
  <b
    >many of these factors will come into deciding whether I will like anything
    today.</b
  >
  I can give you examples for days, but if something hits like a movie trailer
  when I first saw one for an Anime series... then that will be it. I will talk
  about my reasons for giving any new show a chance in my season previews so I
  guess those will be a good gauge of my tastes over time.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So I can only say that my profile now and my opinions whatsoever is pretty
  much surrounding this meme image as adapted from an
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/OVA" target="_blank">OVA</a> episode of
  "Seitokai Yakuindomo":

  Once again, this is in
  <b>no way representative of my opinions forever</b> because I can change and
  so do you, but as of now, this is what I feel about the stuff around Anime I
  know of, hopefully covering as many categories I can or I have experienced so
  far.

<div>
  "Fractale" is still by far, my favourite dystopian based worldview of the
  sci-fi future I desire and envision as I stand now. (Okay maybe not for the
  birth of the keys but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) This original series, along with "money vs
  future" economics suspense thriller "C" are the only action series which
  helped define the human-like futuristic world I desire to see in fiction, and
  has since shaped what my novel project "A Pack of Life" is based on today.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And boy do I not want to talk about "Glasslip" again. Pretty much the only
  reason why I picked this one up was from the Anime's theme songs: ChouCho sang
  a great summer song, and nano.RIPE ended up being one of my beloved Rock music
  artists. Everything else is not to say at all, because despite the decent
  animation and great music, the original series failed to write a solid plot or
  sound logic on the mystery of... whatever is happening, which makes it even
  more disappointing when the truth is revealed, if you have realized if that
  happened.

<div>
  "ACCA" is a simple choice as I like to watch shows with deliberate mystery, as
  we are brought into the journey of main guy Jean to travel the country for
  auditing purposes, only to then realize (spoiler alert) there was an ongoing
  coup d'état and he is fundamentally involved in it. So cool, the story is so
  well presented including the plot twist, everything else including the
  worldview is just so perfect, I would love to recommend this adaptation. And
  it's not because Lotta-chan is cute. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  "Red Data Girl" was honestly so bad, I keep reminding myself what was good
  about it or what was the reason for me to watch the Anime. Was it because of
  Hayami Saori? I don't think so. I think I was expecting some action or cool
  stuff at some point, but unlike "Koukyuu no Karasu" which despite its ancient
  dynasty context still had some action at the end with the build-up on plot,
  this one just has none, and even what was the slice-of-life parts didn't
  deliver. Also, destroying electronics? You need to stay away from me forever.

  This one was hard to choose, but if I have to mention a good one.... I still
  like "The Cat Returns" back when I was a student watching this Studio Ghibli
  classic in class (by the way) after the exams were over. It's the perfect
  fantasy adventure you would want to live as a kid similar to "Spirited Away"
  just without all the creepy stuff I guess, they have a certain magic. Outside
  of Ghibli though, "NakiNeko" can be that runner-up just being in relation to
  this masterpiece in terms of storytelling also serving as an ideal romance
  scenario in animation.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I legit thought "Kimisui" was supposed to be good and I totally enjoyed the
  story though with a sadder context, but it took a bad turn at the ending to a
  new level - a level so new, you wished it had ended with a standard crying bed
  scene because spoiler alert, she was stabbed by an aggressor. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> This
  is probably the reason why I will mention this in a negative light even if at
  all.

  I was an avid fan of listening to just music back then, so I appreciated more
  of Anime soundtracks especially in iconic scenes where it matters, or when the
  tunes appear more than often. I would say impact and me still caring about
  soundtrack back then is where I will be at, so it's no wonder the list here
  does not feature newer shows just because.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  For selections though, I went for "Kara no Kyoukai" and despite it being a
  dark movie (will explain later) it does have a strong, depressing view with a
  soundtrack written by Kajiura Yuki (which you might know better from the
  "Fate" series, this movie series is effectively its spin-off) and chorus sung
  by now disbanded Kalafina? Man, this was that perfection to an intro of a
  movie. This is the music that filters its audience. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> This was also
  what led me into the series and Kalafina, all music produced by Kajiura-sensei
  herself.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  As for the other two, they symbolize what I distinctively remember for the
  Anime I watch, whether it's the theme music or just something sad and quaint
  after a hectic day, these have never disappointed me. Shout out to Hashimoto
  Yukari (for "Toradora!") and Kousaki Satoru (for "WORKING!!!", "OreImo" or
  anything Aniplex) specifically for making great soundtracks whichever
  direction I go and meet them in.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Of course, there are other so many good ones out there that make the show they
  were in recent years, so I'm just listing these off my head to give you an
  idea what I liked back then that were so, so impactful.

    I would like to also give a shout out to a playlist(?) which I distinctively
    remembered I have burnt into a CD (back then) which is a great summary of
    the first 5 years of me listening to Anime soundtracks before I fell off, as
    seen below:

  Anime opening theme songs make the best of any series: They define what it is
  about the even set a worldview to anticipate and be excited about. For this,
  there can be so many produced by the animation (collaborated) music labels
  because they can have more control on the genre and style of what is, and thus
  song like those from Anime "K-ON!", "Chio-chan", or even "JoshiMuda" will be a
  hit. But we don't want to only about those intentional perfections (or flops),
  we want to talk about what's great and bad about making mainstream artists who
  are affiliated to these music labels, that come up with memorable songs to
  shows we remember.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  The best ones, I can remember, are those that define the series thanks to the
  artists themselves, by mistake or by spending time to make their craft go into
  the world of Anime. Ironically, it's also those long-run series who will have
  such rep, from ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION to Ikimonogakari back then to today's
  Anime artists dominating the Anison world... they are what makes of the best,
  but I still think of the oldies as when they brought me in. And the worst ones
  we don't talk about, and pray to the gods there are the ending theme songs to
  carry the impression for the show. Looking at you, Anime "KanoKano" and
  "DomeKano". <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  For Anime's ending theme songs though, as much as it's a sandbox for putting
  in anything related to the genre I think I have seen too many examples of
  songs going off the perpendicular; I have seen cover songs of oldies old
  enough I know of them (thanks "Tada-kun" and "Tenshi-sama") and they are just
  a lazy effort by production, I've seen ending theme songs done for each
  episode that the series existed ("OreImo" WTF but thanks to all the indie
  composers who participated), I've disliked those which aren't as great as
  their opening theme song coming in from Anime character songs and that's
  understandable lol I skip them anyways and I promise you it was tough finding
  them back to list here, but most importantly, the ones that make the most
  impact are the ones, which link to the end of every episode.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Why though? Because those who link their episode ends to the ending theme song
  create a plot transition, and those are just the best, making the twist happen
  not within the show only, but also outside to give one reflection and invoke
  further emotions to what is due to happen. Trust me, learning that from an
  emotional drama series like "Toradora!" hurts a lot, and that's how I knew.

  We have seen many Anime having sequels to their ADAPTATIONS (by the way) or
  their original work, and whether they have completed that from the source, for
  me it has always been a pain to wait for the next one and whether it'll
  deliver, known by me as "sequel drag". However, there are some series I would
  love to see them announce another season though many of which have been
  fulfilled in recent years (shout out to "Kuroshitsuji" still going, "Yojouhan"
  for giving it a proper ending despite being a light novel adaptation), so I
  will talk about the remaining ones that have never announced a sequel *prays*,
  or those in contrary I don't want to see (more) sequels of since, most likely
  my reason will be because, that they aren't that enjoyable in the first place
  and I have given it to them for the get-go from the first season. And now I
  have an obligation to see it through no matter how far they are from the
  initial boom, but that's just me.

  As I've learnt from bloggers from the early days of Random Curiosity, is that
  to give oneself a three-episode rule, as they will involve plot twists, and an
  implication of a summary of a series, sometimes the end of a first arc, sort
  of like a checkpoint, for you to decide whether this will be worth following
  through all the way. The ones listed I have followed on those rules for
  reasons that just make me generally not want to watch them through (typically
  involving horror and/or biological science that is <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> or just makes me
  <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span>), but one particular one I recall, I watched way more before giving it
  the thumbs down. Why? Because they showed me an implied sex scene. Between
  high schoolers. Yup, totally off the rails from what was just like a love
  betrayal series? Dude, we can do better. Even "Glasslip" was better- But we
  know the greatest mistakes are those we don't put down and have to deal with
  their presence from here on.

  You have been seriously warned about watching any of these (okay maybe just

  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> scenes or
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shimoneta" target="_blank">dirty jokes</a>
  or they are absolute tearjerkers or anything, but you might cry because many
  of these are just straight up core and in themes of life and death and more,
  enough to make you and I lose your appetites; It's that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yabai" target="_blank">bad</a>. You may say
  they were mistakes I have never put down because they still are quality drama
  despite how disturbing they are (and that kind of says what kind of depressed

    "BLEACH", which will be ending its final arc Anime adaptation by next year
    so we are technically celebrating this early, will still be the
    longest-standing and most beloved action series I have chosen to prefer over
    whatever others were available at that time. (Looking at you, Naruto and One
    Piece.) Nothing here will explain how much I wanted action scenes or sword
    releases to dominate my imaginative mind, and to see it happen in animation
    from the comics is only a dream come true, no matter how critical I can be
    of the Anime series those years ago and today. I will only thank for its
    completeness, if it hasn't made grounds in both media types already.

  On the contrary, this is likely what the Anime industry expects us to do after
  watching an Anime adaptation, and this is my only best example so far, so hear
  me out. Instead of desperately wanting a sequel which considerably has a
  conclusion for their Anime adaptation, I decided back then when I had a lot
  more time to do this, to binge or even follow on the latest chapters of the
  comic it was based on, and boy did it end in the most spectacular fashion
  ever, true to its style and storytelling, it definitely made me like this
  series about fortune more than I started. (Spoiler alert: Everyone became a
  Fortune God haha true chaos has arrived) I think that's enough for me to give
  them due credit just for introducing me to this story.

  I picked up these voice actors based on a few factors, including their voice
  acting and how often they appear in shows I watch, and I think this is an
  adequate representation of what I know of them to give them credit for. From
  Hayami Sho's iconic voice as Aizen Sousuke in "BLEACH" and evil principal in
  "Assassination Classroom", to Tsuda Kenjirou's deep voice that gets the female
  audience going (and I swear also on the looks too) even if he voices a horny
  father in "Ao-chan" haha, and I have to put my hat off to Suwabe-san for
  always delivering on his roles every time I see him, "Senko-san" and "GREAT
  PRETENDER" to name a few I've seen.&nbsp;

  For the female voice actors though, I may give a little exception due to my
  inclination of bias towards certain roles and/or voice behind, so don't mind
  me showing appreciation to veterans like Hocchan and Kana-chan and the like
  just because they are pretty much the bulk of my liking Anime characters
  throughout and perhaps beyond. Ede-chan here though is just worth a mention
  purely because of her efforts in voice acting in the Anime I see here in, and
  I cannot describe how much that transfers to her image and my love for all of
  this in general.

  Also known as "gap moe", this segment(?) is dedicated to the (typically
  female) voice actors who have shown outstanding voice acting ability by not
  just sounding different, but because it's so far away from their usual acting
  voice, will make me stand on end on how they sound otherwise. In this case
  though, instead of the end result being cuter than the usual, some of them
  start from the usual, as seen in Aki-chan who voiced
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/40869/Meegan" target="_blank"
    >a matured woman in "FRACTALE"</a
  >
  and blew my mind even though it was just a minor character, and I know using
  Naganawa Maria here is kind of cheating, but have you ever heard
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9O92jqfEKQ" target="_blank"
    >her matured voice</a
  >? Yeah, it's just different, and I only have examples in video games so not
  going to touch on them too much. Sumipe is likely the only one who voices cute
  roles normally so not as herself, and it's when she voiced characters who
  sound like herself but behaving otherwise (<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/104733/Fuuki_Iinchou"
    target="_blank"
    >see "Aho Girl"</a
  >) that makes them excel and/or make me like them more.

  What took the world (or at least Japan) more than a year ago, this cute girl
  music band slice-of-life series is anything but, and that's just half the
  story, because pretty much everyone in the main cast is basking on its
  success: Toyosaki Aki is renowned for her uniquely adorable voice, Hikasa
  Youko is veteran and a jack of all trades, even Taketatsu Ayana went to become
  one of the most popular voice actresses to date. Even if Satou Satomi and
  Kotobuki Minako did not achieve the success of the other members from this
  series, I still ended up following them just because, until they all become
  the married women we all expected. For what might not look like them, their
  impressions on me have never faded since then, and I can only be more than
  happy I picked this one up to know of them.

  This is just a personal preference, where I will talk about a little how much
  these voices make my Anime experience infinitely better for no reason.
  Naturally, they fall into the idolism territory so don't mind me speaking my
  mind out here. Mikakoshi and Nu-chan typically appear in places I least expect
  of them and they turned out better than I thought (shout out to

  I have real strict requirements with respect to action series, and I'm sorry
  about that, but the idea that there is human extension of power AND the main
  weapon of choice is a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/katana" target="_blank">katana</a> TOTALLY
  got me when I started reading and watching "BLEACH" all those years ago, and
  competing franchises do not even come close. (I do not include the drag that
  is filler arcs for this analysis) But many of those I watch today are also due
  to this, whether it is through tools or just made up from magic or whatever
  phenomenon. Other than that, I will appreciate a unique worldview as seen from
  "Bungou Stray Dogs" and how they use literary authors of the past century as
  material (so they don't get copyright infringement lol), and to a smaller
  extent proper plot progression because who cares about never-ending series I
  can't even stand how long the "Attack on Titan" series took to conclude.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Some of these were even used in my personal light novel project "A Pack of
  Life"; The duel setting was based on "Shakugan no Shana" portals which stop
  time all while letting the action carry on within the space, which I thought
  was really cool. "Kekkaishi" also deserves a worthy mention because of how
  much physics they can go with just the barriers alone before they had to use
  OP stuff, to be frank.

  For this though, as you can see the crazy amount of titles I watched from this
  genre, you would know that I am more than just a sarcastic individual.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So I take my jokes very seriously, but then again it's really
  anything floats, I would expect jokes to land properly to not be
  disappointing, not to take itself too seriously, and have memorable characters
  which at this point can be supplemented by the voice behind so don't mind me
  liking "Komi-san" here just because Koga Aoi is main girl (and also it has
  great 2000s comedy vibes), or the reverse where I ended up liking the "Asobi
  Asobase" main trio just because of the voice actresses and I recall watching
  this live through VPN on Abema TV without subtitles, by the way. Those were
  great, confusing times. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> "Chio-chan" I would say in summary is the
  best balance of all of this it was worth watching time and again always making
  me laugh, also cringe if you have seen the girls dance especially on the
  livestream special back then with Oozora Naomi and Omigawa Chaki doing it. I
  will always remember Ede-chan laughing at the background the whole time I
  can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  Honourable mentions include "JoshiMuda" which is fine but the main girl is a
  total idiot which I really don't like along with "Aho Girl" but the rest of
  the cast did make up for it.

  I don't think I have ever been a fan of drama series considering I left drama
  to watch Anime which has pretty much every other genre out there, but those
  who are good tend to hit, starting from "Toradora!" which started it
  all.&nbsp;We won't talk about and also I'm not keen on those drama that is
  just The Great Depression, so at least some form of comedy or romance or
  something must be involved, is my point. Specifically though, those who excel
  are also those that make a point on their story, enough to make me cry on of
  course more true to live themes like family and romance, but other stuff less
  subtle and relatable do work on me too, but don't quote on me there.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  "Skip to Loafer" is probably the latest in the lines of not staying too much
  for the storytelling but be able to tell stories of all the characters
  beautifully, similar to "Yesterday wo Utatte" and it's not because this was
  aired when Hanazawa Kana was still single. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Anyways haha, touching
  scenes, memorable soundtracks but I think this is to a lesser extent and more
  on theme songs (see ending theme songs section for details), and strong plot
  twists are what I will look out for to leave an impression.

  I wonder how I should explain my 2nd favourite genre of Anime to watch in
  recent years, purely because they are easier to digest, but less relatable as
  I grow up from a high school student to a working adult, so nowadays I just
  tend to go for more adult working area slice-of-life stories which are kind of
  present these days in contrast to the overwhelming high school setting
  everyone seems to be going at which is kind of stale even watching it for a
  decade and a half. In this genre though, if chill feels and strong character
  types aren't a thing for you to go by, then this might never be for you. From
  tsundere cat(?) Tsumiki and Ookubo Rumi is totally not my fuel after this and
  "Servant x Service" too lol, to Futaba in "Senpai ga Uzai" just representing
  most kids never growing up nowadays I can't even, to even "Slow Start" which
  balanced their character developments all around it's actually ironic to
  ignore the actual stories that were going on with whatever Eiko-chan is doing.

<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I would say "Kawaisou" is also a good runner-up on this, once again if there
  are memorable characters and a tad bit of comedy infused into it, "Senko-san"
  if you can picture the main guy as me, "Koufuku Graffiti" if you are super
  into food p*rn, but I can go on forever. Not all topics will hit though, and I
  can promise you I have skipped entire seasons of them because their topics are
  not of interest to me. What was the girls riding on motorbike one? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  Ah, the dream I have never attained in real life. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Besides being a
  great mockery of my single life watching couples come together through various
  means and circumstances, it is definitely hard to make them better because of
  how unique the circumstances have to be seeing that you know, falling on top
  of one another or seeing each other naked isn't exactly exciting for anyone
  anymore. (Notice I did not include an "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi"
    target="_blank"
    >ecchi</a
  >" genre in here just because, or else "Love Hina" would be a staple) So for
  me nowadays at least, the sweeter the main (or secondary) couple(s) can be,
  the better, and that is hoping it isn't without heavy dramatization to not
  make this a tearjerker.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Otherwise, you would be glad to see that "Tsurezure Children" has unique
  stories of many couples up the wall one might as well start with this and I'm
  still paying (passively) for the licensed manga till date (though it has
  concluded years ago, but I'm taking my time), and that should give you a good
  idea of how this genre works in general. "Kaibutsu-kun" takes credit in just
  life-changing one's circumstances, teaching the studious girl that one's
  soulmate can appear anywhere around them at any time even if he's weird or
  just plain handsome (lmao), and I think "KimiSomu" is probably the best in
  progression in recent memory. I mean, there's "Tada-kun" which was pretty
  impressive for an Anime original, and "Shikimori-san" for a twist in
  circumstances each with its own story to tell, and I think this is why I can
  never get tired of them yet.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I would also argue that most of the (not Studio Ghibli) Anime movies I watch
  are even more worthy of praise for this genre along haha why do I watch only
  those movies though? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

  Now we come to the minority stuff I watch in genre, because honestly speaking?
  Mystery series are hard to stand on its own and still be good, or else every
  action series or even "ACCA" will make of a good mystery. Still, I think that
  having plot twists and stuff is vital for such a genre even if I would expect
  a more proper resolution even if you don't lead me on anything because I'm not
  that smart and you can make me confused until halfway through the series, I'm
  totally fine with that.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I did not get the mystery on "F in Naru" but damn is it intriguing thinking
  about how that can work back then (spoiler alert there was enough years for
  the same woman locked in the room to be replaced), and "UN-GO" I would argue
  is kind of cheating with this genre and that's why I prefer not to talk about
  this along with the fantasy genre (which we will cover later) since one will
  never understand enough to be a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/meitantei" target="_blank"
    >great detective</a
  >
  at any point and the solution can just be magic for all I know which is cringe
  in my opinion. Point is, the more true to life for the plot the better, which
  makes London history-based series "Kuroshitsuji" earn a spot even if there are
  many more I can mention, and despite having a demon on our hands. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  There are other interesting plots for mystery like "TanMoshi" with the
  recollection dump and "GREAT PRETENDER" if you like to be in crime yet know of
  nothing every single moment.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I think I'm just too dumb to understand mystery series lmao</div>

  For this? I have to say, I don't have much requirements, and it's really due
  to unique circumstances. The more unique the better, and hopefully not on
  generic fantasy stuff like magic and magic though I would argue "MajoTabi"
  taking up this spot is precisely because it is done so well with an
  interesting worldview and immersive storytelling though I was told that the
  original work was more depressing, like Elaina would eventually be so poor she
  has to work on the streets. So yeah, please more sequels hehe, and apart from
  this exception, I will take

    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank"
      >alternative world</a
    >
    plots where someone suddenly appears in another world for some reason</b
  >
  (though "BLEACH" is technically one so welp), and I chose "Houseki no Kuni"
  because damn is the idea of the moon people such a intriguing thing the
  stellar cast pales in contrast to the story (or not hehe emo Mikakoshi is
  <span class="emoji" title="😚">*chef's kiss*</span>), and I think many people agree with "NagiAsu" on their
  storytelling and worldview of sea people which I appreciate.

<div>
  In summary, I would like to think that, many of
  <b>the international audience will think very otherwise form my thoughts</b>,
  that maybe, just maybe, I'm more aligned with the Japanese audience but haha
  that's also unlikely since I browse through Japanese forums too and I see
  polarizing opinions, but yeah, I like to have different opinions, things like
  soft appeal and impactful minor scenes; I like that I always will have a niche
  opinion wherever I go but no one to talk to. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>

  <div>THE ANIME GOODS</div>
  <div>
    Though I told myself these aren't real and it's better to support 3D girls
    then spend money on 2D girls lol that was long ago, but in years going
    forward and to not fill up my room, I would wish to buy some Anime goods in
    remembrance of those shows I have watched and liked. That is the ideal,
    something that every show has sold in common... the only thing I knew about
    are badges, so maybe I will start from that soon enough of whenever I want
    to drag myself to Japan to buy them since it's hard to buy them for the vast
    15 years of shows online. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  </div>
  <div>
    <br />So far though? You may have known some of them here and there, and
    it's mostly for "BLEACH" so far. From

      >karuta cards</a

    series I have watched thus far, so they deserve some form of repayment. But
    I might be extending soon, as said above I am trying to find a common item
    to buy that does not take up space (it is the digital age after all), so we
    shall see how that goes moving forward.

<div>
  This shall be it! May I watch many more years of Anime and love the dynamic of
  real people voicing behind more ideal characters (lol) and NEVER like the
  movie industry or Netflix or whatever but we shall see, I'm only starting even
  though it has been 15 years already. I mean, I can go on forever talking about
  the stuff I like about all the Anime I watch but why would I? Maybe it's time
  for you to experience it for yourself. <span class="emoji" title="👍">*thumbs up*</span>

  P.S. Oh by the way, my Q&amp;A did not include ranking or even rating of Anime
  characters because not only is it unimportant to me (though when I started I
  thought

  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/28/Yui_Horie" target="_blank"
    >Hocchan</a
  >
  more <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>), I also judge shows now based on the voices behind them. But
  yeah, I do like Anime characters within their shows, so you can't exactly ask
  me to rank them-

  P.P.S. ROLEPLAY TIME!! Haha because of my love for the voices behind Japanese
  animation, here is some (just some) of the role(s) I can imagine they would be
  involved in my life:
</div>
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>A father who sounded like Hayami Show (or Miki Shinichirou)</li>
    <li>
      <strike> A mother who sounded&nbsp;like</strike> [I have no idea haha,
      never had that desire]
    </li>
    <li>An elder sister who sounded&nbsp;like Toyosaki Aki</li>
    <li>
      A younger sister who <strike>sounded like</strike> is Natsukawa Shiina
      (hehe)
    </li>
    <li>A long time friend who sounded like Asakura Momo</li>
    <li>
      A (jealous) girlfriend <strike>who sounded like</strike> Koga Aoi
      (hehehehe)
    </li>
    <li>
      A high school classmate who sounded like Amamiya Sora whom I never had the
      courage to confess to because she's perfect
    </li>
    <li>
      A woman whom which I might share a physically intimate relationship with
      <strike>who sounded like</strike> Kouno Marika (umph)
    </li>
    <li>A childhood friend who sounded like Nagae Rika (or Kanno Mai)</li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    ... Not going to describe more because you can catch up on The Fanfiction
    series in this very blog to find out if most of them were true. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    I'm done!
