  Ah hey, welcome back. Really didn't expect to do this again after taking just
  a month's break, but here we are. Forgive me if I didn't keep up the standards
  on this though, she has high standards here as with all other women fictional
  me is going to interact with. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  This one in particular, we are kickstarting off to celebrate someone's
  birthday in about two days time, so don't mind me doing this earlier as with
  our regular schedule so I can get back to do up posts for the weekend (now
  that I don't have a laundry list of Anime to watch) so to, you know, put more
  of them into my fictional life. Ah, such is fiction, isn't it?

      window seat and she immediately noticed the new item in town. She
      immediately took an order without waiting for me. She enjoyed the drink,
      the sides were fries which she said she missed, but when it came to the
      burger, she looked at it for a moment and went silent.</i

  Man, do I wish I can be this friendly with Akarin. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, I was
  trying to create a feel that she has with her colleagues ie. friends at work,
  what do you think? Oh, I'm not married? OOPS lmao can we not burn our dear
  girl here, she is going to leave us virgins behind after releasing that new
  single which I will be reviewing in a couple of weeks. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We will have
  more of her coming back though, as with my schedule so far, and I might just
  extend this to the end of the year just because I missed writing this even
  though it's cheesy and will never happen in real life. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Ok Aozaki
  Shouhei say goodbye to these losers here haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Trust me when I say I scoured the fanclub images and videos (for this one
  was from the fanclub goods last year) to confirm what she was eating in that
  image because if there is anything about this series I will keep a standard
  of, is descriptive accuracy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I have to fill the alt text dude I
  can't lie
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Akarin looking to the top right is a fan-observed symbol of her using
  her brain or lying if I'm not wrong, as seen from a YouTube clip compilation.
  *searches for vid* Wow I can't believe I can't find this, am I hallucinating?
  lol whatever this is part of the script now I will use it to my advantage haha
