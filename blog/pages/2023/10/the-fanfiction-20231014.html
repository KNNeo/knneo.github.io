<div>Ah hey, welcome back. Really didn't expect to do this again after taking just a month's break, but here we are. Forgive me if I didn't keep up the standards on this though, she has high standards here as with all other women fictional me is going to interact with. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>This one in particular, we are kickstarting off to celebrate someone's birthday in about two days time, so don't mind me doing this earlier as with our regular schedule so I can get back to do up posts for the weekend (now that I don't have a laundry list of Anime to watch) so to, you know, put more of them into my fictional life. Ah, such is fiction, isn't it?</div><div><br></div><div>Without further ado, let's!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Kitou Akari eating a potato fry looking top right out of the window, sitting in a fast food restaurant with a burger on a plate placed away from her" border=0 data-original-height=355 data-original-width=512 height=139 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl918771.jpg title="Kitou Akari" width=200></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>It has been a while since Kitou Akari and I hung out together downtown. She has cut her hair down, and looked fashionable. Of course, she is now a celebrity and all, we are barely friends now.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>She chose a fast food chain we used to eat. How nostalgic, we used to spend afternoons studying in groups during college. We sat down at a window seat and she immediately noticed the new item on the menu. She immediately took an order without waiting for me. She enjoyed the drink, the sides were fries which she said she missed, but when it came to the burger, she looked at it for a moment and went silent.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>She shoved the plate towards me. When I asked her why, she said she just wanted to try but changed her mind. As she promptly took another order, I leaned back in disbelief; She has not changed at all.</i></div><em><br></em><div><i><abbr title=新しいことを試させてくれるのが好き。>"I like how you are here to let me try out new things."</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I pause in my actions before I dismissed what she said. I looked back at her. She looks away to the top right, chipping away at her potato fry.</i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Man, do I wish I can be this friendly with Akarin. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, I was trying to create a feel that she has with her colleagues ie. friends at work, what do you think? Oh, I'm not married? OOPS lmao can we not burn our dear girl here, she is going to leave us virgins behind after releasing that new single which I will be reviewing in a couple of weeks. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> We will have more of her coming back though, as with my schedule so far, and I might just extend this to the end of the year just because I missed writing this even though it's cheesy and will never happen in real life. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Ok Aozaki Shouhei say goodbye to these losers here haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Trust me when I say I scoured the fanclub images and videos (for this one was from the fanclub goods last year) to confirm what she was eating in that image because if there is anything about this series I will keep a standard of, is descriptive accuracy. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I have to fill the alt text dude I can't lie</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. Akarin looking to the top right is a fan-observed symbol of her using her brain or lying if I'm not wrong, as seen from a YouTube clip compilation. *searches for vid* Wow I can't believe I can't find this, am I hallucinating? lol whatever this is part of the script now I will use it to my advantage haha</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
