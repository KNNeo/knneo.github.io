  No, not about getting another job lol though we should get those resumes sent
  out soon hehe, but heck, do you even remember watching the whole of Anime
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B-gata_H-kei" target="_blank"
    >"B Gata H Kei"</a
  >? Like, to completion?? (Get it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>) Alright, this sounds awkward to
  talk about anyways and IF you have never seen it before, think of whatever dog
  Anime earlier this year, but it's not dog. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, I used to watch this
  stuff back in 2010 when sh*t like&nbsp;<a

  Anyways, let's not let this ruin the new shows on stage, we can't keep
  thinking about s*x either to let's think of 3P!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We will be watching
  two of them this week... <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> (No really, two shows, not like, because there
  are two women lmao)

  Oh come on, I thought the intro will be "I'm going to live with Naoya-kun and
  the others. Somehow this is better than I expected" LMAO because you know,
  Shino-san likes the dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode of a series I don't
  need to remind you who's in love with the guy (#KanoKano14), because spoiler
  alert, everyone is. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay maybe not Risa-chan she can be our idol for
  now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, Shino did hint to us again, in case you have not heard,
  that she is to make sure her friend Saki-chan takes her place in being with
  the guy she likes. Simple enough... or is it? Now that we have a better idea
  of how she is involved in all of this, let's talk about how all of this has
  progressed so far. I mean, I wished I could refer to a dam exploding and
  ruining the lives of people downstream, but this is worse. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> For
  starters, Shino-san is a transfer student back in middle school when she met
  Saki-chan. Shino would think that because of her intellect and she was only
  transferred to this school because the family moved house, that she might be
  left alone considering she walked into this a month later than everyone else.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> How did
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/34785/Rie_Takahashi" target="_blank"
    >Rieri</a
  >
  end up in the "smartest girl in class but doesn't get laid" role again? Why...
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Thanks to the persistence of Saki-chan though, they became friends.
  Somehow I feel so bad for both of them including Ayaneru, for having to deal
  with this comedy, and the acting. I sincerely apologize on behalf of the
  author and the casting director for doing such hideous, harmful things to you
  washboards. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp; Shino then also knew of Saki's also persistent
  childhood friend who keeps confessing to her every month. Despite having up to
  36 chances to confess to the girl he likes, we know the drill, Saki still
  chose to push him away until something probably happened and the promise was
  to fulfil his wish when they go to high school blah blah which you know of the
  plot today. But since Shino was friends with Saki and felt bad for the one guy
  who kept crawling up to her (lmao) (I'll let you guess which one hehe), Shino
  decided to help him out. You know, by jerkin' his gerkin'- By uh, making his
  confession more impactful so that you know, best(?) friend gets a good
  boyfriend. We don't talk about what happened in the changing room lmao (Yeah
  she might make a great model for clothes to give Saki-chan... but at least
  check on the bust size haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>), but you know, gifting stuff sure is a way
  to get Saki-chan. I mean, she can buy two portable consoles for the sake of
  playing with others, so why not? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All this for Shino to stay away
  from her friend's happiness? She knows, dude. she knows. (Shout out to that
  VELTPUNCH song) So despite what we think will be a perfect couple scenario if
  Shino were to take Naoya for her own... As I said, it's okay, you can
  technically do this. Then he'll actually be in a monogamy as all things should
  be. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Jokes aside, and I feel like we should shift our focus to the
  actual drama of the episode, when Shino actually confronts the person who
  started it all: Minase Nagisa. Yeah, logically thinking, Nagisa did think that
  confessing to Naoya even though she has a girl and will get rejected is a
  thing, but contrary to what we know, the guy's an idiot, so he runs a gaming
  PC with a normal PC even with a single core CPU. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You tell him,
  Shino-san, you tell him. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... damn this is quite an episode
  I did not expect. We are moving the drama in real quick just to set the stage,
  we only get the MeTubers appearing in the thumbnails. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Still, I
  appreciate the explanation of the relationships so far even with some serious
  drama talk and not like Shino can't be mad at that girl or the food, but she
  is being nice, and that'll probably will carry her till her friend's...
  downfall? I mean, the only downfall is when she is on top of Naoya- Speaking
  of which, we will have more of that, mind you (haha), in the upcoming summer
  festival next episode! Nice, <em>nice</em>. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I sometimes ask myself how
  much porno I watch as an adult, and I wonder if I have to at all since, you
  know, look at this episode, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I just happen to have the capacity to deal with other people's
  problems." Yeah that's what makes Shino-san nice I have this capacity and I
  don't even-]

  FINALLY get some action...? Come on please, I can't come up with misleading
  clickbait. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, coming back to this, we have more flashbacks, but
  let's see if I can piece them up together. Firstly, the fight. Remember last
  week where a bunch of high schoolers were doing some showdown on the rooftop
  of some school? Yeah, surprising how the students haven't been evacuated yet.
  Oh, it was a Sunday. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, they gave the dates but didn't say the day
  of week so how would I have calculated that? What was calculated though, were
  some of the tactics shown on ground. The laser sight to throw the opponent off
  who apparently were sent by the government, the hoodie which apparently is
  some torso and not just a hoodie? I will talk about what I think in a moment,
  but with this our dear boy Kuro here gained the upper hand. I mean, if you
  can't see one's torso that maybe weird but if ninja are famous with their arms
  and you can't see them... you see where I'm going here? Next up, the Russian
  agent. Looks like this foreigner isn't just here for the upcoming Comiket
  lmao, but under orders of some employer who has her daughter hostage (that
  motherf**ker just stealth killed someone on Germany streets WTF) and wants him
  to dig out the ninja so you know, world politics involving Putin or something.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You think Putin knows something about this? Haha they probably
  ordered to not stop airing this series, I think. Yeah, they are in the sponsor
  list? Uh oh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Still doesn't permit you to declare war on small
  nations though) (bruh) ANYHOW I don't want to be cancelled at least let me
  live till the end of this review lol, the Russian did end up encountering some
  ninja even though I doubt snipping off three dongs are needed to help him get
  there since as they have mentioned before, they are indeed out there in the
  wild so it isn't hard to find them. Bro, just kill people until they resist,
  that's how you find ninja, right? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Didn't expect him to live long
  though, Kuro-san has been dispatched to take care of him. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Which will
  explain the rooftop showdown since someone else caught wind of this guy? Last
  but not least, that old man. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Besides being a nuisance as part of the
  opening animation (lmao), and walking around the neighbourhood touting his
  fresh breast milk lol and I think I know why now, he is also, as the
  deliveryman in disguise which is also running for a ninja organization pointed
  out, a retired ninja in disguise. Top level too. Which also kind of explains
  why he has the same torso as Kuro-san over there but his is more advanced
  since it can be manifested in a form of a hoodie instead of, and this is what
  I think, swapped out of a female ninja. Yeah, you thinking what I'm thinking
  now? And boy did he just disappear after little pep talk with Katou the
  deliveryman. All in all... I'm keen, as a ninja. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Not in the breast
  milk lmao, but the rest of all this. They might have got me already, if the
  first episode isn't much of an indicator. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, I'll watch another
  week to make the decision, how about that? So far though, I think we finally
  have something going on. Retired ninja? Your country's best covert force
  controlled by United Nations after the war? Private organizations having to be
  taken down by the government? What more of society can this not be? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  I'll stay around, hopefully next week will be the conclusion to the current
  day fight. You can't take me down anyways I have the 4.0 too, this one makes
  me invisible to Internet comments haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I think I am going to be very surprised that (1) this isn't a
  <strike>Naruto</strike>&nbsp;ninja Anime ripoff lol thank goodness and (2)
  what a modern take on ninja in fictional Japan would be like. I'm hyped to see
  whether this can deliver to be the next action series I watch.]

  You know what this series is about. You know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> It's about 3P- In
  fact, it's as much as <strike>100</strike> 101P, you ever heard of that?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well thank goodness this series will down it up to our level to make
  sure we will still be able to like this without having to run a quantum
  computer brain in the first episode (#Hyakkano01) because we shall start with
  the first two. Yes, to start this train wreck, let us be introduced to main
  guy Rentarou. As his name may have implied and in contrary to that, his love
  life so far walking into high school has been rough. He confessed to a girl in
  middle school and boy did she reject him good, and it's not just this one.
  Just middle school he confessed 100 times and got rejected by all of them?
  Bro, even the KFC guy got it off better than you. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, which
  also means he understands how sad it is to confess to someone and get
  rejected, but also, he is still single. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Problem, you say, so he asks
  the God in the shrine for advice, and viola! He has a solution for him. Since
  he asked for soulmates, the lord is kind enough to bestow him... A HUNDRED of
  them. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, he did ask for it. He just didn't say how many.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or maybe God made a user error in his paper form and we all wonder
  why technology couldn't have done this better. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yes, this is too many
  fourth wall breaks even with the Tokyo Ghoul reference so I shall ignore that
  and move on haha the author is offended you didn't laugh at his jokes. (BRO,
  JUST BE FRIENDS WITH THE "KOMI-SAN" AUTHOR I BET YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER
  haha) Also did God also tell you to not reject your soulmate or else they will
  literally lose their "soul" because you didn't "mate" them? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Quality
  jokes, me, better than this sh*t Anime. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, it's eerily close to
  a situation where the guy cannot reject both of the girls who just
  confessed(?) (I would argue for the cold-hearted one but) (haha) to him and
  it's as if he has to accept both of them and date them both. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> And he
  thought about it, keeping to traditions. So wait, he's not even doing a
  polygamy- He's just going to cheat on all of them? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/186040/Naoya_Mukai" target="_blank"
    >Naoya from "KanoKano"</a
  >, you gotta take notes. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oh never mind, he dated both of them HAHA
  way to go, sir, you have done things that <em>couldn't</em>&nbsp;have been
  imagined at this point. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Personally? I know this is a very hard
  decision, but in this case I will have to kill my dearest Hondo Kaede,
  since&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/deredere" target="_blank">shy</a>
  Anime girls are what brought me into the world of Anime, so me in Anime would
  choose... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We can't kill them yet, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because they are so
  lovely and let's bring our attention to the first two girls after deliberating
  for so long, we have Hanazono-san who is aggressive in loving someone and that
  is still an understatement but kind of clumsy so you know, hopeless romantic
  might be a better description of her rack <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> and... just do yourself a
  favour and find out what "<a
    href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere"
    target="_blank"
    >tsundere</a
  >" are because what, it's not like I'll explain to you just because you're
  dumb! Haha ah hey. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... Hmm... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sorry, I'm just
  thinking of punching myself if I were to pick up this series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because
  for real though, I can see where this is going, and of course they are not
  going to pump 100 soulmates for this guy in high school alone lol the rest
  will appear in college because who finds lifetime partners at the workplace
  haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, but more than that, I'm thinking whether the animation and jokes
  will hit. So far though? It has been a mixed bag. I'm reluctant to think that
  it's something worth watching for a season long, but then again I feel like I
  can find something <em>so</em> much better paced in storytelling and not as lame
  to laugh at and <em>so damn tryhard</em> (lol)&nbsp;every week just to remind me
  that God may have played a joke on me and filled in "0" for the number of
  soulmates I'm going to have. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> So yeah, maybe a couple (get it?) more
  episodes then, maybe I'll be able to accept them all. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> All one hundred
  episodes of NO NO NO NO NO haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I feel like the easiest thing to do to deal with this, call me crazy,
  is to never give them an answer. They can't die if I don't say anything,
  right? Yeah make Rentarou a mute and problem solved lol also make him the
  <a href="https://www.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/569240-ICANT" target="_blank"
    >ICANT Twitch emote</a
  >
  too since he has to deal with all the upcoming confessions lmao]

  because damn despite their roll of songs coming into my music library I think
  I am getting used thus getting bored of their style so maybe I take a break
  from them I guess. I have not gotten bored of

  though since the B-side is also a love song and it's actually not that bad so

  just because the title song is interesting and not like a samba music B-side
  will get me. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, no Anime artists showdown we are not going to
  compare whose

  normal things under the spotlight of the media-<br />
  <br />
  Well, more news on not Twitter which I will talk about this week, not much
  though. Following last week,

      >Natsukawa Shiina released a new song preview</a

  and it isn't bad but then again even if this is likely the title song I will
  give it due care when the album is out next month. What was probably more
  interesting is

  and hmm it isn't awesome but it definitely feels different from their usual
  style I have to say. If I remember to watch this then

  will be interesting to see considering Japan hardly ever cares about not
  YouTube nowadays lol. I would think this might be promoting their new single
  or even mentioning about

  and I like to say I actually know who they are because boy, did they help
  write an Anime's opening theme song which I liked so yeah, brought in life for
  the song to be frank. Last but not least,

  during her fanclub event and artist 5th anniversary today, so yay more songs I
  guess.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />Next week will hopefully *legit* be a quiet week and we are near the end
  of the year already (we just hit 200 songs for the year and my tinnitus is
  acting up again lol) (if you asked, yes haha) since there's only
  <b>The Floor's new song</b> so maybe we can check out other songs if we need
  to but then again I just watched RyokuShaka's live over the weekend so maybe
  we watch more rock festival videos? You know, to prepare for next year's
  initial stack haha yeah I prepare such things beforehand or else the first
  paragraph will be a one-liner lol<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  So my plan for Anime next week is (hehe) if I end up only watching 2 new shows
  this season (including "KanoKano") then I might pick up previous season's
  shows to watch, since I now knew some of them which were good. Yeah, likely
  "Shiawase na Kekkon" since my sis watched it and we know, WE KNOW!! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  There is a good ending, people, despite how bad the trailer makes it look
  like. So probably that. See you guys next time then, and until then I am still
  pondering about my Anime choices because damn

  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because you know, why not? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Man, Anime is a thing in Japan,
  just so you know. And I'll probably do up that Anime Q&amp;A post sometime
  soon haha bye
