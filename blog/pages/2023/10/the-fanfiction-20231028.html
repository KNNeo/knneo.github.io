<div>Happy birthday Toyosaki Aki!! Haha for once we should cut to the chase.</div><div><br></div><div>So yeah, this week onwards which was the planned run from now till end of the year, but you know, I had to put in two weeks of ex-girlfriend lore just because. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay, moving forward though, as I would like to subtitle "the married women special" haha ah, I shall write about fictional me with you know, currently married bunch of women. You know, the upside of this is I don't have to change my lore if they DO get married because they already have. Yeah, can we have a spicy divorce? I should not have said that lmao I wish them happiness even if they aren't me.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, let's get this going! I wonder who is featured this week... <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Toyosaki Aki dressed in a white top and short jeans, riding on a sky blue bicycle" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=360 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/g3148296.jpg title="Toyosaki Aki" width=141></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>For a year's summer holidays during my university life, I had to work part-time at a bicycle rental store. It was facing the beach with a lot of foot traffic, it was busy but they paid well so I didn't mind taking in the views while I earned some allowance.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>On the first month of my shift though, a lady who registered herself as "Toyosaki Aki" changed my perspective of summer entirely. I helped her find a bicycle suitable for her height with ample space for her long legs, which without a pair of shorts sure is shining brighter than the evening sun. After I finished pumping air on her bike wheels, I turned back and squatted down to continue doing my other tasks. It was until she said something that made me raise my brows and look towards her.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=準備完了！誰かついてくれないかな～>"Preparations are all done! It would be great if someone were to join me..."</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>Soon after, my shift was over. The boss then saw what happened and allowed me to grab a bicycle for an hour. That was the best hour I had that weekend.</i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>Hmm, so Aki-chan's relationship to fictional me. Pure acquaintances, shall be the theme over here and likely over the next few posts but who knows if I will change my mind, but I intend to let these stories be stuff that fictional me would have experienced just hanging out in public and meeting people. Because seriously, we can't write a love story plot they are already married I might as well be her puppy at this point. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Coming back to reality though, fictional me would not have agreed to go along with her if not for her charm which has been rubbing off on me since when I started watching Anime all those years ago, and is probably still it with her newest solo artist album a couple of years ago. This is... pretty humble for a story for how much I have liked her over the years, to be frank. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><div><br></div><div>P.S. Yes, the mention of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/namaashi target=_blank>bare legs</a> is a thing haha I HOPE SHE BROUGHT HER SUNSCREEN lmao (no seriously though I didn't bring any or if you want to buy from our shop? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>)</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
