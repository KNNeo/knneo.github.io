  Happy birthday Toyosaki Aki!! Haha for once we should cut to the chase.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah, this week onwards which was the planned run from now till end of the
  year, but you know, I had to put in two weeks of ex-girlfriend lore just
  because. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay, moving forward though, as I would like to subtitle
  "the married women special" haha ah, I shall write about fictional me with you
  know, currently married bunch of women. You know, the upside of this is I
  don't have to change my lore if they DO get married because they already have.
  Yeah, can we have a spicy divorce? I should not have said that lmao I wish
  them happiness even if they aren't me.

      >For a year's summer holidays during my university life, I had to work
      part-time at a bicycle rental store. It was facing the beach with a lot of
      foot traffic, it was busy but they paid well so I didn't mind taking in
      the views while I earned some allowance.</i

    <i
      >On the first month of my shift though, a lady who registered herself as
      "Toyosaki Aki" changed my perspective of summer entirely. I helped her
      find a bicycle suitable for her height with ample space for her long legs,
      which without a pair of shorts sure is shining brighter than the evening
      sun. After I finished pumping air on her bike wheels, I turned back and
      squatted down to continue doing my other tasks. It was until she said
      something that made me raise my brows and look towards her.</i

Hmm, so Aki-chan's relationship to fictional me. Pure acquaintances, shall be
the theme over here and likely over the next few posts but who knows if I will
change my mind, but I intend to let these stories be stuff that fictional me
would have experienced just hanging out in public and meeting people. Because
seriously, we can't write a love story plot they are already married I might as
well be her puppy at this point. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Coming back to reality though,
fictional me would not have agreed to go along with her if not for her charm
which has been rubbing off on me since when I started watching Anime all those
years ago, and is probably still it with her newest solo artist album a couple
of years ago. This is... pretty humble for a story for how much I have liked her
over the years, to be frank. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>

<div>
  P.S. Yes, the mention of legs is a thing haha I HOPE SHE BROUGHT HER SUNSCREEN
  lmao (no seriously though I didn't bring any or if you want to buy from our
  shop? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>)
