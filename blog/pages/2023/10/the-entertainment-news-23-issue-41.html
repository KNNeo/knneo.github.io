again. *ahem*

  Ah, the scent of a new season of Anime in the air, one would have not noticed
  time has flown by that fast. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> As usual, this will be a week of
  uncertainty unlike the rest of this week in this blog which is LIVID and
  filled with posts for some reason <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, so we are going a little wild for
  the week. Not "KanoKano" though, we will start with sequels first just because
  I can't contain myself and how much I want to-

    JOKE SHOW OF THE SEASON LET'S GO!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this glorious comeback of a
    romance series I'm so glad didn't join the previous season's sequel dump
    (#KanoKano13), as if it's not obvious Shino-san here wants to be in part of
    the action, and just blocking herself using her friend so that she can stay
    away from the guy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, thanks for watching, everyone, have a
    great day. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Now that you have caught up with season one, let's start
    back where we left off! Uh, of course it feels awkward to have to talk to
    Shino after what has happened so far if you would recall this friend found
    out about whatever Naoya did to more than one girl lol that's the whole
    point of this series anyways, but turns out their reason this time is just
    to help Nagisa study because damn, do I not need to remind you about how
    much effort Nagisa needs to do... anything in life, honestly. It's like a
    bimbo but the voice actress is married. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Alright we can't keep making
    fourth wall jokes here haha, but yeah, all this makes so much less of any
    reason to be able to ask Shino for such a favour. Like, who would help her
    friend to enjoy her boyfriend's two-timing summer holidays? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I know
    I won't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But as a reward since Shino can state anything and they
    really mean <em>anything</em>, instead of just ensuring that Naoya is dating
    one girl which might as well just be herself- She instead chose to stay at
    their place since she also just found out about that too haha she is missing
    out on so much I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, good time for someone to
    play catch-up until you realize someone else has been doing so all this
    time. Yes, she is called Milika haha hey sorry for putting you aside for
    half an episode when these guys are flirting, but of course she will not let
    that happen considering she hasn't even taken a step into Naoya's current
    living quarters when there are two, no, three girls who did it already.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Since they blocked her path to his place, she will block their
    path, by... blocking the entrace to Naoya's place? Uh, I mean, don't we have
    a back door or something to the backyard? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, why are we
    watching her pee in public? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not like we will let her do her thing,
    and not like we are going to let her dad witness this spectacle and it
    really makes me think why not that first, but instead Naoya introduced to us
    the new character, Milika's sister Risa! I mean, I didn't expect this to be
    so soon I really thought this will be a 4P thing and maybe they will join
    back afterwards but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, why do 4P when you can do 6P-
    Really, why would Milika think that selling your sister out to your love
    will make him want you? I mean, I would've just dated your sister, that's a
    possibility. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, lack of reason upon logic is this series'
    strength, so is the strength of Milika-san being able to carry Naoya into a
    trolley and push him out of school unconscious because she drugged him (high
    school, by the way) just to bring him to her place to showcase her sister?
    Maybe calling the cops was the right choice. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I think
    Shino-san is basically Plankton from the SpongeBob series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She's
    the necessary evil, but she will not able to do anything anyways for the
    status quo, even if it's stealing something from them. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> But unlike the
    next episode where we are going to see Shino-san naked again... Wait, isn't
    Plankton <em>always</em> naked? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> SHE IS BASICALLY FLAT LIKE A PLANKTON
    TOO- I think I will just laugh until the year ends if you don't mind.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, just great for this to be back, I don't think this will
    break grounds like the romance series I've watched just this year alone, but
    boy will I be here for all the jokes. Also imouto because why not. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    Yeah I just need a reminder to NOT listening to ClariS singing the ending
    theme song? Hey prove me wrong but did the song glitch a bit in the first
    verse? Yeah, sh*t can't even produce a decent song with just 2P LMAO ok we
    are done

    Yeah, remember "GREAT PRETENDER"? Like that, but we are not pretending to be
    criminals. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Uh, that isn't the focus of the series though I promise
    you even though that is part of the lore, but in this first episode I didn't
    expect to pick up just because (#UnderNinja01), let's talk about
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ninja" target="_blank">ninja</a>. How much
    do you know about ninja? Do you know as much as that foreigner who just went
    into a government building to ask to meet an assassin? Do you know as much
    as I do which is basically nothing but some knowledge from hating the
    "Naruto" series? Haha *ahem* Or do you know as much as Kuro-san here and his
    clan, who serve to observe society as it moves to take action in utmost
    secrecy when the time comes? If you are interested in the latter, then boy
    do I have an idea for you. I would say though, that this still started off
    very, and I mean <em>very&nbsp;</em>light-hearted and dumping a lot of jargon
    to what looked like some high school gang fight upon the rooftops (lol) and
    this isn't by any means some masterful knowledge showdown or anything. Not
    like ninja need 200 IQ to be good at their skills, the main guy didn't even
    go to high school until this very job. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Still, with the guise of
    strategic planning and not being trained by anyone and having a name for
    taking down some foreigner terrorist and I promise you I am not being racist
    at all because I didn't write this story lol, we still did not have much
    idea about who Kuro is as a person. We were directed to pretend to enlist
    into the school, we know he belongs into a clan of ninja, and that's pretty
    much it. I assume that foreigner will be here to expose of what ninja are in
    this society, but for now... it's hard to even point even though they are
    everywhere. Also, we are dumped with flashbacks. Maybe that's the issue
    here. No, our issue is "where are the damn ninja" haha what else is new. All
    in all... I thought I would be able to see some ninja action before I can
    give a more solid decision on whether to continue with this. But for now...
    Hmm, I don't know. 7 out of 10, I guess? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I am rather keen on what
    this fight here means especially having to deal with the government and
    whatever was in the war of all things, but the stage hasn't been set much,
    so I don't know what to deal with this. Maybe I give this a little more
    watch, I kind of like the jokes in this somehow lol I thought we were
    supposed to be secretive? Well, we shall see if I can even figure something
    out in 3 episodes, just like ninja should be able to in 3 steps? I don't
    know, I can't share with you enough ninja info otherwise I wouldn't be aliv

    I mean, we all say the weirdest of things when we like the one girl and will
    never confess because we aren't that cool enough? Don't doxx me, thanks.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this romance series I don't know if I have enough experience in
    my 15 years of watching romance Anime to be able to watch this lol
    (#KimiZero01), I know enough to know what's great about this series, what is
    actually bad about it, and most likely why I wouldn't give this the get-go.
    Let's talk about why. For starters, the animation. I don't know, but damn
    was I not able to stand all the cleavages- Please, that's the least of our
    problems. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But damn, was I not happy with the animation so far
    because you know, if you want to sell on some girl that the guy likes in the
    first place, you gotta make her look good. And I don't mean that this
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gyaru</a>
    doesn't look good in any way, people can have opinions and like such type of
    fashionistas, and not like I don't lol if you would remember Anime
    "KiseKoi", but the way she moves and talks, it's just not that appealing
    enough even with all the sparkles to make sure she is. Next up, I think I am
    reminded of this, and I don't get why so many romance series are still stuck
    with that logic, is the monologues. Remember the last time you watched a
    romance series without heavy monologues of idolism and self-reflection?
    <a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50796/Kimi_wa_Houkago_Insomnia"
      target="_blank"
      >Me neither.</a
    >
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And that's what I think is the core issue here, as I've been
    watching a lot of those these past couple of seasons, I need a change of
    pace and not have things like this be the focus of the storytelling already.
    Maybe because it's adapted from a light novel, but who is it to say the
    scriptwriting isn't ideal. Last but not least, I think I have a bias. I have
    a bias towards who was casted the main girl here. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yes, you should
    know by now because I talked about this last time too in the preview, when
    it was voiced in the light novel promotional video by Asakura Momo here
    really sounded great even with just a trailer, but damn did they change her
    out. I can't say by how much worse because I am a fan of Oonishi Saori also,
    but you should've seen how much I liked the last time she did a role along
    those lines, and how
    <a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/45613/Kawaii_dake_ja_Nai_Shikimori-san"
      target="_blank"
      >"Shikimori-san"</a
    >
    made my impression of her in romance shows much more appealing than whatever
    this was. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like, compared to this, in that one at least the guy was
    cooler and they had a backstory to talk about together and stuff, right?
    What is this free-to-play mobile game riddled with ads bullsh*t right here.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know, maybe I did not have enough experience (get it?) in
    watching romance Anime after all I did not even give
    <a
      href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/50425/Fuufu_Ijou_Koibito_Miman"
      target="_blank"
      >the one she did with TakaMina</a
    >
    anyways and that one had a better plot that this had though! Story wise I
    still have to give it credit by the way, because the idea of just being
    forced to confess to someone you like and NOT getting rejected and
    IMMEDIATELY inviting you to her place sounds like a dream like Ryuuto here
    would have said many times, and boy is he just basically the male audience
    if this is what is serving the demographic these days, still required him to
    calm down his Johnny (lol) in order to be able to walk out of her place
    still a total virgin. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all though, I know that Oonishi
    would've made of a better girlfriend, but just being with Mocho was going to
    be fuel for watching this, I promise you. I think we going for clean energy
    now lmao but seriously though, after saying this much and I have convinced
    your virgin b*tt to like

    who sang the opening theme song haha we know who she is there's only the one
    in the Anime industry and don't tell me you don't know, I hope this has made
    you happy so far. Because I don't. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Wait, have I become one of
    those guys who will date Runa-chan here for like two months and dump her?
    NO~ I will dump this series though you won't see me talk about this cute
    chick next week let alone next month haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> I might just pick up

    <b
      ><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/1557155200" target="_blank"
        >w.o.d.'s album from 2021</a
      ></b
    >
    was alright I started with this because the one song in their band summary
    video(?) got me intrigued, ended up giving more songs than I expected so
    that's good news going forward. I also listened to
    <b
      ><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/1707122629" target="_blank"
        >Enfamilia's album</a
      ></b
    >
    which released last week (and also took me a while to know
    <a
      href="https://x.com/KlassicNote/status/1709375217498558609?s=20"
      target="_blank"
      >what this band is about</a
    >) and boy am I just glad they did not conflict with the stuff I listened to
    last week because damn,
    <a
      href="https://x.com/KlassicNote/status/1709375875706486822?s=20"
      target="_blank"
      >did the punk rock hit real hard</a
    >&nbsp;for some reason. Coupled by collaboration artists to sing for them
    including Tsuji Shion and HALCA-san from HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR to name a
    few? I didn't give the song from the latter though. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But I did give
    two other songs which damn hype, I wonder when's the last time I gave so
    much punk rock to be honest. SWANKY DANK? Yeah, probably. *head bops*<br />
    <br />
    Alright, this week's news on music is a lot, so I hope you are prepared.
    Yes, more than last week I think.

    and boy this is their first in this two-piece band formation so let's see if
    it's as boring as their album cover art. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (GOTTEM)

    already lol.

    is for their new song and single so I shall elaborate no further since it
    still didn't hit me since the first time I listened to it weeks ago.

        >Ryushen's new music video in collaboration with Polkadot Stingray</a
      ></b
    >&nbsp;which of course I know of the latter artist, is nonetheless
    interesting despite it not being like, ground-breaking but you know, maybe
    I'll like it if it isn't electronic heavy. I guess collaboration season
    after all because

    >
    so in case you missed out maybe start remembering that their album is next
    month and we are leading up to it now for more Rock n' Roll. I tried my hand
    at

        >VELTPUNCH's intro quiz</a
      ></b
    >
    which I only got on the beginner's version since most of them are familiar
    songs even if I didn't know the songs themselves, but damn if you know the
    intermediate version then you are more of a fan of them than I do. Haha I
    didn't listen to all of their songs so I won't know.

      >they appeared in THE FIRST TAKE for the first time</a
    >
    and boy did none of them hit me because I missed the former and the song in
    the latter wasn't one I gave from their new album. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on I
    wish for the other song for the latter to be something I know,

    chose to listen to the newest stuff, honestly.

        >preview for Natsukawa Shiina's new song</a
      ></b
    >, and I think I know this was from her late night radio show since they
    promised that, isn't too bad a listen, so I know I will enjoy the album when
    it's out in a month's time. Busy months to end the week, huh, I gotta
    prepare by buying a new smartphone then. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span><br />
    <br />

    for Anime so I really hope the B-side holds up I have not heard of anything
    yet though let me be surprised since I am already with the title song hehe,
    and because I watched a live video this weekend I might just give chance to

        >Genie High's album from 2021</a
      ></b
    >
    to see if I can give the one song I heard in that video. I know right, 2023
    is so overrated, I'm in 2021 era now! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span><br />
    <br />
    <br />

    >
    which I don't know if I should be happy or not because on the downside I
    just watched two romance series which are likely better in plot than this,
    but on the upside I am still keen upon realizing that this will then cover

    secrets, full force. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Alright, this one is probably worth looking
    forward to. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you guys next week, if you are done with these
    maybe help yourself to the week of posts if you haven't (especially that
    photobook hehe), and I shall see you next week haha of course I will see you
