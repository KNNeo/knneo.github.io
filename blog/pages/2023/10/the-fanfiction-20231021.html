  We are back for another series of me thinking that I can get laid with other
  women in real life! Yes, this is fictional me trying to blend in and
  maaaaaaybe think of ways to incorporate all of them into my ideal life.
  Please, we can't be that lame and STILL be single at 30, we gotta have a
  girlfriend by now, maybe think of marriage.

      invited by our college friends near the year end for a party. We sang
      songs, everyone was down on fried chicken (and beer), and my friend passed
      out even though&nbsp;they were supposed to send us home.</i

      should stop drinking, but Akari who sat in front of me was just staring at
      my direction. She was keen on my friend mentioning I have been eyeing her
      for a while ever since the study session at a fast food restaurant, and I
      have not been taking action since. I explained that if not to concentrate
      for the exams as a first year student, I would spend more time with
      her.</i

  Well, if my story isn't much of a hint enough, and thus I conclude the
  description of my relationship between Akarin and fictional me... she was my
  ex. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yup, I don't think I will ever mention how we broke up lmao we
  really shouldn't, but who knows? Maybe that current girlfriend was part of the
  problem. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, I feel like this is quite a journey, *kinda*
  similar to my own experience in college where some girl told me to study with
  her for the semester's course and... that's it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this case though,
  I brought in some friends maybe just course mates to look like I have friends
  (lol), and slip her into the story previously where we hung out to study, in
  case you wondered how that worked. So yeah, Akarin would have been a great
  girl to date I would think, so this is my imagination what would have been.
  You think she will take some action if she found out that some dude likes her?
  Only if he's attractive, right? RIGHT?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  P.S. Teaser for next week since, in case you didn't notice, next week's post
  will align with Toyosaki Aki's birthday... You can figure out yourself from
  here haha see you then
