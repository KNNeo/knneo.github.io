Man, am I already in regret waiting for another week to review that one
photobook (lol) because apart from it being spoiled to death within just these
few weeks and effectively Karin-chan promoting the heck out of it I think I am
already done just without the book itself lol why, but also, the Inorin fanclub
newsletter got shipped to me, JUST AS I WAS SHIPPING IT OFF!! <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Well, guess
I gotta pad the order now HAHAHA
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Welcome back. At least for next week we will have a slew of posts lined up, so
  that's good news. What's not good news is likely my decisions to buy stuff for
  the week including changing my desk chair because the arm <em>cover</em>
  was breaking. I mean, could've just bought a cover to put over it but rather
  spend more money to take up more space! Why do I behave impulsive like my mom
  now lmao
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyhow, we got the Anime next season preview on hand too, but not until we
  send all of these off! I'm already glad I don't have to watch five damn
  sequels next season even though not like sequels will leave me alone but now I
  can watch new shows! I can't complain about sequels anyways I watched them in
  the first place haha <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span><br />

  Oh yeah they <em>both</em>&nbsp;have glasses?? Now THIS is heaven. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In
  this final episode where I still have no idea where this is going and they are
  middle schoolers in case you need a reminder lol (#SukiMega13), maybe, just
  maybe, we get a conclusion out of this. But instead, we just have more daily
  shenanigans from Mie-san herself apparently, because you know, see title.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But is it already surprising the nth time coming? Especially when she
  just brought the other pair of glasses which are non-prescription thinking
  that they are? Like, you walk out of the house blindfolded? Haha either way
  Komura doesn't care, he just stares at her all day and be nice to her hoping
  that some day, he won't be forgotten just like her glasses were. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I
  mean, you have been staring at her already, so just take it out. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I
  promise you, I PROMISE YOU, this is not a porno. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> The rice on her
  hair, please. Also not talking about the weird stuff that makes Komura a
  creep, at least we can talk about how just Mie-san's tied hair from her friend
  is making Komura have a different reaction which is still "you're cute" just
  like how we deal with idols lol where is the lie here, but more on the story
  focusing on the time that has passed so far, and how they will not be meeting
  each other for some time soon since the exams are over and summer vacation is
  on the way. Not a great idea to ignore parents who are bringing you on
  vacation lucky them, but heck, Komura did still have desires to hang out with
  his... his... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Classmate, female classmate by the way, during the
  summer holidays. This is unlike the male classmates who just tease the heck
  out of her during her elementary school days like Ise who she met on the
  streets recently, who of course stereotypical, guys will only fool around and
  sort of bully girls *ahem* and take their stuff and things, only to think that
  they might be up to something to grab their attention and their parents didn't
  teach them to be nicer to women lest they what, face the consequences when
  they reach adulthood and are single? Haha tell me I'm not one of them.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Even still, and this is where it matters even more than just staring
  at each other's faces in the playground lmao, where the origin story(?) as
  shown in the flashback when Komura still had his black hair in case you forgot
  it was dyed as instructed by the mother, it looks like they knew each other
  some time ago, and technically them sitting beside each other is not just a
  matter of fate! I mean, maybe Komura is just into the idea of some girl saying
  he's great husband material which I will beg to differ but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You know,
  the feelings be mutual at this point so yeah, why not? Komura would argue that
  she might forget about him just like how she forgot about her elementary
  school classmates? BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;"
    >Nah Komura, that's impossible, you have done irreversible damage to her to
    make her yours. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;</span
  >All in all... I thought they would not come up with a proper ending just
  because it's just an adaptation, but now that I've seen the flashback...
  alright, I'll take it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But seriously though, maybe people will
  complain about the weird contrast in graphics, the lack of plot and above all
  else, who the heck cares about Komura lmao I'm more into Azuma-kun haha, but
  overall this is just a nice, simple romance story to enjoy. I did enjoy my
  time watching this for the past few months. Sure it's no classic romance plot
  lines and stuff and losing glasses sounds like a bad excuse considering you
  take your exams more seriously than your eyes lol and Komura is really just
  like a creep the girl doesn't mind having around, but heck, this is Anime so
  this will work. I appreciate the soft approach to this middle school romance,
  and I definitely did not regret picking Mie-san up. Uh, I mean...!!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  The theme songs, picking up the theme songs were great haha remind me to stop
  watching another middle school romance

<div>
  [TL:DR; "Meanwhile, I'm her a dad-like classmate who has sat beside her for a
  while." Actual proper summary of this series by the way]

    >it has been announced already</a
  >
  in case you missed that, we are concluding the days we are having in the magic
  school... maybe? Maybe I was too fast on the talk here to be frank, but let's
  find out what happened this time around. Cuff is training with Ichi because
  all she wants is to get stronger but forgets that she needs to focus on battle
  and not let emotions get in her way? Check. Daleth sneaking into the school?
  Check. She got found out by Nico and had to fight him because she told him she
  was Sade (lol) but then told him otherwise because she found out this was a
  school with Walter in it? What? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I like how even within the new
  characters and the old ones which at this point I would hardly call Daleth
  evil, there is still always something new to talk about even if it's Cuff
  sleeping in class with all the drool and Viola not caring anything in the
  world or just Alice telling Bocchan the answers when being asked in lesson.
  You know, it's all fun and laughter until you forget we are all trying to
  build up our knowledge and skills to fight against a master of magic and
  illusion. And mind-reading, that's right. Bocchan figured that out maybe a
  little too fast there even to ask Daleth in person, but considering that Sade
  would resort to creating curses specific to her targets, goes to show
  <strike>how much she cares about people</strike> how much she is aiming at
  their weaknesses in order to maximize her passive damage to people who
  apparently are getting in her way. Well, I would doubt that Bocchan will get
  in her way, but I assumed someone in the household did. Who that is though,
  I'm not too sure. What I am sure is though, is that Sade hates everyone,
  especially people from the future lol Zain managed to send the bunch into the
  past, but more likely also, we have heard a little something from the master
  witch. Zain may be keen on her body (lmao) but she is more keen on the people
  who will get in her way, specifically in her way of love. You know, think
  Walter and Daleth but Bocchan gets in the way haha what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He won't, he
  can't anyways. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways coming back, but knowing just that fact is
  enough to send the group back home just because no one wants to fight a woman
  in constant anger lol, also maybe go back because the couple (hehe) managed to
  meet Bocchan's grandfather who despite a lack of interest to find why these
  people are roaming around his mansion, probably is going to be a character
  involved in Sade's... erratic behaviour back then. So many factors just in
  going back to the past? No wonder they need another season to wrap this up.
  They gotta get Sharon to wake up too? Uh... all in all, yeah that was quite an
  abrupt ending, dude!! Hmm... let's not talk about everything else but talk
  about just because they will have a sequel incoming, doesn't mean that we
  can't conclude this properly! I mean, I guess they are taking the befriending
  of Sade a thing to focus on for the next season of Anime but still, I'm most
  definitely not satisfied on how the story was told so far. I think I will
  forget about it in due time though, considering the next will be story
  concluded(?) next year, so we shall see. So so far, I will go into the
  final(?) season with two things in mind, that Sade has cursed more than who we
  know including yes you guessed it Daleth-san of all people, and that Sharon
  might be a potential antagonist, making this series' bad and good even more
  convoluting than before. Remember the idea about people in Anime grinning
  without their eyes open, those characters? Yup, be ready to be scared next...
  year not next month haha, where we will see if Sade can be stopped before all
  this hell takes place! Probably not surprising, it has to be romance-related
  so love has a chance to be stronger than magic... right?

  Once again, I'll ask a serious question: Do you like to be alone? I mean,
  don't ask me, but if you have people you love, don't you miss company? For me,
  this final episode of this lovely series which has always been smiling as
  often as Chizuru has (#KanoKari36), I think like, we have reached a point
  where we can cry about things like this, yeah, this is the "sometimes" Kazuya
  has been talking about. For that, I feel like Kazuya may have done the most
  gentlemanly thing ever in a rental girlfriend date: Tell the rental that she's
  his ideal. I know, that may sound real cliché in some way or another, but I
  also think that's a good reminder on what this series has become, and I think
  might also be its flaw. Yeah, unlike Ichinose who has been perfect all around
  in the one date she was supposed to enjoy herself in, uh... I think the
  problem here then is they still make jokes about how Kazuya is only just going
  to idolize whatever he thinks should be his lover because damn, that wouldn't
  be enough, would it? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Maybe he should be the supporting man after
  all, not like we've not seen women with power. But ironically it has always
  been Chizuru trying to hold herself back, and you know, neither of them will
  ever profess their feelings for each other which really just makes this
  conclusion rather stale compared to many other shows which will actually give
  you that straightforward albeit cheesy conclusion. That aside though, I'm more
  than surprised that Kazuya did retort the rental girlfriend back to give her a
  chance to cry her heart out. That I think was done the best it can be done,
  but maaaaaybe without the directness of Kazuya saying that or at least in this
  case implying that, she can at least cry in front of him. Yeah, that's how she
  became his ideal, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean, Mini-chan doesn't even need to
  know this much to get this feeling and thus keeps dunking her master (lol) to
  do more about this romance that might just go away as long as Chizuru doesn't
  keep that mask on, but the impression so far is really still just... this is
  no longer business but the rental girl keeps treating it as such! I know it
  feels like a violation of rules for the company, and technically her neighbour
  Kazuya just needs to pick up his naked loser butt in the bath (lmao), but that
  is not what happened, dude! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe that's the problem about this
  series after all, apart from everything else which is actually lovely in
  comparison and/or even honest, as we have seen from Ruka-chan to Sumi-chan and
  so on. All in all... as any of the female characters apart from Mami-chan
  (because who tf cares where she is) and Sumi-chan (because she can never)
  would have said: Ah~~AH!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, we are very likely still back in
  square one. Just that, you know, we have the experience of going one round of
  the map on this journey of rental girlfriend with a girl named Ichinose.
  Because overall, I think this series has been less of a rollercoaster ride
  than what it should have been in the first place, showing off the
  complications of just dating a rental girlfriend or falling in love with one.
  I mean, that premise is fine for me, but seeing where this goes up till now
  and with many more stories to tell in the original work? I already don't
  foresee much of a motivation to like this more than I have to. Also, seeing
  what hints they dropped for us so we can go watch the source material? I
  wouldn't even care more. And it's not like I don't care about Mami-chan, maybe
  it's just me, but most of the stuff here doesn't hit like I wanted it too. If
  you need a better impact, then the story about some strong woman without any
  weakness or she does but we still have no idea what it is just like how Kazuya
  is right now... that kind of woman should (typically) be paired with a strong
  man who will do anything for his girl, which in this case, should not lack the
  confidence more than what was essentially a professional actress. It's too
  real to pair this loser lol with an ideal per se, but that also means that it
  won't carry much weight compared to those which go straight to the point. And
  that's what I think is genuinely (I'm not acting now) think that all this is
  its biggest flaw even till now. Drama might be drama, the jokes and emotional
  moments do hit me, but it's just not it. Chizuru might be ideal, but this
  series is not, and might never be. If they still want to try to convince me
  they are welcome too, but I shall view this with a different vision, depending
  on how far they will go to not let the main couple progress at a faster pace,
  in my opinion.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I might be harsh on this season review, but reflecting on this for a
  bit, I still think it's a hard sell on letting a wimp guy do anything for a
  perfect woman. It's not bias, it can be done this is the best method you will
  see yet, but people will want more predictable or even wholesome drama. With
  that, I doubt many will appreciate what this is trying to convey or withhold
  from expressing, I would think.]

      only I can get over the somewhat not stellar animations needed to make
      this romance story real good. I mean, at some point you will forget the
      context of... old(er) male bodyguard to some female Yakuza descendant
      since I'll be more concerned if the romance antics will hit. Sounds
      interesting enough for me if I can give an episode or two- Oh it's already

      [Premieres October 5th, 2023] and see if this thriller will be good, even
      the writers are optimistic about this in a genre that hasn't been running
      too well in recent years. Also, if the idea of disguised real "ninja"
      which I hope will keep its realistic stealth elements and not end up being
      a sniper showdown. Then maaaaybe I'll get hooked, who knows.

      in general (hehe) but I guess this is just my fantasies though coming back
      to the actual show, it will be interesting to see if the guy being normal
      and all (which can mean a lot of things) will still get this experienced
      lover to fall in love with him. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I mean, the animation's not that

      [Premieres October 6th, 2023] where if I'm not wrong from the trailer
      Shino-san is going to be stopping whatever relationships that are going on
      between Naoya and his many girlfriends in which Saki-chan is her bestie,
      Nagisa just jumped in which means this two-timing is most likely her fault
      lol, and we don't care about Milika-san on whether she wants to be in
      this. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I hope this is good enough of a summary for anyone to
      realize that this is a comedy romance which defies logic as with
      Hiroyuki-sensei's sense of humour coming in from "Aho Girl" which is worse
      lmao, but at least when placed in a romance story, this is just bringing
      in the appropriate laughter over such a controversial topic even in Japan
      itself. I cannot imagine more girls in this mix but Milika has a sister so
      I wonder what will even happen to Shino herself, and whether she will just
      end up being mixed up in this too- How wrong does that sound? Haha you
      have to see it for yourself to understand this imo I just LOVE the female

      Just dictating that a series of crimes can be done by a human or robot is
      enough premise for <b>"Pluto"</b> the Netflix series (apparently the
      production on this is crazy heavy to the extent only Netflix will help air
      it) which focuses on the mystery of a serial killer whom a futuristic
      society can't differentiate whether the wrongdoings were done by man or
      machine. Creepy, really, but I'm not into the latter part of this equation
      so no thanks.

  </ul>
  <div>
    Hmm if I don't count sequels, and the two I am initially keen but I won't be
    watching, then this season's focus might not be romance after all!

  Things be getting serious here already, people. Like really, if this new
  episode and conclusion of the second season (#BLEACHTYBW25) isn't a hint of
  what is about to happen in the Royal Palace, I don't know, just watch ahead?
  Haha of course, I really should not even talk about what will happen since
  only Yhwach will know of that lol <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, but you know, the action scenes are
  exciting to watch to say the least! From Askin dealing his death using
  strategic poisoning lol I can't wait for your to be destroyed by [REDACTED],
  to the fight between Tenjirou and Hashwalth which boy really compensated for
  the former missing in action last week, or Ishida the loser (haha) fighting
  Senjuumaru with her super quick reflexes on spiritual energy manipulation,
  looks like everyone is having a great time even just within the cage that
  Hikifune just set up. Also yeah the highlight of this so far, Yhwach against
  Ichibe. I think we know a lot about the former or well maybe <em>you</em> don't,
  but let's talk about the latter first, Ichibe's powers. His "sword" or some
  sorts do not just kill things, he removes the names out of them. Think of like
  programming where everything in the application is made of thousands of
  variables even without the end-user knowing? Yeah, he just happens to know the
  name of Yhwach's right arm holding a sword. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, it's the same short
  form called by Namaiya when they first met. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yu-ha~!! Haha it's like
  the good morning "oha~" but lamer. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ironically, Ichibe didn't spend
  enough time to wipe off like, his memories or something then again it's a
  naming power not a memory-altering power though isn't it the point? Haha
  anyways, so Yhwach still remembers that he has powers to utilize so he used
  one from the first page of his bible: The control of Quincy power. With this,
  he is able to effectively make the rich stronger and poor weaker so that the
  overall power of the Quincy army stays strong, or just you know, the one
  leader gets stronger so he can fight Ichibe again. It's like a terrible fiscal
  policy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> ECONOMICS JOKE haha I had to check if I am referring to this
  right, by the way, my econs sucked at university. Which also means apart from
  those who avoid the beam of light on them, the rest are going to be used to
  get rid of the Squad Zero. Uh oh. That might have gotten a lot of people
  worried starting from Kyoraku where, I did remind you before, meets with
  Ukitake revealing that all this time, he has been housing some god-like powers
  which will be seen on the remaining Sternritters soon. Oops, spoiled too much
  again. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  Moving on back to the Royal Palace, at least in this final episode
  (#BLEACHTYBW26) we are not letting Squad Zero lose to these guys just yet I
  hope, especially when I don't remember whether this is added in or is part of
  the lore, but damn these fights are a joy to watch! Damn, Ichibe with the Kido
  too, my boy. Oh, I'm tearing up. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But still, despite the real hit on
  Squad Zero and I don't mean Ichibe he is in a different realm anyways, I'm
  just happy that all this action has been made SO WELL I cannot even ask for
  more, from just the individual member fights in general not winning to the
  true powers of the Sternritter gang up there by the way, still had more up on
  their sleeve. Just, uh, it's not safe, as usual, what else is new with
  superpowers in this universe. Yeah, if you thought Yamamoto was ruining
  worlds, oh boy, allow me to tell you about just <em>one</em> of the Bankais from
  Squad Zero. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>&nbsp; Yeah, Kon would've woken up to this phenomenon.
  (Oh shit, is that what happened at the end of the episode? Senjuumaru no stop
  haha) Suffice it to say that I think this is just a way to get the voice
  actress of Senjuumaru more paycheck for her buck lol, but between all the
  names and abilities it's not hard to explain why this will ruin worlds because
  damn it's as if Kubo-sensei went all out in making sure the good guys don't
  die to these losers just yet. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Especially Ichibe, he cannot die.
  <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> No really, as long as one can fight, you will hardly be able to win
  Ichibe in the first place because his zanpakuto, in case you haven't caught
  wind of it yet, has the ability to remove names, and later in his not called
  Bankai, give names to anything that is it by his ink. So yeah, just buy
  Twitter, change it to X, and no one would've remembered that old domain name
  called "twitter dot com" and it's a financial and corporate mess. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Hey, I'm not saying it doesn't work lol, but so far just erasing Yhwach in
  name (not in existence by the way) and naming him "black ant" is working haha
  hey if this is not the biggest bullying session in "BLEACH" considering Ichibe
  just stole a bit of something from everyone I'm pretty sure including myself
  lol, I don't know what is. Bullying Kon though? Small fry. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also
  reduced to small fry is... I don't know what to call him now, to be honest.
  Quincy God's son? Yeah whatever, that thing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> He's doomed. Unless you
  tell me he has something else up his sleeve in order to meet with his dad- All
  in all... boy I know this is the halfway point of the final arc, but damn,
  Kubo-sensei permitted the return of Kon? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like, F**K OFF DUDE WE DON'T
  NEED THIS AFTER ALL THE SERIOUS ACTION lol who am I lying they can't even
  afford to do the animation for this new Shinigami Illustrated, pft. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyhow, I'm just rather pissed that [spoiler alert] they stopped the season
  here. I knew Ukitake won't appear this soon into the story he will have a
  purpose to fulfil I promise you, but heck, why then did they not choose to
  stop where the Quincy King will be [spoiler alert again just in case you don't
  heed my advice] killed and absorbed, signalling the next wave of doom fall? I
  guess this is not the depression that is "Attack on Titan", huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I
  mean, they even placed some comedic relief at the end!! Like, why? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Never mind that, this is still overall something to enjoy for the most part, I
  am not disappointed until they brought in that stuffed toy lmao, so yeah keep

  of all things, they didn't reveal his Almighty power here and there. Again,

  lol (#OjouToBankenKun01), this one beside the granddaughter of the yakuza
  (lol) is her personal caretaker, I guess you can call them childhood friends
  as the guy introduced to the other classmates in school, maybe he's her dad
  haha, but overall, he is her crush. Not crash please, we can't talk about the
  accident. *oof* Just a short summary, we are dealing with the caretaker role
  yakuza underling (lol) who is way older than her of course, now trying to
  blend in into the high school she went in just so he can protect her from...
  well, everything. Problem is, this has resulted in her being so antisocial
  because of the overprotectiveness, this guy also blocks her from dudes. So
  yeah, normal romance? That can go to hell. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Obviously not what
  Senagaki wants when she walks into a new environment, but sure is rough trying
  to blend in considering she has never done so, so the guy leads her in every
  way possible, from making them the chairpersons in class, to even allocating
  teams in sports day so she gets to play some volleyball. Until, and I do not
  joke, she gets hit by one. Thank goodness the first victim was one of the
  yakuza dudes who can be punished unlike the students in class haha we saved
  some innocent human beings today once again, but still, it's as if he doesn't
  want to see his girl (hehe) grow up and be independent and be just a little
  stronger than just a little princess. Yeah, real cringe if you think about it,
  so I really hope for her sake, that he will take a step back. But not like
  it's helping her though since she's already, if you didn't notice, hopelessly
  in love with this caretaker twice her age. So yeah, normal romance? Not unless
  it's with your stepfather. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;"
    >All in all... I might give this a miss. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I feel like this got a
    lot of things right in many places but also a lot of things wrong too I
    especially disliked the pace of the story for starters it's rather slow, but
    I think the biggest thing drawing (get it?) me away from it now is the
    animation. Like, I can provide examples for days with the warped eye balls
    on close up and extra top lip for effect(?) but yeah, if these kinds of
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shoujo" target="_blank">shoujo</a> romance
    needs some kick (get it because volleyball?), it's definitely making sure
    that the guy looks super handsome and the girl... well the guy is more
    important haha yeah. Or maybe I'm not that hooked into it, whatever. Still,
    I would say this isn't great, so I'll take away Akarin's ending theme song
    and be done with it, I don't want to associate myself with the yakuza
    anyways haha ah</span

  no surprises there it's for Anime you are totally correct even if you haven't
  guessed anything. Married, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of,
  <b>Kotobuki Minako's new music video</b> made me like her once again for some
  reason, even though this is not Kotobuki Rock she was known for at least this
  is good lead up to the return of her solo music career(?) and/or a restart to
  her singing once again.

  release which the track list now revealed many songs that have appeared in
  recent years including classics just because, so this might feel more of a
  remaster instead- Yeah, just like Ajikan, yeah.

  this new season which I won't watch, the one with the palace poison girl.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> From what was in the newest trailer I've not seen in the preview, the
  ancient palace context is already making this most intriguing in itself, I'm
  in!<br />
  <br />So for next week as planned, since we don't have new Anime theme songs
  to rock to, I shall rock into my research with

  >&nbsp;from last year which will no doubt be mentioned in the reviews next
  week too so let's see if we can align on something music. And if I get bored
  maybe I can listen to whatever

  is about which released like, two days ago. It's got Tsuji Shion and many
  other people I don't know- THERE'S HALCA IN THIS?? lol<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />I think by delaying my upcoming package by a week might be a reeeeal bad
  idea because that means next week we will get a new post every day of the
  week!! I think. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Assuming that the package drops by earliest tomorrow,
  my weekday nights will be busy. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> On other things, if you want to join
  my life of meaningless <strike>retweet</strike> re-posting whatever campaign
  TrySail is going through in countdown to their live tour now, you are welcome
  to join in with promises of a chance to get... I don't even know what it is
  but even if it's a reply from the staff I'll also be happy- Okay but a reply
  from Mocho though?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you guys next time then, and trust me, I have
  been planning to revive The Fanfiction series as soon as, wait for it, next
  weekend. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> No promises though, not even on account of Kitou Akari's
  birthday in two weeks HAHA UNTIL NEXT TIME!!~
