<div id="hashtags"></div>

Okay okay this one I HAVE to write down it was so good I can remember a lot of
it now so let's do it we have references from places I don't even know:
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  "We were at a theme park finishing our rides until we missed one as we see the
  rides close one by one. (It was featuring office chairs hopping through bumps
  on the ground in pairs?) We were like why not and decided to form rows of two
  to try it out. But there was a check on wearing accessories like rings in
  order to prevent accidents, hinting on those who don't on the same row? The
  first row both had accessories so that was fine. Second row only I had a ring
  (which I don't IRL) and the row behind me only RumiRumi had rings on her right
  hand. As such, we both moved to the same row. But then, the organizer decided
  to move us around to reorganize us instead, and I promptly grabbed her hand
  and moved her in front of me.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  "Ah but I don't want to let you go", I said (in Japanese) while grabbing on to
  both her hands, of which she then came up with many reasons to shake me off
  including talking about how she would only attract ugly men and I referred to
  myself (lol) and I kept saying how much I wanted her until she eventually gave
  up. (I wish I can remember the whole conversation but) I embraced her and she
  did the same too.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I then woke up (in my dreams) sleeping in embrace with her, tucked nicely with
  my head aptly placed on her left shoulder, just enough space for me to
  breathe. The regular stress of a headache was nowhere to be found: It was as
  if being in embrace with her did the trick. It also felt like she was still
  sleeping, so I did not dare to move lest I wake her up. But I felt like this
  would be a moment to remember so I struggled to find my phone within reach and
  took tons of selfies with me and her on bed while a live video(?) of what
  looked like ClariS performing on Christmas was playing on the background of my
  phone (lol). I then sent some of them promptly to my buddy to show him of my
  current situation."
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And yep, of course I checked my phone again when I actually woke up and...
  Man, Ookubo Rumi I wish we were together I'll wear as many rings on my fingers
  as you want me to. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Aw that was a great time wasn't it? I wish I
  remembered the conversation I really tried to recall but as I write this I
  forgot so thanks for writing it this detailed, me. Have a great Friday,
  everyone. May your dreams be half as good as mine haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. References in this dream are likely I only recently went to a theme park
  last month and that's why I was reminded with Christmas stuff but don't ask me
  why ClariS maybe their winter track cover album hit me, and I was putting
  Aizawa Saya wallpapers all week so you tell me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe that is
  Saya-chan though I did hug not her (ie. bolster) real right last night.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I didn't exactly know who it is I did wake up saying RumiRumi
  between my lips though hehe
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  The chairs reminded me of work though and I'm currently outside of office for
  two weeks so <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> haha
