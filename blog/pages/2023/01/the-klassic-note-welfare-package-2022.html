Hard to determine what is uniquely different and also I bought stationaries so I put those under miscellaneous. And shout out to the one shirt purchase even though I said I should NEVER buy another shirt- Don't worry, I'm not going to wear it just because. I want Ayano to wear it in front of me without pants-</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>MOST WORTH ITEM BASED ON ITEM VALUE<br>My best impressions for the year are either that <b>marupi gacha Raffle the second one</b> specifically where I won the top prize and got the most amount of stuff (including digital content apparently as lowest tier) out of it based on a fixed gacha price of 600 yen per attempt, and which I normally did 10 because you will get an extra bromide. A close second would be <b>Horie Yui's tour pamphlet</b>, I would say, because damn is that A LOT of content in a small book. Might be small, but the content is worthy of a photobook itself. Same price as everything else in the market by the way.</div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><div>LEAST WORTH ITEM BASED ON ITEM VALUE</div><div>And I guess, yeah, the <b>marupi gacha Raffle the most recent one</b> is probably also worth the least worth considering I got a buttload of duplicates and have not yet given them out so it's just in my room now. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I should stop doing this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So far into the new year we aren't doing it yet so that's good news. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I wouldn't consider the miscellaneous stuff to be least worth as they are necessary for storage here and there, so probably in the pamphlet department we also had some disappointments, including Kouno Marika's and Hanazawa Kana's- Damn that one was not great because again, like, less than 3 outfits means it's already weak production at fault. Oh yeah, Naobou's book is also a great scam now that I think about it haha</div><div><br></div></div></div><div><br></div></div><div><div>BOLDEST ATTEMPT</div></div><div>I would like to mention for the any number of special items I bought this year could be an attempt from the norm. From Inorin live tour goods (which will have a follow-up this year <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>) to even bags for literally no purpose whatsoever or even a fan as a free gift with purchase from Marinka's live tour but *ahem* probably the boldest attempts must be mentioned are the digital domain. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm thinking if I can say this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Thanks to my friend I got to buy some digital photobooks over at Amazon Japan which feature AV actresses by the way I bought two already from *ahem* Itou Mayuki you may have known her from our calendar review haha, and Kawai Asuna... I also bought even (not AV, but VA) Koga Aoi's digital photobook OR even when Kanno Mai was cover for a voice actor magazine... But NONE OF THEM, literally none of these, will compare to the one I'm going to mention below.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=945 data-original-width=1420 height=213 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQxE84GoeKZ2Wez-phJhwlAjtZ9wLv8P-UIPF15z5DijkJBZskWhvP5Ihaeub0CAWWh7gO80ugoDYGP0mAevPZPHesfAwBiLuFoWEbiMgldHoW2YE7vziVeSe-6g2egHSFCtVwNcKlv3iioyJYgFgTM7e8bcRye7qOb-UBvy_DPwcW2JOqDsomqPsv/s320/2022-12-04%2022.55.21%20book.dmm.co.jp%201bade7d4fb86.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>From "<a href="https://twitter.com/Escape_r18/status/1486866618198204416?s=20" target=_blank>#Escape Azusa Hikari</a>"<br></table><div>In an attempt to give AV actress <b>Azusa Hikari</b> her title to join with the other two, I tried to search for non-nude (hehe) photobooks but she doesn't really have any since having those wouldn't be for artistic purposes and I kinda want both ie. non-nude but for artistic, and since I can't find one at the time I went for a compromise and uh, chose to eliminate the non-nude criteria. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> As you would see in the screenshot above if I didn't decide to put a ban on this site yet lol <a href="https://twitter.com/Escape_r18/status/1488829551958532097?s=20" target=_blank>their Twitter account</a> probably has <a href="https://twitter.com/Escape_r18/status/1493902987902832643?s=20" target=_blank>safer images</a> lol who am i lying to, but yeah I really just appreciate her with clothes to be honest, body and everything.

I guess putting in a record number of fanclub registrations is making them worth a mention considering that I LITERALLY FORGOT to stop the yearly subscription to Kouno Marika's fanclub... so now it will end in May this year. Well, if I forget to unsub by then again I'll get another year I guess. You're welcome, Marinka. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Serious talk though, <b>the voice actor trading cards</b> which I did twice are actually good, though results are not satisfactory but I did buy a box for my bro on his birthday and he got SSR so good for him. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Does that count</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>BEST PURCHASED ITEMS BY TYPE</div></div><div><div>🖼️Bromides </div><div>(Not including sets of used bought in bulk, gacha outcomes included)</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Hekomachikoroibuki<li>Kouno Marika 1st LIVE<li>Moeshi Tours (should have bought the birthday ones instead of these)<li>smile giving day vol.2<li>Horie Yui LIVE TOUR 2022<li>AMUSE VOICE ACTORS CHANNEL Fan Meeting Bromides (choose your own bromide)<li>marupi gacha Raffle June 2022<li>marupi gacha Raffle September 2022<li><b>Inori Minase LIVE TOUR 2022</b><li>Assault Lily Summer LIVE voller Blüte Big Bromide Sets<li>marupi gacha Raffle November 2022<li>Toyota Moe 2023 Calendar</ul></div><div>🎴Cards/Memberships</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li><b>Voice Actor Card Collection VOL.08 Kouno Marika</b><li>Kitou Akari fanclub "smile giving day vol.2"<li>Takahashi Rie fanclub "RIEKOU"<li>Inori Minase LIVE TOUR 2022 (rare card get but)<li><b>Voice Actor Card Collection VOL.10 Waki Azumi</b><li>Minase Inori fanclub "Inori Machi"</ul></div><div>📓Pamphlets</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Kouno Marika 1st LIVE<li><b>Horie Yui LIVE TOUR 2022</b><li>HANAZAWA KANA Live 2022</ul></div><div>📔Books</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Ganbare Douki-chan Vol.6<li>Touyama Nao Official Book "NOW loading..."

Spoiler for next package post, we already have a birthday photobook for me to review. It's not going to be as great as Lynn-san but it's from the same publisher so I have high hopes.
