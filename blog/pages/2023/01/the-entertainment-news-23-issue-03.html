Four shows this season, huh. And my bro says the voice actress fest that is "Spy
Classroom" is good? No. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, I rather take a harem romance with all of
them in it in real life and this is not that-

  Welcome back. I feel like today is not just your typical Sunday where I get
  sad over work (lol), but suffice it to say it's sadder since I'm going to
  spend THREE DAYS in the wild from tomorrow so happy birthday dad; I'm glad we
  didn't decide to have your birthday dinner on Monday lmao
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  That's the sad stuff dealt with, so let's see if I'll have more sad stuff lest
  the new shows below disappoint. No,

  Oh yeah Kotoko-chan I would like to do some
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikagawashii" target="_blank">suspicious</a>
  things with you at my place. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> In this new episode of a series I didn't
  expect to see a season two but here we are (#KyokouSuiri13), wow is that a
  wholesome episode of what is basically a summary of the first season and the
  series itself. So, in case you have no idea what this is... hmm, in a nutshell
  it's just like High Court, but you can lie all the way through. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You
  have to lie ALL the way though, just like how in this episode we have the
  manager with a lie about him having a pet that is illegal to raise in Japan.
  And when I mean all the way, that just means that you have to lie to everyone,
  including the audience. So, story goes this time around some spirit heard of
  thumping noises at night and feared of it which, reasonable, it was found out
  that in the apartment above there was a very suspicious placement of a doll
  which even the manager feared. Yep, in case you have been reading the above
  very carefully, you might be thinking I'm contradicting myself, and that's the
  whole point: Kotoko-chan essentially the spiritual medium and ruler between
  worlds, is supposed to appease her fellow spirits with utmost reasoning and
  logic. In this case, she lied about the doll existing even though that's the
  truth we will talk about getting rid of that later, but instead covered it
  with the manager having some weird kink of rearing a kodomo dragon or
  something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, which story is spicier, right? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also,
  because the manager would be the only one responsible, they can say whatever
  they want about him. Well, unless the spirit itself dared to go find out the
  truth itself, of which it didn't, which brings us to the truth. After leaving
  the spirits behind, her boyfriend/buddy/contract Kuro-senpai then mentioned
  about the idea of not telling the truth behind the discovery of the doll, and
  created a lie based on the manager. So here we go, it's upon these levels of
  lies if you have watched season one you would know of the Steel Lady (umph
  Sumipe haha) and Kotoko had to put layers of lies to let the Internet
  community come to some conclusion so the supporters of the demon would cease
  and it can be more easily taken down. Not that it's a problem here, but
  considering that is a doll which is a cursed seal meant to... uh, kill nearby
  spirits, that thing should be glad it didn't decide to investigate the
  apartment above. Which brings us to the second half of the episode, the fight.
  The gang of spirits talked about the beauty of Kotoko-chan (haha she cute) but
  also, the monster that is Kuro-senpai. So, for some background, he came from a
  family of people who eats weird food so yeah my place too haha, and got fed as
  a kid, a kudan (defined as a human-faced bovine, ugh) and a mermaid. He
  survived the ordeal of the mythical powers of consuming the two types of meat,
  so he gained the power of future sight AND immortality, making him basically
  invincible but also, looking worse than me as a human if you are in the
  spiritual world. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Meaning that, as long as he can see a future of him
  not dying, he can cling on to it, sacrifice his mermaid body which won't kill
  him, and be revived instantly. Of course time is a major factor in achieving
  that feat so let's hope that doesn't get him this season. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> All in all,
  great way to bring us back in, I really thought they will touch on the romance
  parts a bit too but that's fine I hope your motivation to watch that isn't
  clingy Kotoko-chan because it is mine. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Other than that, we see a cast
  of new characters from the opening animation, we know one of them will be
  voiced by
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki" target="_blank"
    >Yuuki Aoi</a
  >... and that's all I know. We shall see how well this season holds up, just
  like Kotoko's logic and reasoning...?

  Wow, okay dude, you might be even more cringe than me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, after
  having a girl who notices you? I don't think so bro your life is changing
  right now. In this first episode of a series where deja vu is merely an
  opinion (#KuboSan01), I don't think we can understand mobs here lol it's not
  what you think they are, so maybe
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calefare" target="_blank">Calefare</a>
  might be more of a familiar term. No? Oh, it's a Singapore only thing? Oops,
  what have I done. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, ignore me when I say stuff you don't care
  because no one cares which is the motif of this blog anyways lol, we talk
  about being invisible. And I don't mean by having a superpower, no, this is
  just your typical romance slice-of-life Anime, not fantasy or supernatural
  elements. It's just that Shiraishi here has a human problem. Unlike Komi-san
  who can't communicate, this guy can, and this is HIS ONLY WAY of being noticed
  by people. Yeah, it's as if he is invisible, is the shtick of this series.
  Ironically though, as you can see by the intro of this episode, 1x Kubo Nagisa
  noticed him. Obviously being the opposite of him, popular and smart and
  everything, I still can't make it why this girl would see him more than twice
  a year given Shiraishi's reputation of being so background it's like dealing
  with the CSS background style attribute with a screen reader BOOM programming
  joke. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Nonetheless, the quest to figuring out how far Shiraishi has to
  do to be noticed by... damn even camera AI, sounds like a good challenge for
  Kubo-san already. For the dude, it's just a juggle between the consequences of
  not listening to Kubo-san and the real threat of actually getting noticed in
  class even though the reality is likely that both won't get him any attention
  whatsoever. Get it? That's the joke. Basically no risk, better than trust
  bonds. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Or maybe it's the other away around how did the teacher who
  looks like
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/167614/Hanasaki_Horie"
    target="_blank"
    >Ao-chan's perv author dad</a
  >
  know? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, the rules of this "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san"
    target="_blank"
    >showdown</a
  >" is more like an experiment, really, and following a give and take rule set
  by Kubo-san&nbsp;every time, Shiraishi is just dragged into her world where
  she takes her advances on, spoiler alert, the guy she likes, one step at a
  time. Hey, she saw him already; That's more than just a first step. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I
  mean, not talking and avoid being seen is one thing, this guy managed to avoid
  everyone besides the one girl who will give a damn about him. Hey, tell me not
  being attractive is also one of his virtues. Like, people think seeing him is
  good luck but have you guys ever thought of chatting him up though? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  Well, at least he got his manga and video games with him. Welp. I wonder if
  anyone will notice him if he hangs out on forums or online chat. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I
  mean, I've got noticed just from a livestream in months so I wonder what are
  his odds. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Maybe that's why, maybe, taking a selfie with the most
  popular student in class will be that much more exciting, above everything
  else. And just this, I think, is already making this series worth a watch. I
  will have to swallow up the theme songs though, maybe I'll go with Kana-chan
  first as opening I guess, who also voices the main girl. (<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa"
    >Hanazawa Kana</a
  >
  of course, married woman voicing a JK lol cringe) All in all... hmm I think we
  have enough hints as to what will happen of this relationship in school
  compared to the other one I watched last week. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Not a bad idea after all
  considering even Shiraishi will also make jokes about himself haha, still
  could not get around anything this Kubo-san wants of him... but as she said,
  she's all filled up. See,
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/123699/Takagi" target="_blank"
    >Takagi-san</a
  >
  is the one having fulfilment issues, okay? This girl knows what she's doing.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And if ignoring everything else about potential romance, Shiraishi,
  why not take this chance to gain a friend? She'll definitely notice you more
  than your mom haha why I can already imagine the wedding photos of only the
  bride BRO YOU GOTTA DRESS UP AS A CLOWN NO BLACK SUIT FOR YOU lol more jokes
  next week I guess

  Man, maybe Ranpo-san can't appreciate the art of... well, anything. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Unless it's straightforward? Man, you allergic to entertainment, bro? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  So yeah, in the new episode where us idiots uncover the truth lol
  (#BungouStrayDogs39), according to Ranpo-san even at the start of this series,
  he "has the ability" to find out the truth. Well, this is now accented by the
  fact that Fukuzawa had to tell him about who he is, basically. Also, because
  he's young and easy to deceive? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, we gotta hit him on a lie
  somehow to make this work, so why not? Now that we got this out of the way,
  maybe we can talk about the actual threat that is going to happen in the play,
  shall we? So, story. Sorry if I had to take quotes from Ranpo-san himself, but
  since he did it so well I might as well take a leaf from him since I'm such an
  IDIOT- This play is about reversal of roles. About humans versus angels, and
  how that will change around. The main guy we have seen last week is the leader
  of this... fictional cult? Yeah, and of course, is on the precipice of
  revealing the reversal of roles for the play itself, you know, angels getting
  their vengeance and killing humans and stuff blah blah. Problem is, Ranpo-san
  is just rattling this in the theatre floor where people paid tickets to watch
  and that's kinda bad for PR, so Fukuzawa decided to give him an illusion he
  can deal with: By telling him his detective powers were an Ability. Maybe
  that's how Ability users and the term came about which will be interesting to
  talk about with respect to current timeline, but let's leave it at that we are
  still in a flashback. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Seeing as Ranpo-san is a kid and he knows
  better to believe in that lie of a truth, he took it upon himself to BE the
  greatest detective of all time since you know, technically he is since we are
  all idiots in his mind now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the murder happened, people were
  shocked to see that it is "real", and in the second half of the play Ranpo set
  out to reveal the people involved in this supposed crime. Turns out, it's just
  the main actor wanting to show how real death can be to the audience, but of
  course his fans probably mostly female in demographics are already shocked by
  his fake death even, drinking that much water after being drawn of fresh blood
  won't help make any of us forget about that fact. Yeah, technically a psycho,
  dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Actor, my a**, and shout out to the first ever movie which
  showed faeces on camera too. Epitome of acting and drama, but probably why we
  have age ratings today. So long story short, Ranpo-san was great he figured
  everything out even those people who think he's a genius didn't know he is
  just smart and not Ability user lol, STILL did not figure out how the
  playwright who cooperated with the main actor was actually killed in his
  writing room. Yeah. Remember there was supposed to be a murder? Happened now.
  <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> All in all... man we are not done yet, ladies and gentlemen. We now
  know that arresting someone who might be interfering with this play might yet
  create another problem, and as Ranpo-san sits in the police car with an
  overenthusiastic policeman... you can see where this goes, yeah. He won't die,
  no, but let's see if ANYONE will believe this dude is an Ability user and that
  he is worth getting rid of. Haha see you then I'm so stupid I need to watch
  this again to understand if I did this write up correctly lol

  starting off with another stoning at the park. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Please, not smoking,
  as in, sitting there. Really trying to pretend, huh, this girl. Like, even
  when some acquaintance comes by? You won't ask for help? If I sprained my leg
  even if it's not for saving a cat from a tree haha, and someone I know passed
  by? I would still ask for some help. Or worst case, limp my way home to be

  came in (HELL YEAH lol) with the thanks and usual dinner leftovers lol, but
  Amane thought eating freshly cooked will be great because maybe he missed the
  cooking back home? I mean, who doesn't? *points at self* Yeah, say it in front
  of the girl, dude. That's how <strike>you get to go to her place</strike> you
  can get her to come to your place to cook??? Okay, normally this stuff happens
  only 6 episodes in and we are already doing it? Sure dude, they have no
  feelings for each other- It's like hiring a cook, bro. She's not your
  prospective wife or whatsoever. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I might be considering the prospects

  being a wife already so don't mind me. Guy gets jealous of friend's girlfriend
  because yeah we can all do with a partner at some point <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> still did
  not get more than a relationship with a neighbour who has been cooking for you
  and actually noticed you because you rank in the tops in school? Hey Amane,
  say dropping that student ID card was a mistake. Why did they even print
  birthdays on that though? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Amane then realized you know, gotta do a
  hired classmate and neighbour a favour (lmao) and treat her to something, but
  not like he has all the experience buying gifts for friends I bet he doesn't
  even for his bro right here haha I did it so I'm better than him <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>,
  instead asked the bro's girlfriend to help. Well, burning a lot of money in
  the process he gotta bribe all of them first. But turns out,

  liked the gifts, so all is well, excuse me, mission complete. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in
  all... I think I know why I said I can't clap last week. It's because I need
  it to play half the speed so I can savour all of this not dating stuff and
  THEN do the clapping. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's that good. You know how Amane says he has
  to say how good the food is as he eats? This is the same with my opinion of
  this series so far just that I can only talk about the girl. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Ah hey,
  I'm not interested in dudes I'm a hetero male just so you know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Listening to the ending song and then realizing it's a cover song from
  MONGOL800 I'm like how is that old dude writing songs for Anime now lol, and
  many more coming our way considering this isn't Iwami-san's first cover song
  for Anime hehe been there too previously for Anime "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/36470/Tada-kun_wa_Koi_wo_Shinai"
    target="_blank"
    >Tada-kun</a
  >", it looks like this whole thing is progressing as slowly as it is smoothly,
  and I kind of like that actually. Will whatever Shiina-san say come true for
  their relationship eventually? Will any of their actions hit each other as
  love-inducing? I think we are starting with the guy first, actually. Then
  maybe we will deal with the blockhead of a girl haha oh well we have episodes
  to go through so we can wait we got

  How you like my intertwined Anime references this week, eh? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah,

  happier? We are already failing not even one month in dude I truly hope the
  upcoming photobook reviews will compensate- I even found a
