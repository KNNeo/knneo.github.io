Still on holiday though; Waking up from a long sleep after being up to watch a livestream till 2am with the rain still pouring outside is <a href=https://jisho.org/search/saikou target=_blank>SAIKOU</a>!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Should have just stayed in longer but there's this I promised myself so<div><br></div><div>Oh boy did I take my time to sub to <a href=https://ch.nicovideo.jp/maimild target=_blank>Kanno Mai's radio program channel on Niconico</a> because you get to watch in full the monthly video livestream apart from the regular audio program which I missed last week because they only showed like 10 minutes of it, ended up being the best thing out there mainly because not only did she follow chat and had cup noodles and THEN spilled it in her first ever livestream screw-up, THEN had to fake it again because they were making <a href=https://jisho.org/search/aikyacchi target=_blank>eyecatch</a> (the stuff you may have seen in Anime midway) and chat learned to vote overwhelmingly (92%) on repeating history over another option. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This is the best stream I've seen this year so far and I'm incredibly impressed by the coincidence and/or 200 IQ plays on this. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also the shame on Mai-chan doing <a href=https://jisho.org/search/nagekisu target=_blank>flying kiss</a> is just <span class=emoji title=😚>*chef's kiss*</span> she took it back though, just so you know. The kiss. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br>Okay enough of her we can talk about her again next month near Valentine's Day for her next livestream hehe so let's talk about Anime! I guess we're not adding "Anime" in front of the "Extra" now or else the page address will screw up I hate you Blogger so let's see if Shii- Mahiru-chan here can win a REAL idol-<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=OtonariNoTenshiSama03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Otonari no Tenshi-sama ni Itsunomanika Dame Ningen ni Sareteita Ken</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Guys don't need charm anyway" Okay Amane allow me to beat you up on behalf of all single men in this universe</div></blockquote>Oh damn we introducing mom now?? Okay, I'm in. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well then again I'm not interested in moms haha not until I see the credits. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> In this new episode where Mahiru-chan is always MVP and I'm going to regret saying that (#OtonariNoTenshiSama03), maybe not because then I can stop calling her <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20230121/19/natsukawashiinablog/6b/56/j/o0353060015232736063.jpg target=_blank>Shiina-san</a> since you know, the mom is right Mahiru-chan is cuter to call. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay, so, about the mother. She cute. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oi, stop triggering mom fetishes here please haha, then again that is a familiar voice so I'm not going to explain <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/8555/Hisako_Kanemoto target=_blank>Kanemoto Hisako</a> to those who don't know of her, but let's say that this mother is very bossy. Like, she wants the son to get a girlfriend earlier than her husband type of bossy. Not that hard to be honest, because you know, she just needs to think that this friendship is it would do. Then again, what else you gonna think when you see some girl hiding in the bedroom of your son living alone? Only one would find that in a surprise check in on your son. But seriously parents out there, stop freaking out your kids living alone, they need some personal space for magic to happen. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But then again Amane, stop chasing out your mom like this, have some respect. I legit though we are dealing with some stepmom problems or something. Also, your problems can't be worse than Mahiru whose parents don't even call her by her name- MOVING ON haha, and what else is new when Amane gifts the girl some cake to celebrate her 1st place in results in school haha (yeah brag about it) in order to let the girl feel bad about the gift and feed him instead?? I'm sure a certain teacher would've bled out by now seeing all this feeding and name calling but hey, keeping it secret I guess. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> It's great that's all we need in this story anyways everything else is not necessary. Well, maybe the cooking haha it's what keeps this relationship going. Speaking of, you would think Amane thought it's a great idea to be cooking himself so you know, don't have to depend on angel neighbour cook that much but seriously who are we lying to, even if he is real good at cooking I would rather fake it so I get free good food done and you know, maintain that relationship so as a surprise to no one, he can't cook for sh*t haha so we're good, nothing much changed there. And it looks like we have something going on for Christmas in this story going on, but probably because we are assuming that Amane is still spending it alone did the buddy's girlfriend decided to have some party at his place. Reasonable, but only on Christmas Eve and with the neighbour being alone? One would think that will be an issue at this point, really. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And so it happened, Mahiru-chan easily rejected all the guys for Christmas because guess what it's better to play video games with Amane-kun here hehe, and yeah I then recalled that the buddy and his girlfriend don't really know this nice girl next door to Amane who has been cooking for him and receiving gifts from him. So now what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, in case you wonder how she can be involved in their party... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... these two are literally doing couple things and they say they are friends. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Sure, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I think I can live with that, it has enough fuel to keep me going so far but it might be getting stale. I just hope moving forward it's not another 9 episodes of talking about food and taking care of the guy because that'll also be boring on the long run. We are hinted of not that happening so that's good. As long as you don't give me <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34934/Koi_to_Uso target=_blank>a bed with cameras and them in it</a>, I should be fine. <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> We're just enjoying some simple boy-girl relationship that will blossom at some point but we don't know when so I guess we can only be patient and keep giving gifts and say pick-up lines and stuff haha she has no idea how love works by the way</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0HNzjfATaYXKwQ_oTPwPvoyIt9m0wl1VacS9J-TB5CjKHjZdxqzUncx6wSrmAUuibzgZMlcOa0frn79Nz-p_U1SpUU7IktRaCxX8uz6L2nPAjuyBVtJjIB6uU4PNzhKLrl2TArq8M8soS630y1DYCpmhlZjHLUWWgFjZ6NuX3jJvt2QTmH_ct4mdf/s320/otonarinotenshisama03_cooking2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Basically me if I cook lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhZ24DUKlipwbAcFiTt61C9H-vvjYtCu3mr9dW5JQWitCAeb2on5k-pe_368yelqURaFifU6u4B_TlC9-5T_Fg82WLpqk_x0JJ5V1aJUc13X_2VPUHX54Ohbs9AaFpeJFqoGOBqqb0kSIkyXZMPOymCuFrzU-jDD0HjBor4lrn4YQXV4a35yUvFyBw/s320/otonarinotenshisama03_switch.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you don't know of this reference it's understandable haha<br>(Nintendo Switch, by the way)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I had no reason to kill her." I mean, your wife doesn't think so though so... man haha</div></blockquote>Yeah, you think the investigators are like, super biased about this guy taking revenge on his ex-wife? Haha I don't but you know, can't defy logic here. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> In this new episode where we learnt about a murder without a potential alibi (#KyokouSuiri15), dude, this b*tch just wants you to die. No joke. Marrying her was a mistake. Well, being nice is also a mistake so yeah, should have just sued her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, we come back to the murder incident of the ex-wife as I will refer to from here on, and based on the initial talk with the stupid police investigators or if they dare to call themselves detectives *pft* haha, pretty much everything is pointed to Muroi-san here being a murder. Due to his nature of being kind to others no matter how much he is taken advantage of even to the extent of betrayal, he would never otherwise seek revenge on for example, the people in his ex-company who fired him off his President position before he ended up retiring to the mountains, if you would recall. But yeah, life has not been nice to him. We have a friend who wanted to push him off the mountains to get the same girl he liked. We have an ex-wife who, and I shall quote Kotoko right here, thinks that she might be some replacement to the snow woman she doesn't know of, and thought that something will befall upon her despite the divorce. But seriously, this wife already deserves to die how did Muroi-san even marry such a B*TCH is beyond my comprehension. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, really feels like the ex-wife wanted to die real bad by putting down all those hints we will figure out why later, but you know, why not put the ex-husband as the scapegoat because it's easier and she can technically get her revenge done and done as if getting half his assets isn't enough. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Man, it's hard to make jokes here let's not forget Kuro-san has to work night shifts un a tunnel, okay? Haha I feel much better now. Not for Kotoko though, who especially arrived to talk to the couple about this specific incident so see if this logical genius can help him out. Turns out, I like how in the start she is already sloshing on the dude for being evil and thinking up all of this just to show how much Kotoko herself can manipulate reality to her favour which of course, in the face of logic, be able to solve mysteries like this which will otherwise be at a disadvantage for whoever involved. I liked the fear on Muroi's face like he killed someone lol spoiler alert he didn't, and she is technically right about the snow woman believing in him too much she might just help the guy in seeking revenge to the people who turned against him... But yeah, it's just a display of the power of arguments for now. Also, Kotoko is right, they didn't bang, so unlikely the guy is doing anything to gain the trust of a spirit to do terrible things on his behalf. But who knows? It can all be made up after all. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> All in all... I'm as usual watching this series, interested to know what happens next in the mystery of an incident. It is after all, a set of lies to deal with common logic, isn't it? As long as it works. That's what this series is about, and we will be talking about this again next episode when we are at it, so we can figure out what Kotoko-chan here might be here for anyways. So yeah, I'll take this with a pinch of salt and see how it carries itself on. Dealing with the police though? Maybe the cops are that dumb to believe her, who knows. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlqIEdzRgjwrtEMfNOdzFZ2O2hjwxThni8AMLv8ggzb3CFX-9QCre0dXLLdcOBdJhmjc3fXiY_9ZGKkTyuGrMoW35I9i0AxTZQHtFkCr47r2xNfsIozgKJzZbQvgBMfShP59Fc1Qtc5449OwOKyPKOFW6uRENTjhYciwmWDL7z0P_RTYRh8EEhyPTx/s320/kyokousuiri15_yukionna7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>EXPECTATION<br>(Snow women gotta kill, right?

Wait, what was that last part? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Inagawa Kotoko, everybody. <br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSanMovie><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>映画</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san Movie</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Thanks to you, it was easy for me (Takagi) to adjust." This series in a nutshell haha</div></blockquote>Man, we have no idea on the anxieties of dear Nishikata and whatever he is experiencing when he has to deal with this girl, I tell ya. We will never know because we're all busy being jealous of this lucky bastard. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, in the epic conclusion to this teasing master of a middle school romance series (#TakagiSanMovie), I guess we should send this off properly, shall we? Let's. We start with something simple, you know, just to remind us what this series is essentially about. Well for starters, the guy Nishikata is an idiot. I better mention that first we don't want more of them reading this. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Also, ever wondered why Takagi is the one coming up with all the rules, like how you can't effectively use scissors in a game of scissors paper stone? You idiot? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh yeah, also he is ripped, doing push-ups for losing to Takagi. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, and rich, gotta mention his savings account also due to being teased. Man, we know so many things about the two of them already, so what else is new? What is new though, it's we're reaching the final year of summer. Yes, before we become extinct- Before we graduate from middle school, by the way, these guys already dating before high school and I'm still a loser a decade and a half later. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways, we have a lot of setup going, just not for Houjou-san because she chose summer school instead of his newly found boyfriend so RIP him haha at least he's better off than I am lol got me dude, but for everyone else... looks like there's always something sadder to talk about. The three girls who really made me think this movie is for them lol, might be split up soon seeing Sanae-chan talking to the teacher about her going into city to pursue her passion for running, Kimura might be a prospective photographer while Takao is fishing himself whatever that is, an eel? Haha yeah, and the main couple be going to see fireflies. Well kinda, but Nishikata promised to help that poor guy out so he can have one last shopping trip with his girl, instead let the buddy suffer the same fate since you know, now Takagi has to wait for him to do volunteer work by entertain kids so they won't be scared holding a torch and worrying that some spirit will come after them. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm not into ghosts. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, rather believe in superstition, they say. Either way, we are in good hands because Nishikata is friends with the supposed scary thing, and Takagi loves the dark so she can do teasing stuff in the dark. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I will not elaborate on that haha</div><div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"It would be nice if we can meet without any reason"</div></blockquote></div><div>And so the couple met each other more often than not, and even found a reason to be together for all of summer: a wild kitty alone on the shrine. It almost felt like a blessing from the gods or maybe it's really just lost or something worse like the mom is not even around <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> haha maybe we not think about sad things just yet because we got a cat to take care of! We met up with a pet shop owner, gave the kitty some food, gave it a name worthy of the bed of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hamabou target=_blank>Glehnia</a> flowers near the shrine, and they thought trying to find an owner for it would be a good idea. Of course it's hard to find someone for the cute little kitty as I say that haha, but above all else, it's probably a bad idea leaving it alone in the cracks of the shrine for shelter and maaaybe showering it with food from time to time, so I guess in the end Takagi's father had to make a compromise of accepting a cat in his place lol. Of course, this is a movie, so there had to be a drop, which is a likely scenario to what will happen if the kitty were to be left alone. I expected like, it found the mother or something but I guess it could be worse, it got picked up by another family which placed itself in the role of family cat since their previous one passed away. Welp, I guess that isn't a bad idea it did end up in the hands of a family who will have the capacity to take care of them, but for Takagi and Nishikata, it's a different story.</div><div><blockquote style=text-align:center>"It'll be strange if things were still the same after 50 years"</blockquote></div><div>Like, if this is not a series that will remind you of the end of things, all great things had to end. From the girls having to wave Sanae-chan goodbye after doing their last list of things for summer together, to the main couple having to say goodbye to Hana-chan after taking care of it all summer... we all have something we can't bear to lose or say farewell to. And boy is the latter of the drops much heavier than I thought, but yeah, Takagi isn't taking this too well. To that, I guess Nishikata did compensate it with a confession? Awkward to say the least because damn did the girl not react to anything he said even if it's straight off what we all wanted to hear these past years since the series started, but yeah, I guess that's how they got together. Yeah, claps all around, we did it people, all we needed was something in common and then losing it. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay maybe not that sad I can't bear to see Sanae-chan leave the gang anyways- Oh, thank goodness she didn't leave for the city. Three more years left, I guess. All in all, as I listen to the ending cover song which sounds like I watched another Studio Ghibli masterpiece but I'm not... I don't know. I feel like this end is not enough to make me love this series. Or maybe it's as much as Nishikata loves Takagi: Just enough. And that might just be it, right? They have so much going on for them, this is just the beginning. Maybe this will grow on me eventually, as I recall what a beautiful train wreck this has been watching all three seasons of Anime and concluding with this. It's not the best thing out there, but it did make me feel, so I'll give that much of an end a thumbs up. Really, maybe experience it for yourself. It might be short just like how everything is in life <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, but it's good, I will say that much. I just think it might be underwhelming in this case to do a confession though; most romance series would've been more proper with their confessions. But what do I know I've never been in love-</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqOPsYw5OS3ImphMtPH6vzVUCcW9piW5_WrpvZ94CHGBZhZ9m4UiN34X9vobIXcEYEn0ZbTTsUriST9hmgAQQ3EsXLIV732ZpkCw8dvduOiE-J06jPaB-GaYHFCcc64lQBggxFwx4zDONtbt5CHnAJQTRz-anPDH-MnOUrDaVbe1qds75pLQjwS59a/s320/takagisanmovie_caress.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>EXPECTATION<br>(Haha hell yeah this is middle schooler life)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitMFyPNf1l62PSqzusvzNN9JnT1-QlJ5mEfV1V9ed-RXfqj9-cXXzZIiC8S0u9x98cIqJGAacMaOQ5uZvkkgJl_pse9cx34JSUnWrdzfUeftUkWukwlDYXNk7jwlz7xG0IXqWEgjSRzuG_xvbV4mJdPpoF72axuzzoaKK0aSdp_L-NLh2kj9F6TNSF/s320/takagisanmovie_couple7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>REALITY<br>(Imagine you sleeping with a girl... outdoors lmao)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Let's hope the "Kaguya-sama" movie will be good after promoting it since Christmas last year, maybe we will see me talking about it half a year later? We can but hope. Boy, do I wish that not all romance series will end with a movie; I can't go to a cinema nor will I understand one if I go to one in Japan AND DO NOT GIVE ME THE INTERNATIONAL SCREENING BULLSHIT lol okay me. See you guys next time then, have to go back to work and deal with a bunch of new music releases for the year haha, so let's see if I will still give a damn about my 15-year dedication after all this talk about moving on and stuff lol looks like a me problem don't mind me lmao bye<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. As for the theme songs of "Takagi-san" movie... I've already given half a year ago with <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/island-memories-ep/1626247171?l=en" target=_blank>Ohara Yuiko's mini-album</a> for this and the Anime's 3rd season, so I didn't fancy the opening, I'm glad I gave the insert song and I promise you this was very close to being nominated for an award in Klassic Note 2022 and that's why I say I want to watch this before the year ends, and the ending song is a proper close to such a long series. I most definitely am swimming in tears when I heard the insert song haha</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase target=_blank>Inorin</a> was the cat in the "Takagi-san" movie lmao NOW I gotta hear it again haha oh and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/890/Haruka_Tomatsu target=_blank>Tomacchan</a> is the pet shop owner I guess maybe it has been a while I didn't detect that tbh</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
