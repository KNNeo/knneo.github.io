Ah hey, welcome back. Still on holiday though; Waking up from a long sleep after
being up to watch a livestream till 2am with the rain still pouring outside is
<a href="https://jisho.org/search/saikou" target="_blank">SAIKOU</a>!!! <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>
Should have just stayed in longer but there's this I promised myself so
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Oh boy did I take my time to sub to
  <a href="https://ch.nicovideo.jp/maimild" target="_blank"
    >Kanno Mai's radio program channel on Niconico</a
  >
  because you get to watch in full the monthly video livestream apart from the
  regular audio program which I missed last week because they only showed like
  10 minutes of it, ended up being the best thing out there mainly because not
  only did she follow chat and had cup noodles and THEN spilled it in her first
  ever livestream screw-up, THEN had to fake it again because they were making
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/aikyacchi" target="_blank">eyecatch</a> (the
  stuff you may have seen in Anime midway) and chat learned to vote
  overwhelmingly (92%) on repeating history over another option. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> This
  is the best stream I've seen this year so far and I'm incredibly impressed by
  the coincidence and/or 200 IQ plays on this. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Also the shame on
  Mai-chan doing
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/nagekisu" target="_blank">flying kiss</a> is
  just *chef's kiss* she took it back though, just so you know. The kiss.
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />
  <br />Okay enough of her we can talk about her again next month near
  Valentine's Day for her next livestream hehe so let's talk about Anime! I
  guess we're not adding "Anime" in front of the "Extra" now or else the page
  address will screw up I hate you Blogger so let's see if Shii- Mahiru-chan
  here can win a REAL idol-<br />

  Oh damn we introducing mom now?? Okay, I'm in. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well then again I'm
  not interested in moms haha not until I see the credits. <span class="emoji" title="*dabs*">😎</span> In this new
  episode where Mahiru-chan is always MVP and I'm going to regret saying that
  (#OtonariNoTenshiSama03), maybe not because then I can stop calling her

    target="_blank"
    >Shiina-san</a
  >
  since you know, the mom is right Mahiru-chan is cuter to call. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Okay,
  so, about the mother. She cute. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oi, stop triggering mom fetishes here
  please haha, then again that is a familiar voice so I'm not going to explain
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/8555/Hisako_Kanemoto" target="_blank"
    >Kanemoto Hisako</a
  >
  to those who don't know of her, but let's say that this mother is very bossy.
  Like, she wants the son to get a girlfriend earlier than her husband type of
  bossy. Not that hard to be honest, because you know, she just needs to think
  that this friendship is it would do. Then again, what else you gonna think
  when you see some girl hiding in the bedroom of your son living alone? Only
  one would find that in a surprise check in on your son. But seriously parents
  out there, stop freaking out your kids living alone, they need some personal
  space for magic to happen. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But then again Amane, stop chasing out
  your mom like this, have some respect. I legit though we are dealing with some
  stepmom problems or something. Also, your problems can't be worse than Mahiru
  whose parents don't even call her by her name- MOVING ON haha, and what else
  is new when Amane gifts the girl some cake to celebrate her 1st place in
  results in school haha (yeah brag about it) in order to let the girl feel bad
  about the gift and feed him instead?? I'm sure a certain teacher would've bled
  out by now seeing all this feeding and name calling but hey, keeping it secret
  I guess. <span class="emoji" title="*giggles*">🤭</span> It's great that's all we need in this story anyways
  everything else is not necessary. Well, maybe the cooking haha it's what keeps
  this relationship going. Speaking of, you would think Amane thought it's a
  great idea to be cooking himself so you know, don't have to depend on angel
  neighbour cook that much but seriously who are we lying to, even if he is real
  good at cooking I would rather fake it so I get free good food done and you
  know, maintain that relationship so as a surprise to no one, he can't cook for
  sh*t haha so we're good, nothing much changed there. And it looks like we have
  something going on for Christmas in this story going on, but probably because
  we are assuming that Amane is still spending it alone did the buddy's
  girlfriend decided to have some party at his place. Reasonable, but only on
  Christmas Eve and with the neighbour being alone? One would think that will be
  an issue at this point, really. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> And so it happened, Mahiru-chan
  easily rejected all the guys for Christmas because guess what it's better to
  play video games with Amane-kun here hehe, and yeah I then recalled that the
  buddy and his girlfriend don't really know this nice girl next door to Amane
  who has been cooking for him and receiving gifts from him. So now what?
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, in case you wonder how she can be involved in their party...
  <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... these two are literally doing couple things and they
  say they are friends. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> Sure, dude. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> I think I can live with
  that, it has enough fuel to keep me going so far but it might be getting
  stale. I just hope moving forward it's not another 9 episodes of talking about
  food and taking care of the guy because that'll also be boring on the long
  run. We are hinted of not that happening so that's good. As long as you don't
  give me
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34934/Koi_to_Uso" target="_blank"
    >a bed with cameras and them in it</a
  >, I should be fine. <span class="emoji" title="*ugh*">🙄</span> We're just enjoying some simple boy-girl
  relationship that will blossom at some point but we don't know when so I guess
  we can only be patient and keep giving gifts and say pick-up lines and stuff
  haha she has no idea how love works by the way

    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Yeah, you think the investigators are like, super biased about this guy taking
  revenge on his ex-wife? Haha I don't but you know, can't defy logic here.
  <span class="emoji" title="*wink*">😉</span> In this new episode where we learnt about a murder without a potential
  alibi (#KyokouSuiri15), dude, this b*tch just wants you to die. No joke.
  Marrying her was a mistake. Well, being nice is also a mistake so yeah, should
  have just sued her. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, we come back to the murder incident of
  the ex-wife as I will refer to from here on, and based on the initial talk
  with the stupid police investigators or if they dare to call themselves
  detectives *pft* haha, pretty much everything is pointed to Muroi-san here
  being a murder. Due to his nature of being kind to others no matter how much
  he is taken advantage of even to the extent of betrayal, he would never
  otherwise seek revenge on for example, the people in his ex-company who fired
  him off his President position before he ended up retiring to the mountains,
  if you would recall. But yeah, life has not been nice to him. We have a friend
  who wanted to push him off the mountains to get the same girl he liked. We
  have an ex-wife who, and I shall quote Kotoko right here, thinks that she
  might be some replacement to the snow woman she doesn't know of, and thought
  that something will befall upon her despite the divorce. But seriously, this
  wife already deserves to die how did Muroi-san even marry such a B*TCH is
  beyond my comprehension. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, really feels like the ex-wife
  wanted to die real bad by putting down all those hints we will figure out why
  later, but you know, why not put the ex-husband as the scapegoat because it's
  easier and she can technically get her revenge done and done as if getting
  half his assets isn't enough. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> Man, it's hard to make jokes here
  let's not forget Kuro-san has to work night shifts un a tunnel, okay? Haha I
  feel much better now. Not for Kotoko though, who especially arrived to talk to
  the couple about this specific incident so see if this logical genius can help
  him out. Turns out, I like how in the start she is already sloshing on the
  dude for being evil and thinking up all of this just to show how much Kotoko
  herself can manipulate reality to her favour which of course, in the face of
  logic, be able to solve mysteries like this which will otherwise be at a
  disadvantage for whoever involved. I liked the fear on Muroi's face like he
  killed someone lol spoiler alert he didn't, and she is technically right about
  the snow woman believing in him too much she might just help the guy in
  seeking revenge to the people who turned against him... But yeah, it's just a
  display of the power of arguments for now. Also, Kotoko is right, they didn't
  bang, so unlikely the guy is doing anything to gain the trust of a spirit to
  do terrible things on his behalf. But who knows? It can all be made up after
  all. <span class="emoji" title="*wink*">😉</span> All in all... I'm as usual watching this series, interested to
  know what happens next in the mystery of an incident. It is after all, a set
  of lies to deal with common logic, isn't it? As long as it works. That's what
  this series is about, and we will be talking about this again next episode
  when we are at it, so we can figure out what Kotoko-chan here might be here
  for anyways. So yeah, I'll take this with a pinch of salt and see how it
  carries itself on. Dealing with the police though? Maybe the cops are that
  dumb to believe her, who knows. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span>

  Man, we have no idea on the anxieties of dear Nishikata and whatever he is
  experiencing when he has to deal with this girl, I tell ya. We will never know
  because we're all busy being jealous of this lucky bastard. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah,
  in the epic conclusion to this teasing master of a middle school romance
  series (#TakagiSanMovie), I guess we should send this off properly, shall we?
  Let's. We start with something simple, you know, just to remind us what this
  series is essentially about. Well for starters, the guy Nishikata is an idiot.
  I better mention that first we don't want more of them reading this. <span class="emoji" title="*dabs*">😎</span>
  Also, ever wondered why Takagi is the one coming up with all the rules, like
  how you can't effectively use scissors in a game of scissors paper stone? You
  idiot? <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh yeah, also he is ripped, doing push-ups for losing to
  Takagi. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes, and rich, gotta mention his savings account also due to
  being teased. Man, we know so many things about the two of them already, so
  what else is new? What is new though, it's we're reaching the final year of
  summer. Yes, before we become extinct- Before we graduate from middle school,
  by the way, these guys already dating before high school and I'm still a loser
  a decade and a half later. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> Anyways, we have a lot of setup going,
  just not for Houjou-san because she chose summer school instead of his newly
  found boyfriend so RIP him haha at least he's better off than I am lol got me
  dude, but for everyone else... looks like there's always something sadder to
  talk about. The three girls who really made me think this movie is for them
  lol, might be split up soon seeing Sanae-chan talking to the teacher about her
  going into city to pursue her passion for running, Kimura might be a
  prospective photographer while Takao is fishing himself whatever that is, an
  eel? Haha yeah, and the main couple be going to see fireflies. Well kinda, but
  Nishikata promised to help that poor guy out so he can have one last shopping
  trip with his girl, instead let the buddy suffer the same fate since you know,
  now Takagi has to wait for him to do volunteer work by entertain kids so they
  won't be scared holding a torch and worrying that some spirit will come after
  them. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> I'm not into ghosts. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, rather believe in
  superstition, they say. Either way, we are in good hands because Nishikata is
  friends with the supposed scary thing, and Takagi loves the dark so she can do
  teasing stuff in the dark. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> I will not elaborate on that haha
</div>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "It would be nice if we can meet without any reason"
    </div>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div>
  And so the couple met each other more often than not, and even found a reason
  to be together for all of summer: a wild kitty alone on the shrine. It almost
  felt like a blessing from the gods or maybe it's really just lost or something
  worse like the mom is not even around <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> haha maybe we not think about
  sad things just yet because we got a cat to take care of! We met up with a pet
  shop owner, gave the kitty some food, gave it a name worthy of the bed of
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hamabou" target="_blank">Glehnia</a> flowers
  near the shrine, and they thought trying to find an owner for it would be a
  good idea. Of course it's hard to find someone for the cute little kitty as I
  say that haha, but above all else, it's probably a bad idea leaving it alone
  in the cracks of the shrine for shelter and maaaybe showering it with food
  from time to time, so I guess in the end Takagi's father had to make a
  compromise of accepting a cat in his place lol. Of course, this is a movie, so
  there had to be a drop, which is a likely scenario to what will happen if the
  kitty were to be left alone. I expected like, it found the mother or something
  but I guess it could be worse, it got picked up by another family which placed
  itself in the role of family cat since their previous one passed away. Welp, I
  guess that isn't a bad idea it did end up in the hands of a family who will
  have the capacity to take care of them, but for Takagi and Nishikata, it's a
  different story.

  <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
    "It'll be strange if things were still the same after 50 years"
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div>
  Like, if this is not a series that will remind you of the end of things, all
  great things had to end. From the girls having to wave Sanae-chan goodbye
  after doing their last list of things for summer together, to the main couple
  having to say goodbye to Hana-chan after taking care of it all summer... we
  all have something we can't bear to lose or say farewell to. And boy is the
  latter of the drops much heavier than I thought, but yeah, Takagi isn't taking
  this too well. To that, I guess Nishikata did compensate it with a confession?
  Awkward to say the least because damn did the girl not react to anything he
  said even if it's straight off what we all wanted to hear these past years
  since the series started, but yeah, I guess that's how they got together.
  Yeah, claps all around, we did it people, all we needed was something in
  common and then losing it. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> Okay maybe not that sad I can't bear to
  see Sanae-chan leave the gang anyways- Oh, thank goodness she didn't leave for
  the city. Three more years left, I guess. All in all, as I listen to the
  ending cover song which sounds like I watched another Studio Ghibli
  masterpiece but I'm not... I don't know. I feel like this end is not enough to
  make me love this series. Or maybe it's as much as Nishikata loves Takagi:
  Just enough. And that might just be it, right? They have so much going on for
  them, this is just the beginning. Maybe this will grow on me eventually, as I
  recall what a beautiful train wreck this has been watching all three seasons
  of Anime and concluding with this. It's not the best thing out there, but it
  did make me feel, so I'll give that much of an end a thumbs up. Really, maybe
  experience it for yourself. It might be short just like how everything is in
  life <span class="emoji" title="*sob*">😢</span>, but it's good, I will say that much. I just think it might be
  underwhelming in this case to do a confession though; most romance series
  would've been more proper with their confessions. But what do I know I've
  never been in love-

  I feel like I've been soft. <span class="emoji" title="*silence*">😐</span> Wait, let me explain. <span class="emoji" title="*laughs*">😆</span> You know,
  watching Anime with softer feels, lighter mood, even just more jovial ones.
  Let's hope the "Kaguya-sama" movie will be good after promoting it since
  Christmas last year, maybe we will see me talking about it half a year later?
  We can but hope. Boy, do I wish that not all romance series will end with a
  movie; I can't go to a cinema nor will I understand one if I go to one in
  Japan AND DO NOT GIVE ME THE INTERNATIONAL SCREENING BULLSHIT lol okay me. See
  you guys next time then, have to go back to work and deal with a bunch of new
  music releases for the year haha, so let's see if I will still give a damn
  about my 15-year dedication after all this talk about moving on and stuff lol
  looks like a me problem don't mind me lmao bye<br />
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. As for the theme songs of "Takagi-san" movie... I've already given half a
  year ago with
  <a
    href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/island-memories-ep/1626247171?l=en"
    target="_blank"
    >Ohara Yuiko's mini-album</a
  >
  for this and the Anime's 3rd season, so I didn't fancy the opening, I'm glad I
  gave the insert song and I promise you this was very close to being nominated
  for an award in Klassic Note 2022 and that's why I say I want to watch this
  before the year ends, and the ending song is a proper close to such a long
  series. I most definitely am swimming in tears when I heard the insert song
  haha
