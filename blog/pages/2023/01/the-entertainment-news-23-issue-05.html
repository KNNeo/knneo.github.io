Man, am I <strike>tired from</strike> sick of yesterday afternoon but
considering I don't even give a damn about that [REDACTED] yesterday, I
literally took the wrong bus TWICE haha... Is that what it feels for everyone?
To not care about timeliness? I mean, I was on my way home and was distracted by
ordering of dinner for the family but people do this on a daily basis? How the
f-

  Hey everyone. I really thought of taking work leave... the following week for
  abnormal reasons because (1) my regular Twitch streamer will be on holiday
  means no mornings burnt where I have to watch him play and yes it's a him
  which means I can actually spend more time doing my own stuff, and (2) that is
  when the new package will... supposedly arrive after I consolidate it...
  hopefully next week. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah there is a lot of uncertainty on that so
  maybe I would not do that to myself who knows I'm already taking leave the day
  after my birthday <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Let's Anime and music! I'm back from... let's just say prayers lol not
  Christian btw, and I want to buy organic tea leaves later so maybe I stop
  listening to
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMi1Jdo6FHQ" target="_blank"
    >VTuber Himemori Luna play the electone</a

  and move on, yes?<br />

  Yeah, it actually doesn't matter the female can be taller than you. You'll
  just be laughed at- Wait, he won't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey as if this isn't much of
  ridicule to the guy especially he can't be noticed by none other than this
  girl lol in this new episode where we are dealing with Master Teaser Kubo-san
  (#KuboSan03), hey, tell me if watching romance isn't the best thing to get
  warmed up at this time of the year. Well, if you live in the Southern
  hemisphere I'm sorry lol, but suffice it to say that we are enjoying the cold
  winds right now, and boy does the wholesomeness in this series help with the
  warming up. So, for starters, it's new character time so we are introduced to
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >Hotaru-chan</a

  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34902/Tsurezure_Children"

    >Anime joke</a
  >
  I'm sorry, Seita-kun. Man, is "kun" even the right honorific? Seita-chan? Ew.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay, Seita is Shiraishi's younger brother but I don't remember this
  guy's given name I guess we will find out when Kubo-san has to say it hehe,
  but let's just say we also don't know much of now the cutest character in this
  series since Kubo Nagisa (lol) so maybe we give him and his... somewhat
  literate sense some love, shall we? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Because honestly saying, my
  first impression of Seita here is ironically as much as the brother himself,
  kinda playing alone but not so alone that he's actually alone and that
  strangers will ask if he's lost lmao man this is a problem, but you know,
  playing around in the snow alone is kinda sad, he should get some friends.
  Hey, maybe he has the same problem as the brother, okay? We don't judge.
  Luckily, Kubo-san DID see the brother because she probably noticed why the guy
  left school on time since he promised to bring his brother out to play in the
  snow... alone haha it runs in the family, and it would've been great to take
  some hot drinks in this cold weather, eh? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I mean, I wouldn't take
  that also to be honest so he's basically me in Anime- I don't have a younger
  brother though. I have an elder sister but not as cringe as Kubo-san's one who
  ironically is working at a bookstore Shiraishi decided to visit because he
  wanted to get the bonus that comes with buying his usual manga
  serialization&nbsp; magazine- BRO YOU ARE LITERALLY ME WITH CDs haha no one
  will understand me though. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> But yeah, it took a while before the crowd
  was cleared (lol) and he can get his own copy haha there is no rush no one is
  into that book with a scantily clad lady on the cover lmao. Interestingly some
  jerk placed a rated magazine on the book he wanted to get and uh, I guess this
  is him growing up so I won't blame him... He decided to, you know, take a
  peek- Return the book to its place which he can't go to anyways the 18+
  section is probably off limits for him, and he got caught by the bookstore
  staff. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> Nothing much happened there he did return the book and got what
  he wanted, but as you would've guessed, the bossypants of a bookstore staff
  named Kubo told her sister about it after picking up his student ID as he
  dropped it on the store. No, really, REALLY shouldn't have told Nagisa about
  Shiraishi liking rack. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again we have seen the bra it isn't too
  bad but as my bro would've said it's not big enough- You think Shiraishi knows
  he has been backstabbed by a stranger? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah don't worry, Kubo-san
  didn't mind that at all. Not one bit. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So as punishment lol I guess
  not really, she asked the guy to hang out with her... on a specific day in the
  winter season where couples go out. Yes, it's Christmas day, girl still bought
  him a gift too but it's still not as good as Shiraishi coming up with one in a
  shorter time than she did, gave her a pair of gloves to warm her hands up.
  Aw... All in all though, wholesome content plus bossy sister in the making
  haha the latter is already there already, and I'm digging this story of
  coincidences, I really do. Can't wait to see more people involved in
  Shiraishi's not loner life lol I can only envy to any extent honestly

  Maybe putting that as the opening quote is a bad idea. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yes, no doubt
  we are talking about Fyodor whose Ability scares the heck out of people even
  in the past lest say present time, so let's see if this new episode
  (#BungouStrayDogs41) which brings us back to the new arc will give us anything
  worse. Oh, not Fyodor? I'm listening. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, we are back with another
  mystery in real life, literally starting off with Kunikida in prison. Damn.
  Now what? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah ignoring everything else Kunikida has to go
  through lol even Ranpo-kun knows to not deal with that or else this will take
  another couple of episodes haha, we know that Kunikida's statement of... can I
  even say it? Some kid blowing up in front of him. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Anyways, yeah, that
  is true, well, since Kunikida won't lie. Well he hasn't so far so let's assume
  his track record. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Either way, Ranpo can't figure out a way to prove
  him innocent so he's in there for now. But at this point, he thought of
  dealing with Poe remember that idiot rival of an Ability user? Haha was
  supposed to be meeting someone else, suddenly got dragged into Ranpo's
  investigations... but turns out, was relevant to Ranpo's case actually, so he
  got interested in what Poe was reading at the time - a novel without an
  ending. Surprise, the author was killed before it could be published, the
  final volume, and let's just say it is a coincidence that all of these cases
  may be related somehow. Or else how would there be an envelope on the top of
  the building which was supposed to be the location of the suspected user as
  told by an informant? The informant wasn't lying though, but some things are
  clearly not obvious on first look even from Ranpo's standpoint. Firstly,
  literally a murder happened at the building they were in, body thrown right in
  front of them. Second, the cops arrived on time. Like, the only reason that
  would be possible is that someone called beforehand. No spoilers but guess
  who. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So you can figure it out, the perpetrator was quite dumb haha,
  but even so, Ranpo can figure this guy out. Yep, being the famous detective we
  have seen crack cases like peanuts lol great Chinese New Year snack by the way
  haha, could figure out why this guy was pushed off the building, why his face
  was faked until it hit the ground face first so he would be unrecognizable,
  why his shoes were changed before the fall... but he could NOT figure out
  where the bad guy is. If we can't find evidence to where the criminal is then
  we can't apprehend him, simple. That's the whole purpose of (introducing)
  Ability user Oguri Mushitaro and his Ability "Perfect Crime", which will be
  kind of a joke in a bit but let's just say this gives him the power to cover
  his tracks in crime. At this point it looks like it's his own tracks because
  guess what, he is the guilty party. So basically this guy can fake all the
  evidence he wants using his Ability. And because Ranpo's Ability isn't exactly
  an Ability, he would still be able to see the truth. And that's why it doesn't
  work on him. Dumbass. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay I wish I was right, but sadly for Ranpo,
  just because his is reality and the Ability isn't his thing... this guy will
  get away with it. Every. Single. Time. But not this time though, as Ranpo
  decides to snoop around to see if he can get a ride with the guy's limo lol,
  still did not realize Ranpo has already figured him out even without more of
  his Ability in place. All in all... WE F**KING GOT HIM, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey,
  this is half the fun of this series, stop ruining it for us, Ranpo. So yeah, I
  figured that out soon enough than the end of the episode honestly, but if you
  need a hint of sorts... it all boils down to the fact that this evidence
  manipulation Ability is not automatic. Imagine, if that in a perfect
  situation, this guy will ALWAYS forge all the evidence he has around him. But
  he's a human. HE is the guy who decides when evidence has to be manipulated.
  And when he doesn't, is when he will be found out. That's it. See if I'm right
  next week haha I better be but then again I'm not famous detective I don't
  have to be right lol

  [For context, and if you are one of those people like me who will research on
  the actual authors they are named by as with all the characters in this
  series, Oguri-sensei is famous for writing science-based detective mysteries,
  likely from a time where science is still new and just like magic, crimes can
  be puzzling just due to the fact that science is involved. Go find out and
  join the Google search stats if you are keen haha]

  Hey, I said the wife in making thing somewhere not in my reviews, but you
  know, what do we know of Amane's intentions. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh he doesn't? LIAR haha
  in this new episode where the angel doesn't know sh*t lol
  (#OtonariNoTenshiSama04), well turns out everyone knows the truth now so what
  else is new. I like how Amane thinks he can hide this secret in due time haha
  but I guess too late now should have just locked the balcony, but yeah,
  introductions all around as we introduce extrovert girlfriend Chitose to the
  best girl in this series... and the buddy I guess lol we had to do a round of
  this, huh. So that took longer than I thought who cares if the buddy was a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a> lmao,
  and I guess there are more people who know of Amane as a kid now, apart from
  Mahiru-chan here because the mom is now her friend and showed her pictures of
  the guy when he was younger lol. We were also talking about how happy he looks
  when eating food (bruh have you even seen the girls eat in Anime "<a

  they had to do more cooking and eating AND play video games on the following
  day? Can I just have that as my life now? I'll trade my life right now for
  that. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oh, and that's just cooking alone. Without love. Ah hey hey,
  if you knew of cooking and how they say cooking for the ones you love are
  better... you are not alone. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I guess these two don't know about that
  yet, or maybe, she doesn't. I'm pretty sure Amane is well aware of the fact
  that this girl is doing all the care for him and he's just... giving her gifts
  back in return? Man, tell me they aren't a couple. With that, they spent the
  day playing video games- Can we not show the Nintendo Switch console thing
  again? Gamers be cringe when they hear "video games" but NOT see a PS5 lol.
  Last but not least though, maybe working too hard is also a thing for our
  angel lmao,

  oh dammit, Mahiru-chan had a fever. Probably not from being with the guy for
  too long because who won't, he looks dashing anyways haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> As I said
  they literally dropped an
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> in her
  sad life, but let's just say she needs to rest or else how we get the fever
  away. Oh, holding hands while lying on his bed, that's&nbsp; the most
  important for recovery. That's what happens when you don't choose to recover
  at your own place haha also she is still protecting her rooms I guess this
  place is public domain so technically safer for everything. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I can
  already imagine Chitose or the mother Shihoko scream at the sight of this but
  I won't say too much on the aggression of Mahiru-chan on the dude. I won't. I
  will refrain myself from doing so, just how I did the rest of the episode. All
  in all... I'm already chill but I feel like I need a bottle of them chill
  pills because yeah, it's not happening yet. The ultimate scene. So until
  then... this guy's just trying to pick her up, right? I'm not hallucinating?
  Somewhere down the line there's a grin from the dude? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Like, he's just
  showering his girl with gifts as if I didn't see it and comes up with excuses
  for each of them. BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm still waiting for a drop. And I don't
  even see it from where I am now. That's my problem with this series for now.
  It's just... I watch every episode and I think I need therapy. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah,
  just give me the pills, the super drowsy ones. Because damn, I wish I don't
  have to be paralyzed by this romance that has yet to exist. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We will
  watch on, we will persevere. Well, I will. If you feel like dying at least
  tell me if you are female and <i>maaaybe</i> I'll come watch you sleep and
  hold your hand or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> More cringe next week I guess I don't
  know if I can finish watching this tbh even if it's on Amazon Prime Video haha
  yeah

  Well, this week's kind of a disaster. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I say that because it's a party
  to end the month, really. Whether it's a good party and how many people get
  sloshed and puked all over the place is not the point. Well, mostly me puking
  because it's hard to give songs at the start of this year already. Really,
  last week with two albums I literally found out on the week itself was easier.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Anyways, coming back, I thought I can give

  though was split into two versions for each Anime for being a double A-side
  single, both had different track lists and of course I listened to the "Bungou
  Stray Dogs" version which featured a new B-side which got me in, and I did
  give the two A-sides so... no Review, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> These are all
  Limited Edition releases and I don't review those so *phew* that was a narrow

  last Sunday and immediately picked out the song I'll be keen on, and

  which I listened over the weekend was really meh it made me sick of the pop
  rock styles represented in it. I had no idea which song was the insert for the
  Anime "Kaguya-sama" movie until I realized that was also the only song which
  got me despite its mellow mood. So, uh, yay? Maybe I'll try giving that for
  the sake of it I guess, it doesn't sound too bad. That or I'll just come back
  to this again sometime this year with the same result...? I know right just
  give it then lol her vocals won't sound better half a year later haha<br />

  song it has real vibes from 10 years ago and I mentioned it above already so

  crossed, this might just be the only new song, that's how capitalism works. I

    >their 2nd major album</a

  which sounds like it's time for me to get into them again but maybe not now
  this one is a pass.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  So next week to start the new month, we have
  <b>Hanazawa Kana's new single</b> only because everyone else is next week
  that's the hype week for music releases apparently for next month, so that. I
  also found out that <b>yucat's new mini-album</b> is now on music streaming
  services now which was released physically a month ago, so let's hope her
  buddy Niitsu Yui will do the same with her new album. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We can but
  hope I'm coping with this real hard I tell ya
</div>
<div>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />So yeah, that's all for this week the weekend came and went and I STILL
  haven't done anything. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I really need to do something about this really.
  Maybe I should take that work leave the week after next, we shall see. Hey cya
  guys next week then, and until next time... we shall see if I have an answer
  to that I guess, and my recent obsession is... how much I want to see Asakura
  Momo with more skin. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'll read back on the photobook review from 4
  years ago haha damn is it that long ago already? Girl, we need a new photobook
  haha also Ten-chan can you too? Maybe all three of them so I have a reason to
  repeat history lol

  P.S. Signed up for
  <a href="https://ayanakoukoku.com/" target="_blank"
    >Taketatsu Ayana fanclub</a
  >
  because I think she deserved it more than I do but also we will talk about why
  soon, but damn is is very worth it at 440yen a month. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oh only
  backdated six months haha wow you gotta be in it for all time to see it hey
  just in time for 5th anniversary? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not gonna ask whether we can see
  her bloated stomach but seriously where's the milk coming out of her-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Will sign up for Rika-sama fanclub soon but I doubt this will be as
  worth it considering she is being real quiet compared to a mother lmao
