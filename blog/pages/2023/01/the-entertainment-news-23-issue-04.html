Yeah yeah, I know, Sunday is where all the good stuff comes in, so maybe we will compensate this by doing a once in a while Anime Extra, the first this year! I have something prepared for that occasion though, so don't you worry.<div><br></div><div>The package is coming in quite well, and so are my plans for my upcoming birthday which I will tell you guys in a post of what I will do to continue my fandom for... well everything I have today. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> That isn't much to say about me but we shall live with it! It's my life after all I want to be happy-</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, let's! <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20230116/15/natsukawashiinablog/d4/b8/j/o0336057415230666256.jpg target=_blank>Shiina-san</a> will not be in this post though I did not drop the series yet she will be in the Extra- Dammit again! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe we call her Mahiru-chan lmao<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KyokouSuiri14><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Kyokou Suiri</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"You're far too mean to be the last illusion before I die" All of us seeing &lt;insert favourite idol here> lol</div></blockquote>Wow is that a betrayal up on the mountains? Damn. Also, I said I'm "going to" die but not now, girl, stop making me think I'm already in Heaven. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode of a new arc we are finally in (#KyokouSuiri14), I didn't realize we are in the cutest episode in the series EVER. Yeah, what is the craze about Kotoko-chan anyways? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, introducing the... eh, not really unluckiest, but more like, and I thought I was the easiest man to take advantage of lol because Muroi-san, who fell down a mountain which I rather not explain why he got pushed down by his friend apparently, is saved by a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yukionna target=_blank>snow woman</a>, which of course, <strike>is voiced by <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki target=_blank>Yuuki Aoi</a></strike> is a youkai but this spirit is around mainly because she rather not see someone die in the mountains as ironically, she doesn't want modern society to build like, safety infrastructure to destroy the nature around these areas which makes sense, then thought of saving the dude from the snow instead even though the guy is so doubtful because she also asked for money because she felt bad stealing from stores stuff she wants to eat? This b*tch knows modern capitalism. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, so offerings, right? I got it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah, blah blah a decade passed, and a lot has happened to Muroi-san's deceived life. He was a president of a company which got bought out because someone betrayed him yet again lol why, his wife left him for another man because why not he's not handsome enough I guess, and he's had enough so he basically decided to retire back in the village near the mountains where he met the snow woman in the first place. Didn't expect to see her again though, but looks like this spirit can't keep the snow cones to herself <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> so I guess this guy might as well return the favour. And probably more with whatever huge cold rack that spirit has lmao why must it even be cold anyways you should've read the novels, but wait wait isn't this just the cutest thing ever?? Like, how is THIS GUY living the life after all this and I'm not? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, that's a lot of build up just to link to this very series because remember this is about some spiritual medium solving mysteries and kissing the boyfriend of a monster? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> As I watch I'm like, what has this got to do with everything we've seen so far in this series, and boy did that "Lady" word strike a bell. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So surprise, the snow woman is indeed working with caution with probably the most trustworthy guy in the planet because damn look at his betrayal resume <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, still is betrayed by his wife upon her murder and are currently investigated by the police even though he has an alibi... which can only be proven by a spirit. So yep, that's kind of a problem, I really thought this spirit is a rival but turns out she's here to replace Kotoko-chan HAHAHAHA what are the chances she'll like the monster of a mermaid and kudan? No way, right? I hope not, we can't deal with love <strike>triangles</strike> rectangles in this mystery series. Yeah mystery, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, nice setup to what might be the drop next week we are investigating a murder to technically save this guy for the I don't know how many times at this point, so let's see if Kotoko can reason her way through. I mean, we can't create a profile for this snow woman to appear in court... or can we? Haha I'm just guessing I have no idea watch the next episode to find out</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuiBo3jtCf_by2myPcZnga_vD7GjyVteFhR1VC7g_DjwuRYp-ygOTHpLGnuFEVx0WiHk4Ccv1CmsE_ZgIq2NWT4QE04lss1F8maYo9bJFdDVWENG0FBsXKeiVPoQFtYfpGmATFpmWYc0DmUIwjUf8GNKFoFu5_zRwxYlEadUkNuXSiRS2Xk9ccx6Fl/s320/kyokousuiri14_rabbit.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>EXPECTATION<br>(Happy Lunar New Year of the Rabbit lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3MQMrC10Lgx69Va3O7qfcL1QMkZpw-HvHrBR9Oqe4_WMOI_jOuPluki07AucTYK8j36eWkfEx0aljRgypzUY0liUsWz0kPhmHsnjprY45VVugziA49SvZJ3dPi1-_KmbRDCv_5OrqaCCwjW-cq9NnnE65dVquwdbZzekN2DtDQvfnjdYMpOJ8EqsY/s320/kyokousuiri14_seduce.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>REALITY<br>(Hell yeah haha ah)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsV3_sgo3_b1yIGNB61cu5Q_HkackOEmMYOwiFrYV9KhmiaCuMcNlWh8O1rMk6YVghTEGj8VZw7IAsFKoon4YAquRZQFrEwsZVXJrEu1-KjHUTB_2mj40y4PsYAQOeWXZ3nxsGIxHpmW27_hQ5-oGOSRBh6toO4CYYoBQrrWj3t_qZtVAsyFCCjoKp/s1600/kyokousuiri14_lick.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>And I guess this is a good in between hehe<br>*<a href=https://jisho.org/search/peropero target=_blank>pero</a>*</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I'll say that. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We continue on the antics of talking about the depression that is Shiraishi, and how he can't be seen during runs. Man, that's gotta be rough dude, and that's assuming you running laps is with integrity because you know, people can cheat a lap or something, dude probably ended up running more at some point just because the count was off as he wasn't noticed a few times. Hey, gotta say, not much difference between him and me in the panting department, that's for sure. Just, panting until next year <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sadly, my salvation isn't some girl who likes me coming in to give me wet wipes to clean off my sweat- WHY IS HIS LIFE BETTER THAN MINE lol I know it's Anime. Also, find a girl who will *<a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoc06xDOpfFCp7BBgzR208nRH712I_RuLu16y3_8XakDhKrOK0jn_izVw6sEDdpH7SkSq2a10p3v-5btqiWALJ2xrvWz_LrHzanA_Je2wwuKy_dW7jkE7zNVNUn1Gi6WDG-GSYARKgNajQWiI7eihAw9GelA7WuvclAE6zAA1ia-rqAndBwbjIeA3G/s1600/arusuno01_sniff.gif target=_blank>SUUUUUUN</a>* you even when you sweat. (Haha I love <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/51923/Warau_Arsnotoria_Sun target=_blank>that Anime reference</a>) I don't know, maybe she really likes the dude, what do I know. Speaking of which, looks like the sister is more than interested in her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> and her recent habits of waking up early and, uh, using her perfume? Haha dudes can't figure out cologne I know I don't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, maybe Shiraishi will notice that. Also, just let your little sister leave to see her boi already BITCH CAN YOU NOT?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, as you can see, Nagisa here has some <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsundere target=_blank>tsundere</a> things to her sister but then again the sis is rather persistent just like how she herself is to Shiraishi's interests in manga and she had to borrow from him instead of buy them because you know, we all hate it when Volume 1 is not in the bookstore. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Hey, it's a good plan, even just going to his place to get them books. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Again, this girl might've planned it all, and not like Shiraishi will notice anyways. Haha I thought this was about not noticing the dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, in your usual case of "going to school" with the dude really reminds me of "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/12291/Acchi_Kocchi target=_blank>Acchi Kocchi</a>" I'm sorry for more references but the wholesomeness of romance is also similar somehow, so you know, all this going to school thing but without the pretext of saying anything. Yeah, subtle. But also, waiting for Kubo-san's friends, of course. Haha bro what are you thinking you think we doing naughty stuff early in the park- And it still wouldn't be as bad as going home without the keys. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Dude, why is my life in this Anime. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Of course, different from my experience, someone walked him home which <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> I wish someone will do that too but my crush lives 2 seconds by the school and I had to take the bus lmao <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> saw him not be able to go home after being drenched from what was a puddle run over by a car by the road TYPICAL haha, then thought of letting the guy to dry up at her place. Oh okay so we going to HER house now?? LET'S GOOOOO <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay and if you wonder why this was better than the girl going to his place... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's just a bathroom I didn't see a bra or nothing. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, maybe see how many times I've laughed at just writing this review without trying to write too much of a narrative as I promised myself not to. What I could not promise myself though, is to not stop watching shows like this where the interactions are so to my tastes I can't put it down. So yeah, I'm in this already, don't mind me. We are sometimes hit with the depression that is Shiraishi lol, but otherwise, the situations are cute, the girl is cute, the girl's sister is cute... haha what's there not to like? We are also not introduced to her other sister(?) yet so I wonder where does she place into this equation which I don't know how to calculate. Well, what else is there to say? If you want bittersweet romance whether it's coming in from the guy or the girl's perspective, this will have you covered. I mean I know this is <a href=https://jisho.org/search/seinen target=_blank>seinen</a> genre but come on right? Everyone likes pure stories haha I mean at least I do</div><div>[TL:DR; "The way she closed the gap between us is bad for my heart" ALREADY better than Takagi-san series haha also this Anime is also bad for my heart I just realized lol]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjPX0AEZmtk8epJS1OJuCHFAVvw7GKBGcD5tdPsQAGOxmsmglqxnnBs7Lnnca1bxTrvnSf9FhXLdVWphJAfsUTzHdh2xOZ_qTWIkiTA3osC9_1Ms0RHLPloMW-fCGBsE3volcll6eF34C9fL4DrEGOQdxpbKWBlli8COTRv5pOe4IhIb77MjrPajbC/s320/kubosan02_shiraishi5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when people ask why I would be interested in a wholesome romance slice-of-life<br>(Haha yes referring to this series)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7GWrUvJyqcjMFrH8s0LVlLdkKDsSe09JlQlb6UEb6RLmR983YFytlMT4mFF1373O7HS-KAcYq463SFsT4P18BsC2vAzztaVtKWtZdBw9hANxDD2B5vhiJrOxCyPp2nPXRf_t9TKzTEMS8hK2P_U3BINt-jMfLzXnjL_6c4j6ZTx51h_fABCNF50gD/s1600/kubosan02_slide.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That's cute lol that's me seeing my crush too</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Yeah he wants you to work <em>under</em> him lol</div></blockquote>Oh, so Ranpo-san knows everything all along, what else is new. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, if you still have NO IDEA if the guy driving Ranpo is the culprit here in this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs40) I hope they have told you what you need to know last week. Like, really, of course, but to know how it worked, then yes we will need a very famous detective to explain all of this. Then again, do you think all of this matters if we can't even catch the mastermind? I mean, we don't even know- Hey, all that is important is that Ranpo knows. Wait, he also doesn't? Oops. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, story. So surprise surprise, the guy on the vehicle is working under the organization we shall abbreviate as "V" for now because we'll talk about why that isn't and/or that will be explained in future episodes when we go back to the present, but suffice it to say that a couple of things have happened long before the play has started. For starters, we know about the actor who faked his death. That one is probably just staged with the stage wright who is murdered as soon as the act started, mainly because they can cut off this part of the trail, I assume. They as in the "V" thing. Then, we know some other people not related to the play are involved. Of course, the obvious, Fukuzawa and Ranpo are there. Just that the latter chose to let things go on as they are also because for example, the stage wright was already killed before he can deduce the truth of the current case so that's already kinda impossible to save, but we can save the others, including the one who was supposedly knocked out and wrapped on a carpet and transported to the back of the stage. We will talk about who that is later haha if you haven't even realized who he is maybe look at the cane Fukuzawa was told to find by Ranpo and tell me you recall a certain cat in this series. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Other than that, Fukuzawa was at least smart enough to deduce Ranpo's hints without letting the police officer who took him away know, like leaving a note on the sign he knocked over lol that was elaborate, so technically knowing that Fukuzawa would know people or maybe that dude from the case of the flying documents (lol) or any other Ability users or activity who would help him in locating Ranpo. Ironically, Fukuzawa was on time before the guy could pull a fast one on the detective, and saved him on time. But Ranpo deserved that slap since Fukuzawa be right: He shouldn't just put your life at stake. Or else we won't know when you have to. You would be dead detective before anyone could get you famous, bro. And we're not talking about that book thing you can do to trap people until they can solve your mystery. So yeah, maybe not do that next time. With this incident though, we now know of several things about this "V" thing. Firstly, we know of the mastermind, because I recall he had a certain Ability which can see the present? Who was the guy in "DEAD APPLE"?? Oh, Fyodor. I almost forgot his name until I see him. *looks at Wiki* Okay, he can kill anything with touch, that's creepy. Probably on the stage wright- ANYWAYS, we know he's still alive, he is technically not in the main Anime series yet, so I guess we will see him introduce himself in due time and not from a shipping container lol. Next up, we know "V" is "Five" now. But for this I don't recall what was the thing to be honest? So let's just assume it's something with Ability users and stuff, but damn are we not even close to the main villains. We had Port Mafia which we learnt is in cahoots with the Detective Agency and the police (as a triage to protect fictional Yokohama), we know of the American Ability user group, and I guess now we will be properly introduced to the [REDACTED] Ability user group. Last but not least, the formation of the Detective Agency, basically the origin of this is the flashback arc. So, wink wink, Natsume Souseki is under observation and working with the government as an Ability user back in a time where they aren't regulated, and overseeing this duo he approved of them running a business to keep this protection job or mystery-solving more formal. He was probably also trying to get into this theatre incident to find out more what is with this threat. And then you know the rest from here on, with Port Mafia and how the triangle is formed. All in all, man what a setup to reach this point, Fukuzawa is right Ranpo doesn't know shit and we could be done with this series if you were a second late to stop the trigger, but hey, what is the fun in that? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay we got enough of this shit let us go back to the present where we have Elise-chan and Akutagawa and Fyodor- Okay not the last one lol</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjT3T9ToQEUXSZMZcb6hSVoxGsnd6QZ1eF_V0fcVoZ35FeVjA_JoMRVXbL0AnIPi2ly0Mq5RvvC9B8v7bVaXlqu2OVt4eZugUGMCzh_aG5dE2hjDNpi1N6iJRNKsqw9ya6L6fDDYC5Apu1_NwTvHOSGIryUHtaDXLfd-rY7vYvQRbYZgi22WSg2g6z/s320/bungoustraydogs40_natsume1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>So cool, you didn't realize he didn't have any arms<br>(Haha he has, if you look closely)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhh_lZI3iEx4fatwY739ubFYlr0KsB-OU5YVwQFAyK2tgEF0b665D7uiB8lHfz0mzVvEOBspA7S_Ho28NhwFcm_NBssswE2B2xa7JbGXsxLF-EpB0HkStlBeblW_NOHAMedQK6xfA9ZNpNk4TzSZ-QVbZ1fx9Ld8H3WytfrKRPF7zygMFoMY-07cJri/s320/bungoustraydogs40_ranpo5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That time when my mom was angry I played video games instead of do my homework lmao</table></div></div><div>P.S. "If you're killing as a ritual, it doesn't matter who you kill" Yeah, like, a scapegoat, got it. Is that how those people got fired in big tech companies due to management decisions to keep their own pay checks? lol<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span style=font-size:large>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hmm not much this week as I explained last week lol, but I did catch up on more new releases just within this year which is like three weeks? Hey, it's something to go off with. For example. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/heaven/1658495326?i=1658495356&amp;l=en" target=_blank>Gotch's new song</a></b> got into me despite the deep rap speech thing in its verses so I'm giving it anyways. I also got to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ugly-beauty/1661606318?l=en" target=_blank>DENIMS' new album</a></b> which is actually released this week and considering my bad rap with them previously after I gave such a wonderful release which was two albums ago... this new one is as weird as I thought it will be. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, normal. Maybe too normal just listening to the topic songs, so I went for something weirder, as mentioned on Twitter. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I also just stumbled upon (like, just now as I'm writing this) <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/encount/1660213144?l=en" target=_blank>SunSet Swish's new album</a></b> which also released this week so maybe I also give that a listen right now and give <em>maybe</em> one song or two. Thanks, Apple Music. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span><br><br> Well this will be rather a short one since we'll be missing Sunday, but next time around we will update them back. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/mol_74/status/1615363669868810248?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA" target=_blank>mol-74's new song</a></b> since they announced going independent starting this year is a meh, so let's see if they can offer something else by the end of the year. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1615476561645342721?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new song will be for a new drama theme song</a></b> (and I thought they don't have new songs anymore) so let's see when that gets a physical release. If you need some cringe from this news column here's <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1615524129331122176?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai featured in a live video</a></b> for if I didn't remember wrongly European music channel Fender, because guess what SCANDAL was in it before too. I meant cringe because Haruko-san will be speaking in the video clip in English. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1616376447723266050?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA" target=_blank>TrySail announced a new song on digital release</a></b> during their recent live tour which you know, see you later for a new release of sorts then. Somehow it just takes a lot for me to give digital release off the bat, and not that I've not done so, but clearly not for the above. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1616649591574900737?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai also announced a new album due in May</a></b> which is quite fast considering I just credited their previous album on my own rankings last year. Printing songs already, by the way. Reasons why mol-74 rather go from major label to independent, by the way. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1616722272953286657?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA" target=_blank>Aimer's new single is slated for start of March</a></b> and I think you guys know already it's for the new "NiER:Automata" Anime series so let's hope there's something better than the topic song that is not depression or whatever. Short, isn't it?</div><div><br>So for next week, though I'll be at work because I didn't bother to take work leave, I'll be listening to, on the go, a slew of releases hopefully in this particular order of importance, which will be *takes in deep breath* <b>SCREEN mode's new single</b> and <b>LUCKLIFE's new single</b> for Anime "Stray Dogs" which of course the latter was for another Anime too in their double A-side so be aware of that I'll likely be giving those instead of the former haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, <b>Fuchigami Mai's concept mini-album</b> which I have mentioned is run by vocaloid composers so I hope they aren't literally Hatsune Miku lol, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/aowoikiru-ep/1664414942?l=en" target=_blank>Takahashi Rie's new EP</a></b> hopefully finding some gems similar to her very first release last year. Then maybe I'll give a damn about <b>halca's new album</b> which either I care after I listen to her appearing in <a href=https://twitter.com/CultureZ_ target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's late night show on Monday</a> (which you will know by the next post, on Tuesday) and/or after I get to watch the Anime "Kaguya-sama" movie because she sang an insert song. Either way don't expect me to care more than I cared about her single for Anime last year. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then there are a laundry list of them waiting for me to review which I didn't mention here so maaaaybe I'll listen to them if I'm reeeeeal bored lmao what is with this crowding of releases on this week anyways<br><br><br><br><br> So, the plan for <b>the next Entertainment News</b>. The first Anime Extra of the year will feature... "Tenshi-sama" haha I really want to keep those selfies of not Mahiru for next time to be honest, and yes, the recent "Takagi-san" movie which I told myself I should watch by the end of last year but didn't. Klassic Note Song Awards, it's all your fault (lol), and now I will watch it, and it will probably be done... after we're done with this tradition of a holiday so Tuesday if all things go well, which I will then also watch the latest episode of "Kyokou Suiri" as it comes out. Yes, more snow woman haha you think there will be a sex scene? After the wife got murdered? Maybe just f**king the rabbit I guess. With contraceptives. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys next time then, and until next time... maybe listening to SunSet Swish in 2023 was a mistake lol I hardly know them anyways they sound like frederic somehow and the latter is better-<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I still cannot believe I may have to follow on my next doujin series "Shinki no Ane" and I think I did mention before because now that they have <a href="https://twitter.com/92M/status/1616095611614531585?s=20&amp;t=Ffe724C4BZsGuER3cYnsLQ" target=_blank>an ASMR video</a> of the main girl ie. elder sis of the story... voiced by <a href="https://twitter.com/RiccaTachibana/status/1604084633838051328?s=20&amp;t=KyKA_1vDgB4cm-HFnJJf4w" target=_blank>Tachibana Rika</a>-sama... Haha okay short Anime series like "Douki-chan" and I buy <a href="https://twitter.com/92M/status/1607734641603272704?s=20&amp;t=Ffe724C4BZsGuER3cYnsLQ" target=_blank>FOUR volumes</a>.
