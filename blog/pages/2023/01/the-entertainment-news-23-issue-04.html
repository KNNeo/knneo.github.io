Well, tomorrow is the one and only Chinese/Lunar New Year depending on who you
ask so I won't be at home to do Anime and music by then so we shall do it on a
Saturday! Yeah yeah, I know, Sunday is where all the good stuff comes in, so
maybe we will compensate this by doing a once in a while Anime Extra, the first
this year! I have something prepared for that occasion though, so don't you
worry.
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  The package is coming in quite well, and so are my plans for my upcoming
  birthday which I will tell you guys in a post of what I will do to continue my
  fandom for... well everything I have today. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> That isn't much to say
  about me but we shall live with it! It's my life after all I want to be happy-
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, let's!

  Wow is that a betrayal up on the mountains? Damn. Also, I said I'm "going to"
  die but not now, girl, stop making me think I'm already in Heaven. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  In this new episode of a new arc we are finally in (#KyokouSuiri14), I didn't
  realize we are in the cutest episode in the series EVER. Yeah, what is the
  craze about Kotoko-chan anyways? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, introducing the... eh, not
  really unluckiest, but more like, and I thought I was the easiest man to take
  advantage of lol because Muroi-san, who fell down a mountain which I rather
  not explain why he got pushed down by his friend apparently, is saved by a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yukionna" target="_blank">snow woman</a>,
  which of course,
  <strike
    >is voiced by
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki" target="_blank"
      >Yuuki Aoi</a
    ></strike
  >
  is a youkai but this spirit is around mainly because she rather not see
  someone die in the mountains as ironically, she doesn't want modern society to
  build like, safety infrastructure to destroy the nature around these areas
  which makes sense, then thought of saving the dude from the snow instead even
  though the guy is so doubtful because she also asked for money because she
  felt bad stealing from stores stuff she wants to eat? This b*tch knows modern
  capitalism. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, so offerings, right? I got it. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So yeah,
  blah blah a decade passed, and a lot has happened to Muroi-san's deceived
  life. He was a president of a company which got bought out because someone
  betrayed him yet again lol why, his wife left him for another man because why
  not he's not handsome enough I guess, and he's had enough so he basically
  decided to retire back in the village near the mountains where he met the snow
  woman in the first place. Didn't expect to see her again though, but looks
  like this spirit can't keep the snow cones to herself <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> so I guess this
  guy might as well return the favour. And probably more with whatever huge cold
  rack that spirit has lmao why must it even be cold anyways you should've read
  the novels, but wait wait isn't this just the cutest thing ever?? Like, how is
  THIS GUY living the life after all this and I'm not? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, that's a
  lot of build up just to link to this very series because remember this is
  about some spiritual medium solving mysteries and kissing the boyfriend of a
  monster? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> As I watch I'm like, what has this got to do with
  everything we've seen so far in this series, and boy did that "Lady" word
  strike a bell. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So surprise, the snow woman is indeed working with
  caution with probably the most trustworthy guy in the planet because damn look
  at his betrayal resume <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, still is betrayed by his wife upon her murder
  and are currently investigated by the police even though he has an alibi...
  which can only be proven by a spirit. So yep, that's kind of a problem, I
  really thought this spirit is a rival but turns out she's here to replace
  Kotoko-chan HAHAHAHA what are the chances she'll like the monster of a mermaid
  and kudan? No way, right? I hope not, we can't deal with love
  <strike>triangles</strike> rectangles in this mystery series. Yeah mystery, by
  the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, nice setup to what might be the drop next week
  we are investigating a murder to technically save this guy for the I don't
  know how many times at this point, so let's see if Kotoko can reason her way
  through. I mean, we can't create a profile for this snow woman to appear in
  court... or can we? Haha I'm just guessing I have no idea watch the next
  episode to find out

  "Lunch break is over, why am I still feeling sleepy" Oh dude, you'll feel it
  when you start work too lol in this new episode of a lovely series I will
  definitely be hooked on I am already to be honest (#KuboSan02), don't mind me
  saying cute from the start because if you aren't here for Shiraishi which I
  assume you aren't you won't notice him anyways <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, then yes, Kubo Nagisa
  is adorable. I'll say that. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> We continue on the antics of talking
  about the depression that is Shiraishi, and how he can't be seen during runs.
  Man, that's gotta be rough dude, and that's assuming you running laps is with
  integrity because you know, people can cheat a lap or something, dude probably
  ended up running more at some point just because the count was off as he
  wasn't noticed a few times. Hey, gotta say, not much difference between him
  and me in the panting department, that's for sure. Just, panting until next
  year <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Sadly, my salvation isn't some girl who likes me coming in to
  give me wet wipes to clean off my sweat- WHY IS HIS LIFE BETTER THAN MINE lol
  I know it's Anime. Also, find a girl who will *<a

    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/51923/Warau_Arsnotoria_Sun"
    target="_blank"
    >that Anime reference</a
  >) I don't know, maybe she really likes the dude, what do I know. Speaking of
  which, looks like the sister is more than interested in her
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> and her
  recent habits of waking up early and, uh, using her perfume? Haha dudes can't
  figure out cologne I know I don't. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, maybe Shiraishi will
  notice that. Also, just let your little sister leave to see her boi already
  BITCH CAN YOU NOT?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, as you can see, Nagisa here has some
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a>
  things to her sister but then again the sis is rather persistent just like how
  she herself is to Shiraishi's interests in manga and she had to borrow from
  him instead of buy them because you know, we all hate it when Volume 1 is not
  in the bookstore. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Hey, it's a good plan, even just going to his place
  to get them books. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Again, this girl might've planned it all, and not
  like Shiraishi will notice anyways. Haha I thought this was about not noticing
  the dude. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, in your usual case of "going to school" with the
  dude really reminds me of "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/12291/Acchi_Kocchi"
    target="_blank"
    >Acchi Kocchi</a
  >" I'm sorry for more references but the wholesomeness of romance is also
  similar somehow, so you know, all this going to school thing but without the
  pretext of saying anything. Yeah, subtle. But also, waiting for Kubo-san's
  friends, of course. Haha bro what are you thinking you think we doing naughty
  stuff early in the park- And it still wouldn't be as bad as going home without
  the keys. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Dude, why is my life in this Anime. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Of course,
  different from my experience, someone walked him home which <span title="*cringe*">😬</span> I wish
  someone will do that too but my crush lives 2 seconds by the school and I had
  to take the bus lmao <span title="*shrugs*">🤷</span> saw him not be able to go home after being
  drenched from what was a puddle run over by a car by the road TYPICAL haha,
  then thought of letting the guy to dry up at her place. Oh okay so we going to
  HER house now?? LET'S GOOOOO <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay and if you wonder why this was
  better than the girl going to his place... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> It's just a bathroom I
  didn't see a bra or nothing. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All in all, maybe see how many times
  I've laughed at just writing this review without trying to write too much of a
  narrative as I promised myself not to. What I could not promise myself though,
  is to not stop watching shows like this where the interactions are so to my
  tastes I can't put it down. So yeah, I'm in this already, don't mind me. We
  are sometimes hit with the depression that is Shiraishi lol, but otherwise,
  the situations are cute, the girl is cute, the girl's sister is cute... haha
  what's there not to like? We are also not introduced to her other sister(?)
  yet so I wonder where does she place into this equation which I don't know how
  to calculate. Well, what else is there to say? If you want bittersweet romance
  whether it's coming in from the guy or the girl's perspective, this will have
  you covered. I mean I know this is
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/seinen" target="_blank">seinen</a> genre but
  come on right? Everyone likes pure stories haha I mean at least I do
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "The way she closed the gap between us is bad for my heart" ALREADY
  better than Takagi-san series haha also this Anime is also bad for my heart I
  just realized lol]

  </blockquote>
  Oh, so Ranpo-san knows everything all along, what else is new. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey,
  if you still have NO IDEA if the guy driving Ranpo is the culprit here in this
  new episode (#BungouStrayDogs40) I hope they have told you what you need to
  know last week. Like, really, of course, but to know how it worked, then yes
  we will need a very famous detective to explain all of this. Then again, do
  you think all of this matters if we can't even catch the mastermind? I mean,
  we don't even know- Hey, all that is important is that Ranpo knows. Wait, he
  also doesn't? Oops. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, story. So surprise surprise, the guy on
  the vehicle is working under the organization we shall abbreviate as "V" for
  now because we'll talk about why that isn't and/or that will be explained in
  future episodes when we go back to the present, but suffice it to say that a
  couple of things have happened long before the play has started. For starters,
  we know about the actor who faked his death. That one is probably just staged
  with the stage wright who is murdered as soon as the act started, mainly
  because they can cut off this part of the trail, I assume. They as in the "V"
  thing. Then, we know some other people not related to the play are involved.
  Of course, the obvious, Fukuzawa and Ranpo are there. Just that the latter
  chose to let things go on as they are also because for example, the stage
  wright was already killed before he can deduce the truth of the current case
  so that's already kinda impossible to save, but we can save the others,
  including the one who was supposedly knocked out and wrapped on a carpet and
  transported to the back of the stage. We will talk about who that is later
  haha if you haven't even realized who he is maybe look at the cane Fukuzawa
  was told to find by Ranpo and tell me you recall a certain cat in this series.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Other than that, Fukuzawa was at least smart enough to deduce
  Ranpo's hints without letting the police officer who took him away know, like
  leaving a note on the sign he knocked over lol that was elaborate, so
  technically knowing that Fukuzawa would know people or maybe that dude from
  the case of the flying documents (lol) or any other Ability users or activity
  who would help him in locating Ranpo. Ironically, Fukuzawa was on time before
  the guy could pull a fast one on the detective, and saved him on time. But
  Ranpo deserved that slap since Fukuzawa be right: He shouldn't just put your
  life at stake. Or else we won't know when you have to. You would be dead
  detective before anyone could get you famous, bro. And we're not talking about
  that book thing you can do to trap people until they can solve your mystery.
  So yeah, maybe not do that next time. With this incident though, we now know
  of several things about this "V" thing. Firstly, we know of the mastermind,
  because I recall he had a certain Ability which can see the present? Who was
  the guy in "DEAD APPLE"?? Oh, Fyodor. I almost forgot his name until I see
  him. *looks at Wiki* Okay, he can kill anything with touch, that's creepy.
  Probably on the stage wright- ANYWAYS, we know he's still alive, he is
  technically not in the main Anime series yet, so I guess we will see him
  introduce himself in due time and not from a shipping container lol. Next up,
  we know "V" is "Five" now. But for this I don't recall what was the thing to
  be honest? So let's just assume it's something with Ability users and stuff,
  but damn are we not even close to the main villains. We had Port Mafia which
  we learnt is in cahoots with the Detective Agency and the police (as a triage
  to protect fictional Yokohama), we know of the American Ability user group,
  and I guess now we will be properly introduced to the [REDACTED] Ability user
  group. Last but not least, the formation of the Detective Agency, basically
  the origin of this is the flashback arc. So, wink wink, Natsume Souseki is
  under observation and working with the government as an Ability user back in a
  time where they aren't regulated, and overseeing this duo he approved of them
  running a business to keep this protection job or mystery-solving more formal.
  He was probably also trying to get into this theatre incident to find out more
  what is with this threat. And then you know the rest from here on, with Port
  Mafia and how the triangle is formed. All in all, man what a setup to reach
  this point, Fukuzawa is right Ranpo doesn't know shit and we could be done
  with this series if you were a second late to stop the trigger, but hey, what
  is the fun in that? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay we got enough of this shit let us go back to
  the present where we have Elise-chan and Akutagawa and Fyodor- Okay not the
  last one lol

  Hmm not much this week as I explained last week lol, but I did catch up on
  more new releases just within this year which is like three weeks? Hey, it's
  something to go off with. For example.

      >Gotch's new song</a

  got into me despite the deep rap speech thing in its verses so I'm giving it
  anyways. I also got to listen to
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ugly-beauty/1661606318?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >DENIMS' new album</a
    ></b
  >
  which is actually released this week and considering my bad rap with them
  previously after I gave such a wonderful release which was two albums ago...
  this new one is as weird as I thought it will be. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, normal. Maybe
  too normal just listening to the topic songs, so I went for something weirder,
  as mentioned on Twitter. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I also just stumbled upon (like, just now
  as I'm writing this)
  <b
    ><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/encount/1660213144?l=en" target="_blank"
      >SunSet Swish's new album</a
    ></b
  >&nbsp;which also released this week so maybe I also give that a listen right
  now and give <i>maybe</i> one song or two. Thanks, Apple Music. <span title="*wink*">😉</span><br />
  <br />
  Well this will be rather a short one since we'll be missing Sunday, but next
  time around we will update them back.

      >mol-74's new song</a

  since they announced going independent starting this year is a meh, so let's
  see if they can offer something else by the end of the year.
  <b
    ><a

      >Ikimonogakari's new song&nbsp;will be for a new drama theme song</a
    ></b
  >&nbsp;(and I thought they don't have new songs anymore) so let's see when
  that gets a physical release. If you need some cringe from this news column
  here's
  <b

      target="_blank"
      >Ryokuoushoku Shakai featured in a live video</a

  for if I didn't remember wrongly European music channel Fender, because guess
  what SCANDAL was in it before too. I meant cringe because Haruko-san will be
  speaking in the video clip in English. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  <b

      href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1616376447723266050?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA"
      target="_blank"
      >TrySail announced a new song on digital release</a
    ></b
  >
  during their recent live tour which you know, see you later for a new release
  of sorts then. Somehow it just takes a lot for me to give digital release off
  the bat, and not that I've not done so, but clearly not for the above.
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1616649591574900737?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA"
      target="_blank"
      >Ryokuoushoku Shakai also announced a new album due in May</a
    ></b
  >
  which is quite fast considering I just credited their previous album on my own
  rankings last year. Printing songs already, by the way. Reasons why mol-74
  rather go from major label to independent, by the way. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1616722272953286657?s=20&amp;t=slK1ejRLIm6pe9rajw-aVA"
      target="_blank"
      >Aimer's new single is slated for start of March</a
    ></b
  >
  and I think you guys know already it's for the new "NiER:Automata" Anime
  series so let's hope there's something better than the topic song that is not
  depression or whatever. Short, isn't it?
</div>
<div>
  <br />
  So for next week, though I'll be at work because I didn't bother to take work
  leave, I'll be listening to, on the go, a slew of releases hopefully in this
  particular order of importance, which will be *takes in deep breath*
  <b>SCREEN mode's new single</b> and <b>LUCKLIFE's new single</b> for Anime
  "Stray Dogs" which of course the latter was for another Anime too in their
  double A-side so be aware of that I'll likely be giving those instead of the
  former haha <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, <b>Fuchigami Mai's concept mini-album</b> which I have
  mentioned is run by vocaloid composers so I hope they aren't literally Hatsune
  Miku lol, and
  <b
    ><a
      href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/aowoikiru-ep/1664414942?l=en"
      target="_blank"
      >Takahashi Rie's new EP</a
    ></b
  >
  hopefully finding some gems similar to her very first release last year. Then
  maybe I'll give a damn about <b>halca's new album</b> which either I care
  after I listen to her appearing in
  <a href="https://twitter.com/CultureZ_" target="_blank"
    >Natsukawa Shiina's late night show on Monday</a
  >
  (which you will know by the next post, on Tuesday) and/or after I get to watch
  the Anime "Kaguya-sama" movie because she sang an insert song. Either way
  don't expect me to care more than I cared about her single for Anime last
  year. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And then there are a laundry list of them waiting for me to
  review which I didn't mention here so maaaaybe I'll listen to them if I'm
  reeeeeal bored lmao what is with this crowding of releases on this week
  anyways<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  So, the plan for <b>the next Entertainment News</b>. The first Anime Extra of
  the year will feature... "Tenshi-sama" haha I really want to keep those
  selfies of not Mahiru for next time to be honest, and yes, the recent
  "Takagi-san" movie which I told myself I should watch by the end of last year
  but didn't. Klassic Note Song Awards, it's all your fault (lol), and now I
  will watch it, and it will probably be done... after we're done with this
  tradition of a holiday so Tuesday if all things go well, which I will then
  also watch the latest episode of "Kyokou Suiri" as it comes out. Yes, more
  snow woman haha you think there will be a sex scene? After the wife got
  murdered? Maybe just f**king the rabbit I guess. With contraceptives. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  See you guys next time then, and until next time... maybe listening to SunSet
  Swish in 2023 was a mistake lol I hardly know them anyways they sound like
  frederic somehow and the latter is better-<br />

  P.S. I still cannot believe I may have to follow on my next doujin series
  "Shinki no Ane" and I think I did mention before because now that they have
