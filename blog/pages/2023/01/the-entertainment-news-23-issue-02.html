Well Twitch streamer burnt my Sunday morning and tomorrow's gonna suck so let's
not talk about any of those, shall we? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Can we also not put this as
intro I have to read it and it's just
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Hey, welcome back to my world of music and Anime! Sorry for the lack of the
  former last week we are just one day into the new year it's hard to find songs
  to listen to considering we are 15 years in and I can't stop rejecting
  melodies- But that's the reality dude, so we better do something about this
  before the month ends and I have to deal with a storeroom of new releases I
  may or may not like lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So let's! We got action, we got romance again because I can't get around the
  fact that I want love but still want to be single-<br />
  <br />

  </blockquote>
  "From now on, I work alone" is literally me when I walk out of the house.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, I may share some similarities with the Prez so don't mind me.
  So about the new season of this wonderful action series (#BungouStrayDogs38) I
  guess we are starting with flashbacks. Well, flashback in flashbacks if they
  are keeping at this rate lol but yeah, it's about Fukuzawa, the Prez of the
  Detective Agency. And Ranpo, the first apprentice, what looks like. And he's
  too real dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I meant Ranpo. He's so real, he will see through me
  even if I'm watching a video of him in it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So, let's talk about why.
  Fukuzawa was still working for the police (instead of WITH the police, take
  note) as an assassin and is taking on another job of a murder done very
  recently, and looking around at a dude filing papers on the ground lol, a
  culprit apprehended and placed inside a room all on his own, separated by a
  bunch of papers because they are on the ground. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, even if you
  aren't Ranpo with his deduction Ability (or not, he doesn't need it) to see
  the truth, you may have figured how could some top gun assassin sit in a room
  all by himself without any law enforcement. So yeah, to be fair, I am also
  close to detective material but Ranpo will expose me for doing weird stuff in
  my room like opening packages haha, so we shall leave it at that. But Ranpo
  wouldn't, as seen he was just here for an interview from the guy who was the
  victim at the scene of the crime. And the real culprit is sorting papers in a
  lab coat. Dude, who would've figured that out if you aren't a high schooler?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, after just treating him to a meal Fukuzawa soon realized
  this kid has potential of exposing everyone's lies including his lol too real
  dude, so maybe killing him first might be a good option- I'm more surprised
  why isn't he dead at this point. Bro, you know how society works? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Maybe I know too much about how society works too. But hey, that's why you are
  on your own finding a job and never sitting on one for long. Man, imagine if I
  talked cr*p *ahem* about the truth of the co-workers around me. I will not be
  seeing the day of light. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Despite all the seriousness in the mystery
  and we are already embarking on another job in the theatre, the comedy is
  clearly seen by just Ranpo all by himself lol comedy relief we call him, but
  also that he is just super observant and has vast knowledge about events that
  are happening without even looking at the newspaper longer than I do which is
  none. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Just that, is already a good enough reason to keep him by your
  side, dear swordsman. Ironically is that, is where Ranpo will be then be of
  use and/or have a reason to get out of working for someone someday. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> All
  in all, we are at a stage where truth drop here, cat transfiguration god isn't
  here yet haha if you would recall from the previous season where the forces
  had to play peace in Yokohama because of him, so there really isn't much to
  protect for now apart from maybe just this kid who can solve mysteries and why
  he himself isn't opening a Detective Agency just yet. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey maybe he
  will someday, he might need some protection if he reaches that stage. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>
  Too much to talk about just in flashbacks, but impressive setup for the story
  so far ruined by Ranpo-san's straightforwardness haha, so let's see who's the
  criminal who will appear right on their doorstep. Literally. It's not a
  threat, guys; This theatre action is real. See you then.

  I promised to not give an Anime with a long title but look what we have gotten
  ourselves into. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, I'm pretty sure this guy's faking it. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  In this new series adapted from a web novel (#OtonariNoTenshiSama01) hmm how
  should I even talk about this. Like, even in the first scene the circumstances
  are already weak to start with. But yeah, considering I've seen feathers
  flying past my face into a girl in a playground in the rain big enough I have
  my umbrella open, really makes you wonder how this all even happened. Let's
  just say it's a matter of circumstance, okay? Anime needs stuff like this. And
  even so, the reaction from the girl is very bland. I mean, the thanks is
  there, formality, but dude, I really expected something more upfront. Well, I
  guess what happened from here on is more than one would expect and that's why
  the title drop of making the guy even more useless meeting this "angel", but
  yeah, feels like
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">onee-san</a> taking
  care of some dude who doesn't care about his life, right? Feels like it to me
  though. And maybe just because of this, seeing him eating what was that,
  energy drinks for dinner? I mean, can it be considered eating? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So
  maybe yeah even if I lived alone I would still do takeaways which will explain
  how his place looked this bad but that is really no reason to not take out the
  trash... man, is this worse than "Toradora!" with
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/12064/Taiga_Aisaka" target="_blank"
    >Taiga-chan</a
  >? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe it's the reverse of that lol so Shiina-san here (*<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/people/23405/Shiina_Natsukawa"
    target="_blank"
    >gets crazy deja vu</a
  >*) just can't help but help out this guy who can't take care of himself
  considering this guy is her neighbour. Well to be honest? Only like, my mom
  would give a damn so this is quite a thing to return the favour of I guess.
  Hey, just an umbrella, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But yeah, what I actually see in
  this series though, is that they may have just dumped an
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> to this
  girl who doesn't care about love.
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/52865/Romantic_Killer" target="_blank"
    >I speak from experience.</a
  >
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Because think about it: Some guy just appeared in her life and she
  wants to help out all she can even like, making him food on the daily? I mean,
  are those even just leftovers? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> It's not like if we can see ulterior
  motives here, but even if you dump in all the lore that the girl is the most
  popular thing in school and he wouldn't even care... The girl is probably only
  interested in you!! Uh, I mean, let's not spoil that part yet, right? I'm not
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/132504/Ranpo_Edogawa"
    target="_blank"
    >a detective</a
  >. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And please don't say this is a romantic comedy as I continue to
  point out stuff that is as disappointing as the characters themselves, I would
  say. Falling down landing on the wrong position (lol turn her around, bro),
  the guy Amane saying Shiina's cooking is good and the girl replying that
  everyone can make this much when I can't even cook for sh*t, and just
  coincidentally returning the box back every evening to get another box of
  leftovers for days? Hey, tell me the girl isn't trying to get herself laid.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know, this might be a misunderstanding for all we know. We may have
  already set the genre for this series wrongly, I might add. All in all... it
  feels like every time I want to clap my hands, one of my hands is missing.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Is this enough of an analogy? Haha I hope so because this really
  feels like me watching some light novel adaptation again with monologues and
  weak story pacing. Yes, like "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/49470/Mamahaha_no_Tsurego_ga_Motokano_datta"
    target="_blank"
    >TsureKano</a
  >". That's why I'm worried, I'm not prepared to watch another one of these
  again. More like I don't know what to watch this season, but somehow, it's not
  this. Hmm... maybe we try a couple more episodes this animation isn't making
  me tick yet I can tell you that much I'm not even THIS lazy lol try living by
  yourself first, me.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I can't catch my breath with you staring and putting me on edge" You
  know, girl, maybe that's love? Haha ikr please we ONLY simp on

  Wow I did not do much to start the year unlike the previous years, but
  considering we don't have much new songs to cover for the year for now I might
  have to find more to listen to. Meanwhile, thanks to Anime "Romantic Killer"
  I've listened to

  by the way, singing Anime theme songs here and there for FIVE years and THEN
  got an album? The Japan music industry is harsh. Anyways, I did give it a
  listen and picked up a couple of songs which are clearly her best in the list
  so far and are Anime theme songs but aren't winning compared to the one I've
  given her for Anime "Houseki no Kuni" all those years ago. Yes, it has come
  full circle. I've given her in Anime, I'm giving her because of Anime once
  again. Man, she needs more recognition her singing voice is great reminds me
  of fhana? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  is a mess as always but that's a good thing since we will listen to it again
  on the next major release, whenever it appears.

  because it was super damn complicated and the only way you would not miss them
  all is to be subbed to their YouTube channel. Live are removed after premiere,
  and wordy documentaries remain. How do they even get fans? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah,

  (we are in the new year now haha) is just a cute Anime opening theme song so

  mention here because idolism and I like her. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We will give chance when

  <b>SIX LOUNGE's new song</b> for Anime series "Hero Academia" isn't too bad

    >amazarashi</a

  for ending. Aimer actually sounds very suitable in this to be honest it fits
  the heavy and emo style of the series itself, not that it'll be my cup of tea
  just yet. amazarashi, on the other hand, will pre-release the new song on
  digital next week so stay tuned for that I guess. Oh yeah also let me get this
  out of the way lol, also in the new year&nbsp;<b

  listen to the 2018 album.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  I didn't watch a lot of Anime this week but damn did I listen to way too many
  songs just today alone. I mean, look at the above. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And looks like
  someone subbed the "Takagi-san" movie so maybe I'll shell out a night to watch
  this...? Haha good joke, me, you don't have the time. I'll do something up
  next week with the other half of the lot appearing. I'll see about it.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you guys then, and until next time... looks like the only thing
  that is going smoothly so far is my
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gacha" target="_blank">gacha</a> luck in the
  DOAXVV game. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, those were some good luck out there even though
  I didn't get the event one, okay? I'll take those chances over winning REAL
  money. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Maybe we spend more time to blog, yes? We have another public
  holiday coming up in two weeks so let's work towards that. Live to see me
