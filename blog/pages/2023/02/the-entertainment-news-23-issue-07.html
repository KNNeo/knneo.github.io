Okay okay finally that SIGNED photobook is coming my way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh yeah,
should have been on this week's package review, by the way. Which is why no
wonder you may think it's not a lot this time around but hey, slow start for the
year, yes? I gotta beta test paying my item-level taxes first lol <span title="*sigh*">😩</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, hope things will turn around after this week going forward, I didn't
  realize I've already paid for Fiona's birthday
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gacha" target="_blank">gacha</a> in DOAXVV
  before (she was 2nd, 1st was Tamaki hehe) so welp no free set of episodes and
  ring for another member on the list then again. Why do we need to though you
  are welcome for the lipstick Fiona lol

  Alright Kyokou Suiri is FINALLY downloaded (lol don't narc) so let's start the
  Anime! We got a lot to talk about music too<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KyokouSuiri17">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span
      ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kyokou Suiri</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="tr_bq">
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "(Kotoko) and Rikka-san did actually get along at one point, don't you?"
      WHAT lol
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  It's not GPS or satellite communication system, dude. Even if the spirits saw
  anything Kotoko-chan can't know immediately. Which is the problem. Rikka-san
  you b*tch. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where I swear Rikka-san is constantly
  up to no good just by her face alone lol (#KyokouSuiri17), I guess we shall
  find out what happened to her recently. According to the spies Kotoko-chan has
  questioned lol, we know that two months ago I guess with respect to present
  time, Rikka-san is living in an apartment which we are quickly introduced to
  the manager and his girlfriend which has a respectable rack the last time I
  saw one is from the Steel Lady haha quick flashback to season one, living in
  a... spooky apartment that is available because of cheap rent. But contrary to
  the history of tenants which are <span title="*cringe*">😬</span> suicide victims, at least we know
  she won't commit suicide. I mean, she can't. Did you see how she tried to get
  herself rammed by a truck and survived? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah dude someone else
  <i>might </i>commit suicide because of you, Rikka-san. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, in the
  very apartment she is in? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, that counts as 4th time, right? RIP
  Kuro-san you will be missed haha then again you can't die too. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Technically we can stack that suicide number up just in the one apartment but
  cleaning up is a mess so maybe not. We also found out a little more about
  Rikka-san ever since her sort of satellite appearance in the first season of
  the Anime, now talking about how she has been with Kotoko and hated her (lol
  what is new), and gives others the impression that Kotoko might be the new
  Satan of everyone's lives. Not just hers, but seriously, this is just private
  matter so manager don't think too much into it your intuition of jealousy is
  spot-on. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> The manager couple was showed all the reasons Rikka-san
  could be the next suicide victim but to no avail, they knew she wasn't in
  financial trouble or else how can you even bet 20k yen in horses lol that's
  basically part-time salary in Japan, and just as Kotoko said since Rikka has
  the same mermaid body as Kuro-san, she naturally wards all spirits away as
  contrary to what people believe about the haunted abode. Nonetheless, she was
  right about Kotoko and Kuro-senpai appearing soon after to give the manager an
  explanation good enough he can rent the lot out again, but of course, like we
  would spend more time investigating into someone who died after the girlfriend
  died before him in the same place. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Who cares dude just get over it
  and move out or get another girl. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I know right easier said than done.
  Anyways, simple episode to wrap up our recent sighting of Rikka-san, and may
  the next time we see her get involved in more of these 200 IQ plays, I guess.
  Not sure who learnt this level of reasoning skill from who, but somehow, I
  feel like either of them are involved, if not both. We shall see what happens
  ahead, Rikka-san has barely made any action so far.
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I wonder if Sakuragawa-san (Rikka) was just jealous because (Kotoko)
  took her cousin away from her" That's it dude, the manager of the apartment
  nailed it haha]

      unlike you I could NOT find a spot lol RIP middle school me
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  You think Kubo-san placed a tracker on her boi? Like, an AirTag? You think he
  knows? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where it's wrong to stalk on people unless
  they are cute and shy (#KuboSan05), I guess we can talk about more of
  Shiraishi's weird life in school. Hey, it's not weird my experience in middle
  school is pretty much like this, co-starring a Sudoku book and a pen if I'm
  not wrong. Please, an erasable pen, you know how popular those are in 2007?
  Haha okay history lesson over, Shiraishi loves to find places to eat alone and
  looks like the school is big enough to find one, but always, he will get
  noticed by Kubo-san. I mean, not hard, right? Just following him out of class?
  Yeah, it's easy when you are a Kubo lol. They got to eat each other... bento
  omelettes haha chill, I already saw Kubo-san eating it from the fork a mile
  away I can't even, and there's NO WAY she can make something edible. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  Okay, maybe she did make it and it's good. Good enough. I know of a someone
  who specializes only in
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/14776/Tsugumi_Aoba" target="_blank"
    >eggs and vegetables</a
  >
  and that's all her childhood friend gets to eat so what else is new. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  (That's a "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/3958/Kannagi"
    target="_blank"
    >Kannagi</a
  >" reference) Kubo-san did eat his wiener out though so MOVING ON!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  And up next and I swear this is the best part besides the White Day stuff,
  it's the girls' talk, dude. (At shout out to Denny's, my American YouTuber
  knowledge is only used at times like these lol) What else can we talk about
  besides knowing that Kubo Nagisa doesn't know about love and has to let her
  friends tell in on her if she has, even secretly, been over possessive of her
  newfound boyfriend. Please, "boy friend", gotta include the whitespace.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Tama-chan is just raging over this reality of her friend not liking
  an <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> lmao I
  guess Shiraishi isn't one, but as Hazuki mentioned we shouldn't spoil things
  for them so just watch this blossom would be ideal. But yeah, we need more
  reality checks like the whole of "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san"
    target="_blank"
    >Takagi-san</a
  >" series so make this quick or something. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next up is music lesson
  for the couple and I swear all I am thinking about is the
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >opening theme song</a
  >
  but I guess we are not doing that which honestly it's a damn shame, so it's
  probably an old song from Kubo-san haha boomer vibes from her already (Edit:
  Trust me, I can't prove this at all don't know if this will be on the
  soundtrack, who knows), but it's still better than whatever Shiraishi is
  talking about some Anime song when the hero starts fighting like it's "BLEACH"
  and its infamous theme with Ichigo. F**king NERD!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes, talking
  about me too. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last but not least, Shiraishi doing the White Day
  thing. Problem is, he doesn't know who gave him chocolates on Love Day. Haha,
  that's awkward now, huh. But hey, we don't have very far to look at since
  Kubo-san dropped all the hints and somehow, SOMEHOW haha, Shiraishi thinks the
  neighbour in class ONLY knows who did it. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Haha yeah did you see
  Kubo-san's face change when he said he was giving it to someone else? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  I don't know, maybe it's for her. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I sense some

  coming haha this doesn't get old dude (didn't know why I didn't mention it in
  "Kyokou Suiri" lol), but yeah those aren't necessary since we DO know who gave
  him chocolates on Valentine's Day. Uh, look back previous episode for answers,
  thanks. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, damn the hints are dropping but so are my hopes
  for this series lol but really we are still good I'll stay positive like her
  friends are and we will be fine. Shiraishi can't go away he can't be snatched
  by someone else because they don't notice him. No problem, market dominance
  here. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Or so Kubo-san thinks but damn, this is as wholesome as it can
  get, and we can always get more.

    >the original manga serialization is coming to a close</a

  the Anime or not, but hey, if you can conclude this series that'll be sweet,
  to be honest. No season two or something else? Or if you aren't intending to
  then can we conclude it? Haha please?]

  Sounds like a terrible idea, huh, saying Fyodor has been captured? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>

  were great times. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes, I miss
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >Kana-chan</a
  >, what of it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode though we are going elsewhere with
  this flashback series lol (#BungouStrayDogs43), we talk about the Angels of
  Death. Yup. You want to talk about internal corruption? You got it, dude!
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, it's about time, innit? Like, we have been going for three
  seasons of Anime NOT talking about how Sakaguchi can still be in contact with
  like, Atsushi and the others without being found out or eliminated because he
  takes care of or monitor the Ability users in the nation? Hey, I would like to
  say that this is the only legit job in the government because everyone else is
  just wanting the Agency's downfall. Really, the idea of Nikolai threatening
  government officers who are then wanting the end of Detective Agency is kind
  of ironic, even Atsushi knew something was wrong just by smelling a liar who
  hasn't drunk coffee. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, I guess the main point is then, what's
  the purpose of destroying the Detective Agency? Remember Natsume Souseki had
  to create this triage to protect Yokohama and even Japan from harm? Okay never
  mind, let's get to the non-spicy part first. Also, a 101 guide on how to stop
  the Detective Agency! Okay let's go. Firstly, stop the Ability user who can
  disable Abilities. Haha that should be obvious who we are talking about, so I
  assume one of the five Angels of Death back then known as "V" which is a name
  Ranpo-san is more familiar with, is with Dazai on the horse races for some
  reason. Well, that's settled for now I guess, don't have to kill him or
  nothing. Second, find all the crimes the members of the Detective Agency have
  made. Or even better, put them in a crime scene. But first, let's bring us to
  Nikolai's power. Just beating Atsushi's level of understanding seeing him walk
  into the threat first of the government officers and trying to save them
  though they are also corrupt lmao, we know that Nikolai has the Ability of
  creating portals in all directions within a range. And I mean "all" directions
  very specifically because did you see how he got Atsushi's leg stuck IN the
  ground? Which ironically looks like a video game glitch so that's kinda
  screwed up if you think about it. Also how the locations of the Agency members
  can be switched this fast. But that I don't think is from him. Because
  according to the Chief who is still clean, he explains to Ranpo about the
  members of the five Angels. We know of two of them already no surprises there,
  one should be with Dazai because he's such a game changer, and we also know
  one of them can manipulate the mind for information? Access one's memories?
  Think of it as futuristic, I guess, can't comprehend which real life author
  that can be from. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Because it might be this last dude that is very
  different, being able to switch I don't think bodies, but locations of bodies,
  so that let's say Kunikida squatting on the door can be switched with one of
  the enforcers in the room, but likely with the same uh, bodily content? DNA?
  Yeah, I guess. Oh no wait, isn't one of them able to change narrative? Just
  write them as the enforcers? Yeah. That sounds kinda f**ked up though! I guess
  I don't understand it all, and that Tonan dude who already doesn't believe in
  the Agency has all the power to *ahem* call the cops on the Agency so I guess
  why not, right? <span title="*cringe*">😬</span> All in all... I mean, you guys get what happened just
  this episode alone? I'm very confused. Now that Nikolai is dead (lol) can
  someone explain to me what happened? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay jokes aside, we know not to
  trust the jester so he's likely still alive, but the idea of this episode is
  definitely to show that the Angels of Death are the Detective Agency. Easy,
  right? Then the government will remove of them, and then all will be over. As
  in, no one to be able to protect the nation. And we're not relying on Port
  Mafia, by the way, they don't have the wooden arrow. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Wow. I gotta
  say, really hyped about the proceedings on this my blood's flowing crazy. No
  really, can't explain this tension I got right now that's not on my crotch,
  really. It's real impressive so far, and I want to know where this goes.
  Probably not their downfall, but someone has to believe in the Agency. That is
  not them. So that's gonna be hard. Also, is Fyodor free yet? We don't know.
  All the answers we need to know soon, I guess. Damn, is this still the best
  action series so far that I've watched. Okay, second best, "<a

  knows? Ah dammit. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, let's talk about the two Love Days. Yeah, not
  just the one, but yes, as with tradition it HAS to start with the girl. I
  mean, can't be any worse than that dude who got chocolates from all the girls
  in class, he will at least get the one as the buddy mentioned. Don't worry,
  the chocolate here can't be as bad as like, stuffed with frog meat. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>

  is evil enough to ruin Love Day, but suffice it to say that I can talk about
  the differences of what Chitose gave which are
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/girichoko" target="_blank"
    >obligatory chocolates</a
  >
  so it's for anyone without love interest or else the buddy will beat him up
  lol, and what Mahiru has given him at his place because I SWEAR those are
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/honmeichoko" target="_blank"
    >sentiment chocolates</a
  >. Yes, it was the hot chocolate drink. F**king jebaited dude, she gave you
  the chocolate already, you didn't even notice. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Ah that was a great
  Valentine's Day, so of course we fast forward to a month later to let Amane
  worry about what he should give back to her. Obviously not chocolate we don't
  want our angel to be fat lol, and I promise Amane dressing up as his ikemen
  side is probably making Mahiru-chan frantic with excitement haha we call that
  falling in love by the way, then also found like, a
  <strike>wrist accessory</strike>&nbsp;what the heck you call those bracelets,
  for her for White Day. Like, really? Not chocolates, huh. That's great. And
  you dare ask if it's making her uncomfortable? It's making me unwell so what
  the f**k dude go take off your clothes and show your abs or something, dude.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Interestingly, it's more than that because I guess he did put in
  effort to give her like, wishing cards from the guy obviously thinking that
  Mahiru won't use this for... indecent purposes but what do we know, we have
  enough of these cards until Episode 12 so we can expect something. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>
  All in all... BRUH. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> As usual, tell me they are not in a relationship
  already. The romantic type. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I think I know what I hate about this
  series. I hate how much everything is laid out bare. That might be the issue.
  From selecting the right gift for each other and giving to them on the special
  day albeit not in their faces, to them bothered about how they look to each
  other, to even how much they want to celebrate their birthdays and not knowing
  of when whatsoever, I gotta say it's as cringeworthy as it's also very... how
  should I put it, silly? Yeah. Almost said retarded lmao, to think that I'm not
  here to enjoy a romantic relationship between this neighbour helping each
  other situation. But I see another thing coming, and Amane's buddy might be
  right about this, that this friendly relationship will not last long at this
  rate. Someday someone is going to think that advancing into going steady is a
  good idea. Yes, and that will ruin pretty much everything we have seen up till
  now. Not that it's bad, I think it might be coming sooner than later, and I
  wonder if the story will even go in that direction or I guess we just keep
  this storytelling rather monotonous so we can just enjoy more Mahiru-chan
  since why not, we are here for cuteness anyways. Excuse me, here for angel.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Not much has changed since Episode 1 though, I still gotta say.
  Maybe I'm wrong.

    Wow is this week quite a week for Klassic Note, Again, this week is
    literally it, next week onwards for the rest of the month I'll have to find
    something to listen to, so I'll share what's up for the rest of February.
    Meanwhile, let's talk about what I gave!

    is more interesting than that, dude. Also, maybe because it featured so much
    broken English I thought I was listening to No Buses for a second. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>

    coming.

    a day before the release since the B-side didn't get better in my brain and
    the A-side is barely even good. I guess cute voice Akarin is not much to go
    with, huh. Next single is likely for action series Anime so maybe we get
    cool Akarin back.

    is the new Klassic Note Review since the last time I did this almost 6 years
    ago by the way, not that this is a fantastic release but I gotta say the
    first two tracks are really good in my opinion even if they are credited to
    something which says a lot. So yeah, you're welcome, Sumipe. Wasn't there 10
    years ago so yay for your

    and forgot last year. So yeah, giving them now but not like I'm giving them
    all there isn't a CD to buy anyways. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So no, no Review for this.

  <br />We have more news to talk about from Twitter which is about music of
  course don't mind the new season Anime announcements lol. Thanks to Kanno Mai

  which is for drama I think, isn't bad at all and I think I grew to like it
  despite the obvious familiarity so don't ask me why, guess I just want a new
  song from them.

  Okay, so plans for the rest of the month, basically. I'll remind myself again
  next week until March drops by. For next week first though, I'll finally give

  a chance since I've heard a little something from her radio show (which I
  missed this week lol I'm terrible), which is likely the only thing I'll listen
  to honestly. I know there are new digital songs so I'll have a lookout for
  those. Following week I'll give a listen to
  <b>amazarashi's new single</b> which is ending song for Anime "NiER" which
  goddamn has a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsQko0cn8qU" target="_blank"
    >15-minute music video</a
  >
  which I have no mood to watch they literally collaborated with a producer to
  make this, which I hope the song will be good enough for me to talk about lest
  Aimer come trash this dude coming March with the opening theme.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Oh well, I missed Koko-chan's radio show again. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, is this a
  problem because, as I will explain to you in my birthday post yes it's
  happening the following Monday as I take work leave, it's really hard to catch
  some of these radio shows especially their airing time is close to dinner time
  here so I can't just sit here and not eat with my family. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I should
  just move out to live alone haha that's how you get laid, right? If you say
  you live with your parents no one will want to date you? Haha what do I even
  know. See you guys next time then, and until then... Koharu-chan just saved me
  from this week's event gacha shame. Thanks, girl. Your petite build and
  perfectly-sized boobs are the best-<br />
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.S. Oh come on, we know Koharu is good because dear Naganawa Maria is voicing
  her- Where is the part where this girl turns masochist? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We not going
  to get the miracle that is Alternative Girls anymore huh
