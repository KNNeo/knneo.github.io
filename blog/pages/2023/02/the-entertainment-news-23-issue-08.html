  What, this cat drinks alcohol?? PUT HIM IN THE RAIN AGAIN lol oh we can't
  because it can't get wet. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, looks like in this new episode
  (#KyokouSuiri18) we are dealing with a ripped granny raising a...
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bakeneko" target="_blank">monster cat</a>?
  Man, that sounds like trouble already. Looks like we have another mystery in
  our hands, and this time it's from a faraway fishing village. Featuring a
  spirit cat who doesn't even care about taking over humans even though that's
  their lore lol, and a granny who's older then all of my grandparents who
  already passed away (RIP), we are just at the beginning I guess, about a
  little story featuring the village's dead fish. Well, long story short, every
  day the villagers have only seen more dead fish float to the surface, which is
  seriously affecting tourism and everything around the area, making people who
  rely on the fishing life having to leave just because. We all know that since
  we are talking about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/youkai" target="_blank">youkai</a>, that
  this is obviously more than what it seems, and that is what the mayor suspects
  as he... literally chases Tae-san our old granny, down the road. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Gotta say, he got the stamina, despite his build. Then again, we are chasing
  down like, an 80-year-old or something lol. Of course, since we are in the
  Kotoko-chan camp, we are unlikely to believe all the stuff about the previous
  villager's death Zenta after his grandson passed away... I won't bother about
  the story it was a sad affair all things concerned, but yeah, the old dude had
  to join him. Interestingly, he didn't pass away quietly, well, apart from the
  heart attack. It's probably more of what he left behind that might be a
  problem. According to Tae-san and police investigations, Zenta carved out a
  wooden doll similar to Pinocchio but I guess it's just the long nose that's
  relevant for now, which of all things, had some electric stone embedded on its
  right arm. Let's just imagine that this wood Zenta got from is likely from a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinboku" target="_blank">sacred tree</a>
  similar to the one from Anime "<a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/3958/Kannagi"
    target="_blank"
    >Kannagi</a
  >" lol don't worry only 15 years of Anime watching experience, but somewhat
  had a stone in it. Hey, maybe it's some electricity god or something, I don't
  know Japanese folklore. Nonetheless, something bad probably will happen if you
  craft anything from it, let alone say, if you craft something that looks like
  your grandson. Not that important, but the grandson was human, had limbs and
  can walk into the ocean to zap fishes?? That sounds like a problem before we
  even knew of it. Also, I like how the cat is dealing with this rather casually
  as so with Tae-san, but she is right she already is just waiting for her
  retirement (from this world) (oops) but the cat won't let her so I guess she
  has to stay and help to solve this mystery. Also, she is likely the first
  person to think, even after the cat mentioned that the Goddess it was about to
  consult is human, that Kotoko-chan is a monster. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Joke's on you, old
  woman, the man assisting her is probably the <i>real</i> monster. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
  I'm still surprised why the cat didn't freak out on the sight of this
  mermaid-kudan monstrosity. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, even if we have Kuro-san deal
  with the Pinnochio, this might not be an easy task. We need like, sniper
  rifles or something. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, the reveal of the mystery is
  normally a rough start, but at least we know next up will be the action we
  have all wanted since the start of this season which we had like a short fight
  with the sumo-like doll. So yeah, I'll look forward to that. Might be another
  short story here, I would say, leading up to whatever Rikka-san is plotting
  next. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Let's ignore her for now and anticipate more youkai action I
  guess!

      </blockquote>
      Okay Tama-chan the dude is just at his seat which is right in front of you
      what are you mean where is he? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, Kubo-san gotta pretend she
      didn't see him? What madness is this?? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where
      possessiveness of your boi is based and honestly is cringe lmao
      (#KuboSan06), we really should not think too much into the power of Kubo
      Nagisa in school. But outside though, literally where any Kubo-san can
      find him, that's where things start to change. We are introduced to
      Kubo-san's niece Saki-chan on the streets, where she helped pick up
      something Shiraishi has dropped so many times it's hard to believe he is
      preventing the dropping of his own belongings and not praying that people
      will return it to him. Well, going the lost and found route I guess, at
      least Japan has that policy around. But yeah, that's where Saki-chan's
      dialogue cuts off though, namely because she was accompanied by one other
      Kubo who also can see him but more precisely, saw him previously in a
      bookstore. Yes, "trying" to read a porno magazine, please. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So
      yeah, introduction's ruined, and yeah, I am Nagisa's boyfriend, what of
      it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> INB4 we then realized how much of an idol Nagisa is to the
      niece, then also let us in on the news that Saki-chan looked like Nagisa
      when she was younger ie. in middle school, and is growing her hair out to
      look like her too. Oh yeah, maybe Saki-chan can identify Seita-kun in the
      future. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> This Kubo family DNA is really exquisite; I wonder which
      strand is the one that can identify a Shiraishi. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Gotta say
      though, Saki-chan? You can NOT be as cute as Nagisa. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But who am I
      lying to, we know
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >Ten-chan</a

      is cuter than
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa" target="_blank"
        >Kana-chan</a
      >. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Next up, exams are coming soon and boy did the mom drop on the
      son real quick haha deja vu here too by the way just without the video
      games because my mom didn't love me enough <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>, Shiraishi then had
      to study alone because even if he studied with people, the others won't
      even know if he has any issues since they won't remember he exists.
      <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I'm so sorry dude I'm just explaining the lore I didn't mean to
      insult you in any way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, Kubo-san noticed him as usual,
      and is even kind enough to teach him how to do math. Now THAT is a better
      Kubo-sensei than in "BLEACH". <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They thought of studying together,
      well the girl did hehe, but sadly, Shiraishi got the fever the next day
      and was unable to attend school. Not like anyone would notice that lmao
      the teacher did don't you worry the paper can't lie about his existence.
      Well, at least when they made sure to put his name in lmao the jokes, but
      we know Kubo-san is more than worried about him, even her friends know. I
      personally liked how much she struggles to want to go visit him, but for
      not disturbing him I guess we conveyed the same message as with the
      <strike>LINE</strike> PINE messaging service so we good. Shout out to
      Seita-kun and Akina for the save lol I'll leave you to think which one is
      the lie, but we are just glad Seita didn't get the cold. Because Kubo-san
      did. She still came to school though for very obvious reasons
      <i>because she wants to see him come back to school</i> but he was late
      which probably got her worried increasing her feverish symptoms and boy
      was it risky to leave her to go to seek medical help herself. So yeah
      Shiraishi, you late already so why not make this more of an excuse by
      going with her? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... dammit. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I legit thought
      we will get some hanky-panky in the doctor's office. So, no? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
      Yeah, Shiraishi be the main character alright. He has been for six
      episodes- So I guess we are still getting this fever going, eh? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> But
      yeah, as you can see, this series just has enough to make you cringe but
      not enough for you to be touched and/or excited, and that always hits the
      spot for me, if you ask of my opinion. We are only halfway through, we
      pretty much know of the main cast, so let's see what will be of
      Shiraishi's test results. And if he fails, I guess we not playing video
      games no more. That's a pity, just go play with your female classmate
      then. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you then. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      [Speaking of, Episode 7 onwards will be delayed until, and I'm not joking,
      until NEXT SEASON and will start again from the top, so this will likely
      continue in May. Uh oh. Well, at least we can copy paste this again haha
      no I wont, but yeah, can't be worse than Attack on Titan lol]

      </blockquote>
      So yeah, Ranpo found out someone has an Ability of reality manipulation.
      Real screwed up of a power though, how you gonna fix that? In this new
      episode (#BungouStrayDogs44) where it's likely impossible to assemble the
      Detective Agency together unless you mean in prison lol, well we'll take
      the cemetery as the alternative, thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay serious talk
      though, but what else is there to say? Someone is already cheating. Even
      the military knew of how to deal with these guys in advance. Say who's the
      one afraid of Ability users? It's history repeating itself again, I
      suppose. Anyways, it's all the good stuff happening besides everyone who
      got framed of a massacre of government officers so NOT talking about
      Nikolai, the five on stage have to find a way to escape. I mean, you think
      the confirmation of that one dude Tonan saying that they are the
      perpetrators will help? Haha I think the military already has their own
      bias. As much as they try to stop them from escaping, thanks to
      Yosano-sensei they literally gripped on the edge of their own lives
      through death and did walk out of the place... unscathed? I mean, they did
      kinda kill themselves lol okay Hunters time. So, the new characters of the
      series. So now we know that, the military themselves have their own
      squad(s) of Ability users obviously more used for battle, but looks like
      they might be too overpowered to be used in the first place. But it is
      Ability users we are apprehending and/or killing, so yeah, fight force
      with force. Also, how did they just put the cutest character in this
      series but is also a masochist to the leader? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You tell me.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, the Agency members had to plan their escape from the
      premises they are technically still in town but just outskirts and they
      know the military will have more reinforcements even though that likely
      will be dealt with by Kyouka-chan and Atsushi we will talk about them
      later, but the rest had to escape. Kunikida will not choose trains since
      many lives will be at stake also it's hard to run away from a train, so
      car. But damn, did that dude cut through the car clean in half from a mile
      away. Suck it up,

        >Ichimaru Gin</a
      >, he has a longer one than you. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> And it can bend too?? Bro, not
      even close. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Sorry for the "BLEACH" joke but damn, this is already
      as impressive even with just one of the four Hunters showing off their
      Ability. Well I guess the other one did use his field sense to find out
      where the escapees are, so yeah, no extra points to the Hunters for
      figuring out Kunikida's purpose in life. Also my anxiety works in the same
      way without being an Ability user so what else is new. Three decades,
      dude. There has never been relief. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, it's still impressive
      seeing the guys at work and yes the two Hunters chasing them down have
      noticed one of them is missing, which yeah I guess Kyouka did go back to
      save Atsushi because good chances they think he's stuck somewhere which is
      why he isn't joining them at this point, thank goodness. While they hold
      up the military uphill, I guess the Agency has to deal with these two
      themselves, quite literally doing a dance of protecting each other from a
      ridiculously flexible sword... or do they? So alright, no much of a
      surprise there to be honest, Port Mafia has come in to help the criminals.
      <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Of course, the Hunters will not be able to deal with these guys
      if they come in numbers, but the guy who manipulated reality can still do
      something, so we shall see how long this can last. Well, at least to
      assist their escape? The Detective Agency will live through next episode.
      <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, can't believe I've been baited to watch politics
      happen now. Also where is Natsume-san? I thought this is another
      country-interested-in-Yokohama thing. Haha oh well, it's getting more
      interesting and action-packed each episode, so I can't even complain, I'm
      just more hyped every week now haha maybe I should watch on Thursdays lmao
      oh yeah Prime Video

      says in this new episode (#OtonariNoTenshiSama07) where boy, I wish I had
      a father-in-law to quarrel with. Can't have that if no girlfriend though.
      <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> This week, yep finally lore drop. Before that though, gotta drop
      other people's lore, namely Itsuki. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, bro thought it'll be
      a great idea to leave house haha and stay by his buddy's yeah this dude
      also didn't have many good friends here or probably Amane's is the safest
      lmao, and what else can he say besides welcome to his love nest he is
      currently cultivating without other people here to break it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not
      that it really affects the two of them, but definitely for the guy Amane
      it's working. Even if the buddy doesn't really have to constantly remind
      him in his sleep, we know this love is going somewhere. Hopefully. I mean,
      the point that Chitose also wants in on this sleep-in lmao girl this is
      your boyfriend running away from the dad, I guess she probably also
      dropped in the "maybe you like Amane" lore on this poor girl. Then maybe
      she knows. Maybe. But you know what else she knows? That she cannot tell
      others about her pathetic life. Hey, I'm not the one exaggerating, she is.
      Because NOW we can lore drop. Specifically

      lore. We talk about parental love. What is that anyways, really? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
      You want me to elaborate how much a mistake a man and a woman can decide
      alone and think that they can raise a kid until they are independent
      enough without ruining their lives through their selfish or even bad
      influence? Dammit this just sounds like "<a

      did summarize this quite well because seriously we DO NOT need to know
      more about arranged marriage and how heartless these parents can be
      without attending even just the graduation ceremonies of their only child,
      but hey, what do I know about parenthood I'm not even married to anyone.
      <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Oh well, what else can we really do but hope that these
      irresponsible adults will be out of our lives when she graduates high
      school where they can actually file for divorce so that Amane doesn't have
      to deal with what Itsuki has to deal with now. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> There's good and
      bad, I guess. Either way,

      just wants someone to cry on, and it's just SO conveniently we have the
      one
      <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> to
      lend her his shoulder other than his ears. Yeah, in case you wonder how to
      cure shoulder pain from "Stray Dogs" above it's not riding on aircraft...
      I'm VERY sorry for contextual jokes be sure to watch all the stuff I watch
      to be relevant. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Anyways coming back, it's ok to cry on such a
      reality, Mahiru-chan, everyone has to deal with their own issues. In your
      defence? You have people around who will care about you even if it's not
      your family <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span> so yeah Amane the boyfriend lmao and his friends and
      actually people who like you in school that you didn't want to interact
      much with-

      gone through I guess by Sunday already FOUR albums so far, and boy is the
      reception of any of these old and new releases (yes there are new ones,
      fresh off the press) very weak but then again when you think about just
      melody they tend to disappoint. Even so, giving the styles is still not
      helping much, so I went with that and picked a couple of songs. Literally,
      just two. I'll talk about them in order though.

          >Homecoming's 1st album</a
        ></b
      >
      I thought will be a great introduction to the upcoming album within the
      year but then I felt like I didn't feel like giving any of them and so I
      didn't. What I did give though, is the similar judgement for new release

          >Itou Miku's new album</a
        ></b

      which I guess I did listen to her single from last year and it was "kind
      of" good lol so I listened to more idol fanfare and probably gave one
      because of it.

          target="_blank"
          >Ueda Reina's 1st album</a
        ></b
      >
      which I've withhold for two weeks so to listen to it on a week not
      slathered with releases did not help its cause, since much of the songs
      back then aren't as unique or interesting as the ones I've listened in the
      past couple of years. Also, this album is literally released half a year
      before the first time I heard of her. Yeah, that one for Anime "MajoTabi".
      So don't ask me why it rose up that fast. Last but not least, I knew I
      shouldn't have bothered with
      <b

          >a flood of circle's new album</a

      which released also this week because I listened to one of their songs
      earlier this year actually start of the year specifically, and knew their
      melodies won't hit me despite the Rock music style. You see, they like to
      "rap" on their songs which isn't my thing so tell me again when you come
      up with something similar to your album in 2019.&nbsp;

      Oh yeah this week is Love Day week on Twitter so expect something to
      happen in the Internet I guess and please ignore what was on the intro
      this is music only. Saying that though,

      the band and the group will continue with two members and let's hope it
      won't end up with one. Also new songs please, I've almost forgotten about
      you guys. Happier news though,

      because this legendary 2014 release got me real good in association of
      PHONO TONES, this is just as cool and different in feels it got me the
      first time I've heard of it. Give the topic song "FRICTION" a try to have
      a feel for it.

      which is likely his solo music release so maybe I'll change gears seeing
      that I won't exactly be keen on the vocalist changed band.

      <br />
      So for next week, I guess we are in another ditch once again with new
      releases, so let's hope

      for Anime "NiER" will hold up. I'm not bothered to watch the 15-minute
      music video but I'll give a 5-minute song if it's good. I mean, can't be
      as long as a three-parter when I listened to Suzuki Aina's debut album lol
      yeah "Eternal Place" the first and last are just 10-minute
      instrumentals<br />
      <br />

  Ah~ah, was Inorin's fanclub event great. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I know not to expect much
  because you bet this is just another way to get your money lol also it's
  better to be on location anyways, guests Hidaka Rina and Kakuma Ai played
  games with her which most exciting I guess is just them skating around a
  course or making cute faces so not your university orientation ice-breaking
  with cross gender physical contact lmao local joke, Inorin sang and danced,
  and it was an interesting 2 hours starting at 1pm Japan time. Yeah.&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And to not lie about whether I did watch it, here's what she sang in the live
  portion of the event:
</div>
<div>
  - Aimaimoko (Fans found out she wasn't singing at her best state; No wonder,
  she was talking all this time)
</div>
<div>
  - Kimiiro Prologue (From "Wonder Caravan" single; Fans dropped the title for
  me haha I'm not true fan)
</div>
<div>
  - Snow White (From same single, yeah but I didn't care about that single much,
  "Wonder Caravan" is just too good compared to these B-sides, also when I took
  the screenshot)

  Oh don't worry I didn't add any of these songs I've not heard of to my song
  library lol I only liked the first one btw <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And yes, I'm not that keen
  to watch the night event haha it's pretty much the same content in general
  (eg. play games with different themes) and Inorin is not close enough to the
  camera. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Cya guys soon enough, for tomorrow I'm on leave so I'll do
  up a special post to talk about what I am doing with my solo life from here
  on. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Until then, stay happy. I barely did for these two months
  already haha

  P.S. Okay I got just in time after dinner for Koko-chan's radio show 200th
  episode special. It's live video instead of audio, they have a gacha machine
  where when a chime randomly rings, she rolls once and dons whatever accessory
  it's written. Well turns out it's all ears so we have seen her as a cat, dog,
  tiger (lol), rabbit and demon (hehe) as she does impersonations and reads fan
  mails. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I'm SO glad I've not missed this and as my first listen haha
  you bet I was just listening for the chime. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> We will talk about me
  listening (passively) to radio shows on tomorrow's post and why it matters.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  P.P.S. Okay my plan to hijack Pyxis' last-minute announced livestream just now
  worked: They were starting the stream before playing a game ("Momotetsu"
  a.k.a. Japanese monopoly) so they were reading YouTube chat, and I sent a
  Super Chat writing simply "It's my birthday, thanks for the stream" which
  could've been better phrased as in streaming on my birthday, and they read my
  name. REAL. NAME. So if you want to know you can watch the archive by the time
  you are reading this. My hands are still shivering by the way turned on the
  fan for the first time this year lmao BEST BIRTHDAY EVER haha I'm done
