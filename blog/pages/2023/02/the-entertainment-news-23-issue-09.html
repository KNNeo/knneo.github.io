Aw damn there's no more "Kubo-san" to watch from this week onwards. How am I
going to talk about Hanazawa Kana and her birthday yesterday, dude?? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah happy birthday Kana-chan and how many years of Anime you have given me
  so much so my bro fears of me just talking about it lol, and might as well if
  I post this at 11pm I can also say happy birthday to Rieri and Rika-sama!! Who
  do you think I like more haha wrong answers only I LOVE married women lol
  <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  On the other hand I did watch the archive on Rika-sama fanclub events recently
  and am not impressed so I guess not! Haha let's Anime and music then&nbsp;

  </blockquote>
  Ah so yep, what did I mention from last week? Call me famous detective, dude.
  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay in this new episode where we talk about Pinocchio haha
  (#KyokouSuiri19), so yeah we conclude the mystery behind old man Zenta and his
  supposed creation of a doll which ruined the town. Hmm, there's quite a few
  stuff we can talk about and Kotoko-chan isn't lying too much about it to an
  old woman, so let's. Firstly, about the mysteries of the stone stuck to the
  tree. So surprises from last week lol I predicted it anyways, some stone
  specifically a meteorite was stuck to a scared tree and obviously Zenta
  thought this will be a good time to test his wood sculpting skills lol, so he
  brought it back home to carve a doll out of it. Ironically then, this thing
  sort of awakened and starts causing havoc for the people and spirits alike,
  which definitely is a problem. But what is not expected from me is, that this
  is all it can do. Which brings us to the next point, that this doll was not
  meant to kill. Yes, despite ruining all the sea life, it was not meant to kill
  anything human. Because in due time the citizens would have thought of how to
  stop it or found out that it roams at night, and would, unlike Tae-san who
  didn't really care, set up a trap to stop this doll from causing problems. You
  know, maybe even buy a Faraday's cage to stop the electricity if we don't have
  a Kuro-san to deal with it. Kotoko may have made this sound easy, but doing
  whatever the youkai and her have thought out of might be hard for a bunch of
  old people in a fishing village, so whatever at least these spirits came in to
  help. And last but not least, which is the whole point of this doll's
  creation, that is all it can do because it wasn't meant to be strong in the
  first place. I would assume the meteorite just amplified that power or even
  bestowed the doll that power, but it could not do otherwise after the trap was
  triggered, and it wasn't too hard to find out that the doll was NOT Zenta's
  grandson. That's the point, if you want to make a cursed doll you do NOT put
  your loved ones on it. So apparently, Zenta placed the people he hated and/or
  resented over the incident namely the four college students who got let off
  easily over causing of the grandson's death... and Tae-san the old woman
  apparently, probably because of her own association to such events and how she
  is so old she isn't... dead... yet. *ahem* Moving on lol, and thinking that
  even just scraping off the names from the wood would cause them harm even ever
  slightly, I don't even anything will happen to weakling me even if you put my
  name on it lol because, as we have also mentioned above in previous episodes,
  Zenta was too nice to put such a potent curse on others. That's how far his
  benevolence got him, over the grudge of his loved ones. So yeah, sadly the
  rich family college students did not get their funerals, the villagers did not
  get a bad rap since they did not indirectly kill four youngsters AND an old
  woman haha gotta remember that, and the doll would be dealt with any way this
  goes. So yeah, probably weaker than that sumo wrestler start of this second
  season, but as you can see, it's just more of Kotoko thinking out of the box.
  Also, this is likely the most truthful she has been in the cases so far, not
  having more to say after they are done. We are reminded of the final arc of
  this season soon enough, as we are reminded of Rikka-san who can still do
  weird things even though unlikely she has came by this fishing village away
  from the city, doesn't mean she isn't plotting something behind the scenes. I
  really wonder what will up the level of Steel Lady Nanase; We shall find out
  soon.

  Ah hey our favourite villain group is back!! Haha I can't say which member I
  like most but Elise-chan. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really, Ten-chan isn't the point Mori
  Ougai is just based lol, but yeah in this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs45)
  expect 100% more Port Mafia intervention in this because damn, did the
  entrance of I forgot his name again Chuuya look way more impressive than we
  think. And yeah, sword can't deal with guns... well bullets, if there are
  enough of them so yay they managed to escape. Well, maybe not Kenji lol he got
  stabbed real good I may be wrong in thinking that the sword can't do anything
  but yeah it might be a good way to cling on to the flying machine, and as the
  Hunters make their way in, Kunikida made a wise(?) choice by letting the
  others live while he clings back on to the sword extending Hunter I don't
  remember his name, and kept a bit of his notebook for a last resort. Don't
  guess if he's fine he is most likely fine as long as the other one is too they
  are not ordinary humans anyways, so let's figure out what happened with the
  Agency people at Port Mafia's hideout. Damn I love seeing Mori Ougai again you
  bet it's not because of his Ability that I like by the way lol, and he talked
  about two things which Chuuya also mentioned part of. Firstly, he will be
  hiding them for a week while hell is going on outside, but the condition with
  Fukuzawa is that one of the members will be joining Port Mafia. I wonder if
  Dazai counts in this case lmao because damn that is technically cheating, but
  it's the second thing that he lied about. Because next up, Fukuzawa's
  condition for this trade was that Yosano-san can not be the in this trade.
  Because yeah, then the Agency will be done and dead. Literally, she is the
  lifeline, but also, wink wink, looks like we are lying to include her in the
  deal becauseshe was worked under Port Mafia too. Heck, who from the Agency is
  NOT an ex-employee at Port Mafia, bro. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh yeah I guess Atsushi. Last
  but not least though, it's less important from Mori's side but it's still
  important to all of us, our Ability eraser Dazai is held up by the military.
  Which then transferred to the Department of Justice, and blah blah Dazai
  somehow ended up in the same "prison" as Fyodor who is of course still
  orchestrating all of this from behind the scenes. Yeah haha&nbsp;Dazai with
  the 200IQ plays here but yeah he did deal with Fyodor previously too if you
  would recall. Spirit buddies already, these two, probably more than Dazai with
  anyone else I'm sorry Chuuya lol. They also bonded with each other while in
  prison too so that's nice. You picked up the soap too? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> That's a
  prison joke no one will understand haha, so moving on we talk about Atsushi.
  Thinking about it he isn't too smart but kudos to him escaping with
  Kyouka-chan and being safe for now, he thought of asking for the American
  Ability users for help. Ironically when they arrived, they were attacked by
  one of their mates who likely is on the Angel's side now who then barely
  escaped when negotiations fail with his ex-leader? Haha how ironic, really.
  Anyways, Fyodor tipped his ally off as much as Dazai tipped Kyouka-chan off so
  thank goodness no one was killed in the process, but I won't say much about
  what Atsushi can do to save the world of more deaths. Francis suggested the
  revival of one of his members, one we have not seen for a while, and boy did
  Margret remind me of a certain fight with the weretiger to be honest so HELL
  YEAH BRING
  <a
    href="https://myanimelist.net/character/132966/Lucy_Maud_Montgomery"
    target="_blank"
    >KANA-CHAN</a
  >
  BACK WHAT A GREAT TRADEOFF I WILL DO ANYTHING lol happy birthday my dear.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I mean, I would do it just <i>for</i> her. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, Atsushi
  eventually went with the condition, but this is when Mori knows of the big
  bomb that is about to fall upon their organization by helping out the Agency.
  Because ignoring Atsushi's stupidity lmao, we already know Francis is likely
  not on their side, and Mori hasn't exactly chose which member from the Agency
  to be on his side yet, so they might not want to meet up after all. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>
  All in all... hey say I don't like Port Mafia enough. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yep, as always
  Mori Ougai is the smartest haha
  <span style="font-size: xx-small;">don't tell Fukuzawa-san please lol</span>
  and that maaaaaybe we don't listen to the damn Americans about the deal. Or
  trap, whichever you think sounds better. Yeah, Francis also did use Atsushi's
  weakness of seeing people in suffering as a trade even though the deal was
  supposed already off as the weretiger&nbsp; knew to not let people kill each
  other but he's just getting used again. Yup, guess who's the idiot now.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So yeah, much more brain plays apart from the Dazai and Fyodor ones,
  and as we continue to see Yokohama burn also getting so many people involved,
  it would be interesting to see what moves the story on, or if we even need
  story since it's all controlled by that one dude. Haha we shall see, we are
  still very early on to be honest.

  Gotta say though, having that
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> in the
  same class again will have its merits because no one will see Amane going down
  on Mahiru- Haha who am I joking they are just friends. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new
  episode where oh yeah we are at the new year of school now
  (#OtonariNoTenshiSama08), yeah guess whether Mahiru and Amane are in the same
  class now. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> No surprises there for starters, and as Amane's social
  circle blooms in school even with the ikemen of the class joining his gang
  just because, we can but wonder why we still can't get Mahiru into the group.
  And she thinks of that too, so while she continues to pat Amane's head after a
  day of school lol why don't I get that too I only have video games lmao, she
  keeps thinking that she is giving back less to Amane then he is to her. To be
  honest though? Yeah, maybe? I mean, this guy keeps accidentally (lmao) buying
  her stuff from the arcade though I swear he just thought of which ones to play
  already or else it'll all be alien plushies or something haha, and since they
  aren't by accident this means he really takes care of this neighbour who just
  happens to want to help him with his meals. Meals only, by the way. Already
  making him happy which no surprises there, but heck, do we not need more
  physical contact as if we are behaving like a couple? You know, "girlfriend"
  instead of "girl friend". <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>&nbsp;Yeah yeah Mahiru is like HTML now:
  it's whitespace but we know she writes it as nbsp so there is still a
  connection. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I'm sorry for programming jokes I just thought of that
  as I wrote this, but I like how Mahiru thinks that the same way she is being
  treated can be translated to Amane as a dude. I mean, it's great, we need more
  girls who think that they can join casually into a gang of dudes because I
  would love to know more girls hehe, but yeah, they danced to this school
  socializing as smoothly as they can, it's only getting jealous eyes from the
  rest of the class they can't even. Still, progress is progress, just that I'm
  pretty sure people in class seeing the four of them so those two and the
  Itsuki couple settling in for the next cooking class, have no idea that this
  is basically double date and we can't talk about more or else Mahiru will just
  die of embarrassment. And Amane too I guess, no one is walking out of this
  alive. Well, I guess they are even with the screw up in cooking class with the
  pot spill as the guy dives in to save the angel, still made me unable to
  comprehend how this guy isn't like, the coolest guy in class. Like, he's doing
  the feminism 5th wave thing, right? Tell me why he doesn't have enough female
  fans in class to get Mahiru jealous. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>&nbsp;All in all... I don't know
  what you want, girl, I have no idea. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Every week I write a short
  review here and you think I didn't compliment you enough? I don't know what
  you want, girl. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Also, maybe keep the lovey-dovey stuff and the
  shoulder embrace in private, yes? The whole class didn't have to witness the
  spectacle of this bond forming anywhere else in the premises. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But
  what do I know, dude. I don't have a solo neighbour who will cook for my solo
  living. Also, Amane is obviously trying to be too good for his girl, so maybe
  next time we will get to see why this is the case, with him slowly being
  reminded of his past, Mahiru will have to question him out someday. Hey, every
  time it's Amane reading her face, we can do the other way around. Okay see you
  guys then we can only have this much spiciness in one episode also the
  animation quality haha this thing isn't holding up too well tbh<br />

  This week is really not much as I take a break from listening to new songs,
  but that doesn't mean I've not been listening to the newest songs. Just... you
  know, I won't give them because they have a pending release date in the near
  future. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> We'll talk more about those next paragraph with the Twitter
  news, so let's talk about

  ask me why, but the song for Anime "NiER" even if I didn't watch the
  (shortened) music video is not bad, so I just gave it.<br />
  <br />
  Well, let's proceed to more news on Twitter that are about music because we
  need more new releases to come in to be honest. Very, very tempted to just
  listen to anything that drops, but no, we stay rational. Also, indie. But
  ignoring those first, let's talk about what happened online.

  is kinda alright which makes me think I can give their new EP in a month so we
  shall see about that when it comes.

  is as confusing as I expect, but going from the website it's just a revival of
  their single a decade ago? Okay, too much information I can't even.

  which also finally got a release date or else how am I going to know if your
  boyfriend in that music video is real. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay this is actually
  interesting and sudden because I swear they having their acoustic live in
  three months, but

  which is a lot to digest but yeah they are printing out
  <strike>songs</strike> music now I'm getting honestly worried. But heck, more
  new tunes, right? Can't complain. I might actually give

  which if you know of the former that's Ryokuoushoku Shakai's vocalist, and the
  latter is a long time instrumental band which has done many collaboration
  songs with other artists eg. Ajikan, and is the definition of ska music in
  Japan, is releasing a mini-album next month which I might just listen. TMI so
  I'll talk about them in a couple of weeks if we have the time. Last but not
  least fresh off the press, announced in their recent live event

  so that's cool can't wait to be impressed once again they are on a roll in
  recent years to be honest better than a lot of mainstream artists out there so
  I hope they keep it up.<br />
  <br />
  So for next week, we are starting the week strong with a bunch of releases
  some of which I've been waiting for years already. <b>Aimer's new single</b> I
  hope will be a killer release for the year but I'm not going to hold my breath
  she is married already. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Jokes over, so let's see if she can hold up.
  <b>Taketatsu Ayana's new single</b> is also a fingers crossed as I've heard of
  the music video and am not impressed, but hey I've given enough idolism for
  the year maybe I don't give this. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Moving on, and last but not least
  I would say <b>Yogee New Waves' new EP</b> will need to carry the can this
  week. I've not heard of anything and I really want this to impress, so I'm
  going in blind on this. Give me the feels I want again, guys, I really could
  use some right now.<br />

  <br />I was just listening in to Kanno Mai's Instagram live just now (her
  first this year, thought she is done because of her radio podcast) and was
  just listening through the songs she sang acapella, and boy did she hit a
  streak of songs I know of. We went from

    >Ray from 2014</a
  >&nbsp;if you know of Anime "Nagi no Asukara"&nbsp;it brings back memories.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Yeah we need to record when's the next highest combo for her song
  selections to coincide with mine. Okay, highest is 3 now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cya guys
  then haha, I hope you have been enjoying last week's slew of posts as much as
  I do, and until next time I will probably still ponder on why I signed up for
  Kana-chan's fanclub. Man, that thing has to be a yearly subscription, and boy
  is there not much content to please. Yes, Ayachi's better, thanks for asking.
  <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I'll talk about more next month I want to look at Mai-chan live more
  hehe
