<div>
  Okay first, you buy a cake. Then, ask the counter if they have birthday
  candles. Buy 3 of them. Bring the cake back home. See if you have a lighter
  around- Haha you think I'm going to describe this process 30 years in? Get a
  life dude lmao
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  What I will do though, is talk about my step-by-step process for change from
  here on specifically on novelties, actually. So welcome back to another
  non-descript post where I talk about what I have made changes in my already
  stay home life and actually contribute to the world out there while still
  pursuing the stuff I want to do moving forward. It has been so long, after
  all. I will not deliberate further, let's get to it!
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  [You have been warned about this text-heavy long post; Leave if you do not
  want to know more]
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE IDEA</div>
<div>
  So far in my pathetic life lol okay I will stop that we are trying to be
  positive here, I've only been living a life of coming back home from work and
  just binging on YouTube or even re-watching YouTube clips and/or watching
  Twitch archives every night because I just want to take breaks and not think
  too much after work. Sadly, that has not made my nights any more interesting
  as I constantly miss the world out there in Japan, and it's also not helping
  me on my Japanese since I'm choosing not to listen them on a regular basis.
  Also, recently in the past couple of years, due to the rise of purchasing
  physical goods from Japan and the now necessity of paying taxes of stuff I
  bought, it would be wiser to focus more on digital purchases which would
  otherwise remove that footprint and not accumulate stock at home which is of
  course, taking up much space. Therefore, the objective of this list of plans
  is to achieve all of not any the following:
</div>
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      To move away from "easy" and "addictive" entertainment, and not just watch
      YouTube all day
    </li>
    <li>
      To focus on purchase of items from Japan with lesser physical footprint
    </li>
    <li>
      To gain more knowledge relevant to what I actually am interested in,
      through getting involved in more content from the (female) voice acting
      (idol) industry
    </li>
    <li>
      To listen to more varied Japanese music instead of sinking on popular or
      idol music
    </li>
    <li>
      To play more video games per year instead of just watching people play
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  We will talk about how to achieve most of these in a bit, and how my progress
  on these have been so far, but suffice it to say that overall I really just
  want to ignore all the boring stuff and/or stuff I really am too nonchalant of
  and focus on the things I want to support. Not everyone will keep to that, but
  I want to stay true to the things I like. That's entertainment, after all,
  whether you subconsciously know about it or not. The idea is also about
  paying: I've spent enough years NOT paying for content, and either I shall or
  I will be around them as much as I am able to afford time to. That's what I
  think is support today.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THE PLAN</div>
<div>
  From here on, I stay more than committed to the following things I would do on
  a regular basis, at this point let's say with weekly progress. Let's talk
  about them individually. Boy, is this going to be a long one.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  I'll split each of them into two sections: The <b>ideal/planned</b>&nbsp;state
  which is where I want to achieve, and the <b>current</b>&nbsp;state which is
  where I am now. And if I've not started on it then current will just be empty,
  just so you know. "Did not start" doesn't mean "have not achieved", thanks.
</div>
<div>(Not in specific order to the objectives above)</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>[1] Revive APoL</div>
<div>
  If you have not known, I have a personal novel project I have been working on
  since... halfway through my middle/secondary school? Yeah, so around 2008, I
  came up with the idea of writing about life but through the choice of power.
  It's not the next Harry Potter, and obviously my English writing is not great
  as you can see from just up till here to be honest <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>, but I am
  committed to writing stories my way. In recent years though, ever since I
  started work almost 5 years ago, I've not touched this story much. But now
  that I am bent on getting this going, I will talk about what I will do moving
  forward.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <table border="1" class="table">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Current</th>
        <th>Planned</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>To continue writing on Chapter 17</td>
        <td>To finish until Chapter 20, end of first minor story arc</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          To come up with a proper design for Duels in the story (see Chapter 3)
        </td>
        <td>
          To find more popular Internet literature platforms to publish up till
          Chapter 20 (eg. Wattpad)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>
          To write a full plot summary document if do not wish to complete story
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And I can tell you, the publishing part is going to be rough. I still have not
  garnered any courage to list my story online for the world to see, as much of
  it is still in private sites I host. We shall see though, if I can refine my
  writing and storytelling enough to achieve that. But first, I gotta start
  writing on what happened in Chapter 16 with the introduction of a new
  character pivotal to the story arc. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> No more spoilers, I gotta get to
  writing. And then if I really don't want to do this I can sketch out an
  overview for anyone who will want to continue my so-called legacy. I already
  know what I want based on (spoilers) Anime I've been exposed to around that
  time.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>[2] Play New Video Games</div>
<div>
  Yeah, not bullsh*t talk with just buying games to support indie developers
  which is what I did for the past few years, dude, we gotta play them. I think
  I've gotten enough of just watching people play video games, and especially
  popular games because
  <span style="font-size: xx-small;"
    >who gives a f**k about Hogwarts Legacy</span
  >
  haha so instead since I've always loved to play simulation games and am keen
  to support indie developers on their work, since I've enlisted GOG.com to do
  this task for me, and as their library grows and more new games appear there,
  I'll be playing more games more often.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <table border="1" class="table">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Current</th>
        <th>Planned</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>To play more video games</td>
        <td>To play a new video game every month, so 12 per year</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><br /></td>
        <td>
          To pick up on games to play if interested and not just watch others
          play online, ideally short story indie games
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So far I've already played a handful of games but not yet completed them,
  because this is still subject to the other new rule I've slapped on myself:
  switching games every month. Even if I do not complete them, I can move on to
  another. Or more like, if I want to move on, then I HAVE to finish these games
  in a month. They are normally not very long in story, and they are achievable
  if it isn't role-playing, for example, simulation games can get dry real
  quick, so ending those and moving on isn't that hard. It's more like if I can
  achieve the balance on those or not. By the way, this month's game which I
  barely started over the weekend was "Indoorlands", a miniature theme park game
  which isn't doing well on reviews, but I had a ton of fun in it. It's good ol'
  theme park simulation, dude. What else can I ask? Yeah something better than
  Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, I know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Next up will likely be "Spiritfarer"
  as I've forgotten the story long enough for me to want to play it and cry I
  guess. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I don't cry on people dying lmao don't cancel me pls
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>[3] Listen To More Japanese Voice Actresses' Podcasts</div>
<div>
  Ah okay NOW we are at the bulk of the conversation here. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> If you are
  still unaware just walking into this blog I call my personal haven haha, you
  might have noticed I am super intrigued by the idea of the voices behind
  Anime, specifically if they are female. Call me a dirty hetero male lmao, but
  yeah, over the past decade and a half I've learnt to appreciate them more, and
  with the idolism sub-genre growing on this industry, it's natural to see more
  of them having some dedicated slot to read fan mail and talk about the stuff
  they do. Fans naturally gather to witness more inside stories and/or
  screw-ups, so I truly am missing out. So, for now, I'll focus on listening to
  their solo podcasts, because this is a good way to test if I can get used to
  listening to them talk for half an hour minimum, AND the content they talk
  about lol I tell you some people only like to talk about work and not
  themselves so I am very wary of how dull those can be in the long run.

</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Okay, the limitations in this are aplenty, so let's see if I can cover them
  all. Firstly, listening format. Not ALL of them will be ready to listen on Day
  1. For example, Minase Inori's podcast airs on Sunday nights... but on Japan's
  AM/FM radio "<a href="https://www.joqr.co.jp/" target="_blank">Bunka Housou</a
  >" which is not available for the Internet. Another one I know of is "radiko"
  which is also a radio station in certain parts of Japan, of course including
  capital Tokyo. Fortunately, there are archives of these so we might still be
  able to catch them, but as you can see this will be a challenge I've yet to
  find a solution to listen in live. In addition, most of the ones I will
  mention in a bit will be either on YouTube as Japan finally acknowledges the
  reach of the platform,
  <a href="https://live.nicovideo.jp/" target="_blank">Niconico Live</a> which
  is Japan's YouTube which concept of floating comments across the viewing
  screen has been stolen by China's Bilibili platform, and less known is Bunka
  Housou's Internet bretherin "<a
    href="https://www.joqr.co.jp/ag/"
    target="_blank"
    >Cho A&amp;G+</a
  >" which allows me to catch a lot of the podcasts there. (Trust me, these are
  all very daunting a decade ago for me) Many of them have schedules and/or
  subscription lists I can follow so it isn't too bad so far. Moving on, there
  is also the irregular programs will also pop up from time to time, and worst
  off, they do not have a fixed timing and will announce their next simulcast
  and/or live (typically the latter) whenever, and not like I will have the time
  after work sometimes literally at dinner time due to the time zone differences
  (here is 1 hour behind Tokyo), so I may just miss out on these if my schedule
  got caught up with others, especially if in conflict. Maintaining all these is
  actually harder than you think, because you will need a lot of collated
  knowledge to know when and what is happening online, and boy, is Twitter not
  the best place for all of them. Which is why I had to spend some time to
  collect all the information I know, and list them here! Don't worry, the ones
  here are just for the purpose of this post, where I will also explain for a
  bit the terms and the podcasts themselves and what they are.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  We will need some definitions right here, so I'll try to explain them all,
  keyword being try:
</div>
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>
      First half free - A concept to bait people into subscribing into their
      channels for a fee, eg. an hour podcast can be free for half an hour and
      paid for the other half, where of course the latter will have more
      relevant content and former be just reading fan mail and doing PR. The
      Seigura Niconico Channel is known for such a tactic.
    </li>
    <li>
      Alternating weeks - As per definition, the podcast will be aired every 2
      weeks, and the issue here is this can be categorized into two factions;
      Either referred to as "<a
        href="https://jisho.org/search/kakushuu"
        target="_blank"
        >airing every other week</a
      >" which is dependent on which week it originally started on (eg. aired
      last week, next will be next week) or "airing in certain weeks" which is
      now dependent on which week number of the month it airs on. (eg. Week 2 of
      February 2023 is considered to be on the week of Valentine's Day)
    </li>
    <li>
      Simulcast vs Live - Each podcast has their own relevancy with respect to
      their broadcast timing. Some will choose to air at late night but not
      require their talents to do it live, so it will be pre-recorded and aired
      for the first time where people will tune in regularly known as a
      simulcast, similar to TV shows. Some will air live though, even with video
      content on special occasions or straight up as regular, nowadays taking it
      to YouTube for higher quality and audience reach compared to Niconico
      though with a more interactive comment system.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  With these out of the way, let's see if you can figure the table below out!

<div>[4] Increase Digital Purchases</div>
<div>
  This I think I've mentioned earlier in the post and I guess this is
  essentially what I'm achieving here, if I can choose not to buy a physical
  version of anything if it's available in digital, I will now go for digital
  editions if possible, giving money to the idea of renting items through
  Internet services (in case you don't know what capitalism scheme you signed up
  for lol) instead of physically possessing them, potentially taking up space.

  The best example I can give you is photobooks. If any photobook is available

  ago lol, I can just buy those to support them which I recently did with

  that but you have seen the bikini shots on her social media accounts so what
  else is new. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Others like the taking photos for each other photobook
  series "<a href="https://twitter.com/seiyu_tomophoto" target="_blank"
    >Seiyuu Tomosha!</a
  >" with
  <a
    href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%80%90%E3%83%87%E3%82%B8%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AB%E9%99%90%E5%AE%9A%E3%80%91%E7%9B%B4%E7%94%B0%E5%A7%AB%E5%A5%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%88%E3%83%96%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%80%8C%E3%81%8A%E3%81%8D%E3%81%9F%EF%BC%9F%E3%80%8D-%E9%80%B1%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC-PHOTO-BOOK-%E7%9B%B4%E7%94%B0%E5%A7%AB%E5%A5%88-ebook/dp/B0BTD514NN/ref=rvi_sccl_2/356-6148047-4145237?pd_rd_w=OZiVp&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.a4dc92d7-7100-437e-b3e3-2349e8298523&amp;pf_rd_p=a4dc92d7-7100-437e-b3e3-2349e8298523&amp;pf_rd_r=1CCVWMQBG446NMQKKQAY&amp;pd_rd_wg=JRYfF&amp;pd_rd_r=fc2071f9-9db0-4963-a1d0-04a705eb4d03&amp;pd_rd_i=B0BTD514NN&amp;psc=1"

  released recently and upcoming Kido Ibuki's (hehe) I'm just glad I don't have
  to buy more books in hopes that a digital version of it will appear some time
  later.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  For mobile and/or video games it's the same principle, but that for now is
  still based on my years with the game, and I will NEVER give a game money
  straight off just to progress, namely for aesthetic purposes mostly. I don't
  believe in pay to win, by the way. My only success case now is with "Dead of
  Alive: Venus Vacation" also known as DOAXVV. I've only paid money for pay-only
  birthday
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gacha" target="_blank">gacha</a> which
  ignoring the results of the roll, are guaranteed extra items to be included in
  the game itself, not affecting gameplay. (Yes, I don't want any of us to be
  reminded of "Alternative Girls", thanks. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span>)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And moving on, I hope I can keep this up but damn did I ruin that for the year
  already lol, apart from CDs and bromide photos, anything physical I buy will
  so far be limited to photobooks, the first of any single person reviewed, so
  if say Kitou Akari released another photobook recently I am obliged to not buy
  it again since I bought her 1st back in 2020. And I also know it will be
  released in digital thanks to their publishing firm Seigura, which will ensure
  this to appear in the future. That is if the Internet doesn't spoil everything
  for me first. <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>

<div>[5] Devote to Fanclub Subscriptions</div>
<div>
  Of course, in addition to buying digital content, I've made a declaration to
  follow voice actresses and of course subscribe to as many fanclubs as possible
  as the most direct way to support the ones I like. Trust me, if you buy
  anything from them they don't get the full amount. I won't say much for
  fanclubs but at least I don't have to buy stuff or get anything physical back
  which will stay true to my vision for supporting more digital content as
  mentioned earlier. There is an exception to this though, because Inorin's
  fanclub "Inori Machi" is the only one which ships newsletters and even
  greeting cards physically on a regular basis, so there goes my wallet for
  shipping fees every time they send me stuff. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh, and this also
  extends to now Niconico channels which require a paid subscription more often
  a times, to watch the full livestream and/or podcast. My only example is Kanno
  Mai for now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Regardless, let's talk briefly about what I've seen so
  far. The recent streak comes from
  <b>getting all the married ones in this year</b> haha yeah their fanclubs are
  still running by the way. People like married women and it's not me <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Well we don't need the usual table because this is pretty straightforward. So,
  we're doing the same thing for podcasts but for it's for fanclubs now. Here
  are my current, recent within the year and (unlikely) future plans for joining
  voice actress fan bases:

  Well, as you can see for this part it's just giving the money especially even
  on a yearly basis, and we'll enjoy the benefits immediately. The registration
  fee is only one-time unless you decide to bail and then join again like what I
  did with Inorin's fanlub lol. Of course this isn't as straightforward because
  did you remember how I got into Rieri's fanclub? Haha if I have to do it again
  then I'll have to ship the physical item releasing in April just to register
  for a new year of content, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="🙄">*ugh*</span> That's the life I'm into now, I

  Yeah okay please stop counting how much I'm paying a month haha I know a lot
  of people, that's all. Also the yearly ones doesn't count anyways they have
  been paid for. As for the future ones I maaaaay pay for them but unlikely and
  I'll state why above as a note for now. No really, stop counting I'm buying
  like, two photobooks a month, okay? Just... stop. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  This shall be it for now; These might be too much even for me to dedicate to.
  Because damn, I'm still not over with how I think I will be able to achieve
  all this AND avoid a life of watching YouTube. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> We will try, the
  change for support for the causes I believe are real. It's hard to convince
  anyone these days about this, but seeing as I am such a simp for these
  so-called "idols", I can't help but do my part and not see these fade off.

  what I've listed here haha I will try my best I've already burnt my 20s I
  can't even, and then maybe, <i>maybe</i>, I will get my personal life
  together.
