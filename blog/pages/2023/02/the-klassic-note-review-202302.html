  Oh hey we are literally jumping from one post to another haha I told myself I
  bear the consequences for lining all of these up in one day and I'm sorry for
  complaining about how I should be getting the photobook earlier, but hey, this
  time around we are talking about music! Something decent now haha is this
  decent though? Not till I'm done with Kana-chan and Sumipe, I won't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So yeah, we are lined up with two singles to start the year in Klassic Note.
  Not exactly expected but ironically not unexpected so I'm just glad we can
  start off with some recognition to these two artists in some sort of fashion
  considering I have plenty of history with these women. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay jokes
  aside, let's talk about what's new in Anime!
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Oh totally, this is THE Valentine's Day gift for me this year. Guess who I
  chose as my Valentine. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I can't choose married women lol also Sumipe

<div>
  (I don't know which I like better, but locking Kana-chan up sounds like an
  incoming fetish that'll get me into trouble so I'll take it on surface value)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: Wow has this been so many years in the making. Firstly, if you have
  not known about famous Japanese voice actress Hanazawa Kana, don't go out
  telling others you know Anime. For her popularity goes above most of them, she
  is known for her distinctive soft yet aborable voice in the array of
  characters she has played over almost a decade and a half when I knew her back
  in 2008, and she has never been disappointing ever since. For music though,
  despite starting her solo music career in 2012 and only recently has she
  changed music labels to now PONY CAYON (which houses Kitou Akari, Taketatsu
  Ayana etc.), she has not been up to a smooth start despite the continued back
  up from composer and producer Kitagawa (Katsutoshi, I only remember his family
  name) who pretty much decided even her music career back then and in the new
  label... until now. This is a single for Anime, not surprising, but what might
  be more surprising is how much more depth this release has just being
  mediocre, not even impressive. Let's notice this and find out why.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  (1) Dramatic Janakute mo [Even If (You Are) Not as Dramatic]<br />From first
  chorus:
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Even if (you are) not as dramatic, even if (I) lament that (you are) boring
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Again today, (you) suddenly surfaced (in my mind)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Even if romantic words are missing it's fine, that's why
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I) mutter to stop time, even if for a bit..."
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  For starters, this is as simple of a melody as this can get. Not surprising
  for the Anime it was featured in I shall not elaborate more, but maybe it's
  because of that, it gave off more of a softer feel than your usual Pop song,
  which I guess isn't all too bad after all. Coupled with the hot and cold
  lyrics similar to the feels of Anime "Kubo-san" and their main female
  character (to who she also voices), it really gives this song the personal
  touch with respect to its credit, I have to say. Being the opening theme
  artist and main character? This is actually her first, and likely why this
  presents her a new opportunity to stand out among the crowd, contrary to the
  Anime's theme of being unnoticeable. This might have helped her created the
  much needed impression for her music career. Just ignore the usual quirks like
  the bridge part, and you'll be fine, totally.
</div>
<div>Rating: Outstandingly Below Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Groovy Mystery Train</div>
<div>From second chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Let's go out to discover, the groovy music fighter
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Hey, face forward</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Do not stop! (Do a) High Five</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">(As often) As you like"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  Don't ask me why this is the title of the, I guess, groovy song, but hey, at
  least in the lyrics of this rather short song, Hanazawa Kana-chan herself got
  it in the bag. Yes, this is the artist's once in a blue moon lyrics
  composition, singing about the adrenaline rush and being on and adventure that
  awaits ahead, it might even be hard to keep up. The arrangement of this song
  despite with the same composer running the mill definitely helped in making
  this pop out as an interesting B-side as it caught my attention first when I
  heard of the preview before the full song was out. For that, along with cheeky
  background vocals also by Kana-chan, are probably convincing enough for me to
  like this song. It might have an abrupt end though, which I would say adds in
  to the uniqueness of the melody.
</div>
<div>Rating: Quirky Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This is quite a harsh talk about a Hanazawa Kana single, but I
  think I'll treat this as their most successful release 10 years coming into
  her solo music career. I just think this single deserves praise. As I rock on
  the B-side and think of the A-side, I still think this is quite an interesting
  release to give chance to even if you have no idea who the artist is. Oh, if
  you are her fan though, then by all means embrace this as her best achievement
  in getting credit for her songs out there. For we have waited this long, just
  a decade long, for her to be recognized of her singing since I guess you know
  that song from the Monogatari series. No more that, we rockin' this single
  now.

  (If you need a reason to like Uesaka Sumire and her gothic artist style like
  me, then you might as well take the Anime character. Not close-ups though.)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: This must be a second miracle we are talking here. As I joke about how
  I have already given two Uesaka Sumire singles in full with the previous one
  from 2017, I question myself how much I'm keen on listening to this specific
  voice actress' quirks as she embarks on another season of an Anime series
  featuring her as a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a> but
  more importantly, aggression becoming her personality with this release
  itself. The series didn't catch me much to be honest, but as she again sings
  the opening theme song, things are about to change. As much as the songs
  Sumipe sings are just as weird as her and we will get to that later, somehow
  coming from her it makes her music career all the more unique since it can be
  unforgiving as it can be fantastic. And this one falls into the latter, I
  would argue.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) LOVE CRAZY</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Hey, look here</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Just a little bit</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Don't be embarrassed</div>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Hey, tell (me) about (your) true feelings
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">... Just joking"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  This song title totally holds this song all the way, and we are only talking
  about the melody. The janky Rock style and very insinuating lyrics help
  amplify the power of this song to how much to and from the girl in this
  relationship has to desperately yet passively hit on the guy to get him to
  fall in love with her, the theme for the Anime is definitely passed through
  with emphasis and with force. I can't really complain how one would dislike
  this unless you can't get the feels in this song. The lyrics paint a very
  accurate picture of push and pull of love especially in the chorus, which only
  makes this icing on the cake so much sweeter as backed up by the aggression of
  music behind. I can truthfully say this has perfected the Anime theme song
  formula down and true to its roots as this will be a instant favourite among
  those who have gave this a listen.
</div>
<div>Rating: Crazily Impressive</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) REBELLION</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div>
  <div></div>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      "Riding on the cheers that won't stop ringing as (I) sing
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">To protect my love</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      The battle is still just starting, (it's) still going on
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      Let's deliver this oath from the front line"
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <div></div>
</div>
<div>
  As far as I know I walked in only knowing that this is a theme song for some
  upcoming video game, but damn is it actually good. The melody does hit on
  point, it has a slightly unusual style compared to the first song to make sure
  they don't clash, and it's catchy enough for anyone to get on to it. Maybe a
  little rap may have offset the pace at this song delivers, but I have to say
  it isn't too bad in my opinion after all, of course with the usual bridge part
  issue. The lyrics paint a strong feel towards a rebellion with drive as shown
  in the title and with someone to protect, it's definitely a song I've expected
  Sumipe to sing as a music artist. It's that good.
</div>
<div>Rating: Positively Above Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(3) Michi ga Wakaranai no Uta [Song About (An) Unknown Path]</div>
<div>From first chorus:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Forever inside a spiral</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Pouring out in the desert of time</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">The two (of us) can never meet</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Torn apart by a song of fate</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Dear grieving universe, embrace me</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">Lead me to (offer as) sacrifice"</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>
  Oh yeah this is the 90s style melody I've been waiting for as usual, and I do
  not joke they made sure this is a simple melody to remember. And I would
  believe so because of the fact that they had to let Sumipe write the lyrics to
  this song. Even with a unique title, one would believe that this song would
  bring meaning in its lyrics, but trust me, that only barely holds in the
  choruses. The verses tell a different story, as she struggles to write lyrics
  that make any sense, but since it's about getting lost, you can see even as an
  example, in the second verse she was just describing how to get to Shinjuku,
  which is as ironic as it's actually entertaining to listen. Her creativity and
  quirkiness to this level still impresses, and I can't say much but to give it
  despite being reluctant in the first place.
</div>
<div>Rating: Confusingly Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This single is a good example of what happens if you give good
  songs to an Anime artist. You may think I joke like this, but it's hard to
  give Uesaka Sumire proper recognition when every other single in her music
  career is nothing but traps to music I would rather not listen to. This single
  will prove otherwise even if she still prefers such a path, for this level of
  craziness is still up my alley, I would rather they do this more often
  instead. And if you have not heard of her, this release might be a good time
  to give her a chance, since this has everything to cater to your tastes to
  make you like her.

  Let's go in order, shall we? Kana-chan's single is already different as you
  can see from the above, as it's being aligned vertically in the cover instead
  of the usual horizontally aligned, but that's not all. We have the Anime
  "another jacket" alternate cover embedded within the booklet which featured a
  nicely drawn character Kana-chan was featured in haha yes it's Kubo Nagisa I
  did not want to name that in my review despite knowing that she is
  indefinitely cuter than a married woman- MOVING ON haha, instead of all the
  special bromide gifts which are all

  so don't ask which one I liked it's all the same damn black outfit as if she
  is attending my funeral lmao, I chose her music label PONY CANYON's store

  special gift, which suffice it to say I may show this off if I have time, it's
  a special photo which can be scanned with an AR (augmented reality) mobile app
  "COCOAR2" which, if I'm not wrong, allows you to see a miniature something on
  top of the bromide. I'm making a guess right here, it's mini
  <strike>Kana-chan</strike> <strike>Kubo-san</strike> I don't know I'll come
  back and prove me wrong but just anything is already worth the trip.

  Oh well that's too much of Kana-chan, so let's talk about Sumipe now! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Hey, you don't need to show this much in order to be good, okay? She already
  won in my heart which speaks music first; It's Klassic Note after all. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>
  Other than that though, we are dealt with the typical Anime release cover and
  artwork and stuff, so I'm good with that considering the actual contents of
  this single is already in unique territory. For the special gift though, since
  my bro can't make a choice (lol) and ironically the birthday month vouchers I
  got are actually lesser than the points I can redeem, I chose the special gift
  bromide from
