Wow, is my choice of going to colleague's place on Friday a mistake and a hell
of an experience. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Suffice it to say I was just going probably only for
dinner after work but because something came up at the last minute and we all
had to wait for it to be done, only then realized this guy lives halfway across
the island (he at West and I live Northeast), we only had time to have dinner
and do a Lo Hei maybe play some games I did enjoy his PS4 lol, before we
realized we are going to miss the last of public transport that night. With my
sheer luck and thanks to Google Maps I took all the last buses of my journey and
reached home safely... at 1am. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, the night is young, they say.
Guess I don't have to be 30 no more-
<div><br /></div>

  Speaking of time here lol what is the relevance even, the upcoming package
  which will be coming in soon probably in time for Valentine's Day... did not
  go according to plan. No photobook review within so that will not be until
  March, and I am TAXED BY ITEMS SHIPPED NOT SHIPPING FEES so that's already
  going to make me rage lol maybe I find another service which doesn't do that
  hehe

    Because you see, the problem is not finding out who did all this, but to
    find a way to NOT put the blame on us. That's the harder part. Fortunately,
    we have sleuth master here so we good. Also, not

      target="_blank"
      >famous detective</a
    >. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode what is with the special extended
    opening&nbsp; maybe that's the actual length (#KyokouSuiri16), we conclude
    the murder surrounding Muroi-san, who, if you haven't realized, is always
    cursed to have issues with associating with women. Hey, let's not say the
    snow woman is also going to be an issue eventually lol Kotoko-chan stop
    predicting that, but let's talk about the murder first. Well, for starters,
    we have to remember something, which is a thing I thought of not saying but
    then I really forgot which was that, Kotoko had all the access to all the
    spirits in town since she is the goddess after all, so is able to know what
    happened at the time of murder. So yeah, surprise surprise, it's not the guy
    after all, and boy did I thought that the ex-wife would kill herself and
    frame the husband but then again why would she since she could've done that
    long ago, brought us to the next suspect and obviously murder on the line,
    Muroi's partner at his previous work Itsuki. She's a b*tch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also
    she did a lot of things to keep his beloved in check even after he left the
    company, like wink wink, checking on whether he has an alibi before
    committing the murder and then framing it on him. Like seriously, who puts
    the murder's name on the hand? There isn't even a marker on the location,
    dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So yeah, Itsuki here didn't do everything cleanly, and as
    Kotoko mentioned, it's super unlikely the police are still at the
    Muroi-did-it accusation mainly because he has been so secluded even without
    the camera footage, that it's super hard to find any more clues as to
    whether they can pin him as the murderer. So yeah, and as overheard by
    ghosts near the police station lol why, they are investigating the
    possibility of Muroi-san being framed of murder, which will probably make
    more sense at this point. And for the details of the murder you can watch it
    for yourself, but suffice it to say that you know, betrayal of Muroi-san
    somehow must come with a cause of women. Yeah, he too handsome, dude.
    Waaaaay more handsome than Kuro-senpai- GET THAT DEMON MONSTER AWAY FROM
    ME!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Says snow woman because yeah, remember we see him fine but as
    spirits they see him as... they can't even see him straight because it hurts
    their eyes. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, I wish I had that kind of appeal like Muroi but
    hey, I honestly also don't want that kind of betrayal action but maybe after
    I've earned a fortune that's fine hehe. Still alone either way so why not be
    rich too- Then again, I'm already living the secluded life so frame me for
    murder, why don't you? Haha please don't I don't want to eat prison food.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Kuro-senpai asked a good question though, that why would Itsuki who
    if she loved Muroi-san, frame him for murder? Why not frame someone else?
    Maybe she doesn't know anyone else? Yeah I guess, but the irony of being
    there for him while he is framed for murder sounds like a f**ked up idea for
    me. Unless you can tell me you can make Muroi-san innocent by exposing the
    murderer in which case it'll be... you? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, no one said this is a

      target="_blank"
      >perfect crime</a
    >. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all, wow this might be the best episode of this season
    so far, no joke. We are doing pretty well so far and so is the progress of
    Kotoko-chan's report lol don't forget she has to go to college/university
    too, so I wonder how many more cases we will have that actually will relate
    to the snow woman again. I thought she will be main for this season but
    maybe I'm wrong. Or that Muroi-san will be frozen solid soon enough and she
    will be. Haha let's see how then maybe Kuro-senpai will be killed by
    Rikka-san already lmao

    Hey, Shiraishi-kun, if you are a kid you WILL NOT get bored doing that thing

    gives me anxiety to no end my mental health will be in much better condition
    if I were him. Interestingly, Shiraishi did notice something different about
    Kubo-san but don't know what is it until they BOTH got a chance to stand on
    a chair to put up posters on the notice board to notice <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> that Kubo-san
    is wearing tights. Yep, she didnt have socks to wear lol. Also, one would
    think that she might not be wearing anything inside her- lmao but thank
    goodness this is still a
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/seinen" target="_blank">seinen</a> series
    so we are not going that far, but she was wearing them outside, I guess.
    Also, to be able to notice that difference means he was STARING AT THEM LEGS
    DUDE??? Haha ah hey, there is little to appreciate these days we take
    whatever we can. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Next up, Kubo-san wants a convenience store trip.
    I'm not sure what you call those in convenience stores here but they sure
    aren't as cheap as those in Japan to say the least and I won't even vouch
    for their taste, but the girl wants to try them out, dude. Never tried that
    before living for 16 years? That's a problem. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Thank goodness
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tennokoe" target="_blank"
      >the voice from above</a
    >
    and I don't mean Ten-chan's voice lol get it? Kubo-san was able to order a
    drink for herself with help from Shiraishi who wouldn't order one in fear of
    sharing half the drink with her and killing himself with embarrassment in
    the process. So he got a bun. Man, imagine if they bought TWO buns and-
    Moving on haha, but Kubo-san did not give up on the teasing, so she went for
    the kill on the bun. Yup, no tearing out a piece of whatsoever. You see bro,
    the thing with a drink is that you can open the cover and let them drink
    from not the cover. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Well either way he is screwed since people
    just bump into him like he's a wall or something so there's that. Really
    could've eaten while it's hot, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And we end with Valentine's
    Day. That sad day that'll hit me in a week or so where no one will give me
    chocolates, not even by mistake. But hey, Shiraishi thinks the one below his
    desk was a mistake, so what else is new. And you would think one should put
    their name on it at least, well, "to Shiraishi" at least, to let him know.
    But well he did bring it home so we're good. And no prizes for guessing it
    right, Kubo-san made it for him. By herself. Not purchased from the store.
    Made it in her kitchen. With the sis watching- And THAT is what's the
    problem here lol because even the sis knows this miracle is happening in
    front of her eyes where her sister is trying to make chocolate for her
    beloved by herself, and&nbsp;no surprises there from the sis' statement, her
    first attempt came out, uh, very racist-ly black. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I should stop
    making such jokes lol. Anyways, I guess the sis did indirectly help her make
    some of the cookies presentable to the public lmao, so yeah it was a happy
    ending. Well almost. For Shiraishi might be getting the best one out of the
    batch, and maybe Tama-chan and the others get the oddly shaped ones because
    who cares. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Man, I should stop describing episodes but even so,
    it's a joy to watch these unfold so don't mind me talking about how good
    this series is just in general.

    Wow, this episode is really leading up to the rest of this season, huh. Man,
    my blood is rushing I can't even. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we
    conclude the perfect crime which will otherwise be if not for Ranpo-kun haha
    we have to save Kunikida dude (#BungouStrayDogs42), let's talk about the
    mystery in general, how about it? Yeah. No surprises, Mushitaro is the one
    who killed the author and stealing his final volume of the novel, is
    probably trying to sell it in the black market for a profit. Problem is,
    that is just a copy, not the original. For what seems like just one taking
    the life of another lol it is still true to this aspect, there is a lot more
    to this supposed mystery from the famous mystery novel author on his last
    work. Firstly, it's impossible to stop Mushitaro as Ranpo-kun exposes him in
    the car they were in and tells this to the police. There is no evidence,
    that driver is pointing a gun without bullets though to Ranpo, and they were
    above all, in a diplomat car. Yup, you heard that right, they got their own
    butt covered well. So yeah, they had to let them go despite Ranpo tipping it
    out to Poe and to the police to get these guys once he has revealed... well
    almost everything. Which brings us to the next point, why we had to trap
    Mushitaro in his own mystery to get him to confess. Not surprising, we know
    the same thing as this dude that Ranpo doesn't have an Ability he's just
    smart lol, so he had to use Poe's powers to trap him in so the only way he
    can get out is to reveal the truth. Even then, Mushitaro was still lying
    till the end, for Ranpo then figured out already that he committed the
    murder in orders from the author friend himself. Yes, they were friends,
    that's the whole point that he can get this close to the author, but in a
    plot twist for the novel I guess haha, he hired his friend to kill him so
    there is motive and intent. Yup, weird thought, but the author is already
    going to die of a tumour in a year or so so maybe this is a faster route.
    <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Anyways lol, and it's also BECAUSE they are friends, that Ranpo
    knew how to deal with Mushitaro who can cover all his crimes with evidence:
    To let the suspicions behind the friend's death be as what Ranpo will reveal
    to the public OR fulfil his friend's wishes and reveal the actual ending
    proper. Which he wouldn't if he wasn't directly involved in this, so he is
    basically busted already to be honest, serving as easy evidence for the
    whole thing and probably enough to get Kunikida out of prison... or so we
    think. I wouldn't think too much about this Nikolai person who just appeared
    out of nowhere but I would guess Mushitaro won't be walking out of this
    alive lol thanks Ranpo for the career recommendation we don't do
    after-prison job opportunities here let alone afterlife ones he has no
    chance anyways haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, is obviously going to be killed by, wait for it,
    one of the FIVE angels working alongside Fyodor to take Mushitaro down lest
    he reveals more of their plans. Yup, deja vu already? And as the Detective
    Agency take on their next assignment haha it's already too late Mushitaro if
    you can DM like maybe Fukuzawa they might still have a chance to say no, we
    are already in a deep hole of no return as we take on directly the actual
    antagonists of the series. Yup, all those earlier is just for show, ladies
    and gentlemen. This upcoming group? We might not even be able to stop them.
    Boy, is this series delivering, and I like that. Plot twists at every corner
    possible, and we haven't even seen Atsushi-kun. Not really missing him but
    you know, I hope he's not dead. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, do we think Ranpo-kun
    has an Ability now? I don't think so, right? He's just manipulating
    information he knew from mystery to get back those to f**k with him using
    Abilities? I like to think of it that way, makes more sense. *looks at Wiki*
    Yeah, still no Ability haha

    were on it. They were friends, dude, and if you're not Fyodor you will deal
    this with emotion. But you know, there are psychopaths in reality too so

    to start. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I see from the previews we
    finally have more going lol (#OtonariNoTenshiSama05), thanks dad for the

    mistake only once a week. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> New year happened, and we already have
    the first intimate interaction here, girl falling asleep on the guy. What,
    you thought I was talking about cheek poking? I mean, she might be awake
    when she was placed on his bed but what else you gonna do about it? They are
    friends dude, we can't do anything on the bed together. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Come on,
    girl, don't sleep on me. Sleep WITH me. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Hey on another note? Aizawa
    Saya I know your hobby is sleeping and Akarin may say that this isn't a
    great hobby to do with others but can I sleep with you somewhere? HAHA Then
    again that might be too good to be true... for now haha, so let's not tell
    Amane's parents about it, yes? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh hi dad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't worry he
    didn't find out he was flirting with the mother anyways. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Many
    jokes here just having these people interact with each other, but I guess
    the purpose of the parents coming over apart from witnessing whatever thing
    he has with his cute neighbour and how much Shihoko wants Mahiru to be her
    daughter lol that will be incest my dear <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (ah hey step siblings is
    okay though? lmao), brought some
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kimono" target="_blank">kimono</a> for the
    girl to go shrine visiting for the new year. Amane looks
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> as
    usual lmao why, but I think the joke is on the fact that they were seen,
    well Mahiru-chan was seen, holding hands in public I guess. Oh well,
    what'cha gonna do. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They also shared drinks with each other unlike
    the other couple in another Anime which didn't (read above for "Kubo-san"
    thanks), which just goes to show how much of a joke this series is already
    treating friendship like holy water and throwing romance into the gutter.
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> They also shared compliments with each other but then what else is
    new here, and man did the relentless teasing from Amane get the girl every
    single time I can't even. All in all... guys, we all need a

    Mahiru-chan in our lives. And a handsome face. Yeah. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, just
    fill yourselves up with not a cuppa hot drink but with some wholesome Anime
    like this where embarrassment is fuel, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, ladies too
    I swear this demographic is very universal Amane should be the reason you
    watch this hehe. Also, I found out that LISTENING to this Anime will make me
    happier and not complain about the... the drier scenes or poor animation
    quality that would otherwise only be better on close-ups. Man, I guess I'm
    giving this till the end. We have some backstory from Amane and his dad it
    seems on why he moved to live alone so welp I hope it's not a bullying story
    again lmao TYPICAL, but yeah, it's peaceful days going forward which I don't
    think so. We need more drama in this drama even though I swear we have a lot
    of it already haha I don't know what else better to say about this series
    dude just leave me alone
  </div>
  <div>
    [TL:DR; "Like how he is always so cool without even trying" This plot in a
    nutshell- As I said dude it's not an angel dropped into the guy's life as
    per the title THIS SERIES LITERALLY GAVE HER AN IKEMEN lol it's like
    "Romantic Killer" we should just change the title to "Otonari no
    Ikemen-sama" haha]

    Well what turned out to be just a slow week starting February now literally
    became probably the most packed month thanks to Apple Music, I listened to
    TWO albums which released this week. Well, we'll get to the ambiguity in a

    last year and making waves in Klassic Note, is supposed to release his full
    album... next month and I did not know this is a digital pre-release, ended
    up giving a couple of songs not realizing maybe it's better to give this a
    month and half down the road when I don't have anything to listen to. And
    the thought of reviewing <b>Ueda Reina's 1st album</b> from listening to a
    song from her radio show on Thursday might be better. Oh well, convinced
    myself to have to listen the former because it's released on date. Boy was I
    wrong haha I have not listened to Ueshama yet by the way

    Time for more news about music from Twitter! Hey it's not all from there and
    it's not all new releases but we try to find them if possible.
    <b>Yogee New Waves' new EP will release beginning on March</b> and it's
    confirmed to somehow only have digital and vinyl but not CD or other
    physical medium so don't ask me why. It's got new songs so I take them.

    didn't like that song though so lyrics change won't mean much lol. I was

    which also means she is promising more new music which will be rather
    exciting considering her solo songs were just like, the one from last year
    so far and I would love more to be honest.

    during their live tour this weekend and this will likely start their year of
    new songs, though I would argue it might be a bit late but yeah they gotta
    finish the live tour and take a break so that's understandable.<br />
    <br />So next week, I guess we will be listening to a slew of just singles
    thank goodness haha this was supposed to be the highlight week of the month.
    <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</b> is for Anime so my hopes aren't
    too high anymore see you guys in the next album haha,&nbsp;<b

    going to be haha Ueshama will be then I guess

    And boy sorry for the late post but I doubt anyone is waiting besides myself
    lol, because I was dragged by my mom to whatever community dinner (for
    senior citizens) and our whole family begrudgingly joined in only for me to
    be blasted music on my right ear for about 3 hours in the evening because we
    sat nearest to the front. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> I promised myself to be happy this year, by
    the way. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Thanks mom, now that we just won a new toaster I guess
    we're having bread for breakfast for the next few months. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> See you
    guys next time then, my life is as exciting as I just need to agree to say
    yes and leave the damn house, but until next time hope for next week I can
    actually spend more time at home and... maybe fix this blog loading also to
    be honest. I hope I did something yesterday to speed this up, but I'm not
    sure, can't be as fast as that Qwik framework that has been gaining in
    popularity recently I've read up on. Sorry for programming talk but hey if
    web is still the future then maybe the websites can load faster so I can buy
    more Tomita Miyu bromides hehe yup she got me again I'm going to order some
    stuff right now- IS THAT A RAFFLE FOR MIYU-CHAN THAT DID THOSE MARUPI ONES??
    Uh oh haha my wallet noooo<br />
