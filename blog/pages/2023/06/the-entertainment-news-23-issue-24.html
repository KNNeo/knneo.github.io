Wait wait, I got this week's intro, give me a minute.
<div><br /></div>
<div>*ahem*</div>

<div>
  As my workload lightens up on the weekdays and I spend just a
  <i>little</i> more time doing more personal stuff and reading up on how to fix
  the blog and/or my GitHub site haha I actually even found bugs to the recent
  official
  <a href="https://klassicnote.github.io/" target="_blank"
    >Klassic Note Web Release 1.0</a
  >
  (lol we call it that now?), I just am slowly but surely thinking of not the
  #KN15YEARS compilation haha that will be rough to do by the end of the year,
  not the one more blog post I want to do for #KN15YEARS also lol I will get to
  that eventually, but more of just planning out my vision for the next upgrade
  to this place for the weekend. In my latest proposal...

  Haha not going to reveal too much we will show that off in due time and don't
  worry I don't have open betas unlike the many video game announcements this
  week lmao, because just like the Anime and music I watch this week I am ALL IN

  Oh damn Shima-kun in a play, huh. I already can see Kanechika-senpai gyrating
  in the corner liao haha- What are the chances Ririka-san will be here to
  visit? <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Anyways haha I should stop jinxing it, this new episode
  (#SkiLo10) brings us the school festival! Also, more about Shima-kun because
  we know we'll get to this point. Just, casually. Just like how casually he
  said yes to the musical the class is going to do because yes blame peer
  pressure, I don't think Shima-kun will say he's doing this just because he
  wants to. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So of course, since everyone around his life knows about
  this news haha and I also mean the people he wanted to avoid because how is
  the senpai NOT gonna know haha, we start with not the class. So his buddy
  Chris. And hey Shima-kun, your buddy is right: distancing oneself and not
  being honest is such a bad thing to do in school life. I speak from
  experience. <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> Eventually he has to open up himself to the masses which
  will be disappointing after what is of his perfect image so far, but not like
  it matters considering he's doing a romance part with Kinomoto-san who is
  already attached? Still managed to do the rehearsals like a pro, it's guy. No
  one will know- Can we get a full-on mask and hair dye on the gardener Johan?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And then, we have Shima-kun himself. Him remembering his past and
  doing all the lines for his mother while she is quarreling with the father?
  Yeah who cares whose fault is that, but don't expect the stuff you do as a kid
  be something that makes your mom happy.

    target="_blank"
    >Been there, done that already</a
  >. Never goes well. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Which brings us in contrast to Mitsumi actually,
  who already knew Shima is doing this for the sake of it, probably knew he was
  unwilling to do it anyways but is still doing a great job, rather do the love
  scene with him than let him do it with whatever Egashira or some other girl in
  class. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> ANYWAYS haha it's their little secret and so it is to
  Ririka-san haha you can't get mad at him you aren't the love interest you're
  just a burden lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>, but as closer friends, the main couple hehe, they
  know each other well to not discourage one another but also to live on
  whatever <strike>lies</strike> lives they chose to. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Specifically on
  Mitsumi's side though, she is just undertaking more tasks than ever other than
  the student council mostly to feel useful and that is no surprise, but she may
  be on the deep end when she realizes how much the class is rather critical of
  her efforts. I mean, if I were Mitsumi I'll make amends by jumping into the
  bench and being honest with them and with her own due attention, but yeah,
  probably due shock that is sent to the country bumpkin will not go unawares,
  but let's just say that Mitsumi is made of stronger stuff so crying it away is
  probably something to make her better. Also, if you cry means you care. You
  think politicians today cry over the decisions they make? *pft* All in all...
  hey maybe doing it all for your mother <i>was</i> a mistake. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey same
  here bro, but I learnt to stop it at what, 12? So yeah, I'm good. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To
  learn of disappointment stemming from expectations even you worked hard for
  it? Hey, if you did work hard on it, prove it to them. I did not though so
  less a case for me but <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Mitsumi isn't such a person, so yeah dear
  classmate, give the country girl a chance. For Shima-kun though? If he acts
  again it's hardly ever done for himself. We use skills we have for the stuff
  we are not passionate about, don't worry. Seeing next week's preview though,
  yeah Ririka-san (oh yeah Kotobuki Minako hehe it has been a while) probably
  knows about it already lol what are the chances Shima-kun is in the cast his
  class is making a musical of amirite?? So yeah, if you aren't bracing for this
  explosion using an umbrella, I am. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See you then, we counting down to
  the main event already.&nbsp;

  </blockquote>
  Oh yeah, the camping? That's how it works now, this Anime, gotta come up with
  new stuff to do every week. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> And as Nasa-kun sleeps on his worries
  lol you have worries? Haha in this new episode where everyone is up to the
  mountains (#ToniKawaS210), looks like everyone is in on this camping ground
  trip. I mean, the printout is already kind of a hint, but yeah Tokiko
  definitely did not intend to have this camping trip between just the 3 of
  them, so everyone in the cast we know of were also invited. Well, not that
  mechanic though, as much as she's on the top of <i>my</i> list. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Anyhow I'm sure she is busy or just super delayed on the news haha she is
  still deciding whether to go, let's up the hills! Haha Nasa-kun chose to climb
  it though instead of taking it upwards the easy way lol, and Tsukasa of course
  had to oblige. No surprises there, just more surprising is that she can make
  her way up the hill faster than the main crowd, with Kyuuma-chan who lagged
  behind looking at poisonous mushrooms and beautiful flowers, until we realize
  that they were just taking shortcuts and yes Tsuksasa secretly is a ninja- I
  thought she was a swordswoman? Haha who is to say? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Turns out
  Kyuuma-chan is a lot more problematic than usual, and getting "lost" in a
  campground monitored by cameras, the guys decided to search her out only to
  know she went to the toilet- Didn't the cameras know she went there? LOL
  anyhow we got Nasa-kun in the dump instead haha he got lost and tired and
  slept but again who expected a boar or a wild bear anyways, because Tsukasa
  will be the only thing to land on him if he sleeps any longer. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And we
  don't talk about the stuff of them making out, you can watch those yourself.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But more importantly, that Nasa-kun has been dreaming about her
  first encounter with his wife, is how much he thought of why Tsukasa even till
  date, did not hesitate to be with him despite his rather nerdy reply of
  wanting to be with the woman who saved his life. I mean, I don't know, you get
  some girl to save my life and ask me then. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... Tsukasa
  doesn't know about idolism, isn't it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, if
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/34951/Akari_Kitou" target="_blank"
    >Kitou Akari</a
  >
  told me to marry her in order to date her, then I will be on the headlines.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah, I'll do the marriage announcement earlier than
  <a
    href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2023-06-08/voice-actress-tomoyo-kurosawa-announces-marriage/.198921"
    target="_blank"
    >Kurosawa Tomoyo</a
  >. Yeah, even if it's infatuation. Damn, I wish someone will love me back.
  HAHA okay moving on, not much of hint here, we are not even close to the lore
  of what Tsukasa's backstory is exactly about haha I mean she could've landed
  from the moon on this very peak who knows, but seeing that we are nearing the
  end of this second season by the way, and yes looks like we are doing a
  wedding reception in the campsite lol what a surprise, but heck, maybe we end
  this series this way. Though uh... can we not have season three? Just- YOU
  CANNOT JUST END THIS THOUGH YOU HAVE HER SAMURAI IN THE OPENING <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>

  SWIMSUIT EPISODE LET'S GOOOOO <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, didn't expect the good stuff to be
  in this very series compared to the others listed this week, but hey, I'll
  take anything now. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode (#KimiSomu09) where- Oh hey,
  sis. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Sadist Ten-chan again LET'S GO- Why am I already hyped by this?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, we are NOT going to address the treatment Isaki-chan is getting
  from her sister. That is not abuse; that is pleasure. <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Okay jokes aside
  she is not going to give us swimsuits anyways lmao just step on me will do
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>, okay seriously we need to chill because this is a series about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/JK" target="_blank">JK</a>. Get it? As in
  joking? Well, let's move on, we haven't even done the training camp yet dude!
  Yes, the one we had to take a photo to join a contest and hopefully win and
  bring some pride and reputation to the dormant Astronomy Club? Yeah, the
  student council head also thought it was a great idea. So no, no budget for
  you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not surprising, I swear Ukegawa saw that a mile away, but
  considering Nakami is dead bent on letting it happen after what happened last
  time with the star-viewing party which was rather tragic tbh, to compensate
  for the lack of money and we aren't exactly going to ask the rich dad for
  money lol, he gotta take up part-time jobs. *looks at sis* Oh, I see where
  this is going. OH!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Okay I thought he's gonna get in to somewhere
  Isaki's sister will be working or visiting but I guess this is not "Kubo-san"
  anyways lol shout out to Akina, but because reality hit us this fast and
  before you know it, he failed the interview. Nakami, did you accidentally say
  you wanted money so you are here? Definite no-go for starters. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Anyways, not surprising that Shiromaru's arcade will be the next opportunity
  for him haha as always connections are the best way to get jobs nowadays lol
  especially if we have AIs taking over our jobs haha <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span>, seeing that the
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> is
  actually busy with preparing for the next nerd event lol yeah Shiromaru-Con we
  call it (or I guess Betty-Con seeing the name), is not able to get much sleep
  working on stuff all night, so might as well let Nakami take care of the mess
  and the place in the day. Even then obviously it's not enough for them to get
  enough money to go to the places they want, so to cut it short Isaki mentioned
  to provide accommodation and food sort of, for the trip. Yeah, turns out we
  just had to cheat. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Cut corners, please. But what we are not cutting
  corners though besides the cycling animations lol did you see that? Haha it's
  the girls' day out at the beach! Yes, this one sure delivered you will NOT be
  disappointed we have some boob action but not what you think but it is still
  great, and as expected all of them are having fun, Isaki wore a thin shirt
  over her lovely bikini (don't mind the scars it was the surgery) just like
  <a

  haha <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chikushou" target="_blank">dammit</a>,
  and Kanikawa is just here for the dudes. That is not the one classmate.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But I know right, Kanikawa how do you get laid if all you do is just
  stand there and not get wet? BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I speak from experience. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  Then again, thanks for the shaved ice, I guess, whoever you are. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I
  cannot think of anyone who would do this that we know, so let's say that was
  Nakami's dad. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shougakusei" target="_blank"
    >grade schoolers</a
  >. Grade schoolers? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... imagine getting laid, dude.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, imagine your sis going with you to training camp. Yeah, the one
  you get to flirt with your boi haha ah hey you told your grandma about the
  lodgings for the camp, how else would she know? So yeah don't worry
  Shiromaru-senpai, I think we have a new member of the discipline committee
  here to monitor them. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also, who says it's about those two anyways?
  Maybe the sis wants Ganta to herself- See you guys then. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Remember
  this series is about viewing of the stars? I can't wait to view her impressive
  rack- O~kay me haha <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> (Again, did not expect the good stuff to be in this
  series by the way, just in case you don't know)
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; I really wonder who among the girls the one guy thought to buy shaved
  ice for. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> If it was me? Maybe Kanikawa but prove me wrong haha]

  P.P.S. FYI Ten-chan ie. Amamiya Sora is different from Isaki's sister as in
  complete opposite as she mentions in her YouTube videos, she cooks for her
  family and does housework.

  You sure they didn't do this in "Takagi-san" also? Hey, we can't come up with
  newer ideas, dude. Then again it's always fresh so <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> in this new
  episode where clearly someone was jebaited into letting Kubo-san do what she
  likes most haha (#KuboSan10), oh we talking about staring down at others? Can
  Akina stare down at me too, please? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Speaking of which, she is in this
  episode though. Nice. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So, the chalk dust thing. Yeah, maybe that's
  why having the window seat is an issue, people dumping off the chalk dust into
  the air (yup) (still using chalk btw haha what we talking about the
  environment?) and did not notice Shiraishi is basically the wind haha I mean
  in the direction of the wind so white stuff just dumped all over his head
  (lmao) so he had to wash up. Thanks to Kubo-san he got to clean up the parts
  he missed. Or well, she did. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, she's gonna smear her face all
  over his hair- Guys, this is just episode 10, please. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> As a
  reward(?), Shiraishi got to touch her hair back? Yo we got to touch her hair
  LET'S GO- I don't want to wash my hands again so I'll pass. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways,
  Shiraishi said good morning first the next day haha that will be motivation if
  I had that planned from the start but not like anyone will stare at my face
  for a second lmao, because we move on to
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shintaisokutei" target="_blank"
    >physical measurements exam</a
  >&nbsp;or something, I don't know what you call those. A waste of time? Haha
  <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> because damn as a kid apart from knowing how much puberty has grown on
  you (lol yeah) (Kubo-san is not even close to mature, not even <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>), you
  don't really want to know about you know, among other things, weight and
  height. Doesn't mean we need to professionally measure it though. Just put
  your boi against the wall with a ruler and- Yes, the title did mention about
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kabedon" target="_blank">kabedon</a> so good
  job Kubo-san, you did all the stuff couples do without the guy knowing what
  happened. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Also just keyed in "kiabedon" lol that's when the girl
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/squeal" target="_blank">squeals</a> lmao)
  Yeah, putting your man against the wall close enough to kiss <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>,
  wearing his
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/jya-ji-" target="_blank">jersey</a> and not
  smelling it for a moment because why would you haha, and lying to your
  friends- Oh boy this last part is the most important. That's when you know you
  love someone because you don't want anyone to know your secrets- Hey,
  Kubo-san? You aren't a celebrity though your friends know you want more rack,
  dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Last but not least, Seita-kun's first expedition- Okay his
  first errand, yes? Obviously no one is not worried about him so his brother
  Junta-kun (hehe) is tailing him for starters. Also Akina- Wait, what?
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> So is she tailing brother-in-law or- What's the difference even?
  Hehe <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> but yeah the brother's worried so he follows him a distance away
  because despite what we think apparently he can still conceal himself even if
  they are your family members. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Okay more Shiraishi invisibility skill
  lore I'm in haha. Seita-kun did a brilliant job though, and boy do I want to
  hug him just like what Akina did after seeing him successfully buy and bring
  back some eggs which, and sorry for pointing that out, Nagisa failed in when
  she was his age. Yeah, #NotMySibling let's get that trending so I can replace
  my sis with
  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/24413/Miku_Itou" target="_blank"
    >Itou Miku</a
  >
  or something lmao <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> All in all though, great episode with lots of quirks.
  I didn't expect the author to even point out but heck
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/futomomo" target="_blank">THIGHS</a> AND
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/mune" target="_blank">CHEST</a> AMIRITE!???
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Ah hey, we are not getting a swimsuit episode but at the least we can
  mention them in due time hehe I'm basically Akina now
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR: Serious talk though, this Kubo Nagisa is dangerously close to being
  "touch me more" type of woman- Wait, she's not? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>]

  HAHA yes their new album released last month did NOT get me but this one did.
  No wonder, I also ended up giving their most popular song, and yeah, it's as
  fantastical as it's emotional, nonetheless. Really bringing out my depression
  at this time of year lol<br />
  <br />
  There isn't much going on Twitter this week for music, so I'll pick up some
  other related stuff to talk about if you don't mind.

  also symbolizes them going over what their senpais ie. sphere, have done
  within 8 years of their group formation, heading straight into 10th
