In my latest proposal...</div><div><br></div><div>Haha not going to reveal too much we will show that off in due time and don't worry I don't have open betas unlike the many video game announcements this week lmao, because just like the Anime and music I watch this week I am ALL IN on this dude! Oh also being on Buyee and the auction house haha I told myself not to do that already but with <a href="https://twitter.com/seigura/status/1665659742386044931?s=20" target=_blank>the new Seigura magazine release</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/seigura/status/1667015232768851968?s=20" target=_blank>Rieri self-produced scenarios</a> for her 10th year as voice actresses I JUST CANNOT HELP MYSELF lol wait till you see me talk about the most expensive item that is from <a href="https://twitter.com/seigura/status/1664110541663768577?s=20" target=_blank>Ten-chan's new photobooks</a> that I haven't bought yet lol timely too they giving out 5% discount vouchers for Mercari <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SkiLo10><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span style=font-size:large> Skip to Loafer</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I'm supposed to be the guy who says yes to everything?" Yeah why not, Yes-Man, uh, I mean, main character? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Oh damn Shima-kun in a play, huh. I already can see Kanechika-senpai gyrating in the corner liao haha- What are the chances Ririka-san will be here to visit? <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Anyways haha I should stop jinxing it, this new episode (#SkiLo10) brings us the school festival! Also, more about Shima-kun because we know we'll get to this point. Just, casually. Just like how casually he said yes to the musical the class is going to do because yes blame peer pressure, I don't think Shima-kun will say he's doing this just because he wants to. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So of course, since everyone around his life knows about this news haha and I also mean the people he wanted to avoid because how is the senpai NOT gonna know haha, we start with not the class. So his buddy Chris. And hey Shima-kun, your buddy is right: distancing oneself and not being honest is such a bad thing to do in school life. I speak from experience. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Eventually he has to open up himself to the masses which will be disappointing after what is of his perfect image so far, but not like it matters considering he's doing a romance part with Kinomoto-san who is already attached? Still managed to do the rehearsals like a pro, it's guy. No one will know- Can we get a full-on mask and hair dye on the gardener Johan? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then, we have Shima-kun himself. Him remembering his past and doing all the lines for his mother while she is quarreling with the father? Yeah who cares whose fault is that, but don't expect the stuff you do as a kid be something that makes your mom happy. <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso target=_blank>Been there, done that already</a>. Never goes well. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Which brings us in contrast to Mitsumi actually, who already knew Shima is doing this for the sake of it, probably knew he was unwilling to do it anyways but is still doing a great job, rather do the love scene with him than let him do it with whatever Egashira or some other girl in class. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> ANYWAYS haha it's their little secret and so it is to Ririka-san haha you can't get mad at him you aren't the love interest you're just a burden lmao <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, but as closer friends, the main couple hehe, they know each other well to not discourage one another but also to live on whatever <strike>lies</strike> lives they chose to. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Specifically on Mitsumi's side though, she is just undertaking more tasks than ever other than the student council mostly to feel useful and that is no surprise, but she may be on the deep end when she realizes how much the class is rather critical of her efforts. I mean, if I were Mitsumi I'll make amends by jumping into the bench and being honest with them and with her own due attention, but yeah, probably due shock that is sent to the country bumpkin will not go unawares, but let's just say that Mitsumi is made of stronger stuff so crying it away is probably something to make her better. Also, if you cry means you care. You think politicians today cry over the decisions they make? *pft* All in all... hey maybe doing it all for your mother <em>was</em> a mistake. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey same here bro, but I learnt to stop it at what, 12? So yeah, I'm good. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> To learn of disappointment stemming from expectations even you worked hard for it? Hey, if you did work hard on it, prove it to them. I did not though so less a case for me but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Mitsumi isn't such a person, so yeah dear classmate, give the country girl a chance. For Shima-kun though? If he acts again it's hardly ever done for himself. We use skills we have for the stuff we are not passionate about, don't worry. Seeing next week's preview though, yeah Ririka-san (oh yeah Kotobuki Minako hehe it has been a while) probably knows about it already lol what are the chances Shima-kun is in the cast his class is making a musical of amirite?? So yeah, if you aren't bracing for this explosion using an umbrella, I am. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you then, we counting down to the main event already. </div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsXgceR8aycQggHUC8M0LalwnPOGiV-kG5wyds8DuHbPmx-OfupGTucL-VO2AUW2czvJlg7rhRRG_4PFC5bVuGyRILMa5TEY-JRWuPwD1v7cLQrlo1rL0sTivpA4GP0wyYuQ5pUEFhyYLzkSx3q9q9yNEep_e7TO_Ort9ZeiKHrgROSz4nU1g6iNfa/s320/skilo10_mitsumi7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Literally me after every episode of this series I can't even</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSc-0SMHh5WDlpLK9oerqa2d1CaUmsP_Ia5e2AABWepIWzgU33off_Bao4cZiqMb3nqA9RuyqHlUwuSY8HZOceBMSwnZiYswW6wa_3ncNMlz6ucZRKdgZGykJRQJil3JrbIWZFoCa2keSNx_aKnEzWt1xxbQF5Sz7BQ-v9yAr_dizoETkj5B6cZXaS/s1600/skilo10_ugh.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I want to be together with Egashira Mika haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></table></div></div><div>P.S.

You'll get stung to no end" You mean Nasa-kun getting kissed by Tsukasa all night, right? Haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div></blockquote>Oh yeah, the camping? That's how it works now, this Anime, gotta come up with new stuff to do every week. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And as Nasa-kun sleeps on his worries lol you have worries? Haha in this new episode where everyone is up to the mountains (#ToniKawaS210), looks like everyone is in on this camping ground trip. I mean, the printout is already kind of a hint, but yeah Tokiko definitely did not intend to have this camping trip between just the 3 of them, so everyone in the cast we know of were also invited. Well, not that mechanic though, as much as she's on the top of <em>my</em> list. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyhow I'm sure she is busy or just super delayed on the news haha she is still deciding whether to go, let's up the hills! Haha Nasa-kun chose to climb it though instead of taking it upwards the easy way lol, and Tsukasa of course had to oblige. No surprises there, just more surprising is that she can make her way up the hill faster than the main crowd, with Kyuuma-chan who lagged behind looking at poisonous mushrooms and beautiful flowers, until we realize that they were just taking shortcuts and yes Tsuksasa secretly is a ninja- I thought she was a swordswoman? Haha who is to say? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Turns out Kyuuma-chan is a lot more problematic than usual, and getting "lost" in a campground monitored by cameras, the guys decided to search her out only to know she went to the toilet- Didn't the cameras know she went there? LOL anyhow we got Nasa-kun in the dump instead haha he got lost and tired and slept but again who expected a boar or a wild bear anyways, because Tsukasa will be the only thing to land on him if he sleeps any longer. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And we don't talk about the stuff of them making out, you can watch those yourself. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But more importantly, that Nasa-kun has been dreaming about her first encounter with his wife, is how much he thought of why Tsukasa even till date, did not hesitate to be with him despite his rather nerdy reply of wanting to be with the woman who saved his life. I mean, I don't know, you get some girl to save my life and ask me then. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... Tsukasa doesn't know about idolism, isn't it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, if <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/34951/Akari_Kitou target=_blank>Kitou Akari</a> told me to marry her in order to date her, then I will be on the headlines. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, I'll do the marriage announcement earlier than <a href=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2023-06-08/voice-actress-tomoyo-kurosawa-announces-marriage/.198921 target=_blank>Kurosawa Tomoyo</a>. Yeah, even if it's infatuation. Damn, I wish someone will love me back. HAHA okay moving on, not much of hint here, we are not even close to the lore of what Tsukasa's backstory is exactly about haha I mean she could've landed from the moon on this very peak who knows, but seeing that we are nearing the end of this second season by the way, and yes looks like we are doing a wedding reception in the campsite lol what a surprise, but heck, maybe we end this series this way. Though uh... can we not have season three? Just- YOU CANNOT JUST END THIS THOUGH YOU HAVE HER SAMURAI IN THE OPENING <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsnPmJIWpT7u2M9oNIkTFmlK730qnlMo_QRSM7qUOeLPgcrhfut3qkze_3NI8KLTcwb-EibwqTbv3k7JNpry-P2Za-uxLclVx9AwwccC67QXjDEknd2IGeG3LBLk2-S-wqSFPIXYzs6xaYEjC5qPLrPEsfSetj9j8PnQGgRCQ-zSVQ9-rX0UUK9DUC/s320/tonikawaS210_mushrooms1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is called "never eat all mushrooms" lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8xKXwq9wMA4W_AO5xKPQa5ZPqwnY_oa31OKOXpWYapw39m3InbEVbfkmoise7C_tXmLbiC2aGie1gzT2asWTMyz8XT-LirPAr7pZrr6Ktv5YuJxyeRyzoG6yTFvwWbwNoww0TeC1YYIux1LtnN_WhJd7F7P3Gvsnf8mTFahIwMRWH5r6rn-aC-1Y9/s320/tonikawaS210_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is called "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha target=_blank>making out</a>" lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjV3fH0RyzyDGYAZKlZgZRO7cz-O89GK-8P8qCc7yuXG5nwvoq8KWjYv-O5jQufJdGv5pPoEulyjtEVMCDN15lME6WZqp1oW1Mnb9HSCwgC9yx4dyJtNyREN0PNOhE3-XoRuM0ywWPnaTU0qUpk6PYq6U-0cYOUSpVVsJcct-ZLFA3y3hW-QTvXoOb4/s320/tonikawaS210_nasa1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is called "<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E4%BD%95%E3%81%8B%E3%81%8C%E7%A9%BA%E3%82%92%E9%A3%9B%E3%82%93%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8B/1537330309?i=1537330313&amp;l=en" target=_blank>something is flying down from the sky</a>" haha as expected of Nasa-kun<br>(Nice song title reference, me)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

That is not abuse; that is pleasure. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Okay jokes aside she is not going to give us swimsuits anyways lmao just step on me will do <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>, okay seriously we need to chill because this is a series about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/JK target=_blank>JK</a>. Get it? As in joking? Well, let's move on, we haven't even done the training camp yet dude! Yes, the one we had to take a photo to join a contest and hopefully win and bring some pride and reputation to the dormant Astronomy Club? Yeah, the student council head also thought it was a great idea. So no, no budget for you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not surprising, I swear Ukegawa saw that a mile away, but considering Nakami is dead bent on letting it happen after what happened last time with the star-viewing party which was rather tragic tbh, to compensate for the lack of money and we aren't exactly going to ask the rich dad for money lol, he gotta take up part-time jobs. *looks at sis* Oh, I see where this is going. OH!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay I thought he's gonna get in to somewhere Isaki's sister will be working or visiting but I guess this is not "Kubo-san" anyways lol shout out to Akina, but because reality hit us this fast and before you know it, he failed the interview. Nakami, did you accidentally say you wanted money so you are here? Definite no-go for starters. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, not surprising that Shiromaru's arcade will be the next opportunity for him haha as always connections are the best way to get jobs nowadays lol especially if we have AIs taking over our jobs haha <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span>, seeing that the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> is actually busy with preparing for the next nerd event lol yeah Shiromaru-Con we call it (or I guess Betty-Con seeing the name), is not able to get much sleep working on stuff all night, so might as well let Nakami take care of the mess and the place in the day. Even then obviously it's not enough for them to get enough money to go to the places they want, so to cut it short Isaki mentioned to provide accommodation and food sort of, for the trip. Yeah, turns out we just had to cheat. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Cut corners, please. But what we are not cutting corners though besides the cycling animations lol did you see that? Haha it's the girls' day out at the beach! Yes, this one sure delivered you will NOT be disappointed we have some boob action but not what you think but it is still great, and as expected all of them are having fun, Isaki wore a thin shirt over her lovely bikini (don't mind the scars it was the surgery) just like <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSgleRtgO-DbAJ4Pd1FyBCaOgiiC3tzrtGim4vHNs0bI2kXBTZUT2Ld5ftX2Mi2xXK8XVX-fALVG_BNMrQbhbA2kuJ1_Ld-5QSytb0ZcyYlS3Qa_SpHY0hpIYamg99tLEViWtyygiAYVx3/s320/IMG_20190302_142352.jpg target=_blank>Asakura Momo's 1st photobook</a> haha <a href=https://jisho.org/search/chikushou target=_blank>dammit</a>, and Kanikawa is just here for the dudes. That is not the one classmate. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But I know right, Kanikawa how do you get laid if all you do is just stand there and not get wet? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I speak from experience. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, thanks for the shaved ice, I guess, whoever you are. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I cannot think of anyone who would do this that we know, so let's say that was Nakami's dad. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shougakusei target=_blank>grade schoolers</a>. Grade schoolers? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... imagine getting laid, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, imagine your sis going with you to training camp. Yeah, the one you get to flirt with your boi haha ah hey you told your grandma about the lodgings for the camp, how else would she know?

Wow great start haha</div></blockquote>You sure they didn't do this in "Takagi-san" also? Hey, we can't come up with newer ideas, dude. Then again it's always fresh so <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> in this new episode where clearly someone was jebaited into letting Kubo-san do what she likes most haha (#KuboSan10), oh we talking about staring down at others? Can Akina stare down at me too, please? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking of which, she is in this episode though. Nice. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, the chalk dust thing. Yeah, maybe that's why having the window seat is an issue, people dumping off the chalk dust into the air (yup) (still using chalk btw haha what we talking about the environment?) and did not notice Shiraishi is basically the wind haha I mean in the direction of the wind so white stuff just dumped all over his head (lmao) so he had to wash up. Thanks to Kubo-san he got to clean up the parts he missed. Or well, she did. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, she's gonna smear her face all over his hair- Guys, this is just episode 10, please. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> As a reward(?), Shiraishi got to touch her hair back? Yo we got to touch her hair LET'S GO- I don't want to wash my hands again so I'll pass. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Shiraishi said good morning first the next day haha that will be motivation if I had that planned from the start but not like anyone will stare at my face for a second lmao, because we move on to <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shintaisokutei target=_blank>physical measurements exam</a> or something, I don't know what you call those. A waste of time? Haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> because damn as a kid apart from knowing how much puberty has grown on you (lol yeah) (Kubo-san is not even close to mature, not even <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>), you don't really want to know about you know, among other things, weight and height. Doesn't mean we need to professionally measure it though. Just put your boi against the wall with a ruler and- Yes, the title did mention about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kabedon target=_blank>kabedon</a> so good job Kubo-san, you did all the stuff couples do without the guy knowing what happened. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Also just keyed in "kiabedon" lol that's when the girl <a href=https://jisho.org/search/squeal target=_blank>squeals</a> lmao) Yeah, putting your man against the wall close enough to kiss <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>, wearing his <a href=https://jisho.org/search/jya-ji- target=_blank>jersey</a> and not smelling it for a moment because why would you haha, and lying to your friends- Oh boy this last part is the most important. That's when you know you love someone because you don't want anyone to know your secrets- Hey, Kubo-san? You aren't a celebrity though your friends know you want more rack, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, Seita-kun's first expedition- Okay his first errand, yes? Obviously no one is not worried about him so his brother Junta-kun (hehe) is tailing him for starters. Also Akina- Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So is she tailing brother-in-law or- What's the difference even? Hehe <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> but yeah the brother's worried so he follows him a distance away because despite what we think apparently he can still conceal himself even if they are your family members. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay more Shiraishi invisibility skill lore I'm in haha. Seita-kun did a brilliant job though, and boy do I want to hug him just like what Akina did after seeing him successfully buy and bring back some eggs which, and sorry for pointing that out, Nagisa failed in when she was his age. Yeah, #NotMySibling let's get that trending so I can replace my sis with <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/24413/Miku_Itou target=_blank>Itou Miku</a> or something lmao <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> All in all though, great episode with lots of quirks.
