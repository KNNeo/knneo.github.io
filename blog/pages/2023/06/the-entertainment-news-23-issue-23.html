Oh wow did I take the whole week to be able to talk about this haha then again I
promised myself to do another #KN15YEARS blog post when I took work leave but
uh, my phone broke on Monday. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, didn't know it can't last half a
year more before I can get my hands on a new phone that has not yet been
announced which will NOT disappoint <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, so I have to live with my backup
phone which... is older than my previous phone which was supposed to be backup
but died half a year after I changed 2 years ago, is now running in I don't know
how many frames per second because if you thought 60Hz refresh rate was
important today wait till you experience less than 1. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Don't even ask
if I can play games on this thing. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And to make this short week at work even worse, for the rest of the week where
  I had to set up this old phone to work with most of the stuff today... in 2023
  lol this 8-year-old piece of antique, somehow made me forget my PIN number so
  much so I got locked out of resetting it and only after I went to the bank to
  reset it DO I THEN REMEMBER WHAT IT IS haha everyday event, by the way. I've
  since turned off biometric authentication because if anything has taught me in
  life is if you don't want to use a
  <strike>password manager</strike>&nbsp;piece of paper then key in the damn
  password every time then! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Really spent way too much time outdoors
  because of this by the way
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyways, enough about my life in shambles lol I rewarded myself with a trip to
  the forbidden auction house if you would recall <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> and I'm feeling worse
  now lol I saw a better offer after I took a bid <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> HOW IS THIS WEEK GETTING
  WORSE haha okay Anime is good we will be happy now- WHY AM I WATCHING FIVE
  SEQUELS NEXT SEASON seriously when is this pain going to stop<br />
  <br />

      dude. Completely changed woman- Also, love. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Oh, the intro is just her going back to her hometown? Okay. In this new
  episode (#SkiLo09) where you know, everyone changed in summer vacation... and
  then there's me. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Where NOTHING happened so haha yeah let's not talk
  about me lazing my days off school holidays and let's talk about Mitsumi's,
  for starters! Boy, is her&nbsp; vacation even something to envy for my
  colleagues at work when they go back to their hometown... home country lmao so
  yeah same same but different, but that's how it feels like, I suppose. Not
  just going through the lengthy process of whether it's road or air travel just
  to meet friends and family, but more of the ease of being at home. I mean, I'm
  already at home as we speak so that's not much but for these guys, it's coming
  back from an entirely different world. No, not
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a>, thanks.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> She got to meet her friends which aren't cringe because trust me I
  never want to meet my childhood anybody lol, I love an animated dad who is
  glad I'm back home, a grandma who can cook good food lol I will miss mine
  always since I inherited (lmao she doesn't even own the place) her room, and a
  mom who won't breathe down my neck about breakfast. Boy, watermelons for
  breakfast? Is that even legal? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> What do I know, my parents don't teach
  me SH*T haha anyways, not the swimsuit episode I expected because damn where
  is the Tokyo equivalent <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span>, and we are already back at school. Damn. That
  was fast. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And as Takamine-senpai has mentioned, gotta get all the
  vibes back because next up in this school is the school festival! Let's not
  talk about Shima-kun for now haha because obviously living up to the tensions
  of Mitsumi will make anyone happier lol, after attending the festival council
  brief (which includes the student council, I know) she probably even got more
  hyped about seeing the stuff this school has all the budget for since also,
  this is open to the public. So yay on her we will get to see more of... I
  don't know, which class is doing maid café? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, as the school
  prepares for their haunted house special, we got more fears coming in our way.
  Well, not for Mitsumi she has no fear, not even for checking in on Shima-kun
  because she is some friend to know how he feels about all this anyways ie. he
  doesn't give a shoot about it, but hey, me, for the sake of watching this
  series let's pretend to be hyped, ya? Honestly more interested in a sports
  festival. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... yep, there's the drop at the end of the
  episode just for our boi. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> It's so good, I'm not even paranoid.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, the countryside episodes for summer vacation sure is
  interesting, I'll give you that. The feels that Anime in general would not
  even care too much about... well at least from the shows I watch, this one
  covered it well and good. As for Shima-kun, he probably kept thinking like
  "why?" to all the affection he gets from being in not the same high school as
  Ririka-san lol but in his defence I will also say "why not?" because as
  mentioned in the previous episode, it's not his fault. And he will effectively
  be released once this dumb b*tch finds some solace in her own life, so
  meanwhile I guess you can be as boring as me. Well, even more boring than me
  considering the class has to do drama for the school festival now. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span>
  Can we find an admin job for Shima-kun first before Kanechika-senpai comes in
  to brag about this child actor's past? Haha I smell something spicy to end
  this season, oh boy, I smell it from a mile away...
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "I get frozen in place because I don't deserve anything" Well
  Shima-kun, maybe say that after you have ruined your image into hell because
  that is still what is keeping you going, if anything]

  Woah, what is with that intro hmmmmm <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode though
  where <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ponkotsu" target="_blank">clumsy</a> Tsukasa not
  knowing how to deal with a remote control is cuter hehe (#ToniKawaS209), WOMEN
  BEING PARANOID AMIRITE?? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But seriously though, technology is hard no
  one should be expected to understand just like with everything else in this
  world that isn't a necessity in which became one because society demands of
  you. Think about it. Moving on haha, oh Tokiko is a tech-savvy grandma? Man,
  can you help me with something at work? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyways, tech is fun as it's
  the worst thing to have in our lives because even access to the Internet is
  considered a human right at this point, it's hard to not be able to do things
  if tech breaks all the time or we are just not smart enough to deal with them.
  yes, smart tech and AI can't solve our stupid monkey brains, just so you know.
  Not even close. Looking at you, GPT. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Nasa-kun knows the wife is
  worried about asking him for help in this case considering she is very
  independent herself, so you know, we have to console her with cake if that
  thing still works nowadays. But&nbsp;Tsukasa is a anti-capitalist mobile gamer
  to spend money on fake currencies, so good to know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, cake is
  better, dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Ironically, she can have all the damn cake and still
  don't put on weight? Nasa-kun, you need to learn from your wife. Before that
  though, I like how we have a love advice segment in the middle of nowhere from
  Yanagi-sensei as if it's not obvious enough to the main couple that these two
  are a couple themselves, let's not talk about what the story is about, but
  let's talk about how she is just worried she will change because of
  Taniguchi's influence in stuff she despised. Hey Taniguchi is what we call an
  absolute nerd haha three cheers for me dude I'm less cringe now typing all
  this alone every Sunday. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on haha Yanagi-sensei why do you do
  it too then, to think that this will make him not like you as a person is so
  unbecoming, because damn isn't being in a relationship an influence of each
  other in the first place? BRUH. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Don't tell that to me though single
  me will NOT stand to change for anyone other than myself lol. Also me refusing
  to change is the fact that I'm just slowly putting on weight and am doing
  nothing about it unlike Nasa-kun who is basically enjoying all the damn good
  food (from his wife) living the damn
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">normie</a> life and
  THEN thinking it's bad for him. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Alright bro why are you literally me
  now <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> NO I REFUSE TO EXERCISE haha okay this might be a bad idea to put
  in all caps but where's that experimental pill that can literally do exercise
  for the disabled? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> We don't have that yet those are for the people
  who can afford them so not me lmao, so Nasa-kun literally showed off how I
  will look like right now if I were to run laps and do chin-ups. Too real bro,
  too real. All in an effort to build up his strength to protect the wife?
  Tsukasa is right though she can protect you forever have you even watched

    >Anime "Shikimori-san"</a
  >? Don't worry about it, dude. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Maybe worry about how an old woman
  sneaked into your house to have some
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/soumen" target="_blank">cold noodles</a> in
  this summer heat and still wanted all of you guys to go camping, I guess.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> All in all... hey just like the YouTube (lol) videos that Tokiko
  watched, the point where they lie to you about the joys of camping without
  warning to you about the pains you will have to deal with in due time which
  basically mosquitoes is enough for anyone to regret, is just part of the
  experience everyone thinks it's worth going for. So no thanks Tokiko, you can
  go with your son-in-law. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Other than that, total cringe on the
  flashback. So uh... timeless Tsukasa, huh? Very cringe indeed. Well, we are
  near the end now to be honest it's the last lap already Nasa-kun don't stop
  haha, so let's see for ourselves how much Tsukasa is not deserving of...
  anyone to be honest, considering she might be some type of... I don't know
  really we might as well watch to find out haha no really I know next to
  nothing about her past
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "But when I catch Tsukasa-chan's scent, it makes me want to do
  whatever you say" MARRIAGE!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also influence, Yanagi-sensei so don't
  think too much into that, alright?]

  Seriously though, when is the last time you as a student are worried about
  your results? If you say right now when you are working you need to relax.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we are bound to see the stars and don't you
  dare say I jinxed it lol (#KimiSomu08), looks like the guys are dawning on
  theb stargazing event itself. Hey, it's bad when you have seen the drop but
  let's not think too far into that yet, yes? Let's just talk about what they
  did to make all of this happen first. Thanks to Ukegawa and Nakami but yes
  probably more of the former who is in the student council, their meteor shower
  viewing party is set to go as their application to the school was approved.
  This also means the rooftop is up at night for all to see, kinda important if
  you want to see them stars at night, eh? Hey, many people are in according to
  Ukegawa, more than 50 students from the school have expressed interest in
  dancing below the stars? Let's just say it's probably more of flirting around
  because did you look at how happy Anamizu was after her usual baseball
  practice? Haha don't even ask it's always the best when the minor characters
  get a better time then the main guys in my opinion. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> The guys then
  set out to plan the final steps of the event on the day itself yeah and
  alright spoiler free portion is over, it rained. Real bad. Bad enough the
  cloud aren't clearing anytime soon according to the forecast which isn't even
  accurate in the first place. Welp, next time then. For Nakami though, there is
  no next time. Just like me when I was a kid, people expect things to happen
  once perfectly and never fail, but the reality is hardly such a case. Things
  can happen not going your way, and this is not like we have to do it once or
  we're done haha yeah like a life or death situation, so no this does not
  always have to go one's way. Of course we all know that as a matured, tamed
  audience one and above all these high school students we know to keep calm so
  yeah, Ukegawa knew to leave him alone. But hey, at least Shiromaru-senpai and
  Isaki-chan care. And that's the other thing about things that don't go your
  way: People will be concerned about how you think otherwise. Do you feel
  regret? Do you feel your hard work has all gone into the irrigation system
  which is still holding up in this huge downpour? As Isaki-chan talks alone in
  her radio broadcast all drenched after trying to search for Nakami in the rain
  (lol) which I guess they can't talk to each other directly, it's not all a bed
  of beautiful roses in life. Sometimes the roulette throws up the odd-zeros and
  you lose all your money. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Or maybe you gain something out of this, I
  don't know. Ask Shiromaru-senpai what she saw when you two wet prawn heads
  were alone in that bus stop. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... this episode sucks, I
  guess. Not production bad sucks, just sad. But hey, if being alive has taught
  anyone including me, there's always next time. Also, what is done has been
  done. Efforts are constantly going to waste. I just wasted my morning
  yesterday going to the bank to reset by PIN number just because I actually
  forgot what it is. It happens. What you do is that you learn from the things
  you have done wrong, and since Nakami has done nothing wrong, there's
  LITERALLY nothing to be sad about. Just like Kurashiki-sensei, just treat
  yourself to some hamburger steak and you'll be good once again. Speaking of
  bringing up one's mood, boy and seeing how

  are looking from the Anime's official Twitter account, this is gonna be DOPE
  because damn if Kanikawa's rack did not get you, nothing will. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> See
  you then, eh? Just... don't drop me on the Nakami lore I don't even want to
  know any of it at all lol it just sounds like a story of a wimp haha *points
  at self*
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; This series in a nutshell is basically Isaki-chan in the rain bringing
  the umbrella to Nakami and them both being splashed by the puddle by the road
  in which the car drove by it. Not everything's going to go your way, Nakami.]

  and leave it to fate" Haha Nono-chan I actually like that idea I might do that
  next time when I don't know what I want- Coffee. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> "I (Nakami) can
  detect earthquakes that are only magnitude 1." Haha I foresee your career
  prospects, brother.

  Yeah, you bet I saw that a mile away, Nagisa's name was beside Shiraishi on
  the seating plan in the new year's class. Ah, so troubling that is fate.
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where we welcome the new school year haha man I
  wish we are still at that time of year lol we should have been 3 months ago
  IRL (#KuboSan09), but yeah, things are back to normal again I suppose. And
  when I mean normal, I mean totally normal. Tama-chan and Hazuki are in the
  same class as Kubo-san, Shiraishi is in the same class as Kubo-san... and
  above all, they sit next to each other again. Yeah, basically a highlight to
  start this episode alone, but damn could we not have given a damn because what
  else is new even? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, maybe the aggression is new? I mean,
  Kubo-san did draw the curtains on his window seat. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> No really dude,
  Shiraishi can barely be noticed by the class already we don't need more
  camouflage- Oh, it's for her. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> And I suppose in the new school year
  maaaybe we should be more lax, but going by Shiraishi's experience with
  dealing with the gardening in school (because once again, schools in Japan
  don't hire gardeners or else Sudo-kun's flowerbed will look good too lmao) and
  how much Kubo-san has been noticing him from afar all this while even though
  his efforts of taking care of the plants but not being seen has already become
  the seven wonders of the school lmao this is the new horror series plot we
  just put Shiraishi Junta in as a side character- Wait, how do we know that
  isn't happening already? <span class="emoji" title="😱">*screams*</span> Haha okay jokes over we don't do inception
  lore in this pure romance series. Kubo Nagisa still tries to deny despite
  being interrogated by her sister lol, but yeah suffice it to say this Kubo-san
  here is definitely planning on getting her AND Shiraishi back into the roles
  so they can have some lovey-dovey time together- You don't think so? Yeah
  yeah, wait till the guys start talking about how they also want to pair
  themselves up with a female in any of the class committees. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey, why
  need to plan when you have an aggressive <strike>girlfriend</strike> girl
  friend? Oops, gotta put in the whitespace. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> They are friends, right?
  We don't have to confirm that? Shiraishi? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Oh boy, what's up bros I
  have no friends pleased to be meeting you, Sudo-kun. So in contrast, obviously
  this guy is more visible than literally that one guy in class, and saying that
  he has only talked to him for the first time in a year despite taking care of
  the same flowerbeds as he does is not even a joke anymore, but yeah, also
  probably the rare chance Shiraishi himself gets to talk to other people in
  class because how are you going to approach this dude without even seeing him
  in the first place? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, shout out to Kubo-san helping to spread
  the rumours of Junta-kun being a class playboy lol he actually can be though
  if you think about it but yeah not going that far this is a safe place we
  don't talk about u p s k i r t lmao ANYWAYS Shiraishi, this Kubo-san wants to
  be more than friends to you, so can you just admit already? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Yeah,
  maybe the last part of this week's episode is a good summary to what has been
  going on so far with this series. Lowkey action, plain water lmao I will hit
  Kubo-san with this for spoiling my afternoon drink choice to be honest,
  somewhat social circle and progress, and maybe way better than what you have
  ever experienced. That life, I gotta say Shiraishi, I envy you. Imagine girls
  approaching me? I could never. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> People actually knowing of my
  existence? They only know when I did something wrong or got mad about things
  in class. He is already living it better than I do, I feel like I'm more of
  Sudo-kun than this lucky chap. Oh well, time to change profile picture haha
  Sudo-kun is more relatable to me now

  haha and I think I got it now, both of the A-sides are the Anime credit's
  opening theme songs so no wonder I suppose it's because a change in the plot
  that allowed such a case to exist (within one cour, by the way), but damn did
  they get me without the music video so I just thought of giving them the
  thumbs up, I guess. Yeah, it has been a year since then, a new single AND a
  review of said single. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I did listen to a couple more new songs on my
  days off though, but not like

  did almost get me but I guess not. Maybe still stuck in giving Anison at this
  point, honestly. Also, this backup phone isn't exactly ideal to listen to
  songs on the go now so I'm just glad it can even play whatever is above this
  week lol<br />
  <br />
  Well, not much news on Twitter about music but I can still talk about them,
  many of them being additions to the roster for this month hopefully. I did
  give chance to

  anyways. No, not as in

  if I didn't see this wrongly hopefully a new music release I can use some of
  them now.&nbsp;

  <br />So for next week, looks like we only have voice actress
  <b>Toyota Moe's solo debut mini-album</b> to listen to and this is hoping it
  will appear in music streaming services and if it sucks (lol) or it's not
  there then maybe I'll catch up the rock festival videos- Hey me? THIS is the
  time you do that and not like, when there are new releases up your a-<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Yeah, speaking of Anime next season as mentioned in the intro, and boy did I
  already spend so much time writing my thoughts after watching them, we have,
  you did not see wrongly, FIVE SEQUELS due to air next season. Two action
  series so I wonder if the continuation of

    target="_blank"
    >"Stray Dogs"</a
  >
  can even win my childhood series "BLEACH" lol we mentioned about the latter
  last week, the other two "KanoKari" and "Shinigami Bocchan" are expected and
  both of them especially the latter will easily win the likes of

  which will be taking the short end of this straw poll mainly because according
  to the forums some say the main story has concluded in the first adaptation so
  this is likely more of an OVA feel. So we shall see how ALL of them go while I
  think of a way to stop myself from watching more new shows if they are any
  good ones. Yeah, kinda sad with such an abundance of shows to watch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
  See you next week haha, and until then I shall embrace the only solace I can
  find in my life right now is me hugging my own Kido Ibuki T-shirt haha
  honestly it's great you should try it lol bye

  P.S. The rest of the unimportant stuff in summary because despite the bad
  things here, there are a lot of good things that happened: I hesitated to
  watch

  is, Nyotengu and (not Sakura) Ayane walked into my owner room in DOAXVV which
  is probably the worst haha I did not let Koharu back to her room after she
  dropped by though <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> with Loberia in my room the whole time by the way
  ever since Monday, and I'm still thinking of how to code a relationship chart
  of my fantasies with Japanese voice actresses considering it's hard to even do
  inside a diagram-making web application. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Last one not happening
  anytime soon but I do know Natsukawa Shiina is my younger sister. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Maybe I start writing my fanfic from there haha
