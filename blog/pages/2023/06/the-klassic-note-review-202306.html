  Well we are near the end of the month right now almost a month since this
  single released so I still hope it's relevant haha the only thing relevant is
  the delay and this appearing before the upcoming album lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Hey, and welcome back. Didn't expect this to take this long, this could not
  have been part 2 for May since this released the last day of that month, so we
  are doing it the following month. Just, you know, didn't say when to do it so
  I might as well go on a shopping spree for a month, yes? Not like I can apply
  for the special bonus with the paper INSIDE of the CD, isn't it? Ironically
  it's longer though, 2 weeks long compared to the weekend of release date
  normally haha someone's being generous over here? No point I guess lmao
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  If you do not understand anything I said above that's fine, because I hope you
  like Anime songs!! It has been a while since I talked about more considering
  this is so typical of that genre, so let's!

  (Well, thanks for not close-up anyways, not like the 3 of them can fit in
  close enough but the Regular Edition is coming up tops as usual)
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Origin: Well well, what have we got here? If you would recall of Anime group
  trio TrySail from last year, we have once again chanced upon an Anime release
  I would love to talk about, though less relevant as I did not watch the
  series, but at the least I know them well. Specifically of the girls in this
  idol group from MusicRay'n though, we should be familiar with voice actresses
  (from left to right of cover art) Natsukawa Shiina in yellow, Asakura Momo in
  pink and Amamiya Sora in blue, where they display their cutest and/or coolest
  for Anime and beyond. This time around, thanks to the gamer-oriented Anime
  series they were credited for, and ironically featured in its two opening
  theme songs thus the call for a double A-side release, they are here to convey
  the transition between the alternate world's game addiction to potential
  immersion and even confession in the loveliest way possible.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) Karei One Turn [Gorgeous One Turn]</div>
<div>From first verse:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    "Stress (is a) big enemy! (Let's eat) chocolate, potato chips, beef bowl (to
    destress)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    Piling up mouthfuls for motivation!... Also blew away the sense of guilt
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (I have) done it again... Oh well whatever"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>
  This should get the attention of many on the first time you hear it, but for
  my case maybe it's really me understanding the lyrics too well, but the gamer
  talk in the lyrics about SSR and turns and levelling up sure is aggravating as
  it is also super relevant to the Anime credit it was in, so I cannot even
  complain to say the least. I ended up liking the pop beats in this song, the
  melody is better than the Anime usual which is nice, their usual fast tempo in
  singing is also exhibited here among other things from the different
  vocalists, it's overall a nice song to listen to. If you don't even get the
  lyrics then all the more this will appeal to you, not to say the appeal of the
  Anime series to the young masses in the first place. The music video expands
  this even further, making the girls look their part for the credit. Girl
  gamers, but cuter.

</div>
<div>Rating: Playfully Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(2) Follow You!</div>
<div>From main chorus:</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">"Oh My God!</div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    (Am I) not cute at all, sorry for being too strong pulling (you) away
  </div>

    This is (a) misunderstanding... no, correct answer because (our) combined
    answer is the future; Follow You!"
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div>
  As usual, the other side is probably what got me more into this release in the
  first place. On first impression, this is definitely a more palatable piece,
  with a simpler melody despite a longer bridge part which is typical, and more
  relevant lyrics as the Anime takes a turn for romance in the second half of
  the series, changing the mood from hyper to somewhat sweet even romantic, and
  I can't stop saying nice things about it in the lyrics. I guess listening to
  this over time, I can never get over the extra notes on every other line of
  the melody which is typical of Anime songs today to distinguish themselves
  apart, but I still think this is a decent song that I will like over time. The
  lyrics just sing to me of someone who desire company I assume with relation to
  playing video games, but still. It's something to be embarrassed about, and
  that is what makes of a good love song, isn't it?
</div>
<div>Rating: Lovingly Below Average</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Conclusion: This is quite a single I have heard from TrySail for quite a
  while, last time being exactly a year ago with an Anime that I watched. Even
  then, this single delivers in its unique message of gamer talk with cute girl
  singing voices, so it will appeal to the male audience much easier than ever
  despite not being under a strong Anime series credit. If you aren't interested
  in the Anime like me, then this is still a wonderful single, combining all the
  hype about pop songs and adding some spice into it, this is easily a
  recommendation to listen to outside from the mainstream.

  (I sound harsh, isn't it? Haha I gotta say initial impressions aren't great so
  I'm writing that out. A month later though... I actually love these songs
  because they are so different from everything I'm listening this month
  already, I cannot ask for anything better <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Unrelated you think my

<div>
  In addition, and since I hinted (lol) in the intro I will explain in detail
  here, normally (because it's related to MusicRay'n) they would rather prefer
  you to pre-order the releases, get them shipped to you within the week from
  the release date of Tuesday which is one day before the actual referred to as
  "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/furage" target="_blank">Flag</a>
  Day", and because the application window is smaller it's meant to target these
  fans, but I assume maybe considering this is a end of month release and they
  are being generous(?), the application window has been extended to one month
  later ie. end of the month ie. a day after this review, so I'm lucky to have
  caught on. I just wish I can win something over here I opted for the bromide
  set because see previous post lmao because damn I will never hang a huge
  poster in my room *looks at Moeshi calendar* nor do I need a
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/to-tobakku" target="_blank">tote bag</a> for
  anything else since I literally bought one- It's nice to have constraints,
  huh. Well, for bromides there is no limit I'll buy as many photo albums to
  house them <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span>

  Well, that's all. Hopefully I will spend more time on this blog today and
  tomorrow (that table on the previous post took me a lot of time tbh) to also
  push out more posts for Klassic Note I have one more #KN15YEARS post I want to
  do, and then we will dive into the new season of Anime this weekend!
