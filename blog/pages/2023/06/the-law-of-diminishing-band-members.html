Let's find out together in another #KN15YEARS post!</div><div><br></div><div>So hey! Welcome back. I thought of a great idea I've been experiencing recently, and I wished I thought of this earlier writing the earlier posts, so maybe I should talk about it now after all. I know we are technically done with this so far but continuing from the posts earlier this year, I feel like I can slot this in so relevant, I sometimes wonder why this eventually is the case.</div><div><br></div><div>Heck, still better than full bands disbanding amirite fellas??? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>A BAND BEING TOGETHER</div><div>So, in case you don't know what music bands and/or groups are, let me fill you in. I'll talk more about how they function, because compared to a solo artist, <b>these guys obviously do not get the full cut of the pay check</b> if they were to try to keep themselves alive, such as with indie bands, and most of them will still be <b>doing regular jobs apart from having this side job</b>. As you <b>progress to major music labels</b>, your pay check I assume should be more stable no matter the number of members you have in your gang, but in this case, with the power of major label breathing down your neck, you are *sometimes* <b>compelled to do things different from your usual style</b> which has its pros and cons, like when you have to write for an Anime or drama series. Still, we cannot deny that this is at least how bands function today in Japan, and that can only means better things going on... or does it? </div><div><br><br></div><div>WHY THE MEMBERS KEEP LEAVING</div><div>I like to think many a times, members keep leaving ate due to a couple of factors, so let me explain. Firstly, <b>moving to a major music label</b>. Yep, what makes them grow is also potentially their own poison. If you have been a keen ear for music following artists from when they were indie to their success, one would realize no matter how subtle that change is, that bands will transit into being more song production-focused instead of  song writing-focused, meaning that quality of any song may not matter that much as long as we can slap a electronic programmer or wind orchestra into the set. You may think this is making the music better, but one can easily notice why this is not relevant for example on rock bands when they don't bring the whole accompanying instrument team to the next rock festival, the song won't sound as good anymore. And that can be a drug in itself; what makes the song better also makes it feel cheaper and less representative of the band's style. But of course, this is not talking about everyone as bands like SHE'S and Ryokuoushoku Shakai make good use of their transition to major label, making them excel. But for occult styles like LILI LIMIT, I'm afraid that might even be a block as they struggle to find an audience to associate or just deviate from their unique style trying to.</div><div><br></div><div>Next, there's <b>the diminishing returns idea</b>. Let's assume for a moment, that bands are essentially based on one person, a single composer and producer. *looks at FINLANDS* <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> To add more to the band means paying more for the same production level unless you totally do not deal with other instruments or musicians involved with the production of such material (look at the back of the booklet of any physical release to find out more) in which will function well as a full-fledged band, but that also means they can be replaceable at any time feeling their lesser in importance, for example when Chatmonchy had to deal with their drummer leaving as they switch roles and instruments all around and also collaborating with other bands to make their music happen. And with the music trends moving and changing over time, older bands tend to fade away due to lack of popularity, and that is normally a time where bands will think of whether to move on, whether they have the backing of major label or not, which is what I assume is the reason for my beloved 2000s band Aqua Timez.</div><div><br></div><div>Then, there's the <b>personal reasons</b>. A lot of the band members that just chose to leave - especially if they aren't even doing as well and that is a metric we won't know unless we are them - to focus on their personal life, whether it's another career or just family, such as with Ikimonogakari's "secondary" composer and producer Yamashita-san, AILA's departure which led to the end of Lil'B, and Tokyo Karan Koron on their mom-to-be female vocalist. Remember, we just never saw the above, we only know of this reason just because.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>HOW IT AFFECTS BANDS</div><div>At least in Klassic Note, we have seen many take a variety of rather predictive approaches including and not a complete list of the following:</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Use of "non-organic" methods to change music production/display<li>Replace with new members<li>Downsize or even disband</ul></div><div>As I mentioned earlier, <b>music production scaling</b> is always just a trap in itself, and I don't think it's just because band members leave that this will ramp up, and it can also be because of this ramping up that will make the music not as good as the members would have wanted, but considering music production decision normally is down to a few people *sometimes* not involving all the band members themselves I have no idea on this, then maybe that it what it will take to make the music the same quality as before or better, if that is to be heard by the audience in due time.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Replacement of new members</b> is normally the easiest way to do so if the band has their own acquaintances, such as with the revolving cast with ORESKABAND and their brass members due to their niche Ska genre which isn't popular in Japan but is overseas, and the members of VELTPUNCH changing each other album apart from the two main vocalists which are producers and composers themselves. Also worth mentioning are how KANA-BOON dealt with the... erratic behaviour of their missing bassist, how HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR had to try again for a few more years with a new female vocalist and eventually stopped a few years later, and basically every other idol group because they are as replaceable as paper cups in a pantry since they don't have the "band" aesthetic which is why maybe I should not talk about these cases.</div><div><br></div><div>And if they can't do any of the above due to lack of support from major label, bands can also choose to <b>live with lesser band members on their team</b>, typically compensating by doing lesser instrumentals in their songs or multitasking as percussions can be more diverse and one can technically do without certain levels of instruments in a song, but that is song production talk. SpecialThanks sit on the streets of Akihabara today to live with two members despite being four-member band just a couple of years ago. In more extreme cases though, bands like Yogee New Waves may choose to <b>go on hiatus to re-evaluate their position</b> after their guitarist left which might as well lead to their disbandment but let's not say for sure. Or as they snowball, the dissociation of Kalafina producer Kajiura-sensei also gave opportunity for their 3 singing members to leave the group and pursue their solo music careers which, once again, gave them more freedom (and money) to choose the style they want to achieve and not be stuck with their previous self, even if it's not going to be as popular as they are before.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, there are <b>exceptions to this change</b>, such as with rock "band" FINLANDS with the vocalist and producer Fuyuko-san holding down the helm along with her solo artist career, so what else is there to say about these? Some are also inevitable in its nature, with the first in Klassic Note being the departure of Kuso Iinkai's vocalist and producer (RIP) bringing the band to an abrupt end and with no other decision to make. Holding on to the craft is as hard as you think it is, people. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>As I continue to pray for the survival of bands such as Cocoro Auction and nano.RIPE, I cannot help but think of how much smaller they will get because all they wanted is to make more music, or whether just like ORESKABAND and Base Ball Bear, they will have to downsize their members in order to fulfil something bigger than themselves. But I can only be more optimistic on whatever their decision may be, that is to preserve or continue on the genre or unique style of music they so love and enjoy making and playing. Hopefully by then we do not have to deal with Suchmos' unfortunate end before we even get interested in them so that inversely, we can help to promote their music to those who care.</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#KN15YEARS">KN15YEARS</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
