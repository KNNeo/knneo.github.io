<div>In Economics, The Law of Diminishing Returns states that:</div>
<div>
  <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
    ...profits or benefits gained from something will represent a proportionally
    smaller gain as more money or energy is invested in it.
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div>
  I wonder if this is similar with musical bands? Let's find out together in
  another #KN15YEARS post!
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  So hey! Welcome back. I thought of a great idea I've been experiencing
  recently, and I wished I thought of this earlier writing the earlier posts, so
  maybe I should talk about it now after all. I know we are technically done
  with this so far but continuing from the posts earlier this year, I feel like
  I can slot this in so relevant, I sometimes wonder why this eventually is the
  case.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Heck, still better than full bands disbanding amirite fellas??? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A BAND BEING TOGETHER</div>
<div>
  So, in case you don't know what music bands and/or groups are, let me fill you
  in. I'll talk more about how they function, because compared to a solo artist,
  <b>these guys obviously do not get the full cut of the pay check</b> if they
  were to try to keep themselves alive, such as with indie bands, and most of
  them will still be <b>doing regular jobs apart from having this side job</b>.
  As you <b>progress to major music labels</b>, your pay check I assume should
  be more stable no matter the number of members you have in your gang, but in
  this case, with the power of major label breathing down your neck, you are
  *sometimes*
  <b>compelled to do things different from your usual style</b> which has its
  pros and cons, like when you have to write for an Anime or drama series.
  Still, we cannot deny that this is at least how bands function today in Japan,
  and that can only means better things going on... or does it?&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /><br /></div>
<div>WHY THE MEMBERS KEEP LEAVING</div>
<div>
  I like to think many a times, members keep leaving ate due to a couple of
  factors, so let me explain. Firstly, <b>moving to a major music label</b>.
  Yep, what makes them grow is also potentially their own poison. If you have
  been a keen ear for music following artists from when they were indie to their
  success, one would realize no matter how subtle that change is, that bands
  will transit into being more song production-focused instead of&nbsp; song
  writing-focused, meaning that quality of any song may not matter that much as
  long as we can slap a electronic programmer or wind orchestra into the set.
  You may think this is making the music better, but one can easily notice why
  this is not relevant for example on rock bands when they don't bring the whole
  accompanying instrument team to the next rock festival, the song won't sound
  as good anymore. And that can be a drug in itself; what makes the song better
  also makes it feel cheaper and less representative of the band's style. But of
  course, this is not talking about everyone as bands like SHE'S and
  Ryokuoushoku Shakai make good use of their transition to major label, making
  them excel. But for occult styles like LILI LIMIT, I'm afraid that might even
  be a block as they struggle to find an audience to associate or just deviate
  from their unique style trying to.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Next, there's <b>the diminishing returns idea</b>. Let's assume for a moment,
  that bands are essentially based on one person, a single composer and
  producer. *looks at FINLANDS* <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> To add more to the band means paying
  more for the same production level unless you totally do not deal with other
  instruments or musicians involved with the production of such material (look
  at the back of the booklet of any physical release to find out more) in which
  will function well as a full-fledged band, but that also means they can be
  replaceable at any time feeling their lesser in importance, for example when
  Chatmonchy had to deal with their drummer leaving as they switch roles and
  instruments all around and also collaborating with other bands to make their
  music happen. And with the music trends moving and changing over time, older
  bands tend to fade away due to lack of popularity, and that is normally a time
  where bands will think of whether to move on, whether they have the backing of
  major label or not, which is what I assume is the reason for my beloved 2000s
  band Aqua Timez.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Then, there's the <b>personal reasons</b>. A lot of the band members that just
  chose to leave - especially if they aren't even doing as well and that is a
  metric we won't know unless we are them - to focus on their personal life,
  whether it's another career or just family, such as with Ikimonogakari's
  "secondary" composer and producer Yamashita-san, AILA's departure which led to
  the end of Lil'B, and Tokyo Karan Koron on their mom-to-be female vocalist.
  Remember, we just never saw the above, we only know of this reason just
  because.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>HOW IT AFFECTS BANDS</div>
<div>
  At least in Klassic Note, we have seen many take a variety of rather
  predictive approaches including and not a complete list of the following:
</div>
<div>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Use of "non-organic" methods to change music production/display</li>
    <li>Replace with new members</li>
    <li>Downsize or even disband</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  As I mentioned earlier, <b>music production scaling</b> is always just a trap
  in itself, and I don't think it's just because band members leave that this
  will ramp up, and it can also be because of this ramping up that will make the
  music not as good as the members would have wanted, but considering music
  production decision normally is down to a few people *sometimes* not involving
  all the band members themselves I have no idea on this, then maybe that it
  what it will take to make the music the same quality as before or better, if
  that is to be heard by the audience in due time.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <b>Replacement of new members</b> is normally the easiest way to do so if the
  band has their own acquaintances, such as with the revolving cast with
  ORESKABAND and their brass members due to their niche Ska genre which isn't
  popular in Japan but is overseas, and the members of VELTPUNCH changing each
  other album apart from the two main vocalists which are producers and
  composers themselves. Also worth mentioning are how KANA-BOON dealt with
  the... erratic behaviour of their missing bassist, how HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR
  had to try again for a few more years with a new female vocalist and
  eventually stopped a few years later, and basically every other idol group
  because they are as replaceable as paper cups in a pantry since they don't
  have the "band" aesthetic which is why maybe I should not talk about these
  cases.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  And if they can't do any of the above due to lack of support from major label,
  bands can also choose to <b>live with lesser band members on their team</b>,
  typically compensating by doing lesser instrumentals in their songs or
  multitasking as percussions can be more diverse and one can technically do
  without certain levels of instruments in a song, but that is song production
  talk. SpecialThanks sit on the streets of Akihabara today to live with two
  members despite being four-member band just a couple of years ago. In more
  extreme cases though, bands like Yogee New Waves may choose to
  <b>go on hiatus to re-evaluate their position</b> after their guitarist left
  which might as well lead to their disbandment but let's not say for sure. Or
  as they snowball, the dissociation of Kalafina producer Kajiura-sensei also
  gave opportunity for their 3 singing members to leave the group and pursue
  their solo music careers which, once again, gave them more freedom (and money)
  to choose the style they want to achieve and not be stuck with their previous
  self, even if it's not going to be as popular as they are before.
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Of course, there are <b>exceptions to this change</b>, such as with rock
  "band" FINLANDS with the vocalist and producer Fuyuko-san holding down the
  helm along with her solo artist career, so what else is there to say about
  these? Some are also inevitable in its nature, with the first in Klassic Note
  being the departure of Kuso Iinkai's vocalist and producer (RIP) bringing the
  band to an abrupt end and with no other decision to make. Holding on to the
  craft is as hard as you think it is, people.&nbsp;
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <div><br /></div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  As I continue to pray for the survival of bands such as Cocoro Auction and
  nano.RIPE, I cannot help but think of how much smaller they will get because
  all they wanted is to make more music, or whether just like ORESKABAND and
  Base Ball Bear, they will have to downsize their members in order to fulfil
  something bigger than themselves. But I can only be more optimistic on
  whatever their decision may be, that is to preserve or continue on the genre
  or unique style of music they so love and enjoy making and playing. Hopefully
  by then we do not have to deal with Suchmos' unfortunate end before we even
  get interested in them so that inversely, we can help to promote their music
  to those who care.
