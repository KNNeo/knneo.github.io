Well, I slept all week so maybe ask me if I got any SSRs in DOAXVV this week.
<span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Answer is yes, by the way. Last week's dry streak is bad haha
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Anyhow, I'm taking meds, so I'll do this with minimum effort which is as usual
  my best effort so don't mind if I don't do long writeups because I really
  should not but this is how I get over not speaking about all of this to myself
  (with my now sore throat) and my mom thinking that I'm weird. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Maybe
  I do YouTube reaction videos lol
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Trust me, this month is going to end with a bang and it's not the next season
  Anime listings lol dammit, and then maybe we will get back to talking about...
  whatever we used to talk about 3 years ago haha I looked back at the blog
  posts and I can only cringe that much dude lmao maybe I should
  <strike>edit out</strike> standardize those posts from then on <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span><br />

      "How much do you study to get in, Student Council President?" Oh this
      joker? He probably got in with his parents' relations with the school lmao
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  Nepotism amirite, fellas? #NotMyPresident Haha someone is going to mistake
  that and think we are talking about countries here but WE KNOW Takamine should
  be leading this school body. In this new episode where the school festival is
  finally kicking off (#SkiLo11), yeah Day 1 is great. Day 1 is fantastic,
  everyone had a great time. Not much to say about Day 2 though- Oops. <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span>
  Anyways haha, the school festival started, and Mitsumi enjoyed the festivities
  doing student council stuff I bet, the President is getting his buff up so
  high we can't see him above the clouds no more lol I guess encouraging people
  to join the high school is also important so he is the image of that, the main
  girl quickly realized (not Takamine by the way she can hold her own lol) that
  she doesn't have friends to visit her. Well, not like she doesn't have
  friends, but coming from the countryside it's hardly likely to call upon her
  whole village just to come to her high school festival, yes? Never mind, I can
  live with that haha speaking from personal experience <span class="emoji" title="😢">*sob*</span> lol but of course
  not thinking this way, we have Yuzuki from the Art Club who also is
  experiencing something similar to Mitsumi. And trust me, no number of males
  hitting her with their mouths and eyes blind on her artwork she drew of her
  pet dog will cover for that. So yeah, I guess these two can hang out together.
  I mean,
  <strike>Kurume</strike> Makoto over here did cover for her newly-found friend
  in front of her middle school buddies by introducing her importance in her
  life so that's rad, that's what friends are for, really. Or unless you share
  stuff you can't say out loud. I mean, my bro and I share many things in common
  but I won't tell people about tits- MOVING ON haha, Yuzuki also knew this
  social circle she got in high school who doesn't judge her image is so good,
  and I guess this hits on Mitsumi too, isn't it? Yeah, such a great time, also
  the appeal of this series by the way. Next up, I was like, Kanechika when are
  you appearing and here he is! Haha also Shima-kun rather talk to girls than
  talk to you. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Jumping into Day 2 after a super successful Day 1 haha
  yes the musical from Mitsumi's class is a success, but of course not as cool
  as Kanechika's Drama Club performance which I hope did not remind Shima about
  his childhood or anything lol but what is with that long distance stare, maybe
  we introduce some of the new guys who are appearing in the school for the
  festivities. Firstly, the mom's here. Shima-kun's. Well, stepmom, don't judge.
  Also, this Keiri-kun. No guesses who he is, but damn he has a brave front for
  a 3-year-old. So brave, it only falls apart seeing his family. Yes, in front
  of his stepbrother. Really, knowing how to get to the next place of meeting
  even when you are lost? This guy is such a chad you wish you were this smart
  at 3. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, circumstances made him appear alone in the classroom as
  Shima is out and the mother is trying to find him, so the class helped out.
  Our boi immediately got called in sadly before his review to Kanechika-senpai
  haha we can do that another time, and the mother did get in contact with the
  student council which Mitsumi, who was smart enough to notice the keychain on
  the kid's bag, was able to get the family back together safely. That is of
  course, not without its problems. Hey, if everyone in the family is nice,
  guess who's the bad guy? Wrong guesses only- The stepmom is the villain.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... wow I love this episode already. I love it so much, not
  that I don't want this series to end trust me I want things to end I hate
  sequels lol, but I love this episode so much because next episode to end the
  series is going to be ROUGH!! <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> I'm already <span class="emoji" title="🤮">*pukes*</span> at this I can't
  even recover myself, I better keep all this to myself until I really have to
  bang my table or cry just like Keiri-kun did. Maybe then, maybe, we will get a
  slap across someone's face. Whose one will it be? You gotta see it for
  yourself. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> (I have no idea of the plot by the way, this is just
  skeptical drama prediction here)

  Hey, remember what I said last week about that mechanic Nakiri-san missing
  from the action? We found her alright. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where all
  the budget for the camp went to the food and that marriage video footage
  voiced by Kaname lmao (#ToniKawaS211), man, shout out to the intern who edited
  the video by the way, from the animation studio? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Also, did Nasa-kun
  even try to find the wife- Hold on hold on, maybe we start off with addressing
  EVERYTHING that is wrong with that montage video. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well firstly, has
  it been 2 years already? Or is that a fictional thing? Oh maybe the downtime
  but I mean, it's also 2 years since the Anime's airing so quite timely I would
  think, yeah, it has been a while. And yeah, without any wedding or reception
  of any sort? I mean, over here even registration for marriage has some small
  reception for witnesses who gathered, so uh, yeah, about time I guess. It's
  probably what old hag Tokiko (lol) thought so, so she brought the kids out
  onto a stage she prepared, did some montage video to not make this look like
  they have no history and this is some shotgun wedding lmao (you don't want to
  know, the latter case), and get Kaname to be the host of this special
  occasion! Easy, isn't it? Yeah, Tokiko just coughed up the money, not that
  hard after all. Still, Kaname did put in a lot of effort, huh. Remember she
  was to join everyone later? What do you think she was doing down the mountain?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah, carrying the wedding cake from below all the way up here? BRUH.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, she and Nakiri probably prepared most of this in advance,
  and shout out to Nasa-kun playing his part because Tsukasa won't either way,
  and yeah, gotta thank the guests for putting up with his speeches of the stars
  at night haha, because I'm pretty sure the others are more keen on fireworks
  that Tsukasa prepared beforehand. We also got to know more of the lore too.
  Yeah, <i>the</i> lore, of why it took 2 years for Tsukasa to honour her
  promise to Nasa-kun in the first place. So yeah, no surprises, all Tokiko's
  fault- Oh that's all they are going to share?? GODDAMMIT WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT
  THE OPENING THEME ANIMATION- Moving on haha I guess sequel bait is precisely
  what is incoming, but Nasa-kun had a general idea. I mean, I have a general
  idea too but can we have a flashback of what happened in those 2 years?
  <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I guess not, huh. They really gonna end it like this? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> What
  the heck. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... uh, you think they did it on the bed?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, right? I mean, there's the surveillance cameras and everything.
  Old hag probably had the recording going to she can watch it the next morning-
  HAHA okay let's talk about marriage. It's hard. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Not boner hard
  thankfully lmao, but it's a lot of responsibility, don't you think? In
  retrospect, and let's not talk about the entertainment industry where people
  don't care, let's say us commoners care, we find someone who we love and we
  can spend the rest of our lives together through anything... well hopefully
  all good and not bad but who knows, and yeah it's a promise as old as
  civilization itself. But of course, all this bullsh*t talk is obviously not in
  the case for Nasa-kun because I mean, he just said yes after getting rammed
  and saved by a woman. I would also say yes to that woman if I were him and
  she's single. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> But for Tsukasa... maybe this was it. Maybe it was 2
  years of her dealing with this and the fact that maybe we will have a sequel
  to this because THIS IS HOW THEY DECIDE TO END?? <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Oh well, all's well is
  well, I suppose. Not like Chitose can stop them from being together already
  even the elder is giving them their blessings haha
</div>
<div>
  [TL:DR; "They want to believe. That is nothing else, their love lasts
  forever." I legit thought Tsukasa will say the lines of assurance and company
  till the end but this works too]

  Okay guys you know I'm going to make jokes about the voice behind Isaki's
  sister so just, just let me do it, dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this new episode where
  hell yeah club trip (#KimiSomu10), don't forget it's for a photo of the stars
  for the contest, just do you know. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Boy, and this is just the intro.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Hey, we already know this is a good time but
  <i>not as good as the beach episode last week</i> so tone it down, please.
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> So yeah, we start the trip to Kanazawa. For starters, we are
  introduced to the two families of the couple (hehe) because you know, gotta
  get permission from both sides parents so these two can
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha" target="_blank">flirt together</a>
  alone- Anyways haha I highly doubt this will be anywhere close to that, but we
  get a simple overview of the two sides in case you need a recap. Nakami's
  single father family is worried the kid doesn't ask anything back from the
  parent mainly because of the loss of the mother lol I don't want to peek in
  too much but damn this sounds dark, and Magari's family... Isaki has a sister,
  in case you don't know so far. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hayai" target="_blank">Haya</a>, they call
  her; Fast enough to the action, fast enough to notice this guy Nakami is
  probably someone special in her sister's life right now, and probably fast
  enough to realize her position in the family to recall the stuff she did in
  sacrifice to this poor girl who had eaten all the family's budget to stay
  alive by years of surgery and hospital stays so much so we can't give the poor
  first child a proper childhood. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, is that good enough of a
  summary? I sure hope so, can't stop feeling bad for Haya-san here anyways.
  Also, isn't life better when you can get your sibling up and we all go as a
  family? It's just not as great going to the amusement park together when
  there's only single child and parent. Uh... <span class="emoji" title="😬">*cringe*</span> Haha moving on, besides
  hearing it from Haya-san herself, at least Nakami is listening in well to
  Shiromaru's advice about taking photos in general, because man, is getting
  someone interested in photography nowadays such a task I would hardly call my
  sis with a DSLR a photographer AND DON'T YOU DARE SAY INSTAGRAMMERS ARE
  PHOTOGRAPHERS they only are when they run a company under their name and hire
  people to do it for them lmao, but yeah Shiromaru-senpai be like "touch some
  grass, bro" to Nakami but he don't get it, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really, spend some
  time with the girl too, is probably her advice overall. You know,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/seishun" target="_blank">youth</a>, they
  call it. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Speaking of which,
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">onee-san</a> has
  her boyfriend to catch up too so somehow I feel sad already lmao, so finally
  they are alone together in the old abode where the nearest thing is a shrine
  and a bus stop so uh... we doin' it? I mean, she sister gave you the high
  five, bro. You can do whatever is necessary to her sister now- All in all, can
  confirm, Nakami Ganta likes black-haired women. Because SAME DUDE <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I
  mean, we got giving the sis a chance though?? COME ON haha I mean, I will if
  I'm that reliable as this future brother-in-law. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But hey, am I wrong
  though? As much as we have seen so far, how much Isaki-chan has been showered
  with all the love even in a rather hostile environment far from her
  childhood... For that, I agree with the Haya-san, Nakami here has been doing a
  good job inside out. For Isaki, I think it's easy to say at least on this side
  of the family hehe, all is well goes well. Now that this is put aside, let's
  see what will the ending going forth. I guess Nakami's story also Kurashiki
  has a sense of what is happening now, and Isaki... let's just say she is the
  luckiest girl ever. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> I'm not because she did not appear in my life...
  or did she? Haha let's not say for sure haha we have 2 more episodes to go by
  the way

  Man, imagine waiting for a new movie to come out. Hey, DC/Marvel fans. Getting
  bored yet? <span class="emoji" title="😎">*dabs*</span> Hey I wish I can make a case for me with the Animal Crossing
  game two years ago but you can't get me now haha, but for this new episode
  (#KuboSan11) we can get around with Shiraishi I guess. So, about the movie.
  Oh, not the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/henshin" target="_blank"
    >henchin</a
  >" one that Seita-kun liked? Dammit. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Anyhow, not like Kubo-san here
  is crazy about it but she is keen on the series but not to the extent of just
  watching it herself, so might as well watch with her boi. You see where this
  is going here? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> It's just the perfect plan. And you get to go to the
  cinema by train too? Somehow I hate city life haha mine's just a couple of bus
  stops away lol. Well, gotta meet up with your girl and take the train is
  obviously such a great experience, but I feel like in this series it's even
  more accented by the fact that Shiraishi is basically taking up space
  considering no one noticed he was there, could not be more slim to not stay in
  direct contact with his girl, is just holding the fort for her against
  everyone else squeezing on the train car. See? All this push-up training is
  paying off now bro you can hold yourself up to the train door without hitting
  on Kubo-san... Wait,
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >wrong Anime</a
  >? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Even if it was just for one train stop, I can believe that felt
  like hell. Also, Kubo-san didn't like, you know, pull his boi over to help him
  out and that would have been- So wait, no
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu" target="_blank">skinship</a>?
  BUT DAMMIT THAT WAS OUR BEST CHANCE!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, what you gonna expect,
  this is <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kyun" target="_blank">kyun</a> Anime
  where we don't touch each other after all. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Moving on haha, they then
  realized, another reality check right here, that reserving the seats might be
  better (if they want to sit together hehe) since the screening up next will be
  filled unless they want to sit separate to each other but we know a certain
  Kubo-san will not let that happen so... we can hang around by then! <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
  Yeah, imagine if Shiraishi hit the fastest timing and they sit separate seats?
  <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I know right, this is not real. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also not real is what is
  evolving into effectively their first date as Shiraishi blocks off guys who
  want to
  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/nanpa" target="_blank">pick up</a> on his
  girl (lol not really they didn't notice him), go around looking at clothes
  (haha did Shiraishi just stare at a mannequin longer than the girl beside

  your friends and/or family say you are too young to drink coffee at high
  school. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> You want to know when I started drinking coffee? Haha I guess
  nobody, huh. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But yeah, out of courtesy and not killing any humans'
  impressions about this beloved bean in the process, I'll tell her to go for
  the sweetest coffee on the menu: Latte. If you can't even that please don't
  ever mention that word again. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Also, coffee is about preference, dear
  lady. So don't force yourself. I speak from experience. And thus, Shiraishi
  went to get the creamer and sugar for the black coffee. Yep. Shiraishi's my
  bro now. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We got a little gift for Seita-kun courtesy of his future
  sister-in-law with the lucky draws lmao, and they watched the movie which was
  better than all the people watching the movie itself. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean, you
  would say that if you watched an animated movie from a series you loved. All
  in all, man, Kubo Nagisa sure is a desperate b*tch. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No really though,
  if you thought shame was our fantasies for this series, wait till you see the
  grin on Kubo-san's face. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> What the Takagi-san series should have
  been. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean seriously man, for a first date? This ain't too bad at
  all. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay why am I the one grinning on this hehe but hey, win-win
  series, amirite fellas? Also, bro, how can you be so relaxed about it?? Haha,
  someday someone will be interested in my opinions.

  from a couple of months ago, I refused to give anything from their Rock tunes
  for some reason. I don't know why. Maybe it's the fever (lol) that is running

  thought through Kanno Mai's recommendation yesterday that somewhat

  is the band's first week of self covers with their new vocalist YOSUKE if you

  most popular song featured here, is that "the coolness is still there, but the
  ecstasy is missing" and I can't iterate over that more. I don't know, give him
  new songs to sing and we shall see.

  so those will be a change to whatever 80s melodies I'll be bombarded with. In
  consolation though, at least I will be attuned to listening "better" melodies

    >Kanno Mai</a
  >. Yes, as a love interest. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Damn, I don't know. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I LEGIT DO
  NOT KNOW I feel like I know MaiMai a lot but know she is under a veil of
  deception (especially in makeup lol) but I hardly even know Saya-chan that
  much considering the only thing I watch her live is that one fortnightly on
  Tuesdays... which was cancelled this week because she wasn't feeling well.
  Same dude. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Okay then,

  haha) I know, maybe I should catch up (or even pay) to watch her other
  streams- Yes, that's how they get me with idolism now. Single money avenues
  are overrated, man. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Anyways, see you guys next time no point talking
  about my headache as I type this and it's not because I'm thinking of girls
  lmao, but ending the month we do have a lot of birthdays coming up and my
  replacement phone is still nowhere to be seen so... I guess I'll live with new
  wallpapers but in a 2015 phone then haha see you then where things will get
  better! I hope lol I did get a SSR this week on DOAXVV so that's a sign
