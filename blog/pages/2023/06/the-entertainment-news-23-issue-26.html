Wow okay I now actually realized how much a blog sitemap might be important
after trying it out on the GitHub clone yesterday because most of the reference
images I grab for the next season Anime preview is basically using that page to
search for the episodes I'm referring to after the recent update on all
Entertainment News posts back till 2018. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Maybe I do a sitemap for this
main blog too haha this is main by the way
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Speaking of such, still hard at work fixing the posts from here on as
  migrating to another new space may soon be deemed impossible or even
  unnecessary due to the closure of Album Archive which is the easiest way to
  look at images of blog posts for me, moreover making me care less of moving
  also because the imported posts on the new site is getting flagged even though
  it contains no rated images and/or text. So... maybe we stay here from now on
  lol

        story which effectively concluded according to the Anime community so
        what else is there to offer? In this second season though, looks like
        they are picking snippets of their high school days and maybe beyond for
        all the characters, and talking about what happened in between, maybe
        more. We are welcomed back with a fantastic cast from main girl

        *ack*) because remember the last time the mom said the main guy is to
        find a cure before the following year spring or else leadership of the
        family will pass on from the mother to the 2nd son *ack* (haha) Walter
        and I guess Bocchan himself still can't marry Alice for the same reason,
        that curse of physical contact. So yeah, hopefully we will get somewhere
        with this series and not Walter romancing a woman lol why but yeah,
        can't wait for more

        holding the final page of the book so the world doesn't collapse to
        ruin. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> If this even piques you just a bit you can give it a
        chance because damn is this by far still the next best action series I'm
        interested in the 15 years I watched Anime after "BLEACH". Says a lot
        about this literary author name-based human-extension-of-power series
        since it aired in 2016 but hey, I guess I like this more than the
        average viewer, who knows.

      Oh wow that's it, huh. Also, super long writeup again. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean,
      having to deal with (for me) record-breaking FIVE sequels this upcoming
      season is already a pain, and I have a couple of series I'm interested
      including AN ACTION SERIES?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> I need to reconsider my weekends

    Oh yeah, it's sad time. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Hey, as much as I don't want to see this,
    we gotta move on, me. In this final episode of a lovely series I would
    recommend my sis to watch (#SkiLo12), I think the only thing I got out of
    this is... Can't we reflect on the
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/minikui" target="_blank">ugly</a> past as
    we see the beautiful present? Hey, Ririka-san? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Hey F**K YOU,
    understand? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Now that I got the venting out of the way, let's talk
    about Shima's mother. She's scared. Well, she's scared after being scared
    off by Ririka-san so I think that's not on her but this b*tch Ririka- We
    need an abbreviation for this woman I'm going to mention her a lot. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>
    I like to believe the mom reflected on her own actions after being relieved
    from the stress that is marriage and still be proud that his son can finally
    live his own life once again... until this Ririka had to remind her about
    the past. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Can we just erase this woman, really? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> No, not the
    mom, we still need someone to take care of Keiri-kun. Anyways, not like
    these two women are alone Shima's bestie Chris is there to fill him in on
    the details and confirm his suspicions, and I guess he really can't do much
    about it... apart from telling her <b>to move on</b>. Yes, in case you
    didn't understand what Shima was conveying to Ririka at the alleyway after
    the class play, this is probably what he meant. To move on, to stop dwelling
    on the past even if it's his entire fault. And that's why Shima mentioned
    about helping Ririka get over how she feels being hurt by the guy for
    whatever reason we don't need to know, and maybe it's just because, but
    Ririka feels this envy. She felt it real hard, and as she cries on taxi on
    the way home, Chris was right to mention about her persistence in wanting
    this childhood friend to do something about her life when just like Shima's,
    Ririka's life is entirely up to her. You didn't make Shima-kun yours in any
    capacity either so (1) why aren't you lol and (2) how have you lost to well,
    basically anyone else in his class? I know right, her advantage is there and
    I'm not talking about celebrity status (not with that middle finger lmao)
    but she just makes herself look bad, and I'm not talking about just her
    tigress image. So welp, try harder if you want him by your side again.
    Overall, the school festival ended well despite Shima missing his lines.
    Everyone ended up in a better position than they ever did even with
    Kanechika-senpai and that student council president which I didn't expect a
    lore drop even though who f**king cares lmao thanks for the flowers you jerk
    throwing that in the bonfire haha, and if this isn't the

    education, you... probably have a better life then they do. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I mean,
    just saying, this is just plain old good for a high school life. Then again,
    they are in their first year of high school mine was also kinda this level
    of great and everything just goes downhill the following year if you don't
    study- ANYWAYS haha this is such a joyride, I still think my worries about
    like, Shima's backstory might be overrated as I see it die down as soon as
    Ririka-san is provocation countered right from the start. So yeah, overall
    really impressed by the storytelling, we are not getting a confession from
    Shima-kun even with the great sunset and school festival curse of love hehe,
    so yeah, just a typical slice of life storytelling if you are into those
    kinds of things like I am. For me, I'm just glad I gave this a chance. Just
    like how I gave myself a chance in high school- Again, first year is awesome
    for me too I had a great time- Okay maybe not much I was envying the couples
    who got laid HAHAHA oh f**k me let me go cry alone or something

    WOAH WAIT LORE DROP IN THE INTRO?? <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Man, I asked for it and they
    delivered. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Dude, we are already at the final episode of this season
    already (#ToniKawaS212), can we relax with the lore a bit? I thought we are
    concluding the story between Nasa-kun and his wife Tsukasa and what awaits
    them moving on from their informal wedding ceremony up the hill. Apparently
    it's that, I barely had to summarize what happened anyways. They are still
    in the mountains where Tokiko had something to discuss with the son-in-law?
    Haha I don't know maybe it's the stepsister or elder to Tsukasa or something
    I don't even know the timeline anymore. They were interrupted by Tsukasa as
    usual, but at least I think later on we did get some more conclusion to what
    Tokiko's role as a guardian is in this series. Fast forward to the
    accumulation of what ended up to be the moonstone they(?) collected which
    stays at that mansion in that room, and Tokiko not remembering that the room
    is filled with nitrogen and passing out in there lol, probably knew her time
    might be up (I would argue otherwise she seems fit) but more of her taking
    care of Tsukasa herself. Thus, she passes the baton (and the stone lol) to
    Nasa-kun to continue the legacy of taking care of... whatever moon beast he
    might be holding on to that looks like a woman. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Yeah I know of
    original work, what of it? lol I don't) Speaking of holding, Tsukasa does
    have a problem with Nasa-kun hugging her and so do I when I noticed that too
    so let's talk about that a bit haha. To keep it short, Tsukasa was right in
    talking about hugging with where your hands are placed dependent on the
    height of the other person, so if you are taller you put your hand above the
    other so you can pull in closer. Hey this is a thing when you hug by the way
    how do I even know about this I don't remember. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span>&nbsp; But yeah,
    she's right. Also right is Nasa-kun saying she sleeps messy and we have
    witnessed that so many times in this series already, so please Tsukasa,
    don't force Nasa-kun to install cameras in the bedroom to prove his point.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all, this is it huh. In the end we STILL did not get to know
    the full lore behind Tsukasa's story. FUCK!! <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Oh well, see you guys
    in season 3 I guess. <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span> Man, I really didn't want this to end this way,
    but just like Tokiko, not like I have a choice. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Maybe we will have
    some way to know of this in due time, as much as we are hinted, Anime
    production might not have much to conceal behind that old woman after this
    point. Maybe. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Well, for the season itself, rather stale. I mean, I
    was here for the married couple romance and stuff and thought it will still
    be exciting to watch, but between just flirting around and just hanging out,
    I don't think I remembered much from this series up till now. Yeah, the
    burning of the apartment they lived in is probably more headline worthy than
    anything else in the series. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> I don't know dude, it's definitely
    dragging things out just like Tokiko talking about the 2-year period of
    Tsukasa helping her out with I don't know what specifically that is anyways,
    and we aren't even done yet! The recently announced OVA series will bring us
    even further into the rabbit hole of Nasa-kun's creative works it seems
    totally not related to the main story, and I guess at this point they are
    just keeping the series' name going. God forbid this will turn out to be
    some drag I will hate to watch at some point *looks at Attack on Titan*, so
    I might as well keep my mouth shut just like Nasa-kun would from listening
    to Tokiko, I suppose.

      >the kiss scene</a
    >&nbsp;spoiled me real hard for this week, what of it? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Now you too
    will experience the pain first before we even talk about this new episode
    (#KimiSomu11), where there will be MORE PAIN if you think this is a happy
    series so DO NOT LET IT FOOL YOU haha okay me, you gotta relax. We always
    start out with something depressing featuring Nakami Ganta. This time, it's
    the mother. Oh hey, no surprise, no mom. No, as in, we STILL don't get to
    see the mother, she's just not even worth seeing. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Yeah. Like, WHY
    THOUGH- Anyways I really can't swallow this let alone kid Nakami who is
    rather cute tbh haha, so let's just move on from this single parent family
    sadness- AIKO-SAN NO HE CAN'T MEET THE MOM SOMEDAY SHE JUST LEFT haha song
    title joke. Jokes aside though, I guess this might be that episode to talk
    about the sadness from why Nakami can't sleep at night. The confession
    before the actual confession, I suppose. We better talk about that first or
    else we can't proceed, I tell you. So, as what Nakami mentioned in one of
    the nights alone with Isaki, sharing his secret about why he can't sleep at
    night. We all already knew it's because of something, and if you need a more
    detailed description of what the flashbacks have shown plus his statement,
    here goes. Story goes that Nakami woke up one day with the house in a mess,
    the housewife missing, and the kid all alone at home. A morning he wished
    did not happen. Probably a good enough hint of what happened because the
    mother left the family, and let's not talk about what is the cause since I
    don't think a hardworking father is good enough reason to leave the house,
    but hey, we don't need to know about that. Or Nakami's feelings, and how he
    has to deal with that day he noticed something was amiss. Nonetheless, not
    his fault, but now he is just scared of sleeping because he has to face this
    reality now, of being abandoned. Of having to see this day again. Somehow I
    also feel that in a generic level now, but for different reasons because you
    will understand that when you are a working adult, but yeah, a longer today
    is better than tomorrow is probably what many youngsters feel in life
    nowadays. I just eventually sleep because my battery sucks. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Unhappy
    things aside, the couple (hehe) sure is enjoying their vacation out in the
    countryside. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Isaki is still playing around as usual even though
    it's rather detrimental to not have someone else like Shiromaru-senpai to
    take care of their belongings so they can flirt with each other- Yeah
    Isaki-chan the dude's carrying the camera which is the whole point of this
    journey; You want to hold this while he enjoys himself jumping on rocks and
    messing around in the water? It's so easy being best girl lol. With every
    passing day of them enjoying each other's company though, something's bound
    to happen isn't a weird thing to say at all. And to the best part. They
    nailed that real good though. If you missed the waves kissing each other you
    probably thought what I did, but if you didn't, go watch back again to
    understand why this is more <span class="emoji" title="😚">*chef's kiss*</span> than you would think. Because
    yeah, even without much reason. Without much motivation. Just from Nakami
    talking about his sad a** life. I gotta say though, Isaki-chan you can dry
    up a man's tears from just kissing? You guys should kiss more. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span>
    This series is sad enough with stories of the past to hit pain points, we
    can use more of this physical contact. Sometimes you just gotta sleep
    together to know that. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> All in all... I&nbsp;mean, we still got 2
    episodes left who the heck knows what will happen. I know right, Kanikawa
    coming in with the confession. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> But before that happens I guess
    since Isaki did the thing, that Nakami might just return the favour to Isaki
    after all, after they are at least done with the training camp this time
    around. Hopefully without the sister haha what are the chances she got
    dumped and came back? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Man, I may think too much like Nakami but
    hey, what's stopping me? <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> See you next week.

    Hmm reusing content from previous episode? What is this implying hmm...
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> In this final episode of a series I don't know what I fell in love
    with (#KuboSan12), well in my defence we don't know how Kubo-san fell in
    love with Shiraishi too haha but I guess we can figure out together, yes?
    So, psychology tests you watch on TV. This is rather staple, girls like it,
    guys don't really care, but she gotta ask him so she can be pissed off by
    the answers delivered by someone who probably isn't even making this
    correctly and it's from the Internet. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Have you seen actual tests
    before? They are long and hard to answer, by the way. Not as simple as the
    number of flowers in a vase- Wait a minute haha yeah I got experience on
    this let me flip my
    <a

    >
    psychological test book here... <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> One flower means dedicated partner,
    nice. Oh, and kittens means kids, by the way. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Seriously though,
    what's stopping me from having as many kids as possible with
    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa" target="_blank"
      >Hanazawa Kana</a
    >- I'm going to get cancelled. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> (Oh, if I'm her husband I can, got
    it, thanks) (Haha) Anyways, this is a very woman thing, so as Shiraishi
    said, better to take it with a pinch of salt. Like, a small pinch. As in no
    salt at all so just don't. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> We also found out a little more from the
    sister Akina about the date of her sister with her boi haha, as apart from
    learning how to drink coffee at a café if you would recall the previous
    episode, she also went full on lady mode making sure her image is perfect
    for her boi. It's her boi after all- Why am I getting excited over this haha
    <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> and even asking her sis to do her hair for her which thank you very
    much indeed (hehe) so that we can have the peak of this series be last week.
    <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Then again, we should not forget about Shiraishi's birthday since
    literally no one will remember since no one will ask him haha <span class="emoji" title="😩">*sigh*</span>, but
    Kubo-san remembered. And that is all it matters, isn't it? Now he has to
    return the favour haha I will just ask her out and she will be so high it
    doesn't matter what you give her. <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Yeah call me Love Master, thanks.
    <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> We also got some flashback on the start of the school term a year
    ago of why Shiraishi is barely noticed in class, since he was back in middle
    school with Tama-chan apparently. Kubo-san over time probably felt bad if
    that is not surprising to anyone, that he has always been neglected in class
    haha I mean even a nice class chairperson wouldn't even know where to start,
    and thus I guess, she felt the sense of
    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yuuetsukan" target="_blank"
      >superiority</a
    >
    over this man that she has never felt before just teasing him and such.
    <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> What did I say about Kubo-san being a sadist? <span class="emoji" title="😆">*laughs*</span> Overall
    though, I still think this series is a joy to watch. It's simple
    slice-of-life romance, dude. Anyone with a heart can get into this. Just,
    you know, just like Shiraishi isn't for everyone and not like you will
    notice how good this series can be until you actually see it. So yeah, not
    everyone's cup of coffee <span class="emoji" title="😉">*wink*</span> but I enjoyed it, and just like other series
    like this, I'm glad they had enough material to talk about the smallest of
    things that made the series stand out, namely Shiraishi being invisible (lol
    I would argue Sudou is probably more invisible in this series than him) and
    the problems he faces in life which, of course includes people not noticing
    him in class. Again, would have made of a better joke in many other
    contexts, but this is at its most pure, and probably, this is what it should
    have been, for what it offers. Everything else just falls in nicely though,
    side characters, music and animation and everything... it's just something I
    did not regret watching. I would not expect a proper ending so yeah this is
    just it, but I feel like I've already felt so much more than whatever...
    friendship? That goes between them we don't really need more hehe we cannot
    get Kubo Nagisa to confess to the guy this logic doesn't exist haha

    no surprises there but the full-on release is rather surprising and we still

    for their upcoming album is full steam ahead, doesn't mean it's good at all
    by any measure, so I may skip this song after all. I will still put faith in
    the album though unlike their 2nd album back then which I basically just
    skipped because of the topic song lol. And just announced earlier,

    Man, I can use a break for next week because coming next month with the new
    Anime I'll be bombing my music library with new songs again because nowadays
    we just release digital straight away after Episode 1 anyways not like they
    care about sales or releasing good singles-<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Well, now that my replacement phone from eBay coming from the US of A is a
    mess (THREE WEEKS TO SHIP TO SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE COUNTRY?? WHAT THE F-),
    let's hope this expedited one from Amazon will come in earlier (as in
    upcoming Wednesday) than our upcoming package where I will once again take
    work leave at the end of the month so man, *prays* FINGERS CROSSED because
    next week is going to be awesome!! I'm depending on you, capitalism and the
    international mail industry. <span class="emoji" title="🤭">*giggles*</span> Tell me

    will, and until next time... hey let's end this June with a blast! If I
    don't I will report in here anyways this is Web Reports after all, good news
    or bad I will have to do it too lol. Yeah right you only talk about how much
    you got just Tamaki SSR this week and stopped, and how you want to do
    birthday girl&nbsp;<a

    where they talked about best scenes each episode up till now so yeah till
    11, and I agree with most of their choices, also didn't realize this not
    podcast sounded so much better than I thought to be honest, such a joy to
    hear main guy voice actor Satou Gen laugh especially when he said his father
    went crazy seeing the timing of the kiss scene lol same here but I'm not
    this exaggerated. <span class="emoji" title="😐">*silence*</span> Maybe I'm older than his dad haha WHAAAAATTT

    gems in tomorrow's livestream for the new event and I'll roll your birthday

    I can skip Tamaki's birthday-
