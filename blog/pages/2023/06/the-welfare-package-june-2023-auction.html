For the week! For the month even! For the year- Yeah why not my phone replacement is also here too haha HELL YEAH DUDE<br></div><div><br></div><div>Cannot be more high about anything up until now, but damn did I had to set up the phone a bit before we can start this and trust me I have a long night considering tomorrow's a public holiday and everyone is taking work leave the day after <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, I could take some time to sleep tonight knowing that this bunch of photos came in for the worst timing possible because this should have been on Friday and I STILL HAVE TO DO A KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW?? Maybe I do that tomorrow haha</div><div><br></div><div>For today though, maybe we talk about why this is named Part 3, shall we?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>THE ORIGIN</div><div>If you would recall, some time ago and yes it has been like 6 years ago since then, <b>for the first time I ventured into the world of Japanese auction house</b> to you know, get some deals on the cheap and/or rare items one would otherwise never get through normal means. But normal is not what happened back then, not even the second time I did it in <b>almost 4 years since the previous one</b>, because as online stores like Suruga-ya became more prevalent, and my ways of purchasing directly the latest stuff from stores especially photos from people I know (I thank PONY CANYON's online store Canime specifically for this), there has become less reason to even get into this trade at all. But that doesn't mean it can cover all bases, because even in recent years, printed bromides are also increasingly hard to get especially when they want you to be physically there, and with some cases, make this still a compelling run to date despite higher costs to obtain them in the first place.</div><div><br></div><div>As to how this season 3 (lol) all started this time around... well, to put this short, <b>it started off with TrySail's new single.</b> <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, more specifically, it started with me wanting to go through another of this trip again to curb my sadness after I broke my phone last month (tomorrow is the one month anniversary lol), decided to get a phone replacement from overseas... AND also buying more stuff since I really can't do much on this old phone especially playing mobile games and it's just a good excuse since spoiler alert, <b>I wanted to buy the CD mentioned above from TSUTAYA</b> in which the store doesn't accept overseas debit cards. So yeah, <b>through a proxy buying service such as Buyee</b> here my long time <strike>accomplice</strike> partner for almost a decade, while waiting for them to make purchase and deliver it so I can ship it out, I was like heck, <em>why not get some bromide photos to pad the order while I'm at it?</em> And here we are. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>And boy did I regret this on many fronts. I was quickly reminded of the pains of <b>making purchases from Yahoo Japan Auctions</b> with one of the bids which I had to outbid I will mention who later <span style=font-size:x-small><em>it's Rieri</em></span> haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, and throughout this month I was on and off checking in almost every day to see if there was anything else worth buying apart from the... more rare ones which won't be seen anywhere else, <b>not even from those Suruga-ya runs</b> we have discovered that online store which sells these stuff specifically. So yeah, it was a lot of joys and laughs, <b>my hands got itchy and bought the last of Mocho bromides last week</b> only to delay it for another couple of days, and boy am I glad I can even get this one shipped by the end of this month.</div><div><br></div><div>Let me do just a little unboxing here because trust me, it'll all make sense later <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj39Tf4TYb52woxn88zAD6B0KJ3Dhb-8Jzfyi_PYfyV1ZWZiz5bA3oCqUKUb5h0Qyp5L8ATL89MYSM-ZcS9ccuzwpQ0QNYi9A5_yvj6rKIjDYiTDUMZcLGDdm94bV_Yjc_o3rTIC0-_LeXDTClDwhFtt48YSe4fc98or0YAQIDb2Xw7ueHQKZSdy7cTm8s/s3780/IMG_20230628_191528.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=3780 height=256 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj39Tf4TYb52woxn88zAD6B0KJ3Dhb-8Jzfyi_PYfyV1ZWZiz5bA3oCqUKUb5h0Qyp5L8ATL89MYSM-ZcS9ccuzwpQ0QNYi9A5_yvj6rKIjDYiTDUMZcLGDdm94bV_Yjc_o3rTIC0-_LeXDTClDwhFtt48YSe4fc98or0YAQIDb2Xw7ueHQKZSdy7cTm8s/s320/IMG_20230628_191528.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you noticed on the right that is what was used to take the photos from here on ie. this was from the old phone I used for close to a month <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br></table><div><br></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwIAFXyA1CzmUCHE3rYIASoM_c2110JmjNQgQVP8BkA8NWXqqDzFgBkaAgoBjc_zfeoFP7r_SV6g2qowB5J3YzyCqBc5wJznNwTEvJ48DGPfe9MeJDRMU-YneQRdm6bDbUqny_8dgdBf-ofMNmkBdtbt7WzDQJK6KjJqxfIWm_A8DEmBuP6bBBnpGOoiI/s2048/PXL_20230628_134419278.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwIAFXyA1CzmUCHE3rYIASoM_c2110JmjNQgQVP8BkA8NWXqqDzFgBkaAgoBjc_zfeoFP7r_SV6g2qowB5J3YzyCqBc5wJznNwTEvJ48DGPfe9MeJDRMU-YneQRdm6bDbUqny_8dgdBf-ofMNmkBdtbt7WzDQJK6KjJqxfIWm_A8DEmBuP6bBBnpGOoiI/s320/PXL_20230628_134419278.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Oh yeah this is real big of a package for what is essentially photos lol<br>(Well there is a clear file which is probably a mistake now that I think about it haha)</table><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqCIwkzTPeeYbZNk9BtB0_mR27paQdDLhPpkyCgrlKSHZOLZLJe0wLhWH-wzE1-nrvlT3R359tV3dKDdDG264CIXfZmFXIw8RQnOic81rJiolj6SKcJLbYHaAiCOjXpD56_gZnqG0RMYN6Nj893PZSG02yTr_8UZ4HiP8pjZr0fU1nmawoIYr0gC_4r-I/s2048/PXL_20230628_134432656.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqCIwkzTPeeYbZNk9BtB0_mR27paQdDLhPpkyCgrlKSHZOLZLJe0wLhWH-wzE1-nrvlT3R359tV3dKDdDG264CIXfZmFXIw8RQnOic81rJiolj6SKcJLbYHaAiCOjXpD56_gZnqG0RMYN6Nj893PZSG02yTr_8UZ4HiP8pjZr0fU1nmawoIYr0gC_4r-I/s320/PXL_20230628_134432656.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Oh wow why are they all each in an extra letter wrapping?</table><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7GdSYs8JDDzftiCm8OQLYPDW-tmQ9VatKtfYKnqxditO0ExI10kk-SZ8pkiv5QGcRyYC0hdRqmStEfjcqi64UZRqs22Cj8UulgIggRWZrFFPjuahk7FEEE5EF8kpyPHdNwxkaPjVbzmkhKKClngDF0RPZBiURIqZWhFHq08jo29CxaVZDVLlpb-zXMqg/s2048/PXL_20230628_134445277.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7GdSYs8JDDzftiCm8OQLYPDW-tmQ9VatKtfYKnqxditO0ExI10kk-SZ8pkiv5QGcRyYC0hdRqmStEfjcqi64UZRqs22Cj8UulgIggRWZrFFPjuahk7FEEE5EF8kpyPHdNwxkaPjVbzmkhKKClngDF0RPZBiURIqZWhFHq08jo29CxaVZDVLlpb-zXMqg/s320/PXL_20230628_134445277.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Oh there's- OH I actually got it!!<br>That's the special gift bromide photo with purchase of TrySail's new single from TSUTAYA!!

<span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Then again, some are auctioned items so they may be gone before these vouchers arrive, however <b>most of them this time around were purchased from online flea market service Mercari</b>, which is different from the auction house because it functions as a normal online store and I did not need to pay for the (hidden) local shipping fees if the seller doesn't do so, so I could've waited to get them since they don't expire as fast ie. outbids not required lol. Time was a concern to make sure this arrives by this week so compromises were made nonetheless.</div></div><div><br></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5DB0kSX3aI8-iNoZV11PVT47kt8VftXFGvP9b0w1guec4piu3hWyVM6eyuSl7hWhN_oeEfAWsM3rmgjEVv99pBxJ5EwAvM-Hs6Gnjn2OdHlrx2Cm3EgcxVc-P3EoRcBoZlv7SOiQe3y1sZC7vuZQwrjicaYKHEtI_xBNivXakVSUVNBQiASNvcsGLn_w/s1318/screencapture-buyee-jp-2023-06-28.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1318 data-original-width=740 height=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5DB0kSX3aI8-iNoZV11PVT47kt8VftXFGvP9b0w1guec4piu3hWyVM6eyuSl7hWhN_oeEfAWsM3rmgjEVv99pBxJ5EwAvM-Hs6Gnjn2OdHlrx2Cm3EgcxVc-P3EoRcBoZlv7SOiQe3y1sZC7vuZQwrjicaYKHEtI_xBNivXakVSUVNBQiASNvcsGLn_w/s320/screencapture-buyee-jp-2023-06-28.png width=180></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Just a list of items of all the sins I have done haha<br>(No show of money I have filed my taxes already my home country knows I have been doing this for years lmao)</table><div><br></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLyOIqH9lhGY4PKVhNOLgORyyHrS8PsxaiTUfuqYfJatiUa9m5K1qKhZXrMLpQUfH9e_O5lOB-KAVybisIfOgWzinG3LDj4VffWkwGiEYEuGlE6aTFCIV0OWtVw-V74BOVDkXjYJ_JngKeqiTjFLaedDTVB36ZXGJre8Vj4JK3rdihk1lGPWEsQAAYmcs/s2048/PXL_20230628_145743017.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1931 data-original-width=4032 height=153 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLyOIqH9lhGY4PKVhNOLgORyyHrS8PsxaiTUfuqYfJatiUa9m5K1qKhZXrMLpQUfH9e_O5lOB-KAVybisIfOgWzinG3LDj4VffWkwGiEYEuGlE6aTFCIV0OWtVw-V74BOVDkXjYJ_JngKeqiTjFLaedDTVB36ZXGJre8Vj4JK3rdihk1lGPWEsQAAYmcs/s320/PXL_20230628_145743017.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center><span class=emoji title=🥰>*blessed*</span></table><div><br></div><div>So, to expand on the photos shown, I will try to be as detailed as possible about each photo's origin and backstory (lol) before I forget, in chronological order of purchase:</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Soon after purchasing TrySail's new single from TSUTAYA ONLINE SHOPPING end of May, I went ahead and made the purchase from Mercari, <b>Kanno Mai's VOICE+ bromides</b> which can only be obtained in print (a service known as <a href=http://print-tune.jp target=_blank>Print Tune</a>) directly from Japanese convenience stores which unless I have a friend who can do this for me physically in which then they won't cost a bomb, but I can do that alone or online so I'm just glad I can get this only one that is available throughout all the stores and auction house. Don't know why the <u>condition of them is decolourized(?)</u> though the product page thumbnail looks okay and not at all photoshopped... (What are the chances it's re-scanned and printed? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span>)<li>A day later and the bulk of most of my purchases from Mercari have been confirmed but including, and I should not have done that just because, since I can't find anything good on Moeshi on the stores and auction house, I took the liberty to buy <b>the last of Toyota Moe birthday bromides from Gamers</b> from last year (lol which is set C and yes there is an A and B) to pad the order even though I thought it hardly necessary since I can buy them directly and the shipping for this here is kind of expensive so this was a mistake after all. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Among the Mercari ones though, <b>some Aizawa Saya bromides</b> joined in on the fun considering so far up till now I can only buy bromides directly from her livestream series parent company Voice Garage which are already good but I can use with more variety. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><li>I then started on the Yahoo auction house shenanigans exactly 4 years after I did the previous one back in 2nd June 2019 no joke, placing snipe bids (last minute auto purchases) of <b>Waki Azumi's new single bromides set</b> because someone was a true fan to get this from a fan event to make me happier (not as happy as if that dude if he would even remove the duplicates to her 2nd live bromides set so I can buy it hehe) but now I have regretted because all of them had a bent on the top left corner which made them <u>the worst conditioned items</u>, <b>Ueda Reina bromide and clear file set</b> (comes with purchase of her album last year from Animate) because why not I liked her music the special gifts were a given lol I did not even buy them by the way, and the one <b>Koga Aoi Seiyuu Animedia bromide</b> because hers is so rare and underrated I can get it at 50 yen, <u>the cheapest single item in the list</u>. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'll take it haha<li>I continued on my journey to buy more <b>bromides from Natsukawa Shiina's new single</b> back in May because why not they are cute and Suruga-ya doesn't have them on stock, and went down the auction house rabbit hole from here for the rest of the week buying left and right <b>Kouno Marika bromide from her trading card set</b> if you would recall from last year and with purchase you can get larger-than-card photos depending on the store and/or event this one was from Gamers, and <b>TrySail Seigura bromides from 2021</b> because I've not gotten them so far.<li>The breakthrough honestly though, was both from Rieri as it was the only time I had to outbid once for <b>Takahashi Rie's recent Anime "Oshi no Ko" magazine collaboration bromide</b> (How can you not after seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/TVguidePERSON/status/1639100165658390528?s=20" target=_blank>the magazine's official tweet</a>? And I don't even watch the damn show) from the auction house, and also waiting for the right time to make a swift purchase on its release date, <b>Takahashi Rie's Seigura bromides</b> as people are consolidating them left and right because what better way to support your gal's cover on the magazine by buying all of them and selling the gifts afterwards. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah they got me good even further as I know to not see the prices continue to drop after I find a deal good enough to splurge, and give myself time to let the rest come in before consolidating the package. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Now that just sounds like an excuse to myself haha really should have waited a little longer thinking back especially with the vouchers these aren't cheap considering they were fresh off the... shelf? Fresh off someone's apartment I guess lmao<li>Around here was also where I stopped playing with the auction house though, as many of the other stuff are more reliable and/or cheaper in purchase from flea market site Mercari, and that's how I got most of the rest in due time slowly starting from <b>Ueda Reina's other bromide</b> based on the same mini-album last year and then realizing I should take my time as more vouchers appeared over time in increasing discount so oh well, if not pushed for time right now I would have done this more carefully. Among them are also <b>a TrySail bromide and recent live tour pass card set</b> because I was worried my TrySail single will not come with a special gift granted that Buyee was purchasing it for me... and it takes a couple more days after my clicks which is why I rather reserve my purchase directly if possible and also how this is the fall back, <b>a special Kanno Mai's mini photobook special bromide</b> which is <u>the highest priced single item</u> in the list here because I love her that much (hehe) and these <b>two Amamiya Sora's photobooks special gifts from HMV Japan</b> just because I could not afford anything else better. Those other Ten-chan bromides? For 2 of them I can buy half the stock here, people.<li>Worst thing was, in waiting for the Ueda Reina one to appear (the one from Mercari not the auction house lmao) and in view of Mocho's birthday I went on to tempt myself to buy some <b>Asakura Momo Seigura bromides from last year</b> to only know that the former shipped in a day afterwards so damn did I wait a couple more days for the latter to appear so that I can ship it out... last Thursday. Heck, it still took less than a week to appear here though!</ul><div>So much emotion from this write-up haha yeah right? I know most of the rants are why I didn't wait to use the 20% because (1) I wouldn't know two weeks ago that this exists I didn't know this is the discount season, and (2) I would've missed this end of month break to do all of this now. In total, <b>I've spent I think over 30k yen overall</b> from buying stuff through Buyee partner shops (so excluding TrySail's single, Moeshi bromides) and that's what I set out to spend. About half of the amount is on the actual price of 23 bromides + 1 clear file so I can ship them using the other half of the budget. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I have too much money to vent on, this is basically the same rate as the first time I did this 7 years ago despite the exchange rate being so much in my favour now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, the price to pay for all this I guess but NOW, we know when we should do this again next time next year HAHAHA NEVER AGAIN PLEASE DON'T DO IT AGAIN ME I BEG OF YOU</div><div><br></div><div>Oh, if you see a table below means I'm done summarizing everything before international shipping and in order of purchase, the demand of featured... people on my own collection based on amount owned so far, to condition of items because some of them are... not exactly in mint condition. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> (Service Fee is ¥300 for every purchase, and I did not add any insurance because it's just paper- Maybe that's why lol)</div><div><br></div><div class=datatable style=font-size:.9em><table><tbody><tr><th class=freeze>Item<th>From<th>Timeline<th>Qty<th>Price<th>Shipping<th>Purchased On<th>Arrived On<th>Condition<tr><td class=freeze title='Kanno Mai "VOICE+ Vol.5" Print Tune Bromide Set'>Kanno Mai "VOICE+ Vol.5" Print Tune Bromide Set<td>Mercari<td>2023.02<td>2<td>¥999<td>-<td>2023.05.31<br>🟧<td>2023.06.09<br>🟧🟧<td>OK?<tr><td class=freeze title='Ueda Reina CD "Atrium" Animate Bonus'>Ueda Reina CD "Atrium" Animate Bonus<td>Y!<td>2022.10<br>🟩<td>1 (+File)<td>¥1000<td>¥210<td>2023.06.02<br>🟧<td>2023.06.05<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Waki Azumi "Kimi to no Mirai" Release Event Bromides'>Waki Azumi "Kimi to no Mirai" Release Event Bromides<td>Y!<td>2023.03<td>6<td>¥1000🔽<td>¥210<td>2023.06.02<br>🟧<td>2023.06.05<br>🟧🟧<td>Bent<tr><td class=freeze title='Nagae Rika "Re:color" Gamers Bonus'>Nagae Rika "Re:color" Gamers Bonus<td>Mercari<td>2023.02<td>2<td>¥1000<td>-<td>2023.06.02<br>🟧<td>2023.06.06<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Aizawa Saya "Kimi no Iro, Kimi no Koe wo Kikasete" Event Bromides'>Aizawa Saya "Kimi no Iro, Kimi no Koe wo Kikasete" Event Bromides<td>Mercari<td>2022.05<br>🟩<td>2<td>¥444<td>-<td>2023.06.02<br>🟧<td>2023.06.08<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Koga Aoi "Seiyuu Animedia Aug 2020" Bonus'>Koga Aoi "Seiyuu Animedia Aug 2020" Bonus<td>Mercari<td>2020.07<br>🟩🟩🟩<td>1<td>¥50🔽<td>¥185<td>2023.06.02<br>🟧<td>2023.06.06<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Natsukawa Shiina "Yueni" Animate Bonus'>Natsukawa Shiina "Yueni" Animate Bonus<td>Y!<td>2023.05<td>1<td>¥700<td>¥210<td>2023.06.03<br>🟧<td>2023.06.07<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Natsukawa Shiina "Yueni" HMV Bonus'>Natsukawa Shiina "Yueni" HMV Bonus<td>Mercari<td>2023.05<td>1<td>¥300<td>-<td>2023.06.03<br>🟧<td>2023.06.08<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Kouno Marika "Gekkan Bushiroad Mar 2022" Gamers Bonus'>Kouno Marika "Gekkan Bushiroad Mar 2022" Gamers Bonus<td>Y!<td>2022.02<br>🟩<td>1<td>¥400<td>¥185<td>2023.06.04<br>🟧<td>2023.06.07<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='TrySail "Seiyuu Grand Prix Jul 2021" HMV Bonus'>TrySail "Seiyuu Grand Prix Jul 2021" HMV Bonus<td>Y!<td>2021.06<br>🟩🟩<td>1<td>¥700<td>¥210<td>2023.06.04<br>🟧<td>2023.06.09<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='TrySail "Seiyuu Grand Prix Jul 2021" Animate Bonus'>TrySail "Seiyuu Grand Prix Jul 2021" Animate Bonus<td>Y!<td>2021.06<br>🟩🟩<td>1<td>¥300<td>¥185<td>2023.06.04<br>🟧<td>2023.06.07<br>🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Takahashi Rie "Seiyuu Grand Prix Jul 2023" Bromide Set'>Takahashi Rie "Seiyuu Grand Prix Jul 2023" Bromide Set<td>Mercari<td>2023.06<td>3<td>¥2555<td>-<td>2023.06.09<br>🟧🟧<td>2023.06.14<br>🟧🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Takahashi Rie "TV Guide A Stars vol.02" Gamers Bonus'>Takahashi Rie "TV Guide A Stars vol.02" Gamers Bonus<td>Y!<td>2023.03<td>1<td><strike>¥1000</strike><br>¥1100🔼<td>¥185<td>2023.06.09<br>🟧🟧<td>2023.06.13<br>🟧🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='Ueda Reina "Seiyuu Grand Prix Dec 2022" Animate Bonus'>Ueda Reina "Seiyuu Grand Prix Dec 2022" Animate Bonus<td>Mercari<td>2022.11<br>🟩<td>1<td>¥399<td>-<td>2023.06.11<br>🟧🟧<td>2023.06.19<br>🟧🟧🟧🟧<td>OK<tr><td class=freeze title='TrySail "Karei One Turn / Follow You!"
