<div class="page-header"></div>
<div>Hey, welcome back to every weekend ie. the haven in my pathetic life so far, where I talk about how ideal or at this point imaginary, my life would have been as a Japanese... but surrounded with ladies I like. Specifically of voice actresses though; I can't keep writing how much I want to bang porn actresses or whatever haha-</div><div><br></div><div>Well, continuing on the story last time, this time around we are greeted with someone else familiar too, at least to me. But I feel like I don't know her too well, so might as well know less as I write my own lore into it. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Maybe I should listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/momonichi_radio/status/1679109549738061824?s=20" target=_blank>her weekly solo radio on Wednesdays</a> lol that needs an app though</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Asakura Momo smiling in a green blouse with a white sling handbag, holding on to a handrail in a train" border=0 data-original-height=360 data-original-width=512 height=141 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl714977.jpg title="Asakura Momo" width=200></div><blockquote><div><i>The sun shone into the cabin as I boarded a train to meet up with my friends a few stops away out of the city. Holding on to the handrail with one hand as I face outwards looking into the scenery and my phone, I felt a tap on my shoulder. Turning around, with both hands holding on to a handrail and returning a smile, it was Asakura Momo on the same train cart with me! A soft call of "Aozaki-san?" melted me more than the hot sun, as sheÂ mentioned she was also en route to meeting her friends. We started some chit chat, talking about food and recent TV shows and all. But as I went on about my monologue, Asakura-san listened attentively.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>Alighting at my stop leaving the train platform, I felt like she did not just converse with me with a passing smile, but more like she was enthusiastic about it, and very keen on being my listening ear. To me, the conversation made me feel like she was such a nice person overall. Perhaps and maybe, she was just interested in knowing more about me.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Yeah and then the train hard braked and she landed on me, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/passable/1651563632?i=1651563635&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>I know I know</a>. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>What do you think? Well, what do <em>I</em> think?? In this case though, maybe it's not obvious enough because I assume this needs a lot more context, Mocho here will be the most left out of the bunch, but will also be the one I'll be most interested in. Yes, and it's not because of chest. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> Because recall last time where Ten-chan is the one who rejected me (and maybe she'll try to give me chance again) and there's the imouto haha so this one is neglected as much as I have the best chance to be together with. And the feelings will be vice versa too, in case you don't think this will happen. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span>Â Now you get the idea, yes? I just want to p-</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Please, me, that is <strike>"put my d-"</strike> "put my lips against hers" haha that is the nicest I can make it</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. Imagine me making out with Mocho in front of the other two. Imagine their reactions. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content Â© 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
