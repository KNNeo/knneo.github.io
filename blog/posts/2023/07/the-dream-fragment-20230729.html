Damn, we are so close to that Alternative Girls livestream already can we stop fantasizing about their voice actresses, please? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><div><br></div><div>Wow that woke me up real good, so good morning, as I quickly recap what I just dreamt of that will "stop my heart" and woke up to a song title "(I) will never forget".</div><div><br></div><div></div><blockquote><div>"I was excited to see a public event of what seems to be Alternative Girls event as I saw Ookubo Rumi dressed in a dark blue one piece dress in a booth with more than a dozen ladies lined up I assume preparing for an upcoming event. Ironically there aren't any security or staff when I passed by so I wondered why not go chat up to them. But as I went around the corner I saw another panel of ladies which I forgot who they are, but still knew that this initial one I saw was of priority so I quickly turned back after putting down my stuff aside and rushed to take the first row of empty seats, putting me right in front of her and Amamiya Sora also in a one piece dress though in a slightly darker shade of blue.</div><div><br></div><div>They were surprised to see my excitement as so am I, I greeted them in the messiest fashion ever, overlapping phrases since I had no idea what time of day it is, and I assume we are in the day with the sun shining and all. I told them I was a fan of this series and they thanked me and showed a bunch of cute poses in return specifically RumiRumi who put her hands against her face.</div><div><br></div><div>"Don't be so cute, my heart is going to stop!!"</div><div><br></div><div>I think I raised my voice a second time so they could catch me but even so they did not stop on the teasing me or maybe they are just adorable this way, and I can say nothing else."</div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, apart from waking up from this heaven. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well that was fun, and I woke up to a mol-74 song. Now I'm REALLY <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%BF%98%E3%82%8C%E3%81%9F%E3%81%8F%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84/1692517429?i=1692517430&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>not going to forget</a> this haha</div><div><br></div><div>Then again, which work (animation or video game) do I know Ten-chan and RumiRumi were in together though, hmm... That aside though, this shares many references on what I am anticipating in nature just as is, from the upcoming revival of a video game of which Ten-chan isn't in haha uh oh maybe she will be a new character? Haha if this works I should be a prophet, and me feeling the heat is because I don't turn on the fan in my room at this time of year. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah call me madman but I think I woke up because of this reason too so screw me I guess lol. And RumiRumi with the pose think of Sakurako on that series so that IRL I can't even haha <span class=emoji title=🥰>*blessed*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheDreams"><span class="material-icons small-icons">cloud</span>The Dreams</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
