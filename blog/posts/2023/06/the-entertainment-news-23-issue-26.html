So... maybe we stay here from now on lol</div><div><br></div><div>I know right, mentioning Asakura Momo is so not my priority right now HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY CUTEST PRINCESS haha <a href="https://twitter.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1672910303221420032?s=20" target=_blank>your birthday livestream</a> of you just eating cake and <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sushi target=_blank>sushi</a> is something to die for also your rack- Again, I must emphasize, it's because the rack is on HER- You think they bought a B-holder (see Anime "KiseKoi" Episode 9) to compress her chest? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah screw you <a href="https://twitter.com/doax_vv_staff/status/1672620599741497345?s=20" target=_blank>Loberia from DOAXVV</a> I am not giving you money for your new outfit and hairstyle <span style=font-size:xx-small>because it's all going to Mocho superchats</span> HAHA <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Not accepting donations huh haha they just announced a summer-themed single though so that's actually cool- You think she will even show <strike>some</strike> any <strike>bikini</strike> cleavage in the music video? HAHAHAHA LMAO okay me we know it's not happening</div><div><br></div><div>Hey, Anime and music time!! We got lots to talk about the former for the new season so let's!<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Summer2023Anime><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Summer 2023 Anime Preview</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>[Powered by <a href=https://randomc.net/2023/06/20/summer-2023-preview/ target=_blank>Random Curiosity</a>]</div></blockquote>I've read the previews I've done so many years ago and realized I just cut to the chase on stuff that I like so let's ignore all the damn sequels I don't care especially that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>isekai</a> genre bullsh*t and focus on what caught my attention this week apart from the stuff I already know. Anything from maybe to confirm watch will have images to show and/or premiere dates in brackets.<div><ul style=text-align:left><li> <b>"Oooku"</b> (read as O-oku) sounds like haven but in historical Japan so unless you're into powerful women which I'm not let's move on haha<li>Yes I will be watching unexpected sequel <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Horimiya%20-piece-%20.jpg target=_blank>"Horimiya -piece-"</a></b> [Premieres July 1st, 2023] to literally pick up the pieces of this love story which effectively concluded according to the Anime community so what else is there to offer? In this second season though, looks like they are picking snippets of their high school days and maybe beyond for all the characters, and talking about what happened in between, maybe more. We are welcomed back with a fantastic cast from main girl <strike>Tomatsu Haruka</strike> Hori-san falling in love with her weird boyfriend I forgot his name (lol) to secondary character love stories more powerful than the main couple (SAKURA-CHAN NO) there's something to like for anyone interested in this series. Though I'm only in as much as I think this is just going to be the underdog of the series compared to everything else I have to watch.<li><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/AYAKA%20.jpg target=_blank><b>"AYAKA"</b></a> [Premieres July 1st, 2023] seems like an awesome original action Anime series that I might just watch by mistake because damn who doesn't want an Anime <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/1606/Kekkaishi target=_blank>"Kekkaishi"</a> sequel haha but yeah, maybe I watch an episode or two to see if the story or animation can impress me- Oh hello angela with the opening theme song long time no see<br><li>Seeing that I have a lot to watch this season I might just drop watching <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Uchi%20no%20Kaisha%20no%20Chiisai%20Senpai%20no%20Hanashi%20.jpg target=_blank>"Uchi no Kaisha no Chiisai Senpai no Hanashi"</a></b> which is basically Anime <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/42351/Senpai_ga_Uzai_Kouhai_no_Hanashi target=_blank>"Senpai ga Uzai"</a> but in this case this so-called "small" senior at work has a not-so-small rack. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I guess that's the only appeal and that is just WRONG haha we shall see if I will pick her up<li>Okay somehow the trailer for <a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Yumemiru%20Danshi%20wa%20Genjitsushugisha%20.jpg target=_blank><b>"Yumemiru Danshi wa Genjitsushugisha"</b></a> [Premieres July 3rd, 2023] got me keen on the plot because damn besides being an interesting love story of my ideal way to get a girl in my student days because I don't look this cool for anyone to look back at me lol, it also features a great cast of <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/23405/Shiina_Natsukawa target=_blank>Natsukawa</a>- Oh, that's the main girl's name. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> A great female (who tf cares about dudes) side cast (because main cast looks like newbie pair) of Hanamori Yumiri, Komatsu Mikako and Ishihara Kaori just to name a few, as we see main guy try to ignore this girl he has been trying to woo for a while and see the girl like him back after his enthusiasm dies down. Yeah, Anime <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/50739/Otonari_no_Tenshi-sama_ni_Itsunomanika_Dame_Ningen_ni_Sareteita_Ken target=_blank>"Otonari no Tenshi-sama"</a> but better. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Animation-wise not so much and that is just sad for the price of making such a series nowadays.<li>Oh yeah, this sh*t. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Suki%20na%20Ko%20ga%20Megane%20wo%20Wasureta%20.jpg target=_blank>"Suki na Ko ga Megane wo Wasureta"</a></b> [Premieres July 4th, 2023] is such a good premise for an Anime alone because I'm a simp for slice-of-life AND romance series ESPECIALLY a girl with <a href=https://jisho.org/search/megane target=_blank>glasses</a>, also turns out to be super not relatable to me as the girl forgets to wear them for the n-th time. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Nice guy next seat helps her out not just out of compassion, and love blossoms. <a href=https://jisho.org/search/choroi target=_blank>Easy</a>, huh. Also if you liked Anime <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/49520/Aharen-san_wa_Hakarenai target=_blank>"Aharen-san"</a> this is basically the same but closer. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I'm liking this already to be honest I have never been this close to <em>anyone</em>, really. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span><li>Isekai but as a vending machine lmao F**K OFF<li>Man, this is such a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shoujo target=_blank>shoujo</a> Anime I don't think <a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Watashi%20no%20Shiawase%20na%20Kekkon%20.png target=_blank><b>"Watashi no Shiawase na Kekkon"</b></a> is any similar to Anime <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/45055/Taishou_Otome_Otogibanashi target=_blank>"Taisho Otome"</a> and boy did Ueda Reina voicing the main girl get me... just in name lol the trailer is just a meh for me, but damn, straightforward but sad story about historical romance? Hey if anyone is interested in this level of sadness and also likes the dudes then this is for you- I can see this is very female audience targeted haha<li>The theme songs in this are rad though, I might just give the songs by accident. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Undead%20Girl%20Murder%20Farce%20.jpg target=_blank><b>"Undead Girl Murder Farce"</b></a> sounds like a mystery series where in this case <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/46471/Tantei_wa_Mou_Shindeiru target=_blank>"The Detective Is Dead"</a> but in a world where the undead exist. You know how that works. Oh yeah, and what's left is the head instead of heart, the duo solves mysteries just by hanging on (get it?) a line of truth and walking around with a cage with a head inside. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Nah haha I want to sleep on Sunday nights this is no <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/144298/Kyouko_Machi target=_blank>dullahan</a> at all Anime "Demi-chan" is cuter-<li>Oh hey yo let's do this I guess because <a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Kanojo,%20Okarishimasu%203rd%20Season.jpg target=_blank><b>"Kanojo, Okarishimasu 3rd Season"</b></a> [Premieres July 7th, 2023] is back with another hit to (likely) conclude the story between main guy Kazuya with his <strike>girlfriend</strike> <strike>grandparents-agreed partner</strike> business partner to give main girl Chizuru's mother a great time before she (potentially) passes away without seeing her only granddaughter's achievements in the acting industry. Sadly, we got more girls joining the fray and she's not huge she is just Mini lol great joke, possibly spoiling the balance of souls in here (haha) with her accent and role as Kazuya's junior, throwing off the sense of romance on all the characters in the series as we finally find out if Chizuru will give this main guy literally ANY chance to be his lover. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Can we not have a season 4 and end this season without a <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/52198/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__First_Kiss_wa_Owaranai target=_blank>movie adaptation</a> please? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><li><b>"AI no Idenshi"</b> we are not talking about this because AI news are blowing up by the week I need a break from that lol<li>Oh yeah this is basically Anime <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/38759/Sewayaki_Kitsune_no_Senko-san target=_blank>"Senko-san"</a> but cooler lmao because damn is <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Dekiru%20Neko%20wa%20Kyou%20mo%20Yuuutsu%20.jpg target=_blank>"Dekiru Neko wa Kyou mo Yuuutsu"</a></b> in the most interesting premise ever for such a caretaker series because they flipped the story to make the female human busy whilst a male... cat? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> A male cat takes care of her. Anyone? Anyone interested in this though?? Update me if it's good haha<li>Hell yeah we are back with another season with <a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/BLEACH%20Sennen%20Kessen-hen%20-%20Ketsubetsu-tan%20.jpg target=_blank><b>"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen – Ketsubetsu-tan"</b></a> [Premieres July 8th, 2023] and tell me I won't watch my very first action series Anime to its completion with its final arc in second season, because are the introduction of new cast members enough to make me foam at the mouth haha <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11184/Nao_Touyama target=_blank>NAOBOU</a>!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We are still warming up on the fights as we wait for the invading Quincy Army to strike again on the innocent <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> who doesn't know of its past. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Please, I ONLY specialize in writing propaganda haha or I already know the story to say that lol but hey, not gonna stop me from the excitement though. First season has delivered in the fights and subsequent ones should if this is what entails.<li>So <b>"Temple"</b> is just "Love Hina", got it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> MOVING ON the trailer is so lame I stopped at the first confession<li>This might be the next hype thing after "BLEACH" to be honest as hopefully we can conclude this series with <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Shinigami%20Bocchan%20to%20Kuro%20Maid%202nd%20Season%20.jpg target=_blank>"Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid 2nd Season"</a></b> [Premieres July 9th, 2023] (*ack* <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4ZidaRPAyZz00xeqZiYuSk6CYMn9VSaT5vo_Af9kV3GnpnDIYPewe5dPcAitlqC3ANCFOJ3dPkyQqv7O8oiyyFlVUCyFQw2IB2qCl6YVQ9i7JSE5aZGF7kdpB_1JBrTbADxQ7dwhrA5A/s320/shinigamibocchan11_walter4.jpg target=_blank>2nd</a> *ack*) because remember the last time the mom said the main guy is to find a cure before the following year spring or else leadership of the family will pass on from the mother to the 2nd son *ack* (haha) Walter and I guess Bocchan himself still can't marry Alice for the same reason, that curse of physical contact. So yeah, hopefully we will get somewhere with this series and not Walter romancing a woman lol why but yeah, can't wait for more <strike>Inorin</strike> Viola action I love getting talked down to by a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>younger sister</a> lmao wait what (Hey, best scene in season 1, okay? <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1672235297487323140?s=20" target=_blank>I voted on it</a>)<li>Okay whoever wrote the summary for <b>"Dark Gathering"</b> I read until "ghosts love him" and I'm done lol<li>Not even Tomita Miyu as main girl will make me watch <b>"Ayakashi Triangle"</b>. Heck, "AYAKA" just now is still better lmao this is just caressing girls lol<li>Okay maybe this is the next hype thing after "BLEACH" haha remember when I said FIVE sequels? The 5th one on the line is the 5th (deja vu) season of <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Summer%202023%20Preview/Bungou%20Stray%20Dogs%205th%20Season%20.jpg target=_blank>"Bungo Stray Dogs"</a></b> [Premieres July 12th, 2023] where hopefully we can catch that dude holding the final page of the book so the world doesn't collapse to ruin. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> If this even piques you just a bit you can give it a chance because damn is this by far still the next best action series I'm interested in the 15 years I watched Anime after "BLEACH". Says a lot about this literary author name-based human-extension-of-power series since it aired in 2016 but hey, I guess I like this more than the average viewer, who knows.</ul><div>Oh wow that's it, huh. Also, super long writeup again. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, having to deal with (for me) record-breaking FIVE sequels this upcoming season is already a pain, and I have a couple of series I'm interested including AN ACTION SERIES?? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I need to reconsider my weekends now if I want to watch all of this. Oh hey Saturday I see you are open lol</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, let's finish the rest! Insomniacs is not gonna end this early though so that sucks haha then again it can't suck there's kissing in it-</div><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SkiLo12><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Skip to Loafer</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"She looks very intimidating when she's angry!" I mean, that's most women. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div></blockquote>Oh yeah, it's sad time. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Hey, as much as I don't want to see this, we gotta move on, me. In this final episode of a lovely series I would recommend my sis to watch (#SkiLo12), I think the only thing I got out of this is... Can't we reflect on the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/minikui target=_blank>ugly</a> past as we see the beautiful present? Hey, Ririka-san? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey F**K YOU, understand? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Now that I got the venting out of the way, let's talk about Shima's mother. She's scared. Well, she's scared after being scared off by Ririka-san so I think that's not on her but this b*tch Ririka- We need an abbreviation for this woman I'm going to mention her a lot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I like to believe the mom reflected on her own actions after being relieved from the stress that is marriage and still be proud that his son can finally live his own life once again... until this Ririka had to remind her about the past. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Can we just erase this woman, really? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No, not the mom, we still need someone to take care of Keiri-kun. Anyways, not like these two women are alone Shima's bestie Chris is there to fill him in on the details and confirm his suspicions, and I guess he really can't do much about it... apart from telling her <b>to move on</b>. Yes, in case you didn't understand what Shima was conveying to Ririka at the alleyway after the class play, this is probably what he meant. To move on, to stop dwelling on the past even if it's his entire fault. And that's why Shima mentioned about helping Ririka get over how she feels being hurt by the guy for whatever reason we don't need to know, and maybe it's just because, but Ririka feels this envy. She felt it real hard, and as she cries on taxi on the way home, Chris was right to mention about her persistence in wanting this childhood friend to do something about her life when just like Shima's, Ririka's life is entirely up to her. You didn't make Shima-kun yours in any capacity either so (1) why aren't you lol and (2) how have you lost to well, basically anyone else in his class? I know right, her advantage is there and I'm not talking about celebrity status (not with that middle finger lmao) but she just makes herself look bad, and I'm not talking about just her tigress image. So welp, try harder if you want him by your side again. Overall, the school festival ended well despite Shima missing his lines. Everyone ended up in a better position than they ever did even with Kanechika-senpai and that student council president which I didn't expect a lore drop even though who f**king cares lmao thanks for the flowers you jerk throwing that in the bonfire haha, and if this isn't the <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiCSyzDTMnxp0WTlSaiMX-An_TDDVhQReS6j6S6Xb78K5RW8fFJL9wzXgX-MNOA15FON259z7l_8iHlpuVzfoNlq7sGwtGNYFd0sBZ9TSDqHxxIbS2yEbhH1X1OCWtb2K8Xge3hXXKx3B6Ie5g0YZyFJUB6jsu1VOdUSE5doPhYHfcPhEnmpiUf6YGI3Q/s1600/yojouhan01_blossom.gif target=_blank>rose-coloured campus life</a> (lol hey Anime "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei target=_blank>Yojouhan</a>") you were expecting out of Mitsumi's trip to the capital to further her education, you... probably have a better life then they do. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, just saying, this is just plain old good for a high school life. Then again, they are in their first year of high school mine was also kinda this level of great and everything just goes downhill the following year if you don't study- ANYWAYS haha this is such a joyride, I still think my worries about like, Shima's backstory might be overrated as I see it die down as soon as Ririka-san is provocation countered right from the start. So yeah, overall really impressed by the storytelling, we are not getting a confession from Shima-kun even with the great sunset and school festival curse of love hehe, so yeah, just a typical slice of life storytelling if you are into those kinds of things like I am. For me, I'm just glad I gave this a chance. Just like how I gave myself a chance in high school- Again, first year is awesome for me too I had a great time- Okay maybe not much I was envying the couples who got laid HAHAHA oh f**k me let me go cry alone or something</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=933 data-original-width=1280 height=233 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgH0Q0HUmuL11sJ2rv4jFmLb-7n_66GTBF33vqDvcp_yrFLEpnc3Wn94_kG94mZcUKoRKhnN7ZYgj89VhNTAdFY9OHNciG9EFzpBjLb2pu5pEl-x2n7HBVcpz2DX1Tc2VRd7rX1uQEvmFpbgMHsI57tBzqU71FLebCfqEDFjQxI8kyQ3w_jnVWz0x19lf8/s320/skilo12_takamine1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Pretty much all of us after every episode of this series lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgwm1naDdFERJkOFhGrxC5atzgW1HBrQzztM-wAwG4IClViIAKGOS0bgdc_Efq1HpgMi5yIqu3XRRhANX8J_x6yB34pPgS2ZSr4J7xCi3_rYiEszeBEccznHVgMNtDxlN-xK9MWLZ4IorDn9Xo_eFMZdMakpnWazol858_0bK54fbHUssvRQwIV0TibnIw/s320/skilo12_ririka6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Celebrities when they try to hate tweet online and their manager stopping them lol<br>(Also, giving the middle finger??

I thought we are concluding the story between Nasa-kun and his wife Tsukasa and what awaits them moving on from their informal wedding ceremony up the hill. Apparently it's that, I barely had to summarize what happened anyways. They are still in the mountains where Tokiko had something to discuss with the son-in-law? Haha I don't know maybe it's the stepsister or elder to Tsukasa or something I don't even know the timeline anymore. They were interrupted by Tsukasa as usual, but at least I think later on we did get some more conclusion to what Tokiko's role as a guardian is in this series. Fast forward to the accumulation of what ended up to be the moonstone they(?) collected which stays at that mansion in that room, and Tokiko not remembering that the room is filled with nitrogen and passing out in there lol, probably knew her time might be up (I would argue otherwise she seems fit) but more of her taking care of Tsukasa herself. Thus, she passes the baton (and the stone lol) to Nasa-kun to continue the legacy of taking care of... whatever moon beast he might be holding on to that looks like a woman. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Yeah I know of original work, what of it? lol I don't) Speaking of holding, Tsukasa does have a problem with Nasa-kun hugging her and so do I when I noticed that too so let's talk about that a bit haha. To keep it short, Tsukasa was right in talking about hugging with where your hands are placed dependent on the height of the other person, so if you are taller you put your hand above the other so you can pull in closer. Hey this is a thing when you hug by the way how do I even know about this I don't remember. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>  But yeah, she's right. Also right is Nasa-kun saying she sleeps messy and we have witnessed that so many times in this series already, so please Tsukasa, don't force Nasa-kun to install cameras in the bedroom to prove his point. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, this is it huh. In the end we STILL did not get to know the full lore behind Tsukasa's story. FUCK!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, see you guys in season 3 I guess. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Man, I really didn't want this to end this way, but just like Tokiko, not like I have a choice. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Maybe we will have some way to know of this in due time, as much as we are hinted, Anime production might not have much to conceal behind that old woman after this point. Maybe. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, for the season itself, rather stale. I mean, I was here for the married couple romance and stuff and thought it will still be exciting to watch, but between just flirting around and just hanging out, I don't think I remembered much from this series up till now. Yeah, the burning of the apartment they lived in is probably more headline worthy than anything else in the series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't know dude, it's definitely dragging things out just like Tokiko talking about the 2-year period of Tsukasa helping her out with I don't know what specifically that is anyways, and we aren't even done yet! The recently announced OVA series will bring us even further into the rabbit hole of Nasa-kun's creative works it seems totally not related to the main story, and I guess at this point they are just keeping the series' name going. God forbid this will turn out to be some drag I will hate to watch at some point *looks at Attack on Titan*, so I might as well keep my mouth shut just like Nasa-kun would from listening to Tokiko, I suppose.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCrp4FFY8iESe6echTjkTr6oa73qe2GZL_XM1GpO8nFTdqndUPBy1KH6HxX33XwpRAX4MvMxVz7_Pu9UCpDXAI29W_GO9UYZF97rWWqzveLA6xnAN5UsFrc4Ptcp2rkT4-e8YPGMY6Hwxsq7FtWaABybBAIXwZfTu3gMqDEn2CPHINK39q8Y9km-Xnyn8/s320/tonikawaS212_hug1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>#RelationshipGoals<br>(Not the hug done the wrong way though lmao)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4eRF5nOEG_mnwKIuq1XrfA3diHWDGEF2oDmV2Ei6orcRnWF976kmDdAPiOmfh4NNP_UUeKlQA_Bsgh7daiFCGjkJXoSw9XSZFjyKGVGjVC23ry0AlehfnZ7Na0kM6Bahhv3atT9vF9sgsOCVK4c2Am8Om_nOB_zjnnbqB743h_I263sbkXIjXSnc5QKw/s1600/tonikawaS212_break.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW girls reject me without hesitation<br>(lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

We always start out with something depressing featuring Nakami Ganta. This time, it's the mother. Oh hey, no surprise, no mom. No, as in, we STILL don't get to see the mother, she's just not even worth seeing. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah. Like, WHY THOUGH- Anyways I really can't swallow this let alone kid Nakami who is rather cute tbh haha, so let's just move on from this single parent family sadness- AIKO-SAN NO HE CAN'T MEET THE MOM SOMEDAY SHE JUST LEFT haha song title joke. Jokes aside though, I guess this might be that episode to talk about the sadness from why Nakami can't sleep at night. The confession before the actual confession, I suppose. We better talk about that first or else we can't proceed, I tell you. So, as what Nakami mentioned in one of the nights alone with Isaki, sharing his secret about why he can't sleep at night. We all already knew it's because of something, and if you need a more detailed description of what the flashbacks have shown plus his statement, here goes. Story goes that Nakami woke up one day with the house in a mess, the housewife missing, and the kid all alone at home. A morning he wished did not happen. Probably a good enough hint of what happened because the mother left the family, and let's not talk about what is the cause since I don't think a hardworking father is good enough reason to leave the house, but hey, we don't need to know about that. Or Nakami's feelings, and how he has to deal with that day he noticed something was amiss. Nonetheless, not his fault, but now he is just scared of sleeping because he has to face this reality now, of being abandoned. Of having to see this day again. Somehow I also feel that in a generic level now, but for different reasons because you will understand that when you are a working adult, but yeah, a longer today is better than tomorrow is probably what many youngsters feel in life nowadays. I just eventually sleep because my battery sucks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Unhappy things aside, the couple (hehe) sure is enjoying their vacation out in the countryside. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Isaki is still playing around as usual even though it's rather detrimental to not have someone else like Shiromaru-senpai to take care of their belongings so they can flirt with each other- Yeah Isaki-chan the dude's carrying the camera which is the whole point of this journey; You want to hold this while he enjoys himself jumping on rocks and messing around in the water? It's so easy being best girl lol. With every passing day of them enjoying each other's company though, something's bound to happen isn't a weird thing to say at all. And to the best part. They nailed that real good though. If you missed the waves kissing each other you probably thought what I did, but if you didn't, go watch back again to understand why this is more <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span> than you would think. Because yeah, even without much reason. Without much motivation. Just from Nakami talking about his sad a** life. I gotta say though, Isaki-chan you can dry up a man's tears from just kissing? You guys should kiss more. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> This series is sad enough with stories of the past to hit pain points, we can use more of this physical contact. Sometimes you just gotta sleep together to know that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... I mean, we still got 2 episodes left who the heck knows what will happen. I know right, Kanikawa coming in with the confession. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But before that happens I guess since Isaki did the thing, that Nakami might just return the favour to Isaki after all, after they are at least done with the training camp this time around. Hopefully without the sister haha what are the chances she got dumped and came back? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, I may think too much like Nakami but hey, what's stopping me? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you next week.</div><div>[TL:DR; "What is this weird feeling?"

What is this implying hmm... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this final episode of a series I don't know what I fell in love with (#KuboSan12), well in my defence we don't know how Kubo-san fell in love with Shiraishi too haha but I guess we can figure out together, yes? So, psychology tests you watch on TV. This is rather staple, girls like it, guys don't really care, but she gotta ask him so she can be pissed off by the answers delivered by someone who probably isn't even making this correctly and it's from the Internet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Have you seen actual tests before? They are long and hard to answer, by the way. Not as simple as the number of flowers in a vase- Wait a minute haha yeah I got experience on this let me flip my <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/43608/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Ultra_Romantic target=_blank>"Kaguya-sama Season 2"</a> psychological test book here... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> One flower means dedicated partner, nice. Oh, and kittens means kids, by the way. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Seriously though, what's stopping me from having as many kids as possible with <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana</a>- I'm going to get cancelled. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Oh, if I'm her husband I can, got it, thanks) (Haha) Anyways, this is a very woman thing, so as Shiraishi said, better to take it with a pinch of salt. Like, a small pinch. As in no salt at all so just don't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We also found out a little more from the sister Akina about the date of her sister with her boi haha, as apart from learning how to drink coffee at a café if you would recall the previous episode, she also went full on lady mode making sure her image is perfect for her boi. It's her boi after all- Why am I getting excited over this haha <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> and even asking her sis to do her hair for her which thank you very much indeed (hehe) so that we can have the peak of this series be last week. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, we should not forget about Shiraishi's birthday since literally no one will remember since no one will ask him haha <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span>, but Kubo-san remembered. And that is all it matters, isn't it? Now he has to return the favour haha I will just ask her out and she will be so high it doesn't matter what you give her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah call me Love Master, thanks. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We also got some flashback on the start of the school term a year ago of why Shiraishi is barely noticed in class, since he was back in middle school with Tama-chan apparently. Kubo-san over time probably felt bad if that is not surprising to anyone, that he has always been neglected in class haha I mean even a nice class chairperson wouldn't even know where to start, and thus I guess, she felt the sense of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yuuetsukan target=_blank>superiority</a> over this man that she has never felt before just teasing him and such. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> What did I say about Kubo-san being a sadist? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Overall though, I still think this series is a joy to watch. It's simple slice-of-life romance, dude. Anyone with a heart can get into this. Just, you know, just like Shiraishi isn't for everyone and not like you will notice how good this series can be until you actually see it. So yeah, not everyone's cup of coffee <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> but I enjoyed it, and just like other series like this, I'm glad they had enough material to talk about the smallest of things that made the series stand out, namely Shiraishi being invisible (lol I would argue Sudou is probably more invisible in this series than him) and the problems he faces in life which, of course includes people not noticing him in class. Again, would have made of a better joke in many other contexts, but this is at its most pure, and probably, this is what it should have been, for what it offers. Everything else just falls in nicely though, side characters, music and animation and everything... it's just something I did not regret watching. I would not expect a proper ending so yeah this is just it, but I feel like I've already felt so much more than whatever... friendship? That goes between them we don't really need more hehe we cannot get Kubo Nagisa to confess to the guy this logic doesn't exist haha</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyj2GLHPI9AZQIribAngneiuxwhBwdUqCAS6iNewaEcLyxI6yP6n8v3e-fLDUcGRCuwGjptzon0TP74dzRT9HIGmz8Xrn5BxmztwML0chfjRD59OIjQUhaxkTTNLKgedn-halTj-EGUIMET_Ty6xCJgvZEcyYrNulfZl4_UPJm98NoH4A9fPVALmhbwLo/s320/kubosan12_meter.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Do you think,<br>most Anime main characters,<br>have this meter on them?<br><span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXzL5UNQrkQciTMcRx78AWFRkBNlAYdOltim_vkKB7OshJkSVlIas9GdSL73z6q-BFNL4q03tS_d5GyWH1KXY5izTcTrT9WMDtt0a4KzbrA_G8kX-l5U39wXZukT1qqZb8BAAod4uBoOLnQjOco4XtmRcTc8dEHOep9vpaqUW8vNXdMyq37o46ExBTd54/s320/kubosan12_shiraishi2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Anime without context lmao<br>(Also by Anime logic that cute bear can't kill you-)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I missed a good enough generation of songs I can use a not nostalgia trip. Yeah, just a trip. Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1671417668417769472?s=20" target=_blank>they cute</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Then again, that's all I can say because damn did mainstream not hold up as I skip <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/bluebell-ep/1688165502?l=en" target=_blank>Cider Girl's new single</a></b> altogether not even giving the topic song before <a href="https://twitter.com/cidergirl_info/status/1671488435394330624?s=20" target=_blank>the music video</a> even released, and focused on giving <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%8D%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8-%E3%81%9A%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8/1691042465?i=1691042466&amp;l=en" target=_blank>one of fumika's digital singles</a></b> and mostly <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/i-say-no-ep/1690318999?l=en" target=_blank><b>cinema staff's new EP</b></a> because damn I am an old man who can only listen to familiar melodies and cannot indulge in new stuff. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> You know that's not true, you know. Also I listened to <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB-feat-asmi/1687469313?i=1687469322&amp;l=en" target=_blank><b>wacci's new song</b></a> with guest vocalist asmi-san for some reason and uh... let's move on haha<br><br> Finally, we can talk about new music announced on Twitter (or old ones) that will get be interested in the rest of the year, honestly. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ORESKA_Official/status/1671171047498870784?s=20" target=_blank>ORESKABAND's new song</a></b> which is their 2nd this year isn't too bad after all, can't wait for their major release though. Don't ask me how I'm coping with <b><a href="https://twitter.com/mol_74/status/1672560266192769024?s=20" target=_blank>mol-74's new song previews</a></b> and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/mol_74/status/1671473043527573504?s=20" target=_blank>mol-74's new music video</a></b> reveal which is also the first full song reveal for their upcoming mini-album because I'm already all in on this so ask me again next week how I feel when it's all (partially) out. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1671464645276884992?s=20" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new EP is for Anime</a></b> no surprises there but the full-on release is rather surprising and we still have a track list with an unknown guest vocalist so I suppose we will find out in due time. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPYAIRSTAFF/status/1672530446452948993?s=20" target=_blank>SPYAIR is releasing a new song next week which features the new vocalist</a></b> apart from the <a href="https://twitter.com/SPYAIRSTAFF/status/1671895826250227715?s=20" target=_blank>remaster versions of their classics</a> just to you know, detach themselves from the old profile and move on to a new image so hopefully it's working. Might be weaker, but working. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1672417406361440256?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's new song will be for a television series</a></b> she will be a guest in next month so don't ask me when a full version will be released, I have no answers for that. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1672562710733799424?s=20" target=_blank>Kitou Akari announced a new single</a></b> for Anime to end her recent live tour which was up this weekend with <a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1672891700266811392?s=20" target=_blank>surprising highlight from the fan audience</a> so if you don't get the joke I can't help you at all, <a href=https://jisho.org/search/maji target=_blank>not joking</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1672620594633003009?s=20" target=_blank>SPECIAL OTHERS' new song</a></b> is as confusing as some of the earlier ones so I'm not commenting on it any further. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1672577309478629377?s=20" target=_blank>TrySail's new music video</a></b> and <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1672258459448795141?s=20" target=_blank>title song release</a> for their upcoming album is full steam ahead, doesn't mean it's good at all by any measure, so I may skip this song after all. I will still put faith in the album though unlike their 2nd album back then which I basically just skipped because of the topic song lol. And just announced earlier, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1672910303221420032?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new single will release mid August</a></b> with a summer theme topic song and romantic B-side so let's all wish her a happy birthday, shall we?<br><br> For next week, uh... I'm afraid to announce we have ran out of new songs to listen to- Oh, there's <b><a href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1672167815573573632?s=20" target=_blank>GLIM SPANKY's new song</a></b> and <b>The Floor's new song</b> which may also be bad? Then that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, I can use a break for next week because coming next month with the new Anime I'll be bombing my music library with new songs again because nowadays we just release digital straight away after Episode 1 anyways not like they care about sales or releasing good singles-<br><br><br><br><br> Well, now that my replacement phone from eBay coming from the US of A is a mess (THREE WEEKS TO SHIP TO SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE COUNTRY?? WHAT THE F-), let's hope this expedited one from Amazon will come in earlier (as in upcoming Wednesday) than our upcoming package where I will once again take work leave at the end of the month so man, <span class=emoji title=🙏>*prays*</span> FINGERS CROSSED because next week is going to be awesome!! I'm depending on you, capitalism and the international mail industry. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Tell me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaASqPnpq5Y" target=_blank>Capitalist Realism</a> is a thing, I don't care. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys next time pray for me if you will, and until next time... hey let's end this June with a blast! If I don't I will report in here anyways this is Web Reports after all, good news or bad I will have to do it too lol. Yeah right you only talk about how much you got just Tamaki SSR this week and stopped, and how you want to do birthday girl <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1672044173464322049?s=20" target=_blank>Taketatsu Ayana</a> in your dreams-<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Well since I tuned in to Mocho's livestream earlier I waited for a bit, ordered dinner lol it's not sushi though <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>, and watched <a href="https://twitter.com/kimisomu_anime/status/1672926528274071554?s=20" target=_blank>Anime "Insomniacs" livestream</a> where they talked about best scenes each episode up till now so yeah till 11, and I agree with most of their choices, also didn't realize this not podcast sounded so much better than I thought to be honest, such a joy to hear main guy voice actor Satou Gen laugh especially when he said his father went crazy seeing the timing of the kiss scene lol same here but I'm not this exaggerated. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Maybe I'm older than his dad haha WHAAAAATTT</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. Okay <strike>Koga-chan</strike> Loberia give me the discount pack on gems in tomorrow's livestream for the new event and I'll roll your birthday <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gacha target=_blank>gacha</a>. Promise. I can skip Tamaki's birthday-</div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
