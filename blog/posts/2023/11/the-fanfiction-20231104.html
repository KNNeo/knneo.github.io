<div class="title">The Fanfiction 20231104</div>
<div class="page-header"></div>
<div>I was just reminded today is "great (idol) support day" so I guess <a href="https://x.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1720732035671855264?s=20" target=_blank>not you Akarin</a> haha also I decided on this yesterday not knowing any of these so not you also Ayachi though I would argue I'll support the latter more than who we will be talking about today. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of which, we have a new story to tell, this one's a sequel, still featuring a married woman which will be the theme for the rest of the month haha it's ok if you haven't figured out by now, so let's proceed with another episode in this 2nd season(?) of a series where fictional me encounter and interact with women I adore. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Hanazawa Kana in a blue crochet top donning a gray jacket, holding a piece of bread of a face with eyes as holes" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=359 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/g3291134.jpg title="Hanazawa Kana" width=140></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>A few days after I helped a certain lady seek shelter from the sudden pouring rain, I have been contacted by someone who said they were the talent manager of Hanazawa Kana, and would like to meet up in thanks for my kind act back then. Upon noticing the opportunity I have created for myself, we agreed to meet up the following afternoon.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>We met up in city center, and with some egging from Kana-chan, we eventually settled for a famous bakery which they frequent. They ordered a table's worth of bread and a couple of drinks to go with, it was quite a spectacle. Kana-chan held up a piece of bread which looks like a human face and smiled at me. I pointed a finger towards my face, and she burst out laughing while attempting to apologize.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>Since then, it felt like between Kana-chan saying <abbr title=食べて、食べて！>"Eat up, eat up!"</abbr> and her talking to the manager, I think she might have been embarrassed from her behaviour earlier. This was such a treat in many layers, I skipped dinner that evening.</i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>So yeah, some proper conclusion(?) to this weird relationship between fictional me and Kana-chan, by the way. Isn't she some famous Japanese voice actress? Really, me, this is it though?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, at least they returned the favour despite all the formality, I guess this is just a reason for me to be elusively involved in <a href="https://x.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1230298398135242757?s=20" target=_blank>her bread addiction</a> as I would love to point out as one of her attributes. Still, we have seen her being rather improper on camera (lmao) so I thought seeing her being shy and demure and so pure (lol) will probably do some good on my heart. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Kana-chan is a lovely individual, isn't it? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Boy am I still frustrated at my dinner out just now because not only did my food take up to 45 minutes to serve and I don't want to even question why, but also all this time I have been sitting beside the table of a rich jerk who is (vaguely and incorrectly) explaining to someone on the next table (by the way) about investments and doing big things in life, I want to beat him to show him what's up. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe I'll sleep this out and tomorrow will be better, eh? <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S.Perhaps the only consolation was the group of Japanese girls (you read that right) queuing in front of us, and they went "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/yoshi target=_blank>Yoshi</a>" when it was their turn. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah, I'll have sex with any one of them. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
