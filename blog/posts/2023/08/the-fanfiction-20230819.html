<div>Well I did promise you a sequel so here we are!!</div><div><br></div><div>Haha if you have no idea what I'm talking about, refer to my story two weeks ago and then come back here for the continuation- Hey, I wished I didn't screw this up and do this back to back especially if we are talking about sequels but heck, Anime isn't even following this rule already so technically I'm still fine. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, someone popped on that news to be relevant last week so I had to get it off- What am I even saying she is already taken lol not this one though HAHAHA</div><div><br></div><div>Might as well write this before she is though, it's hard to predict Japanese voice actresses marital status nowadays lol ikr Inorin might already be flirting with some dude for what we know-</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Minase Inori wearing a yukata holding a burning sparkler in front of her" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=360 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg944191.jpg title="Minase Inori" width=141></div><blockquote><i>After walking around the festival for a bit, I bought some sparklers for us to end the day. Well, Minase Inori told me to buy some for her to play because I am again reminded on how all this is just to repay her for saving my life and all expenses on this summer festival date are on me. She did enjoy herself though, so it was worth buying another pack.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>We played by the shed around the back nearby the shop where they sold them. The sky was dark enough to light them up yet bright enough for me to still see the ecstatic face Minase-san was making while she lit one up. She cheekily brought it to my face without me looking, I squirmed in fear and took a step back. Her beautiful smile immediately turned into a giggle but also turned into a face of worry. </i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=ごめんびっくりしちゃって。大丈夫？>"I'm really sorry for scaring you. Are you alright?"</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>She moved up to me and I nodded in embarrassment. I did the same thing to her afterwards as she was preparing to light up another sparkler.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The theme song for this week's story is likely <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%8F%E5%A4%A2/1263776647?i=1263776650&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>Minase Inori's "Natsu Yume"</a> and boy was that quite a song to describe this occasion. Well, just the situation at hand, not the benefactor part in case you totally forgot about how this might have happened not in real life. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Nonetheless, since we didn't know each other well anyways we are technically acquaintances, so cheeky Inorin can only happen in fiction, right? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Man, I wish summer festivals were like this for me, all we have here are Hungry Ghost festivals- Maybe I just want to date Inorin after all hehe oh you bet I'm going to continue this lore someday because as a benefactor is there any end to repaying this? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you then.</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction"><span class="material-icons small-icons">category</span>The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
