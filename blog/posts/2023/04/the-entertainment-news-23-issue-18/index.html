The latter I may want to take a break I don't know haha<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SkiLo04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Skip to Loafer</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"It feels so nice when you can head to school early" Yeah, don't have to stress out about being late lol my anxiety please no</div></blockquote>Okay, noted, Kanechika being the bad guy this episode. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey bro you can't blame on innocent girl and that's why they need to be protected in this new episode (#SkiLo04), boy is some guy is going to accidentally join the drama club for no reason. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Don't worry, not happening anytime soon, and as Mitsumi almost killed herself over just doing a quiz in school and spacing out while getting hit with a volleyball lol, it's pretty obvious even to the blind that someone is distracted about something, and she talks to Shima about what she heard of Kanechika-senpai's plans to rail him in. Of course, he still rejected on all grounds, now stating that when he was child acting and appeared on television, he was doing it all for his mother, and thus did not gain any further interest in pursuing the career. Same bro, literally same story, but mine was more of a standstill because it set me to the biggest challenge in acting of my kid life: love. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha, Kanechika got shot down real good, with Mitsumi refusing to tell him the reason, just like a good friend. I mean, Shima may not have any goals in life now but it's definitely not acting with you dressed up as a woman in that skit we saw before. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Though I gotta say? Mitsumi-chan has more life goals than we have. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Spiritual fulfilment, you know. I guess this is part of it but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, second half is probably what took the spotlight this time around, where apparently lazy teacher told Mitsumi that a certain student council senpai is more capable than her (the teacher) (lol) in terms of discipline and so Mitsumi chose to follow Takamine-senpai for a day in her tightly scheduled life. Hey, Takamine-senpai? I can see your ego shining from another galaxy now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Turns out, if you can believe it, Mitsumi ended up dragging her feet all the way into the sunset, from suggesting the idea of looking at someone's farm even though we are just going to their place to give handouts for the day, to missing the bus and letting the cat pass the time with them... yes I know these are very countryside things to do and or experience otherwise considering everyone has a house visit rule longer than the time Takamine would've set, and 15 minute intervals are uber fast in city bus schedules... once in a while it's just great to take a break out of that pace and you know, hand in an empty quiz answering sheet once in a while haha Mitsumi you think this will drop her grades? Even the sensei isn't worried in a bit she doesn't even care. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... Takamine-senpai is cool, isn't she? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, not going to be too biased on this, but hey between Shima taking his life as a joke now and people like Mitsumi and Takamine having goals and setting themselves straight all the time even at their teens... don't worry I am not even close to these guys. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, as you can see, they are teaching each other stuff here and there, and that's what makes this slice-of-life drama good, isn't it? Yes, and so it is. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also, definitely first time heard of so much Tsuda Minami that does NOT sound like her. Yes, you heard that right, Takamine is voiced by her. Seriously, this series blows my mind every episode, and I can't wait for more stories to cry to or be happy about.</div><div>[TL:DR; "What does having no regrets even mean?" Yes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, look at me. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBNjGdotiGxwfkugA48S1Yj_p_GOS-eXJ8SORpeTNXtiQhxopos9_Lk8c3V0ux8tXrvZ8JlURw8KAiEWbYZSH-LWvyfIB27mQWBJz4i_IWe49Wg4RxHZBjzyU2XcKSGLDqsQ6cMgkehzpuYFGpGn-VMHKQ9kOTXgCtBtGDIniZ2cYwpYjoiIZuIBwI/s320/skilo04_office.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This b*tch can do Office better than 90% of people in this world, prove me wrong</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqO8JxdtYTgjhxMHlNz5AT2DWaeRLdxWYWSW1emt-lav9bQSUX66mkzqc7T9K02hWTcqgJs2gVO0QbYGmx57mh-3BxOj6pJFDmqnBYbTX6GAUgyqhv5YIktTwjDfowQ0EThcf3CSWufHNo-zCJAO-SNFqjSGJTNOufDFBieokXcX3DXrnqppWp5xLa/s1600/skilo04_volleyball.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Haha BONK<br>(Shout out to that Tumblr page back then which posted just Anime characters getting hit by volleyballs lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha yeah same <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Okay ominous intro summary drop, what is going to happen from here on? Haha I doubt anything just yet, but in this new episode (#ToniKawaS204) it's all about kissing apparently. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I didn't come up with this storytelling, go ask the author and the scriptwriter for the Anime. Anyhow, let's talk about what happened. For starters, the couple are complimenting each other again. Nasa-kun was so capable of anything he helped fix the vacuum cleaner for Kaname, and even went out of his way to create high school study material for Aya-chan who of course, in her record of failing tests and procrastination skills, will likely not pass the exams yet again but that's not our concern lmao, is still able to do all this while working on this coding stuff which honestly is impressive- My ideal life will be Yuzaki Nasa, honestly. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> On the other hand, we have the caring wife who is scared of doing anything in public lol not assassin or swordswoman lore drop, is kind enough to give a massage to the husband for working long hours in front of the computer which is known to cause a number of problems which is basically where I ache all over right now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Nasa-kun is as usual thinking of all the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>pervy</a> stuff, but not as pervy as Kaname-chan who seriously needs a partner so she can stop searching online for stuff about how to kiss and where to kiss. Or maybe we buy her a sex doll, I don't know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, she kindly listed all of them and gave it to the guy in hopes of him doing something about the wife? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Can this series not be less straightforward lol thanks Hayate for the example kissing literally everyone knew about the author of this series having to write the "Hayate no Gotoku" series in their past when we are all kids. Now that we are married lmao, I guess upping the game isn't too hard, the kissing haha, but I guess doing all this in public is still kinda embarrassing but not for the Yanagi-sensei couple so we will ignore that lol that kiss is so long they have time to hide in a bush, so they decide to just do it at home. Or when Kaname-chan also printed a copy of the list for Tsukasa lmao f**king why Kaname go get yourself a man or something. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, they kissed, many times, on the chest too but with clothes on and that's why this is not a porno haha Nasa-kun you don't think too far in, and that's probably what this is all about. Marriage. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, entertaining episode as always, next time stop with the introduction summary if it's not about Tsukasa's lore drop haha seriously though, and boy Aya-chan is beyond hope just like me. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> It's simple how this series has been so far even with new characters, and I know this is still before the drop, and likely next week too looks like we are going to the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/onsen target=_blank>hot springs</a> even though we kind of live in one lol... but hey, not that I'm complaining, but the budget for this second season seems low. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> If it can still deliver then I'll still see it till the end just like how I dealt with "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/44204/Kyokou_Suiri_Season_2 target=_blank>Kyokou Suiri</a>" last season that also wasn't as ground-breaking as any would have hoped. Mediocre, I guess. It's still funny and stuff as long as these two stay in the hot springs, so that's good enough married life story for me. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh--83RMzHNEicLHaJFTsYgj8zeLxGbk_cgGwUb1T_5auLlifTSjVuDFSQ4aZZ0M3lou_BsQBbL6Bb-EekXnWjBV10y1mtdHzAvLyMhlTeUcn0MFrg36nd8ZLtBBzoV2NOuOt6J-jYoKcYGWHZz9pYEdAgVd-9FlvPu7Zb2Adq7cZ6qKC3S8vLpSpny/s320/tonikawaS204_code.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Python programming language, by the way.</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHZATQMj7_5KjJ1zLP1AiQOelchlOKFLk7vPj6ZzXKNszwvA_nXIPD883XxOOPZyNVnTd8qxot1_Wt7GLshhDwrWbF_tNWO2yJAIRaGO5rWXxkr5KH-m1ZIRQ_Y2-VjAbXdBTZBdpk2VggRQs0ROCPG4jZe_HDWOZJ4m-nCpLWqykrrfUHo59_UxsD/s320/tonikawaS204_kiss1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Hayate no Gotoku, by the way.</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGubviQqsRen6kkNLRpLaG3MogEv1YgfmfhdcDm5FPjw1Dp6vEnfOS4MPBpEDPRZWJBTwBuUwqXqPNwQjxIXu1ZDcGe9SS1SqxdjyeX-nice42vrsq7GT_302jEQ-AxzQt6-NxqzkNBV-BxGoywq18u5O3QIqXwGkj5uIKEjLwrKKFc9w_8wEBoRMG/s320/tonikawaS204_kiss7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Tsukasa is 3 months pregnant, by the way.<br>(<span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Not at night though, we can't with just the two of them lol. In this new episode though (#KimiSomu03), we introduce another loner- Hey me, don't call people loner like I'm not one. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, because this "club" thing still needs to run like one in this school who touted themselves to have one of these clubs some time ago until it's revived by these two, the sensei and advisor Kurashiki told them that in order to fulfil the requirements for presentation in the upcoming September meeting club president Nakami will have to attend, they will have to come up with some event and/or some achievement to show that they have been using the observatory and not use it to camp indoors- What the- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Kurashiki only knows of the "last" member of this club Shiromaru (who is voiced by an embarrassed <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/890/Haruka_Tomatsu target=_blank>Tomatsu Haruka</a> I'M IN lol it has been 15 years dude, relax) who of course is an alumni working now in the countryside, so the two have to track long enough to find... it's a her apparently, working at basically an arcade. Hey, who doesn't desire this life, innit? She invited them in to her small abode which is basically a container haha what's the difference between this and living in an apartment nowadays, she whipped up dinner for them and told them a story about her sad high school life. Basically, it would have been more cool if these 3 were in the club at the same time, but sadly she is left alone after all the senpai graduated, leaving her really having all the rights to be in the observatory without having to do anything, unlike these two. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Then again, the times have changed I don't know for how long Shiromaru here doesn't look that young lol, but these kids really do not know anything about even taking photos of the stars (and the girl Isaki-chan hehe don't tell), so the senpai gave them a crash course and sent them on their way. Including her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> If you recall earlier in the episode also, she did come into school to find the observatory likely only to think that the Astronomy Club has been disbanded and the location being used as a warehouse... until now. So yeah, why not, everyone has memories of this location, and no one is actually willing to let it go not with this cute girl around lol I'm talking about Isaki-chan <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> so might as well make the best out of all of this, yes? Yeah basically thanks to Nakami's efforts Isaki will be able to get more comfort items in the observatory to aid their sleep together- Ahem, just pitch your tent in already, Nakami. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Nakami's plan for now, is to aim for an upcoming meteor shower coming into the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ishikawaken target=_blank>Ishikawa Prefecture</a> where they are at (yes, it's real), use the summer camp to find a good spot and also learn to take photos of the stars by then since there is a popular spot to do so maybe better than the one photo Shiromaru sent to them at night haha, and hopefully take good photos enough to submit to the nationwide photo-shooting contest later in the year. All in all, wow that is a lot of things to expect just within the school year alone. We solved our sleeping problem with Isaki-chan, we chanced upon the observatory (lol), and now we are actually doing photo-taking stuff in school at night. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, can't be peeping in the day when you are indoors in the observatory and taking photos of sleepy main girl, amirite?? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah Shiromaru, I would like you to not tell anyone about this? Haha she won't just take pictures of her and she will leave lol I'm liking this dynamic already to be honest.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoMkAwZPqMF4k9intVztzEroebMyTcdi7aAxxdz-9cvUEPQTVvVN_aV0CpYrLa8z53KQJ-_Py91jjVKQPGQe3GOFqFFYU6bAtTqyYhgPpGVo10smA1WSd90_0nDpWhTupWrFRtV_kQGaWlXfp6fzFRmlqIVDU0CB4JJhGvN8OrQ5Sj37qmqpDn4SoX/s320/kimisomu03_bra.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Why am I not even surprised when they slapped one of these moments in an Anime haha ah</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirq6bFCgKj9Nr6_dyWKxhNRjJJnq803yNSM15lWoD7SyBPyVU-9pstoN1UBU6XHvUPXiJCaT0WMCU5jMd1_Ga_XlDDK4PnEMCnP_eTisf_eJ4eRXAqJ1t5PcWaTBrZa1GUUpzJB_hqtozAO8y3uBKTuM7lWnFvOSdvnMpK-M7bM3TUp-Z4ekigd4W3/s320/kimisomu03_camera1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Haha I see this is still there from Episode 1</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1440 data-original-width=1280 height=360 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8ueFeTL52jVncV1qHZZiYBURAJqE_ztjcrjuqSiMRKrq5SDq_XCOF13zKyguPN4jp6JzGzVfDxN9Je_EHwMk29AthqSTAJtiCJtq2ZSKAllPYJq5YLaKN-heusSNXPrIb49BfUNCkpSOSGqHv2ihPrhRregvkp4kmv3YUHHJ3OnwDQFl_YO_rGSjQ/s360/kimisomu03_camera2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>TFW people found out the person you like lol<br>(Shiromaru: I have your secret now <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Yes, I have officially ignored UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's new album we will not talk about it from here on I assure you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, it's probably because <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/fantasic-partner-shuen-no-destiny-ep/1681078364?l=en" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's new single</a></b> was that good as I gave BOTH SONGS in the single but thank goodness not have to pay for anything further out of my own pocket as I do not review Limited Edition only releases. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I don't know why this idolism did not make a Regular Edition but who knows they don't want my money I suppose. The songs are actually great though, accented by Mai-chan's lyric-writing it only got better if you understand the words. Yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eofX5uTXRHU" target=_blank>dating simulator music video</a>, thanks for the reminder. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><br><br> Now that I realized this segment is purely dedicated to music news on Twitter that I can relate to because I can only care about new releases and/or new online music content since I don't live in Japan and cannot enjoy the live they had over the weekend or something. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I like how we are closer to <a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1650451197650939904?s=20" target=_blank>RYTHEM's best album</a> coming in a few weeks and all we have is just a cover art lol it's fine I'll listen to it when it comes anyways. Also did not realize <a href="https://twitter.com/lucklife_info/status/1635974854263603201?s=20" target=_blank>LUCKLIFE is releasing a best album</a> in July for their 15th anniversary so I have no idea what the tracklist is but it might have songs from their indie days that I do not know of so I'll listen to it when it comes. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1650514943991762944?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new song</a></b> is uh... not going to get me hyped but who knows what will happen when the single releases in a couple of weeks so don't take my words for it just yet. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/homcomi/status/1650522743086137350?s=20" target=_blank>Homecomings' new music video</a></b> for Anime "KimiSomu" takes a lot of references from the animation itself picturing a couple walking alone in the night streets, so not much and as I said I let the Anime bring the impression of this song to me anyways. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1650514942498607104?s=20" target=_blank>SPECIAL OTHERS' new track</a></b> is probably their best so far leading up to the new album in October but not enough for me to give a thumbs up. Hey, maybe they do have something prepped up at the back that is good, who knows. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1650847121481011205?s=20" target=_blank>yanaginagi's new collaboration song</a></b> is not as impressive as <a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1651618395685810177?s=20" target=_blank>her new song for Anime</a> and it's the Anime which got her major debut running but both aren't my thing to be frank. Didn't realize "With ensemble" is a thing until <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1651215154099650560?s=20" target=_blank>miwa sang her emotional song with an orchestra</a></b> on that YouTube channel which is rather impressive to be honest not many have the budget to hire such instrumental backing. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1651905486751666178?s=20" target=_blank>SHE'S new song</a></b> is a meh but we are barely starting and as a reminder their new album is releasing end of next month, so I'll catch up. I don't feel like <b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1651904366398554115?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL's new music video teaser</a></b> will get me anywhere but regardless I'll give it chance again since two months ago. This is rather interesting as <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sphere_PS/status/1651877016977940480?s=20" target=_blank>Tomatsu Haruka is releasing a new song</a></b> after being dormant for so long and no prizes for guessing it's for a Sword Art Online slot game (get it?) so that's impressive in itself again, is releasing in a couple of weeks too. If you missed <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1652266088657481728?s=20" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's 2nd live tour broadcast on YouTube</a></b> don't worry to pour salt to your wounds I saw a bit of it and bailed yesterday. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I've watched it before, so don't mind me. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1651919532326551553?s=20" target=_blank>RYTHEM's new ASMR video</a></b> is of a song I know too well, and if you have not seen them on the streets of Shibuya lol not that I have but I've watched them live on YouTube, SpecialThanks' new live video on the streets is a familiar song from a few years ago which easily can rock the paths out there even now. And to end this I feel like I want to talk about this, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/studyplusinc/status/1651391964133347329?s=20" target=_blank>Sambomaster is 2nd on the entrance exams music artist rankings</a></b> which is impressive considering artists like Mrs. GREEN APPLE (expected) and Arashi (<span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span>) are up there too. It's likely <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/dekikkonaiwo-yaranakucha/1537414929?i=1537414939&amp;l=en" target=_blank>the one song</a> if you do not know, by the way. </div><div><br>For next week though, after probably giving a listen to <b>Ikimonogakari's new song</b> which damn I'm already so over with them lol, it has been 2 years since the last time I did this too so I may take this time to visit <b>Hololive solo artist music</b> again. Yes, not the group ones because I legit do not care. I'm already starting with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/chandelier/1640044138?i=1640044139&amp;l=en" target=_blank>Murasaki Shion's song from last year</a></b> so let's see if I can find more gems. Honestly saying, why can't Shion-chan her sing in her normal voice which is actually cuter than her personality voice now by the way. Yeah, basically reverse of what <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/uso-no-hibana/1537740115?i=1208915319&amp;l=en" target=_blank>96neko</a> did with <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/majide-bi-bi-da-boo/1537751875?i=1292546275&amp;l=en" target=_blank>that one song which blew my mind</a> haha<br><br><br><br><br></div><div>Wow am I just rushing the above so much I barely have time to think of anything else mainly also because I spent too much time just this weekend or the weekdays also fixing my GitHub Pages site without much reward besides self-gratification? Yeah, that'll be enough. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you guys next week then, we are going to start May real strong with a bunch of posts for #KN15YEARS which... I've not done much of and that's why I'll have to cram them tomorrow so I can start this off right haha so see you then for more random talk about my life of music, and until then... I think DMM Point Club gave me a reason to go clock walking steps now. 6000 steps for a chance to get 10 yen? I'M IN lol will report progress if any next week lmao don't expect too much though I probably will not go anywhere <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
