Okay okay this one I HAVE to write down it was so good I can remember a lot of it now so let's do it we have references from places I don't even know:<div><br></div><div>"We were at a theme park finishing our rides until we missed one as we see the rides close one by one. (It was featuring office chairs hopping through bumps on the ground in pairs?) We were like why not and decided to form rows of two to try it out. But there was a check on wearing accessories like rings in order to prevent accidents, hinting on those who don't on the same row? The first row both had accessories so that was fine. Second row only I had a ring (which I don't IRL) and the row behind me only RumiRumi had rings on her right hand. As such, we both moved to the same row. But then, the organizer decided to move us around to reorganize us instead, and I promptly grabbed her hand and moved her in front of me.</div><div><br></div><div>"Ah but I don't want to let you go", I said (in Japanese) while grabbing on to both her hands, of which she then came up with many reasons to shake me off including talking about how she would only attract ugly men and I referred to myself (lol) and I kept saying how much I wanted her until she eventually gave up. (I wish I can remember the whole conversation but) I embraced her and she did the same too.</div><div><br></div><div>I then woke up (in my dreams) sleeping in embrace with her, tucked nicely with my head aptly placed on her left shoulder, just enough space for me to breathe. The regular stress of a headache was nowhere to be found: It was as if being in embrace with her did the trick. It also felt like she was still sleeping, so I did not dare to move lest I wake her up. But I felt like this would be a moment to remember so I struggled to find my phone within reach and took tons of selfies with me and her on bed while a live video(?) of what looked like ClariS performing on Christmas was playing on the background of my phone (lol). I then sent some of them promptly to my buddy to show him of my current situation."</div><div><br></div><div>And yep, of course I checked my phone again when I actually woke up and... Man, Ookubo Rumi I wish we were together I'll wear as many rings on my fingers as you want me to. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Aw that was a great time wasn't it? I wish I remembered the conversation I really tried to recall but as I write this I forgot so thanks for writing it this detailed, me. Have a great Friday, everyone. May your dreams be half as good as mine haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. References in this dream are likely I only recently went to a theme park last month and that's why I was reminded with Christmas stuff but don't ask me why ClariS maybe their winter track cover album hit me, and I was putting Aizawa Saya wallpapers all week so you tell me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe that is Saya-chan though I did hug not her (ie. bolster) real right last night. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I didn't exactly know who it is I did wake up saying RumiRumi between my lips though hehe</div><div><br></div><div>The chairs reminded me of work though and I'm currently outside of office for two weeks so <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> haha</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheDreams"><span class="material-icons small-icons">cloud</span>The Dreams</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
