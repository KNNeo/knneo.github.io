Sorry for the lack of the former last week we are just one day into the new year it's hard to find songs to listen to considering we are 15 years in and I can't stop rejecting melodies- But that's the reality dude, so we better do something about this before the month ends and I have to deal with a storeroom of new releases I may or may not like lol</div><div><br></div><div>So let's! We got action, we got romance again because I can't get around the fact that I want love but still want to be single-<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BungouStrayDogs38><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bungou Stray Dogs</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"This is a story of a man's struggles and his growth... and of parenting" Wait what was that last part?</div></blockquote>"From now on, I work alone" is literally me when I walk out of the house. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, I may share some similarities with the Prez so don't mind me. So about the new season of this wonderful action series (#BungouStrayDogs38) I guess we are starting with flashbacks. Well, flashback in flashbacks if they are keeping at this rate lol but yeah, it's about Fukuzawa, the Prez of the Detective Agency. And Ranpo, the first apprentice, what looks like. And he's too real dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I meant Ranpo. He's so real, he will see through me even if I'm watching a video of him in it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, let's talk about why. Fukuzawa was still working for the police (instead of WITH the police, take note) as an assassin and is taking on another job of a murder done very recently, and looking around at a dude filing papers on the ground lol, a culprit apprehended and placed inside a room all on his own, separated by a bunch of papers because they are on the ground. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, even if you aren't Ranpo with his deduction Ability (or not, he doesn't need it) to see the truth, you may have figured how could some top gun assassin sit in a room all by himself without any law enforcement. So yeah, to be fair, I am also close to detective material but Ranpo will expose me for doing weird stuff in my room like opening packages haha, so we shall leave it at that. But Ranpo wouldn't, as seen he was just here for an interview from the guy who was the victim at the scene of the crime. And the real culprit is sorting papers in a lab coat. Dude, who would've figured that out if you aren't a high schooler? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, after just treating him to a meal Fukuzawa soon realized this kid has potential of exposing everyone's lies including his lol too real dude, so maybe killing him first might be a good option- I'm more surprised why isn't he dead at this point. Bro, you know how society works? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe I know too much about how society works too. But hey, that's why you are on your own finding a job and never sitting on one for long. Man, imagine if I talked cr*p *ahem* about the truth of the co-workers around me. I will not be seeing the day of light. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Despite all the seriousness in the mystery and we are already embarking on another job in the theatre, the comedy is clearly seen by just Ranpo all by himself lol comedy relief we call him, but also that he is just super observant and has vast knowledge about events that are happening without even looking at the newspaper longer than I do which is none. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Just that, is already a good enough reason to keep him by your side, dear swordsman. Ironically is that, is where Ranpo will be then be of use and/or have a reason to get out of working for someone someday. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> All in all, we are at a stage where truth drop here, cat transfiguration god isn't here yet haha if you would recall from the previous season where the forces had to play peace in Yokohama because of him, so there really isn't much to protect for now apart from maybe just this kid who can solve mysteries and why he himself isn't opening a Detective Agency just yet. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey maybe he will someday, he might need some protection if he reaches that stage. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Too much to talk about just in flashbacks, but impressive setup for the story so far ruined by Ranpo-san's straightforwardness haha, so let's see who's the criminal who will appear right on their doorstep. Literally. It's not a threat, guys; This theatre action is real. See you then.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCjuafesBY_BMhwnsMmTkNhtd3raIB0QFiZIWOvNlEmzLG69RolpFteNkrJE4-JutzhzLpEf4vYRUVHBfXrDVvnxUbUF1DyptWDcl1LAFtMPaIeiCeJEYWZ7x7rGt5O1wlRtkOmtnl_Bw2wVtD0DW8ntogPCB_LQGDU3QPpR4K0ksaYnHo3lQ8noIj/s320/bungoustraydogs38_fukuzawa4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW my mom wants me to go downstairs to help her carry her stuff<br>(lol too real)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmpvqCRVoNUmfznIDfQgzeC6O4CiVldQ_Vnj-_5_hZtpJSYHsDg03wbJJZXVBmDlBJXfwWtm1YAYllS9PFMizgxg41UKxvd8NM9vy-h2s654FzR75m30N3ME0P-Q0SorI4ewUgNE6jiVMvJQ8UtRcbfsAz4L19SkTfBBJyecQpuDQrl1jY-PjsykGb/s320/bungoustraydogs38_ranpo2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I want second serving at a friend's house but held back haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgV9dkzvXSQUc3pn2LiyUQRRpWbSEJb2RXNyc0rNFMxc5eQPaZ60538RRLZ4f7hVso01zB2O4gQpwUGDOtwcOK9W0Me6kaq-E9c9KkzZoD96Q9GQtrYMPoSPloawajdj7ba57XVTDJizJuyXTSzFjpymWUhvaYOh9C-j6TS5REGTNtqPuz9iuCobXqI/s1600/bungoustraydogs38_sighing.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Ranpo is just too real dude, I should stop watching this lol</table></div></div><div>P.S.

When I see an angel? Since I was born, dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div></blockquote>I promised to not give an Anime with a long title but look what we have gotten ourselves into. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, I'm pretty sure this guy's faking it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new series adapted from a web novel (#OtonariNoTenshiSama01) hmm how should I even talk about this. Like, even in the first scene the circumstances are already weak to start with. But yeah, considering I've seen feathers flying past my face into a girl in a playground in the rain big enough I have my umbrella open, really makes you wonder how this all even happened. Let's just say it's a matter of circumstance, okay? Anime needs stuff like this. And even so, the reaction from the girl is very bland. I mean, the thanks is there, formality, but dude, I really expected something more upfront. Well, I guess what happened from here on is more than one would expect and that's why the title drop of making the guy even more useless meeting this "angel", but yeah, feels like <a href=https://jisho.org/search/oneesan target=_blank>onee-san</a> taking care of some dude who doesn't care about his life, right? Feels like it to me though. And maybe just because of this, seeing him eating what was that, energy drinks for dinner? I mean, can it be considered eating? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So maybe yeah even if I lived alone I would still do takeaways which will explain how his place looked this bad but that is really no reason to not take out the trash... man, is this worse than "Toradora!" with <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/12064/Taiga_Aisaka target=_blank>Taiga-chan</a>? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe it's the reverse of that lol so Shiina-san here (*<a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/23405/Shiina_Natsukawa target=_blank>gets crazy deja vu</a>*) just can't help but help out this guy who can't take care of himself considering this guy is her neighbour. Well to be honest? Only like, my mom would give a damn so this is quite a thing to return the favour of I guess. Hey, just an umbrella, by the way. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, what I actually see in this series though, is that they may have just dumped an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> to this girl who doesn't care about love. <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/52865/Romantic_Killer target=_blank>I speak from experience.</a> <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Because think about it: Some guy just appeared in her life and she wants to help out all she can even like, making him food on the daily? I mean, are those even just leftovers? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> It's not like if we can see ulterior motives here, but even if you dump in all the lore that the girl is the most popular thing in school and he wouldn't even care... The girl is probably only interested in you!! Uh, I mean, let's not spoil that part yet, right? I'm not <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/132504/Ranpo_Edogawa target=_blank>a detective</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And please don't say this is a romantic comedy as I continue to point out stuff that is as disappointing as the characters themselves, I would say. Falling down landing on the wrong position (lol turn her around, bro), the guy Amane saying Shiina's cooking is good and the girl replying that everyone can make this much when I can't even cook for sh*t, and just coincidentally returning the box back every evening to get another box of leftovers for days? Hey, tell me the girl isn't trying to get herself laid. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know, this might be a misunderstanding for all we know. We may have already set the genre for this series wrongly, I might add. All in all... it feels like every time I want to clap my hands, one of my hands is missing. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Is this enough of an analogy? Haha I hope so because this really feels like me watching some light novel adaptation again with monologues and weak story pacing. Yes, like "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/49470/Mamahaha_no_Tsurego_ga_Motokano_datta target=_blank>TsureKano</a>". That's why I'm worried, I'm not prepared to watch another one of these again. More like I don't know what to watch this season, but somehow, it's not this. Hmm... maybe we try a couple more episodes this animation isn't making me tick yet I can tell you that much I'm not even THIS lazy lol try living by yourself first, me.</div><div>[TL:DR; "I can't catch my breath with you staring and putting me on edge" You know, girl, maybe that's love?

Meanwhile, thanks to Anime "Romantic Killer" I've listened to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kira-kira/1653355284?l=en" target=_blank>YURiKA's 1st album</a></b> by the way, singing Anime theme songs here and there for FIVE years and THEN got an album? The Japan music industry is harsh. Anyways, I did give it a listen and picked up a couple of songs which are clearly her best in the list so far and are Anime theme songs but aren't winning compared to the one I've given her for Anime "Houseki no Kuni" all those years ago. Yes, it has come full circle. I've given her in Anime, I'm giving her because of Anime once again. Man, she needs more recognition her singing voice is great reminds me of fhana? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/cipher/1619462299?l=en" target=_blank><b>fhana's new album</b></a> is not great though, I gave it a listen and I gave up. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I also did give an assortment of songs a listen including *deep breath* <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E8%89%B2%E5%BD%A9-single/1651594368?l=en" target=_blank>yama-san</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%8C%96%E3%81%91%E7%8C%AB-single/1656883288?l=en" target=_blank>Kitani Tatsuya</a> which I promised myself last year, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/under-my-skin-single/1650932867?l=en" target=_blank>DYGL</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/too-dry-to-die-single/1653744124?l=en" target=_blank>DENIMS</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/party-monster-bop-single/1652666484?l=en" target=_blank>a flood of circle</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/left-right-confusion-single/1633921717?l=en" target=_blank>yorushika</a> and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RnJ_g2DitU" target=_blank>anewhite music videos</a>... all without a new song added to my music library. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> I need a break from Klassic Note haha I only linked one song for each artist but I swear I listened to more than one song each before I moved on<br><br>I literally missed last week on the news on Twitter just because so let's catch up on ALL the new stuff from last year to this year and beyond! You ready?</div><div><br></div><div><b><a href="https://twitter.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1607031358920196097?s=20&amp;t=zbadwq03gzfkn4vXeUniFw" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's new song</a></b> is kinda meh I didn't have much feels on their melody by the way I'm totally in for their emo style any time of the day. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1607331666619666432?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's new music video</a></b> in collaboration with a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/bokaro target=_blank>vocaloid</a> artist is actually not too bad but we will get to her concept album when the time comes end of the month. Okay maybe not when there's talking in the song- Why is this a trend? <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1607704743031496704?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's end of year live revealed top songs</a></b> fans wanted her to sing and not surprisingly her 3rd single topic song "<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/parade/1537336348?i=1407236668&amp;l=en" target=_blank>Parade</a>" was top.

That's a OOF. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1607753350958952449?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>cinema staff's new song</a></b> is a mess as always but that's a good thing since we will listen to it again on the next major release, whenever it appears. <b>KANA-BOON's new song</b> can go screw itself the last thing I'll expect from you as always is rap. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1608342449998659584?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora announced her first self-written EP</a></b> which basically means they ran out of budget to hire composers and/or lyricists to provide her new songs lol. The only reason why I would mention Hololive again because <b><a href="https://twitter.com/HZshizuku/status/1608404150337032193?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>VTuber Omaru Polka did a cover song</a></b> of Polkadot Stingray's recent album topic song, which gained the attention of vocalist Shizuku. That's all. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I much prefer the latter's deeper voice though, so can't relate. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/VP_official/status/1608780066791505920?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>VELTPUNCH's new live digest on YouTube</a></b> from their 25th anniversary live from two months ago was the best thing I've seen ending last year so let's hope the recent single will appear on music streaming someday. Fingers crossed, people. I definitely did not miss <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1609064931621744646?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES live and documentary YouTube videos</a></b> because it was super damn complicated and the only way you would not miss them all is to be subbed to their YouTube channel. Live are removed after premiere, and wordy documentaries remain. How do they even get fans? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, nothing to talk about here moving on. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1611377298107678720?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank><b>Kitou Akari's new music video</b></a> (we are in the new year now haha) is just a cute Anime opening theme song so who can say no to that? It just has its kinks for Anime, problems I won't mention here because idolism and I like her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We will give chance when it comes by next month. Hopefully I will have time to watch <b><a href="https://twitter.com/bbb_playlist/status/1611337617274208258?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>SHE'S in a live that is streamed on YouTube</a></b> because that'll be rad but it starts early evening so I may miss it coming home next week, who knows. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1611334760139468801?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>RYTHEM's upcoming livestream is in two weeks</a></b> where they will talk about more of the group's best album after dealing with their solo albums over the new year... for people who go to the live events only, of course. I guess music streaming fans do not matter. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> <b>SIX LOUNGE's new song</b> for Anime series "Hero Academia" isn't too bad it's as simple and cool as they have always been, I won't even complain. This is hard to consolidate since I don't even watch the show but <b>Anime "NieR:Automata" theme songs</b> are from none other than <a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1611746984167079936?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>Aimer-san</a> for opening and <a href="https://twitter.com/SMARinfo/status/1608070383332106248?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>amazarashi</a> for ending. Aimer actually sounds very suitable in this to be honest it fits the heavy and emo style of the series itself, not that it'll be my cup of tea just yet. amazarashi, on the other hand, will pre-release the new song on digital next week so stay tuned for that I guess. Oh yeah also let me get this out of the way lol, also in the new year <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1609202782489436166?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>Aimer-san announced her marriage</a></b> to what was a music composer? So yeah, even if you have lost your voice one can still get laid. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/honkidance/status/1610290617422319621?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance's new live video</a></b> is only nothing short but rad so go listen to it yourself. Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" also had their music videos run live so <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SCREEN_mode/status/1610932642953973760?s=20&amp;t=vaPQaUsNY0ZepmzecPmY2Q" target=_blank>SCREEN mode's new music video</a></b> for opening is really meh from what I've heard so far so I'm just hoping <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lantis_staff/status/1610652618245931013?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank>LUCKLIFE's new music video</a></b> can fill in the gap. Maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/lantis_staff/status/1610652820352692224?s=20&amp;t=gc0JkUjQFPsBjnCI5t9XAQ" target=_blank>the other music video</a> too, eh? Yeah why not they are both good. (I look at the view count difference and I'm already... haha) Man, and only now we can talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1610652269598461954?s=20&amp;t=Hu3djhyNExUJwpht06NC0g" target=_blank><b>Uesaka Sumire's new music video</b></a> for Anime?? Ah hey apparently off-beat songs are a trend, so you tell me. It isn't bad though, not that I'm complaining about it at least. Yes, fanservice did help carry this on lol this first-person view is fantastic haha</div><div><br></div><div>Okay maybe we not skip a week of this next year. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br> So next week, since I literally just listened to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6uYq0_4ct8" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku live video on YouTube</a> which was from their indie days before their major debut album in 2020 one of the songs got me so I will give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AB%E3%82%92%E6%8A%9C%E3%81%91%E3%81%9F%E3%82%89/1281384239?l=en" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's EP from 2017</a></b> a listen. And if I can't get anything out of this then maybe I'll listen to the 2018 album.<br><br><br><br><br> I didn't watch a lot of Anime this week but damn did I listen to way too many songs just today alone. I mean, look at the above. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And looks like someone subbed the "Takagi-san" movie so maybe I'll shell out a night to watch this...? Haha good joke, me, you don't have the time. I'll do something up next week with the other half of the lot appearing. I'll see about it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys then, and until next time... looks like the only thing that is going smoothly so far is my <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gacha target=_blank>gacha</a> luck in the DOAXVV game. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, those were some good luck out there even though I didn't get the event one, okay? I'll take those chances over winning REAL money. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Maybe we spend more time to blog, yes? We have another public holiday coming up in two weeks so let's work towards that. Live to see me write something here then, would you?<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S.
