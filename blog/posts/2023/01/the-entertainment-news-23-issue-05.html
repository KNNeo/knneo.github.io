Is that what it feels for everyone? To not care about timeliness? I mean, I was on my way home and was distracted by ordering of dinner for the family but people do this on a daily basis? How the f-<div><br></div><div>Hey everyone. I really thought of taking work leave... the following week for abnormal reasons because (1) my regular Twitch streamer will be on holiday means no mornings burnt where I have to watch him play and yes it's a him which means I can actually spend more time doing my own stuff, and (2) that is when the new package will... supposedly arrive after I consolidate it... hopefully next week. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah there is a lot of uncertainty on that so maybe I would not do that to myself who knows I'm already taking leave the day after my birthday <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Let's Anime and music! I'm back from... let's just say prayers lol not Christian btw, and I want to buy organic tea leaves later so maybe I stop listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMi1Jdo6FHQ" target=_blank>VTuber Himemori Luna play the electone</a> and move on, yes?<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KuboSan03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kubo-san wa Mob wo Yurusanai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"15 centimetres... That's generally considered the ideal height difference for a couple" So yeah Shiraishi, start growing taller bro lol</div></blockquote>Yeah, it actually doesn't matter the female can be taller than you. You'll just be laughed at- Wait, he won't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey as if this isn't much of ridicule to the guy especially he can't be noticed by none other than this girl lol in this new episode where we are dealing with Master Teaser Kubo-san (#KuboSan03), hey, tell me if watching romance isn't the best thing to get warmed up at this time of the year. Well, if you live in the Southern hemisphere I'm sorry lol, but suffice it to say that we are enjoying the cold winds right now, and boy does the wholesomeness in this series help with the warming up. So, for starters, it's new character time so we are introduced to <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/139273/Hotaru_Furuya target=_blank>Hotaru-chan</a> okay that's a HORRIBLE <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34902/Tsurezure_Children target=_blank>Anime joke</a> I'm sorry, Seita-kun. Man, is "kun" even the right honorific? Seita-chan? Ew. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, Seita is Shiraishi's younger brother but I don't remember this guy's given name I guess we will find out when Kubo-san has to say it hehe, but let's just say we also don't know much of now the cutest character in this series since Kubo Nagisa (lol) so maybe we give him and his... somewhat literate sense some love, shall we? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Because honestly saying, my first impression of Seita here is ironically as much as the brother himself, kinda playing alone but not so alone that he's actually alone and that strangers will ask if he's lost lmao man this is a problem, but you know, playing around in the snow alone is kinda sad, he should get some friends. Hey, maybe he has the same problem as the brother, okay? We don't judge. Luckily, Kubo-san DID see the brother because she probably noticed why the guy left school on time since he promised to bring his brother out to play in the snow... alone haha it runs in the family, and it would've been great to take some hot drinks in this cold weather, eh? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, I wouldn't take that also to be honest so he's basically me in Anime- I don't have a younger brother though. I have an elder sister but not as cringe as Kubo-san's one who ironically is working at a bookstore Shiraishi decided to visit because he wanted to get the bonus that comes with buying his usual manga serialization  magazine- BRO YOU ARE LITERALLY ME WITH CDs haha no one will understand me though. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> But yeah, it took a while before the crowd was cleared (lol) and he can get his own copy haha there is no rush no one is into that book with a scantily clad lady on the cover lmao. Interestingly some jerk placed a rated magazine on the book he wanted to get and uh, I guess this is him growing up so I won't blame him... He decided to, you know, take a peek- Return the book to its place which he can't go to anyways the 18+ section is probably off limits for him, and he got caught by the bookstore staff. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Nothing much happened there he did return the book and got what he wanted, but as you would've guessed, the bossypants of a bookstore staff named Kubo told her sister about it after picking up his student ID as he dropped it on the store. No, really, REALLY shouldn't have told Nagisa about Shiraishi liking rack. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again we have seen the bra it isn't too bad but as my bro would've said it's not big enough- You think Shiraishi knows he has been backstabbed by a stranger? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah don't worry, Kubo-san didn't mind that at all. Not one bit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So as punishment lol I guess not really, she asked the guy to hang out with her... on a specific day in the winter season where couples go out. Yes, it's Christmas day, girl still bought him a gift too but it's still not as good as Shiraishi coming up with one in a shorter time than she did, gave her a pair of gloves to warm her hands up. Aw... All in all though, wholesome content plus bossy sister in the making haha the latter is already there already, and I'm digging this story of coincidences, I really do. Can't wait to see more people involved in Shiraishi's not loner life lol I can only envy to any extent honestly</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPtm1aNeTW7RPOCgkKOluNF1t7ByZguE8sAFko2p1HJp-h8Ouzw36gFNDc6-G5Q1tKUA99b1GKex_kmFGq9btIsPELpBePsp5QI65iP97GBL-836Tg-DIOeU1c--13nnK5J4H4iPPNMSBQMbg8h0CcZdh7L9BUvhoMAsE0eHQuwQo2FZxiq1dlvRPn/s320/kubosan03_seita6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That is just <em>way </em>too many stars on those eyes, really</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYRHV6HEqt36ZzniBPFiOabNb0BFzQVsl6-Q04x0EEiorFOzExx6dUhVymQMxZXik-MO4thJz4KiBFTHYEleSX_kPqvJ1CllS4rQcDCFNhen0r3phxqjecSs6ybNBhFwOEqL8tJNGF1SJCPAXsEnsqmlgooEkpTJhFkZNKcc7AI2n24sCj_RlOzwdN/s1600/kubosan03_snowball.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is too cute not to clip haha</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Oh, not Fyodor? I'm listening. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, we are back with another mystery in real life, literally starting off with Kunikida in prison. Damn. Now what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah ignoring everything else Kunikida has to go through lol even Ranpo-kun knows to not deal with that or else this will take another couple of episodes haha, we know that Kunikida's statement of... can I even say it? Some kid blowing up in front of him. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Anyways, yeah, that is true, well, since Kunikida won't lie. Well he hasn't so far so let's assume his track record. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Either way, Ranpo can't figure out a way to prove him innocent so he's in there for now. But at this point, he thought of dealing with Poe remember that idiot rival of an Ability user? Haha was supposed to be meeting someone else, suddenly got dragged into Ranpo's investigations... but turns out, was relevant to Ranpo's case actually, so he got interested in what Poe was reading at the time - a novel without an ending. Surprise, the author was killed before it could be published, the final volume, and let's just say it is a coincidence that all of these cases may be related somehow. Or else how would there be an envelope on the top of the building which was supposed to be the location of the suspected user as told by an informant? The informant wasn't lying though, but some things are clearly not obvious on first look even from Ranpo's standpoint. Firstly, literally a murder happened at the building they were in, body thrown right in front of them. Second, the cops arrived on time. Like, the only reason that would be possible is that someone called beforehand. No spoilers but guess who. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So you can figure it out, the perpetrator was quite dumb haha, but even so, Ranpo can figure this guy out. Yep, being the famous detective we have seen crack cases like peanuts lol great Chinese New Year snack by the way haha, could figure out why this guy was pushed off the building, why his face was faked until it hit the ground face first so he would be unrecognizable, why his shoes were changed before the fall... but he could NOT figure out where the bad guy is. If we can't find evidence to where the criminal is then we can't apprehend him, simple. That's the whole purpose of (introducing) Ability user Oguri Mushitaro and his Ability "Perfect Crime", which will be kind of a joke in a bit but let's just say this gives him the power to cover his tracks in crime. At this point it looks like it's his own tracks because guess what, he is the guilty party. So basically this guy can fake all the evidence he wants using his Ability. And because Ranpo's Ability isn't exactly an Ability, he would still be able to see the truth. And that's why it doesn't work on him. Dumbass. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay I wish I was right, but sadly for Ranpo, just because his is reality and the Ability isn't his thing... this guy will get away with it. Every. Single. Time. But not this time though, as Ranpo decides to snoop around to see if he can get a ride with the guy's limo lol, still did not realize Ranpo has already figured him out even without more of his Ability in place. All in all... WE F**KING GOT HIM, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, this is half the fun of this series, stop ruining it for us, Ranpo. So yeah, I figured that out soon enough than the end of the episode honestly, but if you need a hint of sorts... it all boils down to the fact that this evidence manipulation Ability is not automatic. Imagine, if that in a perfect situation, this guy will ALWAYS forge all the evidence he has around him. But he's a human. HE is the guy who decides when evidence has to be manipulated. And when he doesn't, is when he will be found out. That's it. See if I'm right next week haha I better be but then again I'm not famous detective I don't have to be right lol</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPziVygGkR5A3R_rmqhcuDelEf4hRU0fRsff76n5XgeBlofAqyKoxclwa_EO-b3syvy895DSQ349Mxhh9Ci61GuCZT6v5m018PDj1F9Bx0Ary9LNxY5LwS1eL18ok4H6yUOZFbw5BW2jxQ3rO44Rnd7BD8TcsHzUWsqtJ3ZW9hGCf1JOh9bW5rAFpB/s320/bungostraydogs41_mushitaro4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I stare at the mirror every morning lmao<br>(No gel, dude, no need for it)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiR9J5XolOtbLE8kZaS0xXa7cODOCExQulYubMsNGmDfOkUiUkvP05Qh0Mr4oXgH2ySG19bqr4GP1d5krznZXmmhV2bgOUeivLFtf5oU4edZAakj0PvuLx-QZKS3c_DZpiMQ2LxgLvFnlVd93y6jarrCFBlMeK1tDOS3wf1pXElQnlMTjWp1kQvlCvd/s320/bungostraydogs41_piggyback.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When you have to explain Atsushi to someone lol he's a very good tiger I'll give you that-</table></div></div><div>P.S.

This series in a nutshell lol</div></blockquote>Hey, I said the wife in making thing somewhere not in my reviews, but you know, what do we know of Amane's intentions. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh he doesn't? LIAR haha in this new episode where the angel doesn't know sh*t lol (#OtonariNoTenshiSama04), well turns out everyone knows the truth now so what else is new. I like how Amane thinks he can hide this secret in due time haha but I guess too late now should have just locked the balcony, but yeah, introductions all around as we introduce extrovert girlfriend Chitose to the best girl in this series... and the buddy I guess lol we had to do a round of this, huh. So that took longer than I thought who cares if the buddy was a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsundere target=_blank>tsundere</a> lmao, and I guess there are more people who know of Amane as a kid now, apart from Mahiru-chan here because the mom is now her friend and showed her pictures of the guy when he was younger lol. We were also talking about how happy he looks when eating food (bruh have you even seen the girls eat in Anime "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/24629/Koufuku_Graffiti target=_blank>Koufuku Graffiti</a>" haha now THAT is <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdzryuWE1lqE-vTxAGq-fJdP-q4JZkgfUCl1NrzxvFBbSXadZpoDIVGcU1mre6phE_B0fwCyAuJzatN1vYrSWwh18c6aR6fm5LGnJL21BFGd3Ok5Lj7LTDlhJ_3CqAm82uSM1odaTVRbBYsY-ytsuzllvigK19Pm9xgeJtXbTr05b13Bpn6P-tG6yg/s320/koufukugraffiti02_23.jpg target=_blank>orgasm</a>-), and I guess this is not even the actual day they agreed on yet because they had to do more cooking and eating AND play video games on the following day? Can I just have that as my life now? I'll trade my life right now for that. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh, and that's just cooking alone. Without love. Ah hey hey, if you knew of cooking and how they say cooking for the ones you love are better... you are not alone. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I guess these two don't know about that yet, or maybe, she doesn't. I'm pretty sure Amane is well aware of the fact that this girl is doing all the care for him and he's just... giving her gifts back in return? Man, tell me they aren't a couple. With that, they spent the day playing video games- Can we not show the Nintendo Switch console thing again? Gamers be cringe when they hear "video games" but NOT see a PS5 lol. Last but not least though, maybe working too hard is also a thing for our angel lmao, <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20230128/21/natsukawashiinablog/85/8f/j/o0450060015235747684.jpg target=_blank>Shiina-san</a> oh dammit, Mahiru-chan had a fever. Probably not from being with the guy for too long because who won't, he looks dashing anyways haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> As I said they literally dropped an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> in her sad life, but let's just say she needs to rest or else how we get the fever away. Oh, holding hands while lying on his bed, that's  the most important for recovery. That's what happens when you don't choose to recover at your own place haha also she is still protecting her rooms I guess this place is public domain so technically safer for everything. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I can already imagine Chitose or the mother Shihoko scream at the sight of this but I won't say too much on the aggression of Mahiru-chan on the dude. I won't. I will refrain myself from doing so, just how I did the rest of the episode. All in all... I'm already chill but I feel like I need a bottle of them chill pills because yeah, it's not happening yet. The ultimate scene. So until then... this guy's just trying to pick her up, right? I'm not hallucinating? Somewhere down the line there's a grin from the dude? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like, he's just showering his girl with gifts as if I didn't see it and comes up with excuses for each of them. BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'm still waiting for a drop. And I don't even see it from where I am now. That's my problem with this series for now. It's just...

Whether it's a good party and how many people get sloshed and puked all over the place is not the point. Well, mostly me puking because it's hard to give songs at the start of this year already. Really, last week with two albums I literally found out on the week itself was easier. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, coming back, I thought I can give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/true-story-make-it-a-goal-feat-maiki-ep/1667507394?l=en" target=_blank>SCREEN mode's new single</a></b> and specifically its B-side but I guess we will skip that and just give the Anime theme song just because. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/shirushi-bungo-ver-single/1665908747?l=en" target=_blank>LuckLife's new single</a></b> though was split into two versions for each Anime for being a double A-side single, both had different track lists and of course I listened to the "Bungou Stray Dogs" version which featured a new B-side which got me in, and I did give the two A-sides so... no Review, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> These are all Limited Edition releases and I don't review those so <span class=emoji title=😌>*phew*</span> that was a narrow squeak. We gonna break first review records this early? Haha no even close, I think like, someone else took the crown. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/mai-create/1667434317?l=en" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's concept mini-album</a></b> is kinda okay, I'm not that keen on vocaloid artist compositions anyways and I did hear the bulk of them from the music videos posted on YouTube... apart from the final track which then also had a <a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1618160376964878336?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>music video</a> on release date when I gave the song itself. So yeah, turns out once again, better not to listen beforehand, always spells bad news. Well, that's the Klassic Note theory apparently so your mileage may vary. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/aowoikiru-ep/1664414942?l=en" target=_blank>Takahashi Rie's new EP</a></b> also went down the same track, but I did listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie_staff/status/1617084782386495489?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>the preview on YouTube</a> last Sunday and immediately picked out the song I'll be keen on, and surprisingly, I still went with that which doesn't have a music video. I then told myself not to give more if I don't want to, and I didn't. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/saiai/1666461863?i=1666461865&amp;l=en" target=_blank>RYTHEM's new song</a></b> got dropped on Friday and I'll talk about that again which wasn't a hard give if not for the super long ending with dialogue. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/nolca-solca/1664390834?l=en" target=_blank>halca's new album</a></b> which I listened over the weekend was really meh it made me sick of the pop rock styles represented in it. I had no idea which song was the insert for the Anime "Kaguya-sama" movie until I realized that was also the only song which got me despite its mellow mood. So, uh, yay? Maybe I'll try giving that for the sake of it I guess, it doesn't sound too bad. That or I'll just come back to this again sometime this year with the same result...? I know right just give it then lol her vocals won't sound better half a year later haha<br><br> Oh yeah this week's news on Twitter needs to include last Sunday's news! Haha ah hey, I remember that. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/VictorMusic/status/1617447049481359361?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>SCANDAL's new song</a></b> is for a new Gundam game and they did say the promotional video gave a hint about the melody itself but sadly it's region locked. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oid_info/status/1617462393855959040?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>Gotch's new song has a music video now</a></b> and not like that'll change the impression of me on the song it's just Gotoh-san singing in darkness as usual lol. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/krage_music/status/1617484775002107904?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>krage's new live video</a></b> is her singing now her most popular song if I'm not wrong but it is a good song which doesn't deserve a Chinese version lol so give it a listen. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1617998299683868673?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new song</a></b> (yes another one) is for the PreCure Anime series as it hits 20th anniversary and I guess I'll wait for some formal release before I will take a listen to them. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/tx_orebijyo/status/1618081233065353217?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new song</a></b> (and we aren't even done with her upcoming single) is for a drama series it seems so that's kinda cool we don't see those every day. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1618963978901938176?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>RYTHEM revealed a new song</a></b> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1618960373159440384?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>best album details</a> in their recent livestream on Friday night which is rather cool especially the song it has real vibes from 10 years ago and I mentioned it above already so I'll look forward to maaaaybe another song by the album in May. Fingers crossed, this might just be the only new song, that's how capitalism works. I just saw <b><a href="https://twitter.com/homcomi/status/1618626331314622470?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>Homecomings new music video</a></b> on YouTube (thanks Google) which is for a new song they are releasing more towards <a href="https://twitter.com/homcomi/status/1618191915870195712?s=20&amp;t=3BsQ2xie1zz7m4_q3HKMGw" target=_blank>their 2nd major album</a> which sounds like it's time for me to get into them again but maybe not now this one is a pass. <br><br> So next week to start the new month, we have <b>Hanazawa Kana's new single</b> only because everyone else is next week that's the hype week for music releases apparently for next month, so that. I also found out that <b>yucat's new mini-album</b> is now on music streaming services now which was released physically a month ago, so let's hope her buddy Niitsu Yui will do the same with her new album. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> We can but hope I'm coping with this real hard I tell ya</div><div><br><br><br><br>So yeah, that's all for this week the weekend came and went and I STILL haven't done anything. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> I really need to do something about this really. Maybe I should take that work leave the week after next, we shall see. Hey cya guys next week then, and until next time... we shall see if I have an answer to that I guess, and my recent obsession is... how much I want to see Asakura Momo with more skin. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'll read back on the photobook review from 4 years ago haha damn is it that long ago already? Girl, we need a new photobook haha also Ten-chan can you too? Maybe all three of them so I have a reason to repeat history lol</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Signed up for <a href=https://ayanakoukoku.com/ target=_blank>Taketatsu Ayana fanclub</a> because I think she deserved it more than I do but also we will talk about why soon, but damn is is very worth it at 440yen a month. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh only backdated six months haha wow you gotta be in it for all time to see it hey just in time for 5th anniversary? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not gonna ask whether we can see her bloated stomach but seriously where's the milk coming out of her-</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. Will sign up for Rika-sama fanclub soon but I doubt this will be as worth it considering she is being real quiet compared to a mother lmao</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
