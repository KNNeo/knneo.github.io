And my bro says the voice actress fest that is "Spy Classroom" is good? No. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, I rather take a harem romance with all of them in it in real life and this is not that-<div><br></div><div>Welcome back. I feel like today is not just your typical Sunday where I get sad over work (lol), but suffice it to say it's sadder since I'm going to spend THREE DAYS in the wild from tomorrow so happy birthday dad; I'm glad we didn't decide to have your birthday dinner on Monday lmao</div><div><br></div><div>That's the sad stuff dealt with, so let's see if I'll have more sad stuff lest the new shows below disappoint. No, <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20230109/18/natsukawashiinablog/17/09/j/o0337060015227748387.jpg target=_blank>Shiina-san</a>, not you. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Note to self: Sign up for TrySail fanclub if ran out of <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20221214/15/natsukawashiinablog/fd/f4/j/o0420060015216201428.jpg target=_blank>Shiina-san</a> images to use- Dammit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (For measure I won't post fanclub digital content. I know some will but)<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KyokouSuiri13><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kyokou Suiri</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"There's reason that transcends reason..." Ooooh boy here we go again haha</div></blockquote>Oh yeah Kotoko-chan I would like to do some <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikagawashii target=_blank>suspicious</a> things with you at my place. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> In this new episode of a series I didn't expect to see a season two but here we are (#KyokouSuiri13), wow is that a wholesome episode of what is basically a summary of the first season and the series itself. So, in case you have no idea what this is... hmm, in a nutshell it's just like High Court, but you can lie all the way through. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You have to lie ALL the way though, just like how in this episode we have the manager with a lie about him having a pet that is illegal to raise in Japan. And when I mean all the way, that just means that you have to lie to everyone, including the audience. So, story goes this time around some spirit heard of thumping noises at night and feared of it which, reasonable, it was found out that in the apartment above there was a very suspicious placement of a doll which even the manager feared. Yep, in case you have been reading the above very carefully, you might be thinking I'm contradicting myself, and that's the whole point: Kotoko-chan essentially the spiritual medium and ruler between worlds, is supposed to appease her fellow spirits with utmost reasoning and logic. In this case, she lied about the doll existing even though that's the truth we will talk about getting rid of that later, but instead covered it with the manager having some weird kink of rearing a kodomo dragon or something. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, which story is spicier, right? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also, because the manager would be the only one responsible, they can say whatever they want about him. Well, unless the spirit itself dared to go find out the truth itself, of which it didn't, which brings us to the truth. After leaving the spirits behind, her boyfriend/buddy/contract Kuro-senpai then mentioned about the idea of not telling the truth behind the discovery of the doll, and created a lie based on the manager. So here we go, it's upon these levels of lies if you have watched season one you would know of the Steel Lady (umph Sumipe haha) and Kotoko had to put layers of lies to let the Internet community come to some conclusion so the supporters of the demon would cease and it can be more easily taken down. Not that it's a problem here, but considering that is a doll which is a cursed seal meant to... uh, kill nearby spirits, that thing should be glad it didn't decide to investigate the apartment above. Which brings us to the second half of the episode, the fight. The gang of spirits talked about the beauty of Kotoko-chan (haha she cute) but also, the monster that is Kuro-senpai. So, for some background, he came from a family of people who eats weird food so yeah my place too haha, and got fed as a kid, a kudan (defined as a human-faced bovine, ugh) and a mermaid. He survived the ordeal of the mythical powers of consuming the two types of meat, so he gained the power of future sight AND immortality, making him basically invincible but also, looking worse than me as a human if you are in the spiritual world. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Meaning that, as long as he can see a future of him not dying, he can cling on to it, sacrifice his mermaid body which won't kill him, and be revived instantly. Of course time is a major factor in achieving that feat so let's hope that doesn't get him this season. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> All in all, great way to bring us back in, I really thought they will touch on the romance parts a bit too but that's fine I hope your motivation to watch that isn't clingy Kotoko-chan because it is mine. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Other than that, we see a cast of new characters from the opening animation, we know one of them will be voiced by <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki target=_blank>Yuuki Aoi</a>... and that's all I know. We shall see how well this season holds up, just like Kotoko's logic and reasoning...?</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnz5EAVfBzLaBP_8dRDXIVGd-K1kP4IGhZCqavLSZaSyA9vPvBfJiU8kwDj_AmrEh-hhBrm2HIybjvRGAovOEkceh_qzaPFA882d-3Y-KM1Oj2D0QkW5l3iYG93vHpINbLa3i6MRDmGPpC0pbPrDd1wDN7CucO7F55iYb-yQxbU5hAoUpDkrudRLg-/s320/kyokousuiri13_cards.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What we are here for:<br>Spirits playing cards lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiezt3YGfzLbooTNeSL9azTWJlLx5unogojh0FxBVnW8vH0i1ne8VnpWjVMvPdjnFiRkoxI73BjS-F6QCfYrk2ZDzR6aKX20UufZOViRP8Q2Htk8P7cBuvGpiP9WSCLnVVHgERpfMryH87GwLjhPa9BTg6QAdk5iJ1Lq3jIUPT-uBiuWDKLaLOyS5Im/s320/kyokousuiri13_kotoko1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What we are here for:<br>HELL YEAH CUTE GIRL PLZ</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGi7D0zmtIXro9aJ3_3ES26p0Nb7ZHgIdrDnfYcqjNSNHjzaHao_NUyIRkLquZffVVJunX3h1rjh7lA73mgwwa4pSiMP7yjqZH0lsc4gDp-Re6RQs5HRQ8fbITFrJIhnNXEc8ABcykqFed4f0oPJ-rCSmQQM925jhlmdebkxCU4fIq8Fe0CgyXtQiR/s320/kyokousuiri13_rikka.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What we are here for:<br>NONONONO<br>(lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S. "(Kotoko) is elegance and beauty defined." My top reason for watching this Anime haha is that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ayakashi target=_blank>ayakashi</a> me? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KuboSan01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kubo-san wa <a href=https://jisho.org/search/mobu target=_blank>Mob</a> wo Yurusanai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I have less presence than other people" DUDE THAT IS ME haha</div></blockquote>Wow, okay dude, you might be even more cringe than me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, after having a girl who notices you? I don't think so bro your life is changing right now. In this first episode of a series where deja vu is merely an opinion (#KuboSan01), I don't think we can understand mobs here lol it's not what you think they are, so maybe <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calefare target=_blank>Calefare</a> might be more of a familiar term. No? Oh, it's a Singapore only thing? Oops, what have I done. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, ignore me when I say stuff you don't care because no one cares which is the motif of this blog anyways lol, we talk about being invisible. And I don't mean by having a superpower, no, this is just your typical romance slice-of-life Anime, not fantasy or supernatural elements. It's just that Shiraishi here has a human problem. Unlike Komi-san who can't communicate, this guy can, and this is HIS ONLY WAY of being noticed by people. Yeah, it's as if he is invisible, is the shtick of this series. Ironically though, as you can see by the intro of this episode, 1x Kubo Nagisa noticed him. Obviously being the opposite of him, popular and smart and everything, I still can't make it why this girl would see him more than twice a year given Shiraishi's reputation of being so background it's like dealing with the CSS background style attribute with a screen reader BOOM programming joke. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Nonetheless, the quest to figuring out how far Shiraishi has to do to be noticed by... damn even camera AI, sounds like a good challenge for Kubo-san already. For the dude, it's just a juggle between the consequences of not listening to Kubo-san and the real threat of actually getting noticed in class even though the reality is likely that both won't get him any attention whatsoever. Get it? That's the joke. Basically no risk, better than trust bonds. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or maybe it's the other away around how did the teacher who looks like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/167614/Hanasaki_Horie target=_blank>Ao-chan's perv author dad</a> know? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, the rules of this "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san target=_blank>showdown</a>" is more like an experiment, really, and following a give and take rule set by Kubo-san every time, Shiraishi is just dragged into her world where she takes her advances on, spoiler alert, the guy she likes, one step at a time. Hey, she saw him already; That's more than just a first step. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, not talking and avoid being seen is one thing, this guy managed to avoid everyone besides the one girl who will give a damn about him. Hey, tell me not being attractive is also one of his virtues. Like, people think seeing him is good luck but have you guys ever thought of chatting him up though? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well, at least he got his manga and video games with him. Welp. I wonder if anyone will notice him if he hangs out on forums or online chat. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, I've got noticed just from a livestream in months so I wonder what are his odds. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Maybe that's why, maybe, taking a selfie with the most popular student in class will be that much more exciting, above everything else. And just this, I think, is already making this series worth a watch. I will have to swallow up the theme songs though, maybe I'll go with Kana-chan first as opening I guess, who also voices the main girl. (<a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa>Hanazawa Kana</a> of course, married woman voicing a JK lol cringe) All in all... hmm I think we have enough hints as to what will happen of this relationship in school compared to the other one I watched last week. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Not a bad idea after all considering even Shiraishi will also make jokes about himself haha, still could not get around anything this Kubo-san wants of him... but as she said, she's all filled up. See, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/123699/Takagi target=_blank>Takagi-san</a> is the one having fulfilment issues, okay? This girl knows what she's doing. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And if ignoring everything else about potential romance, Shiraishi, why not take this chance to gain a friend? She'll definitely notice you more than your mom haha why I can already imagine the wedding photos of only the bride BRO YOU GOTTA DRESS UP AS A CLOWN NO BLACK SUIT FOR YOU lol more jokes next week I guess</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivsyux4yqqp2tQ4dueHb1sIcuxv06jujkelbziBlQCAhGwdGg0RQ-gpRSluXKKaoqgb_lv4PzxOh7BSA_JAYQFLxcIWiEdE1CVGotSbl3QVn8dK8QVncU70LtGzSBYEBWh36_i52-dzu83zbv3W7vUnMzK6loOY7W4g7JlwLcE-UgF73fLaJWk-WWS/s320/kubosan01_apps.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>References you may have missed:<br>You may know of LINE but maybe not photo effects app <strike>C162</strike> B612<br>(Yeah also ZOZOTOWN)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCmrXsH2j9LRcww1rzk7yXc29AVs-RA5fdRu0Y_e-chQX4NXp1XKM_G6-kUQVQg10hIyI_smMfLTuqbVTgsPq6M5AxdnXUBhmUJSEjFpRQpo7gTxufQ0zxQjeRwJzh1_8YpCMiQ3vLEi5a3W_aC3xf3G-RF7LofCOevY75ng7eon2PxW7pFEu76Lax/s320/kubosan01_manga.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>References you may have missed:<br>I think that's a Sword Art Online reference</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrRthAxqr0dGYDfatEOREDG8YUJS2x_pilswdg6BuNRBPLiJXH1RZ1eMW0wf-sDrHg4EwnhpBpHdsLzSu6wqObOz5mjtWcaRgtol-5flXI5_rmPltTlksskeLCBs0KYqMBSMnMcIkLEsec2AQxtqdzPNtW2oI9hwcnrhucV2d8QFH-QKimg8aeUJs6/s320/kubosan01_milk.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>References you may have missed:<br>That's a hint for the final episode haha</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Man, you allergic to entertainment, bro? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, in the new episode where us idiots uncover the truth lol (#BungouStrayDogs39), according to Ranpo-san even at the start of this series, he "has the ability" to find out the truth. Well, this is now accented by the fact that Fukuzawa had to tell him about who he is, basically. Also, because he's young and easy to deceive? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, we gotta hit him on a lie somehow to make this work, so why not? Now that we got this out of the way, maybe we can talk about the actual threat that is going to happen in the play, shall we? So, story. Sorry if I had to take quotes from Ranpo-san himself, but since he did it so well I might as well take a leaf from him since I'm such an IDIOT- This play is about reversal of roles. About humans versus angels, and how that will change around. The main guy we have seen last week is the leader of this... fictional cult? Yeah, and of course, is on the precipice of revealing the reversal of roles for the play itself, you know, angels getting their vengeance and killing humans and stuff blah blah. Problem is, Ranpo-san is just rattling this in the theatre floor where people paid tickets to watch and that's kinda bad for PR, so Fukuzawa decided to give him an illusion he can deal with: By telling him his detective powers were an Ability. Maybe that's how Ability users and the term came about which will be interesting to talk about with respect to current timeline, but let's leave it at that we are still in a flashback. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Seeing as Ranpo-san is a kid and he knows better to believe in that lie of a truth, he took it upon himself to BE the greatest detective of all time since you know, technically he is since we are all idiots in his mind now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, the murder happened, people were shocked to see that it is "real", and in the second half of the play Ranpo set out to reveal the people involved in this supposed crime. Turns out, it's just the main actor wanting to show how real death can be to the audience, but of course his fans probably mostly female in demographics are already shocked by his fake death even, drinking that much water after being drawn of fresh blood won't help make any of us forget about that fact. Yeah, technically a psycho, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Actor, my a**, and shout out to the first ever movie which showed faeces on camera too. Epitome of acting and drama, but probably why we have age ratings today. So long story short, Ranpo-san was great he figured everything out even those people who think he's a genius didn't know he is just smart and not Ability user lol, STILL did not figure out how the playwright who cooperated with the main actor was actually killed in his writing room. Yeah. Remember there was supposed to be a murder? Happened now. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> All in all... man we are not done yet, ladies and gentlemen. We now know that arresting someone who might be interfering with this play might yet create another problem, and as Ranpo-san sits in the police car with an overenthusiastic policeman... you can see where this goes, yeah. He won't die, no, but let's see if ANYONE will believe this dude is an Ability user and that he is worth getting rid of.

Really trying to pretend, huh, this girl. Like, even when some acquaintance comes by? You won't ask for help? If I sprained my leg even if it's not for saving a cat from a tree haha, and someone I know passed by? I would still ask for some help. Or worst case, limp my way home to be honest but heck, the guy figured it out. <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sasuga target=_blank>Sasuga</a> Amane-kun, still best <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> in this series that prince from the other class in school can go kill himself. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sadly I hardly knew how to treat injuries considering I only scraped my knee the one time I went cycling with my family and my sis had to help me so I'm already screwed and doomed to be alone forever. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Anyways haha, Amane sacrificed his sweatpants for school for such a gentlemanly deed, so clap hands for him, dude. Girls, find some guy who will keep your house clean, okay? Not this one here haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> We got reminded of it again after <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20221121/20/natsukawashiinablog/3a/45/j/o0351060015206192102.jpg target=_blank>Shiina</a> came in (HELL YEAH lol) with the thanks and usual dinner leftovers lol, but Amane thought eating freshly cooked will be great because maybe he missed the cooking back home? I mean, who doesn't? *points at self* Yeah, say it in front of the girl, dude. That's how <strike>you get to go to her place</strike> you can get her to come to your place to cook??? Okay, normally this stuff happens only 6 episodes in and we are already doing it? Sure dude, they have no feelings for each other- It's like hiring a cook, bro. She's not your prospective wife or whatsoever. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I might be considering the prospects of <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/44317/Manaka_Iwami target=_blank>Iwami Manaka</a> being a wife already so don't mind me. Guy gets jealous of friend's girlfriend because yeah we can all do with a partner at some point <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> still did not get more than a relationship with a neighbour who has been cooking for you and actually noticed you because you rank in the tops in school? Hey Amane, say dropping that student ID card was a mistake. Why did they even print birthdays on that though? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Amane then realized you know, gotta do a hired classmate and neighbour a favour (lmao) and treat her to something, but not like he has all the experience buying gifts for friends I bet he doesn't even for his bro right here haha I did it so I'm better than him <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, instead asked the bro's girlfriend to help. Well, burning a lot of money in the process he gotta bribe all of them first. But turns out, <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20221115/15/natsukawashiinablog/73/0f/j/o0365050015203329073.jpg target=_blank>Shiina</a> liked the gifts, so all is well, excuse me, mission complete. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... I think I know why I said I can't clap last week. It's because I need it to play half the speed so I can savour all of this not dating stuff and THEN do the clapping. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's that good. You know how Amane says he has to say how good the food is as he eats? This is the same with my opinion of this series so far just that I can only talk about the girl. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ah hey, I'm not interested in dudes I'm a hetero male just so you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Listening to the ending song and then realizing it's a cover song from MONGOL800 I'm like how is that old dude writing songs for Anime now lol, and many more coming our way considering this isn't Iwami-san's first cover song for Anime hehe been there too previously for Anime "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/36470/Tada-kun_wa_Koi_wo_Shinai target=_blank>Tada-kun</a>", it looks like this whole thing is progressing as slowly as it is smoothly, and I kind of like that actually. Will whatever Shiina-san say come true for their relationship eventually? Will any of their actions hit each other as love-inducing? I think we are starting with the guy first, actually. Then maybe we will deal with the blockhead of a girl haha oh well we have episodes to go through so we can wait we got <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/156088/Teresa_Wagner target=_blank>Teresa-san</a> laid 6 years ago already this is just history repeating itself lmao</div><div>[TL:DR; I can't wait for this girl to be so <a href=https://jisho.org/search/betabeta target=_blank>clingy</a> with the guy I can't even HAHAHAHA didn't <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/128944/Kurou_Sakuragawa target=_blank>eat a kudan</a> btw]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi39N6WIsftzSWrDz6lE8bLgg2AnLYG-Js6efiMTrbAD_DdCZjI6cz40DPBQXzj7Bv7gUKdgzSEzti37znvxw7TRJQh52w-oQPG4sfe-Y_cj7L9MhoHvM0PZyXnTyx2ZjKAdK_v5MCp7sLdQKcDB0ZY4eoGyN9lox-B6-uT0Ul7GkNEsophxtfAYnAI/s320/otonarinotenshisama02_id.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Well we aired at the wrong time of the year so remind me of her birthday in 11 months lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQEhRpk9MyKJF-Km-F8g1-j5wT6YvcfBbYtDqPvFHesUlWNhg3WcQikOhpx4wCkTWFj_hXGzVVoAE589ckNxTdb4Jrg7vk3_H90R7wfiLBm-Rc4U5XtycYMZdQPfc2IUztavazf2LhCawENu-Xeuzgip4uj67XmVlF-RYlCzqdEJf6C5umaDKcu6yw/s320/otonarinotenshisama02_kick.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This week in Anime violence we have:<br>Not even wearing heels and can kick dudes in the nuts?<br>She is to be feared haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYxgIgF73OwQlv-RWqlg4wMrptdNM5yP9SMcV18LKcdT5ffCpGed_g9i3F2jXM4anBVWhRWk5gSSKY6rRZGXlVaK1-mcXF6u3ZmmklTCIeSMnBG45Vv-6wJG9yCY7RCkZW5vaR4Nu3WQkNCfX6aFbxa9wV1x2gSliGpnWPpRG0K7h4R7-R9wCMgvBp/s320/otonarinotenshisama02_shiina7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>It's like they know when to put in the effects haha <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kawaii target=_blank>kawaii</a></table></div></div><div>P.S.

I mean, we are only on the 2nd week of actual listening to songs so... I did give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AB%E3%82%92%E6%8A%9C%E3%81%91%E3%81%9F%E3%82%89/1281384239?l=en" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's EP from 2017</a></b> though but I did find some interest in indie them more than major label them somehow, and instead of the one I heard of in the YouTube video mentioned last week, I ended up giving other songs in the release. See? Mood affects music reviews, people. I was sadder that week. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Other than that, I did listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/heaven/1658495326?i=1658495356&amp;l=en" target=_blank>Gotch's new song</a></b> which is a collaboration apparently but I'm just kinda annoyed by the excessive low-pitched... rap? Yeah, so we'll see if this can survive next week before I add it in. <br><br> Well, new time for music on Twitter! I think after that two week drop this one will be shorter, I promise. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://twitter.com/KroiOfficial/status/1612103205898289155?s=20&amp;t=OBKi_5IXvduO55oW6VxKpQ" target=_blank>Kroi's new music video</a></b> for their digital single is very meh I guess I'm just not into their quirky style after all, we might be done with them already. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/YowMomm/status/1612101832523784194?s=20&amp;t=OBKi_5IXvduO55oW6VxKpQ" target=_blank>KaroeRana's new music video</a></b> for Anime "Kyokou Suiri" is definitely interesting in itself considering the last time I heard of her was a love song. It'll carry the Anime series, I'm at least confident of that. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1612403811091419142?s=20&amp;t=OBKi_5IXvduO55oW6VxKpQ" target=_blank>Taketatsu Ayana's new music video</a></b> is definitely disappointing on the song side but then again why does the video feature a kid is beyond my comprehension, so remind me to reset my brain when the single drops in March. Nostalgia drops from <a href="https://twitter.com/shionnu10/status/1612413107095363584?s=20&amp;t=OBKi_5IXvduO55oW6VxKpQ" target=_blank><b>Tsuji Shion</b></a> and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1613869076698533890?s=20&amp;t=OBKi_5IXvduO55oW6VxKpQ" target=_blank>RYTHEM in ASMR</a></b> apparently so if you are keen to walk back a decade please help yourself.

And finally, hot off the press, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1614616302307672069?s=20&amp;t=uUu64eLRF2u-8A8w-HFikg" target=_blank>Minase Inori will release her new single in April</a></b> along with her recent live tour I guess, but it looks like some Anime level stuff already so wee shall see then if that is true.<br><br> So next week... next week... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, nothing much next week so I'll be in the search for not this season's Anime theme songs I hope, <b>maybe more Hitsujibungaku</b> depending on my mood... starting tomorrow can we just move on? <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span><br><br><br><br><br> How you like my intertwined Anime references this week, eh? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, maybe should avoid that a little more we should walk in fresh-minded so we can have a better opinion of Anime without knowing that <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/24413/Miku_Itou target=_blank>Itou Miku</a> is somewhere in there. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> First time, by the way, we all have our first times. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay I gotta go I don't want to publish this blog post in camp. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> See you guys then, and until next time... let's just hope I will be happier by then- Didn't you promise yourself, me, that 2023 will be happier?
