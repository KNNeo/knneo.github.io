Wrong Anime, girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Imagine you getting married to Ede-chan and Sumipe was now you mother-in-law, dude?? I do not have a mother fetish but ever since Moeka's mom from Anime <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/31952/Kono_Bijutsu-bu_ni_wa_Mondai_ga_Aru target=_blank>"KONOBI"</a>... I do. Yes as in wedding vows I can't even- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where why is the first soulmate of Rentarou not also Karane because she should get in this wedding photo taking action (#Hyakkano09), looks like for the first part, we are playing with flowers! Hey, it is a thing in this beautiful park of flowers so what's stopping any of them wanting to take a photo with the boi? Well... a bunch of gorillas? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Bro, you don't even have the bananas to make it <em>look</em> correct. What we do have though, is a bunch of servants that one woman can throw around to disperse the crowd eager to get the bouquet (thrown by, of all people, not a person lol the vice principal), so that no one else will get it but her. Or Karane apparently, because in a crazy attempt to bend the rules, she decided to play along with this gang considering she probably has more grip power than Hololive's Amane Kanata haha sorry for VTuber joke, did stop the lot from getting to the now Rentarou family haha nice name better than that gang. She however, is not preventing the servants from doing dumb shit like change the course of the bouquet in the sky so Shizuka-chan is in for the action! Haha how? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Rentarou's side did get it in the end, but what they also got, is the end of everything to start. Hmm, which brings us to the second part of this episode and also the intro, where damn, we can't deal with teenager stories without dealing with their parents, huh. Well I would assume it's something dumb which will make of a lame joke down the road <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but for now, let's say that someone's mother has an opinion about this harem. (Yeah I know right, bring in any parent into Anime "KanoKano" character and <em>all</em> of that two-timing will be over lol) We don't look like we have much choice, and as much as Rentarou can make his case for finding the girl at her humungous abode... he cannot make her leave her home. Yep, this is the "perfect parent" tactic as I would like to refer here, where Hakari's mom thought it'll be a good idea to not be with some dude who can bring her happiness and is also doing it to like, 4 other. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, valid point it's 99 too many lol, so the mom chose to withdraw her daughter from this relationship. Because otherwise it'll be the dude instead. And if she really sends Rentarou away... into Hell likely case, then we will IMMEDIATELLY kill (in Anime) one hundred girls, because all are to be his soulmate. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Oh God, what have you done. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Regardless, the inevitable has come, and just like the gorilla gang who didn't play fair in the bouquet toss, I guess we cannot play fair too, and thus spawns Rentarou's crazy plan to snatch her back from the mansion. And then elope I guess for as long as they can. Or just change her identity, yeah, flatten her chest or something. Oh, a B-holder won't work? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also where are Renratou's parents, they ok with this? Also, the other girlfriends are leaving together with him? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So many questions. All in all... damn, this drama and its heavyweights. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (You know what I'm saying, you know) Is this what my friend was warning me about? Then I have no worry. With enough willpower I will watch the next episode and find out how bad this goes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Though interestingly, this is quite a development even from this romcom's tone, and I don't mind that actually. I really wonder if this might be it to end the season (or if it does), as this might be one of many. Remember, he has a lot of girlfriends, and any one of them might still get him into trouble. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We shall see this through then, I highly doubt entering a mansion will be this easy. What if though, we invade the mansion but convince the mom instead? You know, sexually? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey *moves waist* haha I'm about to get cancelled I might as well put up the rated warning now</div><div>[TL:DR; Oh, so you got a bangin' daughter but I can't bang her?

Yeah I hope so haha she wouldn't</div></blockquote><div>Yeah yeah, let's watch Ayachi r*pe an Anime man. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also honestly saying? I've never seen Naoya in this much pain before. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> That's because in this new episode where b*tch gets what she wants ie. the guy (#KanoKano22), and I'm not just talking about the one slut, so stay tuned for more. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Meanwhile, you would be pleased to hear that twin buns b*tch or whatever SakiSaki calls Milika now haha, she is right into Naoya as much as she can, just... kissing him all over? Well, just the top part, somehow they are dumb enough to tape his crotch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, this is getting her horny all over, but not Naoya somehow, so I really suspect among all things, that he might be homosexual. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, what is aggression, right? I don't believe he didn't get a boner out of that though. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> The girls outside the room (and Shion pretending she isn't there cause of this lol) did eventually get the door unlocked though, so Naoya's... virginity? Gets to see another day. Well, not his mouth for kissing though, for Milika and Shion's next plan in making sure the Naoya-Saki kiss scene will not happen (for good reason?) is to what, put garlic on their food? I mean, if we all eat it it doesn't smell, right? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Guys, garlic is good for your body. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, and yes more b*tch action drama served in a cold plate lol, because as cold as Milika might be to Shion, conversely Naoya noticed she is alone and came to see how she is. You know, holding the ribbon at a cliff near the ocean for some reason. And because accidents happen like they always do with these two only haha it's like there's an algorithm constantly checking if exactly 2 people are on scene and if it is these two, Shion dropped the ribbon Naoya gave her and fought for her life to get it in the waters, knowing that (1) this will put her life in danger considering they are near a cliff and in rocky waters near the short and there's an impending wave which crushed onto her and that how she can get laid lmao gottem, and (2) Naoya will actually save her and bring her up to shore even if she can't make it. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Also yeah Naoya, I've been keeping this ribbon all along, I've been nice to SakiSaki and you being in a relationship. Yeah, I'm such a good friend, right? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Haha but seriously though, the only thing worth protecting is- What am I even saying, flat chest women aren't worth saving. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, because they LITERALLY ended up in one of the satellite islands around the area?? Oh boy, this is how you know it's getting interesting. Then again, kudos for Shion being a GENIUS for <em>accidentally</em> baiting Naoya into the waters so he can save her and swim... in the wrong direction? And they have to stay the night in an uninhabited island?? Haha Milika-san, take notes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, accidents when they are on the island. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, can you guys just accidentally get married so we can end all this bullsh*t? Asking on behalf of the God of Fortune. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, starting the fire seems to be important considering warmth isn't a thing in the cold waters surrounding them also the lack of a sun shining, but damn Naoya, did we NOT have to go to the lengths of making sure her swimsuit needs to be dried and she has to take it off. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> And they HAVE to land on top of each other, great. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Not a porno, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Interestingly, two things happened when they were alone in an island that should change how you think of this series in general not even say Shion, are that besides the kiss in case you think that it isn't happening anytime soon, and Shion telling Naoya about a person she likes. Just that, you know, unless you're SakiSaki who doesn't know sh*t, you should know that the guy is Naoya. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... what would you do to the person you like in an uninhabited island? Probably not start some fire though, we can just hug for warmth. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways joke's over... I don't know what to make of this though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, if someone were to ask what is the season highlight for the Anime I watch... this is it. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I really don't know what to make of this, nor do I am as brave as Shion or anywhere close to being as nice as Naoya, so what does that make of me? I think of that every time, and I don't have answers. But they do. Maybe I need to be in that situation after all, where all is no consequence, then I will put in my all. Nah, that's not possible... or is it? OH NO IT IS SAKI-CHAN HAHA OH MY- "Hyakkano" you have already lost. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "I don't want you kissing anyone else!"

I'd like to discuss your family name in detail." Alright Kuro-san I think you have better things to attend to right now bro</div></blockquote><div>What even is this intro, some "Yakusoku no Neverland" storyline? Bruh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, it's Yamada. Or is that even your real name? Hmm... in this new episode where strong women should not exist lol (#UnderNinja10), I mean, we have Sasama who am I lying to. Weak men are rarer. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And that's why there's Eita, who as you would recall, is still stuck in the building in another high school. But ignoring him first since Kuro-san did not care too haha he'll be fine, the girls in Kodan High though might not be too great. So, recap since the episode did it too, we are dealing with Saruta being invisible and killing kids in Anime <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> I should stop saying that lol, and two ninja have been dispatched to track him down lest he kills more students in this area. The school director is helping them out, and since the school is designed to have two sidewalks across two buildings, it would be wise to cut him off in the middle. And they did, though Saruta did almost made use of Suzuki's weakness for old men (lmao) to attack her, but unfair since she isn't in armour unlike Onikobe which you would be reminded is in a Marishiten suit, did manage to fight him off, but still not enough to hold him so we can uh, drop the satellite beam on him or something. Interestingly, Katou is here with border line defence (from the delivery truck lol) and The Cube, dubbed as such because it is one strong beast despite being made by one of the least durable things in shipping. Also, I mean, why need a head when you are a cardboard ninja, right? <span class=emoji title=😲>*gasp*</span> Is that it?? That's what it is?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's nimble though, being able to crash through concrete to grab Saruta at a moment's notice, being able to mimic Katou's actions and trying to pin the enemy down so we can uh, drop the satellite beam on him or something. Not deja vu though, since that b*tch in the ninja lab doesn't understand the importance of this fight. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, that didn't happen, and as expected grabbing on to someone from a cardboard robot is rough, so let's talk about Yamada. She's tough. As we have seen in the flashback, she is born from fighting others, is way too strong in reflexes dodging Hibi's attacks all around, and is a woman. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I don't think the last one has anything to do with that, but we are reminded that these are sent from the UN for whatever reason we aren't too sure, but if we need to hear something out of them, maybe a little *screams like a freak* <em>LIGHTNIN'</em> might help. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't think this will do much to her, but if that paralyzes her and drops her speed and attack by half that'll be swell- Sorry for Pokémon joke. All in all... uneventful? That might be an appropriate word for this haha. The most eventful thing might just be an AI bike riding a cat talking to Kawado-san, honestly. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's more like predictable, but we have progress. I'm not that impressed though, because everything is pretty much on hand. Saruta is still alive somehow, and Yamada... let's say Hibi won't stop her anytime soon. But looks like next episode will be more exciting just by saying in the title that Kuro-san is taking up a sword and I even saw Shion doing swordplay too... hey it's not going to be as good as "BLEACH" somehow (lmao <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> finally this burn has some weight) but heck, I'll partake in some sword fighting action! Probably more interesting than seeing... whatever that is in the intro haha <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> that is NOT my opinion of this series though I should start thinking of what to make of this series, really.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBppAhFzX69ejhtZ8DQ9ZMkFgkFzRd6Maksdvz4q-w0z9ESG22NFrQNLPde1SICgH19-HuVIlWjV6Y3JU6RhlEs8ck3XDbNWe_AVTk6i548o4eIETOD-D618J6iLqG83UYkWkl3hlzxDrQXm3B4_08pO_VBitCynBu31snNAWsmlI9sOEYmQcCghV1fVY/s320/underninja10_bros.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me and ma bro going out to find chicks for the night lol<br>(Which one is me I'll let you decide)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRUwdGotuencrj8X09ObztTnBMjqpEa9TfVdDd1Fd2HkaN5IEH5pCRsFOxNLqEZRDjUdbJ0o9lgnW3dp20rurCD_9EDdTaDgm4nvJCJgLaZwiFB83CvyPp646t-EE_Vaymd37_WIokgu4eIF7mTvxPCyMYmkvJ9qWawd7G9HgXNiOwD5yWTU8wFnbTnfk/s320/underninja10_cube2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>My mom walking into my room when I am watching Anime</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Thankfully, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/12-hugs-like-butterflies/1714742640?l=en-US" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's new album</a></b> came up tops for the week, not like it excelled but it did hit me with new album songs filled with deja vu which is a problem and that also means we're at that acclimatization phase where if I don't like their style this is all you are hearing so my time with this band may not really last that long after all. That's how I roll, dude, guys gotta catch up to make me impressed. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> And I can prove to you, that the shadow drop of <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%B7%B1%E6%B5%B7%E3%81%AE%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB/1718876183?i=1718876187&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>Tsuji Shion's new song</a></b> still worked on me despite me listening to this before I sleep AND still made me energized for some reason. She's that good, dude. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> You think she's responsible for my dream that night? Haha no way</div><div><br></div><div>Well, more news about music I hope, I don't recall much but I did like a posts on X, so maybe I need to filter things out here. <b><a href="https://x.com/nanoripe_info/status/1731589488139477433?s=20" target=_blank>nano.RIPE's new collaboration song is releasing next week</a></b> so maybe I'll take a listen to see how good it is, I have no idea about anything by the way not even the band they are doing this with. <b><a href="https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1731600121673208087?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's new song</a></b> is definitely in the wrong season and time and place but also my tastes so I'll give that a skip. <b><a href="https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1731991806966161535?s=20" target=_blank>SID's new song</a></b> is slightly better though, even then I don't think I will give the thumbs up as of now. <b><a href="https://x.com/fumika_tweet/status/1732252174045131148?s=20" target=_blank>fumika's new song</a></b> is also a meh, not going to find out what happened but I am burnt out for the year too so yeah. What's more hype though, is <b><a href="https://x.com/honkidance/status/1731871712633872626?s=20" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance releasing a new album next month</a></b> and boy have I missed a lot about this band throughout the years with the collabs and stuff, but let's hope this will deliver when it's out the start of next year, I have high hopes. <b><a href="https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1732369353490960487?s=20" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's new music video</a></b> is sadly not the song I intended to give in the album released this week and man, did the impression not get any better after watching it so... nah. Looks like <b><a href="https://x.com/uesaka_official/status/1729425244841300151?s=20" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new single releasing next month</a></b> will reveal more details on her birthday steam next next week, so I'll be sure to tune in them I guess. Oh this one is interesting thanks to a tip from Komatsu Mikako, because finally <b><a href="https://x.com/mai_k_staff/status/1732777287324713185?s=20" target=_blank>Kuraki Mai's music library is out on music streaming services</a></b> so yay I can finally talk about the one mini-album I've listened to back in 2018 because of Anime. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, people know this woman for YEARS and I listened to her 5 years ago, pft. <b><a href="https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1733109172282314945?s=20" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's performance on THE FIRST TAKE once again</a></b> is impressive, they definitely sang the one song which blew up recently and also me haha, and that it is interesting to see how all this is done without a tinge of techno or pop reference, I don't know why but maybe it's just me.</div><div><br></div><div>So next week, and likely our final week of listening to new songs unless you want to count Anime "Hyakkano" opening two weeks from now, it's <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/1715994341?l=en-US" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new album</a></b> ever since it "transformed" (lol) into a two-member band. Well, if it's just a Mizuno-san production I can't expect it to be any bad compared to the single I gave months ago, so we shall see. I miss Hotaka-san's compositions though, I truly do. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Hmm we can listen to fhana's new album (since they downsized and changed music label) in the following week though, if I care at this time of year. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also mol-74's new song, that might be on the schedule.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Well, you can't force me to type an outro because damn is the time moving fast and I don't have more interesting things happening in my life which aren't written in this blog. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, I complained about a defective product like a stupid consumer if you are interested. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Maybe it's because my mind is still full of making stuff using HTML because I just made a somewhat realistic idle game that everyone loves playing nowadays (lmao), and I am still constantly thinking what songs this year will make it in the Klassic Note Song Awards. It is tough, I tell ya. My deviation in tastes is making this harder than ever. Haha we will talk about that soon, see you guys then, and until next time maybe I need more excitement in my life. Like being with a real woman, for example. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay that is too real no way haha come back next week if you are also alone and bored, yes?</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Is this also the first year, we might have an Entertainment News #53 for the year??
