I've not been thinking of an intro here mainly because I was thinking of how to write one for Akarin's post yesterday (lol) while being <em>totally</em> distracted by Ten-chan as my phone wallpaper all week. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I know right? If this was all real I won't even be writing blog posts <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>We are near the end of the season, we still have plenty to talk about them all though including the last week of music reviews this year very likely, so let's! Why is <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%92%E3%83%8A%E3%83%A6%E3%83%A1/1538128458?i=1538128461&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>Aqua Timez</a> suddenly ringing in my brain now though I don't even know haha</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Hyakkano10><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na Hyakunin no Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"She made the painful decision to protect Rentarou from her overly doting mother" Yeah you got that right normally it's the other way around</div></blockquote><div>Oh for this invasion, we might need a lot of help from Nano-chan. Yeah, most efficient way to get to Hakari without being spotted, what a motivation. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also what is with the stuff Shizuka reads, she keeps saying lines with "bro". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> BRO, we aren't even done with this because in the new episode (#Hyakkano10) it's infiltration time! Yeah, it's mostly the Renratou family <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> going into the mansion Hakari lives in to save her since negotiations have basically failed but we will get to that later lol, and as we see throughout the episode, this house is stacked with a lot of things to worry about. Firstly, the house cat. I mean, if you think the cat on the rooftop of the school is MVP, let me introduce you to... well, an ordinary cat who likes to play ball. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, not like Rentarou planned for this part, his initial idea was to hit a ball to the room's window to maybe Rapunzel her out or something, but well, that ball's gone, so they gotta go through the front door. And boy did I mention Nano-chan being of use to this mission, because not only did she figure out how to open the door using just the pet door which is typically without a lock or else how is the cat walking out of there, then used stones to hit the... what you call that, knob inside the door, to open the door itself. Well, I'm no professional locksmith and unlikely is Nano-chan but she is doing wonders... until no one can deal with the guard dog. Shout out to Shizuka-chan being there and forgetting to run, literally ended up being bait for the dog haha which kind of works though I would argue, she is too precious to be dealt with, dogs had to lick her instead of... don't imagine anything worse, you perv. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, the rest of them went indoors, and greeting them is a corridor full of infrared lasers which, uh, scientifically humans can't see them, but you know, thanks to Kusuri who sacrificed her application to a famous lab, allowed Rentarou to see now ONLY infrared and you bet this is going to be the problem in the short term AND long term. The short term one is actually good news for Karane and us to be frank, because just hearing her squeal and the assurance(?) of the boy not being able to see anything otherwise is GENIUS (haha thanks Tomita Miyu never thought I wanted this but) because you know, shy girl with tummy out equals content. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, you should go back to listen again with just the audio. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> They did find Hakari though I thought they would pull an evil prank to put the name on another room lol, but yeah, opening the door is already itself a trap. Thankfully, the mom won't k i l l these kids *OOF* just yet lol or else Hakari would be even sadder, but basically no one will believe that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/haha target=_blank>Haha</a>ri here (1) once gave birth thanks to a dying man she loved and was underage which maybe explains her bangin' body lmao, and (2) she would think that her experience of what, losing a loved one and thinking bearing his kid would counter that loss, is what will translate to her daughter's story considering this is the only experience she had so far. I mean, I could do love advice to my colleagues with my experience too at this rate. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> But seriously though, so many wrongs that can't be done but damn why are we still crying over this, because surprise, that's what was supposed to make Rentarou's vision clear out. And you can guess the rest yourself. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... haha totally expected, but damn, it's a good one. So far, just this ending here alone will be the best of this series just because, and yes sorry for not mentioning though my bro already knows, Hahari was voiced by Uesaka Sumire. Yeah, she didn't artificial birth at 13 though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, great episode I am looking forward to more action since she voiced <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/104733/Fuuki_Iinchou target=_blank>that chairperson in Anime "Aho Girl"</a>, I can see why they are doing certain stuff here throughout the episode, the girls trying to justify saving Hakari above anything else, and yeah, I was wondering how would they make the lightning strike again, and here we are. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay, NOW we are moving into uncharted territory. Yeah, anyone fancy generation gap love? We got that now haha I'll laugh this off until next episode don't worry about me I can take these jokes.</div><div>[TL:DR; "Rentarou will never give up in bringing me happiness... Mother won't give up either" Yeah this sounds like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/43969/Kanojo_mo_Kanojo target=_blank>Anime "KanoKano" season one</a> ending but I assure you, one of them isn't doing it out of love.]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGVYjCM5ioSMS9RJpseBfpzTH0NyXZzbzNCyz_EgT-tTZKtk5CdQ6ZUHuKaDZvg16Id-0_J_gD0QSadFL7QLswxZP67jpvatdC_ukdnum1hRcBmKE412Ffb1gGD2x8KESVpOXfq-PKAF4Xp8ISlhMR8aAcW54tQ51O63gKhpB3RlwT16lo51LWdkumIH0/s320/hyakkano10_surgery.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This looks like some sci-fi sh*t happening<br>(Yeah like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/9314/Fractale target=_blank>Anime "Fractale"</a> haha or porno-)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjio3peLnaofmePfZKWhUEs7WdLU4JLy7mFBjNOwVJZx7Ur9V4c7mtsCO3g77qNJiILCe41ZjJIKTrpME2iBouKIydKH89PLPZMNOL6rGFJr5KDd6gPpbFx3ml_UaRzVLB1B0FN23wa1lsO0h4ngd8rou88y24AfGw7EbHcBQ7FAdgRSEMycXvjt631T2M/s320/hyakkano10_hahari2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>BEFORE<br>(Her right cheek is heavier lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3-gkSgl2ZPfMiEMErQlJyMkwU4zTbaQdw_65XHqAG7NqTjRLgNFXus-A4VroM-_LNM-oYqbLDvw9zmrAaxjSZojpnf9RuD4MhjuKM2OxH0IN9nxNTkFAFMDEx4ZZ75HlYKkbCvvZkFrDLx_M3Bakan2xHWFtlCL-OVal3A2WerknFBxCg0Com4bp5B3w/s320/hyakkano10_hahari5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>AFTER<br>(What the whole of next episode will be lmao)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Just say it. It's less painful that way. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha tell the guy to figure out himself, dude, because why must the shy girl explain her feelings to the guy? Oh, does that relate to me also? Uh oh, did I miss someone in my life I don't know? Haha all the coincidences I would have missed glued to my PC at home. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, to not spoil the potential possibility you guys might want to watch this marvel of an episode for yourself, I shall put it shortly on what happened, and then you tell me what's up. Firstly, how Shino-san (did) played it off in front of kissing Naoya. You know, "accident". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But above that, she did hint on the crush thing otherwise, but I swear dude, if you aren't as dumb as Saki-chan and have the same IQ as Naoya? I'm sure you can put two and two together. Yeah, her story and who she kissed. I mean, not that he will be thinking of his two girlfriends at an empty island with just the two of them, just saying. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Anyhow, they did manage to go back to the main island the next morning and somehow Shino-san is fine with what looked like a heat stroke after playing around so much lol Milika-san doesn't get this joy, just that in both cases, she told everything to Milika but told nothing to everyone else. This two-faced b*tch (lol) will keep doing this forever, even if it means hurting the friend more, though in Saki-chan's defence she knew her well this is easily an excuse even if all Shino-san had to do is to make up something with her clothes on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Which, if you understood what this episode had been trying to convey here basically because they are friends that she can't tell her the truth haha a master of secrets right here don't forget she has all the brains too, isn't that ironic but because we are just joining on the Milika-san extortion ride, I feel that maybe we are missing out on otherwise, the not so serious tone of this series after all. But I don't know, maybe let Saki-chan literally beat up Shino and we will see. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Instead though, Shino chose to force herself out of this relationship polygon because who knows how many sides are there in this anyways, and boy, is this getting harder every time. Remember when Shino had to join in the ride just because she can stop this? Yeah, now leaving the ride seems to be a problem now. Regardless of your excuse, looks like it's not going to work for much longer, Shino. "Once nice guy, too much to share", huh. This could only happen in real life drama, dude. I'm still real stoked on how this worked out. Someone give the scriptwriter or author a raise, dude, they nailed it. Honestly, from the start, I know I was prepared for some rollercoaster ride, but now that I have alerted my parents about me talking to the screen I was watching I really need someone else to watch this with lol... Yeah, you got me, Anime. What will be after this though? I really wonder. I doubt the secret for Shino-san will ever be out, I think Naoya would take the hint at this point but I still think he needs confirmation which he will never get, and all of this could be done without being super serious, you know, even without the stereotypical b*tch slaps and stuff? Bro, this Anime is really edging on what it means to talk about romance. Remember the slogan for this Anime back in the first season, about its fresh style romcom thing? Yeah, we're there, dude. Took them two seasons but they did it. Tell me what happens next, I don't even want to guess anymore I feel bad for everyone but not Milika-san at this point. But yeah, playing it off with more jokes, anyone? I'm serious though this is how this series has worked out so far <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiG9_uNQuPl2R3TUIePgNmP51khRE1MRQuX_zg8D6LjX5lT06rMpi-c93Pk2vMWx9Q6rpjV1cMO4fsXq5CB9lOjCDnAfzBJNfeeZ08mwr0HOv6Ha2_35fvSDqSO3ROLuZvCQOTAHp68c5boBojWkpCUq65jBekABG3SWeESwyG9aktjONX7E1DKTsNJvH4/s320/kanokano23_naoya2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me exhausted from last night</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtRmRPX2GruTE47H0LqMh9759tcITZdBSq9lzobnQoAWI8KkDPQSqn2thE8LBJJ-g9ZPtTsiFSLFg6igzif2TXUMmrOuOmZHUzSrfAR_AjCAqkt-_A6gRjhrXSsjC-MFlOoV5Hc8W3ivs-zXoSbst-DBEMIMXpoxNijJLpdKuTNb9J-rC1la6kybynS5c/s320/kanokano23_couple.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Last night<br><span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div></div><div>P.S.

I don't know dude, who makes girls cry even)</table><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=UnderNinja11><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Under Ninja</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Launched through the electric hoodie made for Hibi, with his electrical resistance born from a lightning strike..." Wow how do I gain this ability haha</div></blockquote><div>Oh yeah remember I mentioned we saw Shion holding a sword? Yeah, it's happening, dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode (#UnderNinja11) where the confrontations and lore continue, let's talk about the three things that happened this episode. Firstly, Shion with Saruta. Turns out, Saruta is here to take out Shion. Well, not any NIN apprentice, Shion is the next in line for the organization after his father who supposedly got brain transplanted into that baby beside Sasama, remember? Yeah, that was gross. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But as his mentor has analzyed so far, he still can't wrap his head around why this is a thing, but I'd like to think that someone, whoever it is, wants a potential successor dead, since he's less protected than his other family members. With this, I surely thought we will say goodbye to Saruta because Shion did smartly use his teddy bear as a target aim for that Escape satellite, but damn did that thing take too long to fire I don't know how Kuro-san did it that fast with the school director tbh, but yeah not surprising Saruta had time to escape (get it?) despite being cornered in a ground-floor corridor. Which also means sadly, we had to say goodbye to Mako-chan who honestly did WAY better than her other two buddies she was with because apart from noticing the assailant without getting hit immediately likely thanks to Shion then again it was the blood on him so far, but also, her sword is a projectile which promptly injured the enemy, letting Saruta limp away into the rooftops. Not the other rooftop though, we will talk about that in a bit. Next up, the undergrounds. I assume this is the school director's plan of using Noguchi and Sato-san from the newspaper club to fetch Suzuki who just lost her leg and helping them escape (get it?) the chaos that might happen... soon? Well, that beam is going to come down it's just a matter of time. Nonetheless, we were introduced to more of the plot, and looks like Japan's economy was ruined in the 80s because of them ninja printing fake money. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh heck, I beg to differ but sure, dude. Last but not least, regardless if they will make it alive, is how we have to deal with Yamada. Honestly saying, the drama unveiled so far is just a fashion show between Kuro and his duplicate just without the muscles and it's a woman lmao, as they show off their <a href=https://jisho.org/search/katana target=_blank>katana</a> in front of each other despite seeing Hibi in a defeated state. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, <em>that</em> guy is such a loser I can't even. Gotta say though, Kuro-san still won this beauty contest, hands down. And I'm a straight man. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Well, I guess all the action is on next week, so much for the build-up of hype this week. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We are at the final episode, people, in case you aren't counting. So yeah, we shall see how that works. The action so far though, real impressive though falling short, but I'll take it. As I ponder for the end of this adaptation, I really wonder what does this series mean in terms of story and everything else in between. The latter though, probably did way better, and that might be where I think from I suppose. See you then.</div><div>[TL:DR; "Does that mean the world of ninja split up after the war, now these two sides are enemies to each other?"

Speaking of which, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/1715994341?l=en-US" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new album</a></b> with the two-member team isn't impressive, and as I said to myself, it's half the composers (technically we don't count vocalist Kiyoe-san) so that's half the songs I'll give on their album so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> Then again I didn't give that many songs in their previous album so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> haha we have much uncertainty with these guys going forward already to be frank. Thanks to this disappointment, I then dove into <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/welcome-to-my-castle/1716068321?l=en-US" target=_blank>Chilli Beans. new album</a></b> and boy did it help conclude this year's songs well. With all the Pop-Rock songs hitting the fences, I went from addiction to impressed to wow am I glad I picked up their debut EP when I listened to them on a Rock festival video performance. So yeah, I would say this just won Hitsujibungaku, but just barely. I may have criticisms for these girls but I'm not going to ignore that since we are done for the year. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>We have more news this week on the Internet we call not Y <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>, so let's talk about them! For starters, let me get the sad news out of the way because besides me unfollowing them because I'm not that keen on the band since last year, <b><a href="https://x.com/_kanaboon/status/1734121157874602447?s=20" target=_blank>KANA-BOON announced a hiatus after losing half their members</a></b> even though, as you would be reminded, they have gained back their bassist who... disappeared for unknown reasons. So yeah, I hope you are keen on their new song next year for a movie, I think. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on we need more good news here, <b><a href="https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1734138495177023585?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo new single will be released next February</a></b> which will not only be released on Valentine's Day which, nice, but also be credited in her first major role in a... let's say <a href="https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1734136301656605126?s=20" target=_blank>short 2-episode drama series</a>. That's... all I will talk about she is some mangaka who gained inspiration from the food she eat. Yes, she will be eating like in <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyzGNeJPuKUgA4tqgjlSEewMGDND-vCEOrs64ulfW9uPkD5bgP83THVYlQVzkK_XxnHjgGTbS-jePUTtThDUNcSCk5c0aPfGNVNnwzKSv16TJ7AkCnRch1m7yWFnaw4zKBTHovUbqMRaugSsOyDEE476rIergBjsuPWdeVJ1zJhGC6_oYb66_xmwyEuC8/s320/koufukugraffiti05_28.jpg target=_blank>Anime "Koufuku Graffitti"</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/The_FirstTake/status/1734921108569371074?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new video on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> is unironically one of theie newest songs in their latest single which damn, can I not recommend more for you to listen to it despite it becoming popular due to it being credited for the new "PreCure" movie. <b><a href="https://x.com/specialthanks_7/status/1734890959903883542?s=20" target=_blank>SpecialThanks new music video</a></b> is cheeky, and the song is upbeat and very like them, though I would say the song is rather short but this is also very them. Not giving at this point though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/AKG_information/status/1735136882818994388?s=20" target=_blank>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION new live digest</a></b> is such a nostalgia trip from the newest stuff to the old stuff as far as I can remember and boy did I not know of Hitsujibungaku's vocalist Shiotsuka Moeka until what, a year ago? Damn, this is such a trip. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Maybe I listen to this next week when it comes out. <b><a href="https://x.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1735223602209816835?s=20" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora announced a new single releasing next month in celebration of her 10th year as a solo artist</a></b> (wow it has been that long I'm old) which brings back the debut single staff to write for her once again, now without Anime as credit so this will be rad as it is uncertain, I'm sure. We have some <b>Anison Awards</b> to give out that isn't from here (lol) so congrats <a href="https://x.com/codamappimusic/status/1735664006935822536?s=20" target=_blank>Kodama Hikari</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Sukimega/status/1735671318664618225?s=20" target=_blank>Ooshi Masayoshi's collaboration with the "SukiMega" main cast</a> on them! In an awards ceremony full of "Attack on Titan" and "Oshi no Ko" credit, these come as niche as they are also in my opinion great. <b><a href="https://x.com/Sukimega/status/1735671318664618225?s=20" target=_blank>SPYAIR's new single will release in next February</a></b> which will signal their new vocalist coming into place for their new works so yeah, let's see how this goes if <a href="https://x.com/SPYAIRSTAFF/status/1736038472534884620?s=20" target=_blank>their newest remaster</a> isn't much of an indication. <b><a href="https://x.com/nanoripe_info/status/1735691186210583036?s=20" target=_blank>nano.RIPE's new song collaboration</a></b> with another artist is... alright I guess I don't feel much because this is quite stereotypical of their songs anyways. And I guess this is too late to say now, that in celebration of their new album release <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1735857281684885644?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's Amazon Music Live from 2 months ago is on YouTube for the weekend</a></b>! Which ends right about now as you read this so welp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again half of it is promotion for their new single on Amazon Music <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>So next week, I think I'll have to spend a lot more time to prepare for <b>Klassic Note Song Awards</b> this year, so don't ask what new songs I'll be listening since I'll need to listen back to determine who are the award winners (heck, nominees even) and my beloved Top 20 rankings. We are 2 weeks left into this, so let's make sure we start Year 16 right!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Well, that's all for the week for now. Next week... well the new package is still not coming in together thanks to that Earphones gacha which I totally should not have done especially when I'm informed of its indefinite delay which, thank goodness this is a thing, might coincide with the new volume of "Douki-chan" and the upcoming Comiket, so we shall see how this goes then. Sorry guys, no Christmas miracle this year. Not even with Monica, I only got like, (not Miyazawa) Koharu and Tsukushi. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> That's it. Kinda sad Christmas this year, honestly. Hopefully next week will be better with Sumipe's birthday livestream in case you don't know it's a thing, and we shall see if my replacement Surface Pro will be better. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> I know right, gotta give Christmas gift to myself if no one else is giving me anything. Also, that popping of the screen on the old Surface is giving me anxiety (yes, swollen battery) so thanks for the service for 7 years. See, who says Surface devices don't last long; I grind on DOAXVV every week in super low resolution and frame rate haha I think the wiping of the old device is done, I shall see you next week.
