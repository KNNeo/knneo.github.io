I'm saying it again just in case, you know, you missed the previous two days I said this. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>So, the plan for this special will be to talk about Anime "Hyakkano" and the next season preview, so I am kind of worried what I will be doing this upcoming Sunday but heck, there will be no Entertainment News Issue #53 just because we have a Song Awards to prepare on the same day. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'll think about if I have anything pending to watch haha but meanwhile... let's get this going!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Hyakkano12><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na Hyakunin no Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Come to my room." Oh boy haha</div></blockquote><div>Yeah yeah I know there is <a href="https://x.com/hyakkano_anime/status/1738922222813868075?s=20" target=_blank>season two announcement</a> already this is giving me dangerous <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/48926/Komi-san_wa_Comyushou_desu target=_blank>Anime "Komi-san"</a> production vibes, but hey, let's finish this up! Well, it's not going to be over so soon for Rentarou in this final episode though (#Hyakkano12), hey is ANYONE into cross-dressing? Literally, anyone?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In case you may not have realized this is likely a meme episode as much as it's also, like all episodes you have seen so far, going to wrap up Hahari's presence in this... long relationship with Rentarou's family of soulmates. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Shall we? For starters, not the cross-dressing please I think we just killed him, dude. I mean, if you did this to me I will die too, no matter what the circumstances. Aijou Rentarou confirmed heterosexual male. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>  Thankfully, they didn't make this lore outstay its presence thank goodness really <span class=emoji title=🙏>*prays*</span>, so we will talk about the peeping haha that one I think is just flair, but we shall talk about Shizuka-chan. No really, this is THE MOST we have heard her monologue since heck, her introduction episode? Yeah, and boy, is this cute girl voice always going to get me. Contrary to the others who (even reluctantly) (lol) want to see Rentarou in just skin haha, Shizuka-chan being the most pure and innocent of them all, chose to protect his virginity(?) by ensuring the girls don't get to him in the bathroom. Uh, plan failed successfully I guess, as the Hanazono family tied her up real quick and fled like the wind. Oh boy. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In a crazy set of circumstances which I will not bother you guys with because I swear the author wore the Invisibility Cloak and opened the door to the bathroom for Shizuka lol that's a Harry Potter joke, she got to see what all the girls wanted to see, even though as he expected, Rentarou did go through the precaution of wearing the towel on his crotch. Welp, missed it by that much. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then, which I still think is the crux of this episode, about Hahari's love for two guys. Well... technically not cheating on her boy I won't argue too much into that, but heck, Rentarou is still technically right about being able to love many at once, despite what it feels like cheating on the previous lover- Bro, Hahari doesn't know about being a widow? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh yeah, I guess they didn't marry but still. Just love, dude, look at this series in general. Or even better, look at my relationship with idols just in this series now- Moving on, an appearance of the dad?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Damn, this Anime can do anything even talk to ghosts which I'm pretty sure it's real, Rentarou, ghosts can do such things in your dreams, and as much as we would like to see two main guys in this Anime, we don't (haha), so the dad left everything in Renratou's capable hands. How wholesome. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... as we are introduced to at least what, 4 new girls waiting for them to meet Rentarou's eyes in Hahari's now newly bought property which is the high school... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You get the idea this romance comedy is a mess of its own. Still, production wise I think they did a good job in conveying what they want, jumping between introductions and conclusions for each character giving them enough pace to play around... I think we will finish this series in animation by season 16. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Of course I don't think they will go so far, but as mentioned at the start, this might be a two part thing after all, if Anime "Komi-san" so far has been an indicator of how these types of series will go. Still, I got myself into watching this with <a href="https://x.com/hyakkano_anime/status/1738899825608024131?s=20" target=_blank>such a stellar cast</a> I can't even ask for more, so don't ask how good this is I'm just here for the ride. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Jokes aside though, if I were to criticise on this, and this might be an eventuality, is that production will not be able to love the girls as much as Rentarou will, which will be a problem I foresee sometime into the future, but not until we get bored of its jokes because it's going well so far. We shall see, guys, for season two on this. Still worth a watch though, I'll take such a bold <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsundere target=_blank>tsundere</a> anytime of the day hehe I hope you know of my preferences now</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQo57eCMzY-eJvDCsh7doUQ9PnxVWbJed2zWqUNErNWRsy8JCBbO3DKhMrx1r6unj9N-v3cgY2QeiI1rpN-RrmuKigl8G2Ba0Pa7vM23g9iLlrsTnMD5JouIzp3HRj8SAa74NedavXRklDtPqs1b-IlR_KdTk9UIIYYCZw8igenLhGA_DZuLNu0CVFYmQ/s320/hyakkano12_ikemen2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Shout out to Nano-kun, they saved Rentarou and this very episode</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYhCkZyfGTDcBxonZm1ZBBEVfmuesvXpMe1KppPzUt7-pASODoLm5DpPO672JmtbpWCdcFsQ8UWYPlkp19y4sp4SeBCQCjoA3yX-9lN7yCruHuqCcU7eLZyqoVwX4qNeJZicH2FZfATE03TKyquFf8nfB5sP4EvbOJYYC5Zm6-p7dRKWOQe0hMmaOARX0/s1600/hyakkano12_screaming.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is just too cute I can't even<br>(Which one?

href=https://randomc.net/2023/12/18/winter-2024-preview/ target=_blank>Random Curiosity</a>]</div></blockquote><div>It's that time of the year again, where well at least for the new year, I get to decide what to watch by then. Considering my mood now? I just hope I am not that keen on watching romance series again. (Haha yeah watch me choose 100 of them lol get it this is an Anime joke)</div><div><br></div><div>So, in summary and in Japan TV simulcast order, here are my comments for the new animations in Japan:</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Can I just talk about once again, how many damn sequels there are each season? Can we have new shows? Or is that not making money now? <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span><li>Okay I guess <b>"Dungeon Meshi"</b> is basically the food in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou target=_blank>Anime "Nagasarete Airantou"</a> where everything looks big and weird but tastes great? I'm good haha<li><b>"Sokushi Cheat"</b> your title is too long and OBVIOUSLY it's isekai genre so <strike>no thanks</strike> get the f**k out of here lol<li><b>"Sasaki to Pii-chan"</b> sounds great with Sugita-san and Yuuki Aoi (hehe) until the isekai part. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> MOVING ON lol can we just not<li>Interesting concept for <b>"Momochi-san Chi no Ayakashi Ouji"</b> for a different take in house-bound spirits but damn is the shoujo genre power strong here- Is that Kamiyama You for opening theme song? NOPE haha<li>Okay so <b>"Pon no Michi"</b> is basically Maeda Kaori opening a mahjong place and we don't have to deal with the bullsh*t powers in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/5671/Saki target=_blank>Anime "Saki"</a>. Alright. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><li>Oh wow don't tell me that in <b>"Kekkon Yubiwa Monogatari"</b> I get to date Akarin but she is from another world? I mean technically in this blog this is happening NOW lmao<li><b>"Yubisaki to Renren"</b> sounds like a great love story I've missed all this time, and yes I probably did over the past year, but this also feels to me more of selling the guy more than the girl who has hearing impairment so... I mean, I watched "Skip to Loafer" and I'm already sad from its drama so maybe not this time. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><li>Holy shit why are some of these titles SO DAMN LONG??? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><li>Well, I guess if the princess is enjoying herself, you wouldn't even know she's a prisoner in a demon world. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As much as I would like to hear Shiraishi Haruka (the last time I heard of her is in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37722/Uchi_no_Maid_ga_Uzasugiru target=_blank>Anime "UzaMaid"</a>?) scream like a madgirl lol, I don't think I will watch <b>"Hime-sama “Goumon” no Jikan desu"</b> just because. Just because of what? Yes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><li>Okay I hope I didn't understand this wrong, so basically <a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Winter%202024%20Preview/Dosanko%20Gal%20wa%20Namaramenkoi.jpg target=_blank><b>"Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi"</b></a> [Premieres January 8th, 2024] is <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/48736/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru target=_blank>Anime "Kisekoi"</a> dealing with gals but is in Hokkaido? I'm not entirely convinced Sakura Ayane would be a great one in this case- I'M IN haha but really though, she thicc. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> No, not Ayaneru she isn't this Anime girl, not even close. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><li>Wow I don't know if I can watch TWO Anime with Ayaneru in it. Haha yes, I have fallen in love with her voice as much as <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Winter%202024%20Preview/Oroka%20na%20Tenshi%20wa%20Akuma%20to%20Odoru.jpg target=_blank>"Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru"</a></b> [Premieres January 8th, 2024] has the main couple fall into their own trap, where if I mean trap I meant each other lol, and the best part I think about this is, is that they made sure the angel-demon level thing is kept to a minimum. Yeah, without that fantasy level stuff, this is basically <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen target=_blank>Anime "Kaguya-sama"</a>, isn't it? Hehe I don't know dude, I don't like dumb fantasy romcoms... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (I don't think it'll be great though, but I shall give it a try)<li>Is <b>"Gekai Elise"</b> just <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/52991/Sousou_no_Frieren target=_blank>Anime "Frieren"</a> from the previous season? Why does the girl look the same- Shoujo genre also? I'm good lol<li>"There’s an old saying that claims that you will become a wizard if you haven’t lost your virginity by 30." Alright Anime, sh*t on me, will ya?<li>Ok I watched the trailer in it's entirety for <b>"Gekkan Mousou Kagaku"</b> and I still don't get what is happening lol bye~<li>Hey, not going to say too much, but I might just give <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Winter%202024%20Preview/Majo%20to%20Yajuu.jpg target=_blank>"Majo to Yajuu"</a></b> [Premieres January 11th, 2024] here a chance. Why though? Hmm... if the epic trailer isn't a hint of how good this might become, and ignoring that written in the preview the author did pass away... uh haha oh well, hey at least if this Anime works they can't make a sequel... right?? Uh, I don't know, I might just take a look to see what's up. A witch protecting a town though witches are normally the destroyers of them is something to think about. Yeah, Hikasa Youko too, her voice throughout the trailer is convincing me to watch this. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></ul><div>And that's it! Oh damn bummers if I have to watch romance series once again because damn is the fantasy genre just unable to distance themselves from the isekai premise, still did manage to get me somehow so I'm not too sure, but also, I think for the new year I should give more look at pure fantasy genres so I'll take a peek at some of them. Maybe.
