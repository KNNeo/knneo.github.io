Haha never hurts to do it again! Sumipe did show off a swimsuit when she was in some pool in Singapore last weekend so</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks to a wholesome sale from voice actor magazine publisher Seigura which ended two days ago (so, sorry), I got my hands on Ten-chan's <a href=https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0CD2175NB/ target=_blank>latest</a> <a href=https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0CD238P7M/ target=_blank>photobooks</a> which (yes) (and technically they aren't full on photobooks but) was 2 for the price of 1 so yay that's great and I think I got my money's worth after seeing what's inside since no one was pirating this so I guess these will be my phone wallpaper for the rest of this new month other than the couple of birthdays which will of course, not feature this lady. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Let's Anime and music! Wait, is that "KanoKano" on the front for once because I'm so invested in the story I'm more keen than "Hyakkano" which was already a week late? Haha I mean they did stop introducing new girls so if we are comparing apples to apples...</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanoKano21><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kanojo mo Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Why is this happening to me?" I don't know Shino because you can't like the guy? Haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div></blockquote><div>I mean, if the plane crashes, Naoya, you'll die a happy man. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Or if you and any one of them survive depending on the situation and number of them, we can continue this story. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where Naoya's feat is in the 50s when plane crashes happen more often than in his mind lol (#KanoKano21), we arrive at Okinawa. Ah, Okinawa. Where rules don't exist and they have a serious shortage in clothing. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, where Saki-chan intends to enjoy herself while hopefully remembering to get a kiss out of this with Naoya, Nagisa who wants to support this any way she can, and we don't talk about how Milika-san and Shino are working together so they get their good times themselves. Oh, separately, by the way, since Shino-san had to sacrifice herself to get in the way just like everyone else ironically lmao, she will always be part of the action. You see her hug Naoya to stop everyone else from hugging him on the plane? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways haha, they have arrived, so let's touch on what has happened so far. Not much, actually. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, that time where only Naoya and Saki-chan were together was not that bad for a kiss scene and their first <em>technically</em> need not be the best hehe we can do this any old time, but hey, maybe not I guess- Does Naoya know when to do this though? I know Saki-chan doesn't she might still be too embarrassed to do the deed. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Nagisa goes on the aggression though, well not just the hugging because damn I want to hug a woman with her bangin' body in a swimsuit someday hehe (Note to self, the voice actress is married, hello? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>), but I think she is getting her times' worth when she can do all of this flirting while making sure her... rival? Her other girlfriend (lol) gets what she wants. That is, until the other two had to get in the way. Well, so far Milika-san has only been her own self trying to physically get herself in the way of... well anything as seen from how Naoya wants to be in private with Saki-chan so blatantly obvious I think only Saki-chan herself still didn't know what's up lmao, still isn't as crazy or extreme as Shino-san who will take off her (already flat) top (lmao) to ensure Naoya passes out before he can do anything to her friend...? Yeah, we are at this stage now, people. These are no accidents anymore, people. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> It is still kinda wrong to allow Milika-san have her way to now tied up Naoya in bed (lmao) and just walk away like the brave girl Shino is which I must say still blows my mind how the f**k is Milika-san getting away with this all the damn time but now with an accomplice? It's not that impossible after all, this evil. What happens next? I'm not guessing so you can try. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... At this point we are aiming for the kiss scene between Naoya and Saki-chan. Also, what makes you think that a liar and scheming b*tch like Milika-san will hold her promise to the innocent girl that is Shino-san (LMAO) and still ensure the secret of her crush won't be let out of the bag? As I see now, both of these are going to happen at some point anyways so... Season 3 I guess? Haha that's how they do things now right? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyhow, more desperate Shino-san is always welcome hehe not so much for Milika-san with the school swimsuit by the way, and let's see how bad this goes. Oh boy, even the preview warned through the fourth wall to not do anything too erotic lmao why am I laughing so much at this dumb ecchi drama</div><div>[TL:DR; "You two need to stop with the will-they-won't-they kiss scam!"

Alright who stole the Resident Evil references lol</div></blockquote><div>I mean, what can go wrong... right?? RIGHT?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this movie adaptation of the popular zombie videogame series- Wait, this isn't? Haha okay I better not reference the wrong stuff this is not Hollywood. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#Hyakkano08) where medicine becomes poison? Kusuri-chan, I thought we don't do this stuff? How does this kissing one not stop after 10 minutes? HOW?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah I know right, FBI would like a word with you lol this is too powerful to be kept in a high school science lab. Anyways, we have a lot going on in case you didn't notice this has essentially became a video game reference haha, so let's talk about it. To conclude the Kusuri introduction arc I assume, they made the girls all so horny(?) to have crazy desire to kiss, the other two had to figure out how to reverse them all. Well, they could make enough reversal drugs, but not unless Kusuri herself has access to the lab, which is where they are going first. Problem is, these not zombies are AGGRESSIVE!! Haha what is bad about that you might ask, but besides going a whole lot more physical which will no doubt give them cramps later after they recover from the drug's effects haha besides Nano-chan I guess getting cramps is likely not efficient so she rather exercise, this is just not the normal them. And that's the first hint we get to see from all of them in general, where firstly, because Shizuka-chan powered up still can't beat me in running (lol), it was rather easy to dispose of her (lmao) by you know, trying harder. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But Rentarou did break when he saw his dear girl fall face to the ground (I mean I would too, Naganawa-san hehe) and decide to help her to the doctor's room, only to realize he fell into his own trap and... enjoyed a long-lasting smooching session with one of his girlfriends. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Wait, THIS is bad?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Rentarou did realize that too though haha, and told her to "hang in there" while he heads to the lab to cure her. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Next up, the girls. You know who I am talking about, those two wouldn't even mind sharing a kiss with their boi and still cooperated till this point to catapult themselves to Rentarou to kiss... not him but each other?? Haha you got that right. Since this is PERFECTLY NORMAL and I am not the judge to that this is just perfectly understood they do this on the radio show too haha of course not you idiot, are dumb enough to kiss each other, you guessed it, because they are that close to each other. Remember, the drug only gives drive to the kissing, didn't say who and definitely not on altering everything else. Yeah, <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsundere target=_blank>tsundere</a> Karane is still tsundere even with the drug's effects. We just can't comprehend that because their words are only interpreted in "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/chu- target=_blank>chu</a>" at this point. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Which will make us truly unable to comprehend Nano-chan's efficiency and planning since, as the smartest girlfriend in the bunch lol sorry girls, she made sure to stop Kusuri from going into the lab just because. So welp, game over, might as well let him get kissed to all hell so that Kusuri can make the drugs and save him. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Which is essentially it, but you know, gotta put them in the same closet with the grown-up senpai first. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, I did expect that, so thanks Anime you have done wonders haha and nonetheless, we did arrive at the end part where Rentarou effectively has to give Kusuri enough time to make them reversal drugs or else it'll be game over and he will be kissing Nano-chan forever- Did they just hire someone to make the fake video game credits as if it's game over AND let them scrub it as much as they want? In case you wonder where the Anime budget went... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... lesson learnt, I guess. Well, as long as the drugs don't physically kill anyone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, we can kiss forever and ever if you want. Uh, I take dibs on 3 of the girls first, actually. In order, please. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay maybe just wet Hakari BECAUSE NEXT WEEK (haha) since we are done with introductions this will be the first into the conclusion of this season, and I wonder what that is. This can go ANYWHERE and so far this Anime has proven itself haha IS EDE-CHAN GETTING MARRIED TO ME??

Oh, just a beautiful woman with firm breasts? SIGN ME UP- Please do not hit me in this new episode or use me to hit someone else haha (#UnderNinja09), yeah it feels like Eita is only useful for such things, huh. Kuro-san did that to him too, using him to punch a bully. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, also useful in being held hostage, I think Eita might be good for that. Or else how did you think he can be used to punch some discipline teacher and/or be used as bait for Kuro and Hibi and the others to appear? Oh oops, too much info at the beginning, so let's tear it down a bit. According to sources and especially the school's director, the Kodan High one, looks like the UN ninja is going to strike that school for whatever reason it is, but let's say at this point it's to create chaos. So orders from the organization above them are as follows: It's either they kill them because they told them where Saruta that invisible ninja is, or they kill Suzuki and Onikobe in which case it will also kill Saruta since the satellite might as well obliterate the whole school for good measure. So yeah, the lesser casualties the possible, yes? Especially with you two girls. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But sadly, things have already gone out of hand, as Saruta covertly kills one after another especially with the girls from that one government organization which were supposed to be fighting Kuro's gang... not that one who is sleeping with the grandson of the leader of the ninjas though yeah Shion, that one is having a great time. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh boy, how I envy that kid, but let's put him aside for now. Since he isn't going to help out the panic that is essentially created from you know, someone invisible killing people, ironically isn't causing any panic compared to the PA in school which was overridden by that school director, who insists on talking to Suzuki and Onikobe to help get this UN rat, in exchange for a meeting with Katou. Well, hope that won't cause more fatalities but the ninja did drag a head from the school entrance to the classroom so... <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> Haha and don't get me talking about what is happening in the other high school as all this is happening. All in all... interesting plot progression so far. And let me talk about why. You know what's happening in the high school already, right? No, not Kodan High. That one has Suzuki and Onikobe and Katou dealing with it. Though I would argue how do we even see Saruta if he can be just standing a distance away from the crowd, or you know, he just stops killing students for a bit he'll be totally invisible to anyone. But not this, the yankee one. The one with Yamada on it, holding Eita-kun hostage as of now, waiting for Kuro and the others to appear. You get it now? Yeah, I hope so. Because what seems to be the conclusion to this arc isn't just more kids dying, but OUR MAIN BOY PERVERT EITA DYING? NO. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright jokes over, but hey, the biggest problem I can only see so far is, who is Yamada here? Another high level ninja like Sasama? But looks like Lightning Hibi is going to strike first so I'll look forward to that. Hey, reviews might be bad out there but I'm enjoying this, actually. I can still like the girls more lmao</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMgu4Wi6GsAhf5lcsTWcD0otW83k-u53nMXPcVKu1WglhHKNXXDPw7Chl5ndSssqoaoE7jEJ03afU_FkZGt6sVIm0WJgqHEKxgdWIki0LQ45WDcHffZ-VT9-zE2LHMchsJ1rxidJbFynW19lPrSP2eHbIwm0yXjjqTXjNdgTVA9tpBxqjHbTm6r4k4X7w/s320/underninja09_grope2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This episode in a nutshell:<br>You don't want to know what happened lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1bjeH3cO76Alyh-MORBREwksGFG16aBiznt1KymPA8Xbvgj2KthH7DSjBWKpK_r41S4DZLLbigGFu0xAiu32QV9Axuf2l_eEeQi-Q0bmXA3Lh4optudfoBJTvlemE-DN_CoEvK-MXdE-BV7iYCG6i2YSdTFqmygJsWJGF0YohJzfDc8Yne-juERoNPeg/s320/underninja09_grope3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This episode in a nutshell:<br>Just because she has an eye undone doesn't mean he can't feel your hand bro</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I can barely hear <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1730391507704902062?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new song for a commercial</a></b> but oh well we only have two weeks to wait anyways so that's fine. But what you can hear is <b><a href="https://x.com/The_FirstTake/status/1730572464160432503?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari singing a famous Anime theme song in THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> so you're welcome to enjoy a 2008 classic because I don't ninja Anime. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Yeah, and also <a href="https://x.com/mizunoyoshiki/status/1730579029315682738?s=20" target=_blank>tell Mizuno-san the composer where you are hearing this from</a>, I guess. <b><a href="https://x.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1730527160505622926?s=20" target=_blank>Earphones' new live video</a></b> is for a classic I never really liked but defined their group for many years.

December, by the way. Not many new releases, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And if I have some time I'll take a listen to FINLANDS' only member <b>Shioiri Fuyuko's new EP</b>(?) if I have the time on Friday.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Damn, is the year ending real soon. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not to be nostalgic or anything I could do without this year if not for blogging about what I like haha that was great <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, but maybe, maybe next year should be a year of change. I hope. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Fingers crossed, people! And sorry for the trauma dump, my life is already sad enough I don't need to share it with others. That's why I talk to myself, <em>mom</em>. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> See anyone else next time, and until then... maybe I should write fanfics more often hehe I got SO MUCH to write about Inorin and Rieri with fictional me I can't even-</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
