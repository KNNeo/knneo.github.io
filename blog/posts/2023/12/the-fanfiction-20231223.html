<div>Well bad news first if you didn't get the hint, this series is ending.</div><div><br></div><div>I mean, I will come back, just taking a break from all this because damn is my interest in... everything dwindling recently and I'm not too sure why, so maybe in the new year when I get more hope then will I continue fantasizing on girls. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I will talk about more on that next week to end the season though.</div><div><br></div><div>Good news? We're doing a Christmas special today!! Haha okay, should I say this or should I say we're talking about chest because it'll be a better clickbait? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, we reached the minimum intro length already so no. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> HAVE YOU GUYS FELT HUGE RACK BEFORE, DUDE??? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Uesaka Sumire in a red strapless dress, holding on to a glass of champagne in her right hand, standing by a Christmas tree" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=354 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl800774.jpg title="Uesaka Sumire" width=138></div><blockquote><i>I was never a fan of social interactions, but when I was told to go to a party thanks to my stepsister Shiina, I could not refuse. With the intention of just hanging around, I ended up alone in the party with mostly females, making me feel way more awkward than I was used to. I then took a book out of some love advice I read online: Find the most attractive woman, chat up to her, and that will make your night.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><div><i>I looked around and saw Uesaka Sumire in a red strapless dress and my mind ran wild seeing a body of epic proportions. I approached her as she was drinking champagne alone. I introduced myself to her and we had some chatter. I told a joke about chest and made her laugh, but my real intention was the follow up: I casually asked what her bust size was.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>She whispered softly to me a letter and placed a finger to her lips. I stood at a corner of the lively party in silence as she walked away. I felt like I just knew a secret that should never be revealed to mankind.</i></div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbbKx_GMEBWAixcuvJ7D-S7JdPmI0fkyEIpFV3pQg3o3MxWhEJHuEC9EUKNCYRW9WLsrQ51rV21v6-P29QWfOcVAwOP1_Hqi0RWOVVhCA1EOzOtYH1ZyXAczWHGLvF2Mq1DkMp3dDWT6e4fZYuAoR3KDgTbGts9dLP9b5UezEXrRrTjG42QXJeM0GEMBw/s320/servantservice03_counting.jpg target=_blank>"A, B, C, D..."</a> Haha shout out to Anime "Servant x Service" for reminding me of this joke. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, first appearance of Sumipe in this series, and we're already doing this, huh, talking about her bangin' body. Is this how I want to be remembered? Then again, this is the first time fictional me is picking up chicks so yeah? I mean, she is one of a kind, alright? My bro witnessed it when he went to the signing event in our local convention recently- Just lock me up in a closet with her and we'll find out. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> That said though, if you have not witnessed much from her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1E2G8xPXrj/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target=_blank>alluring Instagram selfies</a>, then maybe you should be like me and buy a photobook or two from her (not the early ones, those are gothic and unless you like those) to see them jugs for yourself. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Have a Merry Christmas everybody I know I will there's the <a href="https://x.com/doax_vv_staff/status/1738369808335544661?s=20" target=_blank>DOAXVV livestream tonight</a> and Ede-chan is in it hehe we need a Christmas miracle and I think this might be it</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. But seriously though, what do you think her cup size is? My thoughts? Probably E cup. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Mainly I don't think she is stacked because she does have quite the body (lol) and if you know, bust size is measured circling your rack in comparison to the circumference under, what you call that?
