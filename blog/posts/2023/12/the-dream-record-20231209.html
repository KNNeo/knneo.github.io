<div>Wow did I just dream of Ogura Yui with her clothes off and measuring my-</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe it's just me, maybe it's because I followed her photobook's social media account (hehe), but whatever it is to say, it's a great Saturday morning, Friday nights are the best, but instead of playing kinky (lol) I dreamt of it?? I was worried I didn't get a boner out of this though!!</div><div><br></div><div>Haha jokes aside I don't miss typing this early in the morning so I have been recalling what happened lmao, so here you go! Really, how she got into my dream is a mystery in itself. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>"I was in Singapore, under the streets of Bugis along the fashion show with Ogura Yui. Somehow I was cheekily pushing a trolley of sorts down the walkway, I have it a strong shove, it nearly missed her, and she gave a confused look. As I approached, she was browsing through outfits, putting them against her chest to check for size, also keeping me happy and my mind screaming off her cuteness in the process.<div><br></div><div>Suddenly, I think we were both in a changing room, as she half took off most of her clothing including her underwear!! I noticed that she has sunken nipples despite them not being large, and she does look skinny, but the sight is worst bewildering. I was topless and she was using a measuring tape to measure my bust size! Due to its limited length though, she was holding along the ends of the tape, I was trying to squint sideways to get a reading, but she saw it better before releasing it after all the effort was put into doing it.</div><div><br></div><div>"B... 110"</div><div><br></div><div>I shouted in amazement while Yui-chan laughed uncontrollably while kneeling on the ground. I wonder if I gained that much weight, or I was so jacked that normal tops may not fit me anymore. "Still M size, by the way", I said in reply, with Yui-chan still laughing at the back without her clothes fully on."</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>BRO</b> haha this is NOT a porno, by the way. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> This is <em>so</em> going to get me cancelled though because damn WHY ARE WE DOING THIS IN PUBLIC haha not even in the hidden fashion streets of Singapore- Though now that I think about it that's rather kinky and that might have happened before anyways so <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤·>*shrugs*</span> HAHA ok NOW I have to buy the photobook already, huh.</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Bust size 110, according to a quick search online (which is likely for Westerners and is generally smaller for Asians), is equivalent to wearing an XL size top. Haha "M size, by the way" <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span>Â </div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. I think though, that her manager was in my dream throughout because I have a feeling someone is spying on us- She was also laughing with someone just like how the staff will do so when they do podcasts so... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¬>*cringe*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheDreams"><span class="material-icons small-icons">cloud</span>The Dreams</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text Â© 2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
