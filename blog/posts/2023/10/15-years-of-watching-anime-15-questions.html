I can tell you what is bad though; Don't ask me what is good because almost all of them I picked up are."</i></blockquote></div><div><br></div><div>I feel like I should put this quote to start this very post. I should have done this post a decade in but you know, it's never too late. As such, I shall do a Q&amp;A post in this 15th anniversary Anime reflection special!!</div><div><br></div><div>I swear it was probably a wiser choice to do this stuff every season but then again we are specifically here to celebrate <a href=https://knwebdiary2008.blogspot.com/2008/10/term-4-week-8-head-start-to-knock-on.html target=_blank>the very first season I was into Anime back in October 2008 watching "Toradora!"</a> (cannot unsee unglam diary blog post) and the FIFTEEN years of me watching Japanese animation so if you want to know more or if you were just here from <a href=https://myanimelist.net/animelist/aozakish target=_blank>my MyAnimeList profile</a> lol... welcome!! This is going to be a long ride.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>THE FIRST YEARS</div><div>This is not going to be an introductory post into the world of Japanese animation, so if you know nothing you are better off not being here haha bye everyone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But if you DO know a little about Anime, you can stay and hear about my journey into this mess when I started this a decade and a half ago!</div><div><br></div><div>As mentioned in the intro, this marks the very first season I have started watching Anime on a weekly basis as of simulcast (in Japan, but even back then licensing has allowed same week airtimes) which yes, I'm sure many of us have watched Anime without realizing it, because back then "Pokémon" and the likes of "Doraemon" are also counted as Anime, even if it's geared towards a younger audience. Even that has a genre in itself (Seinen), and that sort of explain the many new grounds left untouched and the many times my sister who showed me to many shows I have seen before undertaking the exploration myself, from "Love Hina" to "Cardcaptor Sakura" which were aimed at a younger female audience (<a href=https://jisho.org/search/shoujo target=_blank>Shoujo</a>), and even "Kekkaishi" was a recommendation. My classmates also introduced me to classics and that's how I ended up watching "BLEACH" and "Nagasarete Airantou", which were more geared towards a young male audience (<a href=https://jisho.org/search/shounen target=_blank>Shounen</a>). </div><div><br></div><div>My first expedition was through back then cable TV where a new channel geared towards a younger audience started adding late night Anime airings to their schedule. (Remember this is not Japan, and there wasn't subscription TV anyways) Back then I even forgot on which nights but I think it's almost a week after it aired in Japan, "Toradora!" was aired right after "Code Geass" and that's how the ending theme song got me by the way, shout out to SunSet Swish. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And "Kuroshitsuji" aired not long afterwards right after, so yeah, that was quite a packed schedule considering by the time I've watched them all it was midnight and I still had school the next day. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, back then I didn't know much about *piracy* and watching online and stuff (the Internet was in a worse shape than today, trust me), but the idea of tuning in to Anime just like how I would for any TV drama was refreshing, even anticipating and exciting, to look forward too every week. And thus, unlike many who chose to binge them all once they are aired, I sank into the weekly schedule of watching Japanese animation.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>THE BLOG IN TRANSITION</div><div>As I was humbly blogging on the rise of the Internet back in 2008 (about my daily life in school, if you can believe), I never thought of ever writing about Anime. But as there wasn't an easy avenue to talk about Anime with others (I guess the classmates who introduced me to "BLEACH", but even then we were on different levels) especially with my very niche opinions about you know, liking theme songs to even liking the voices behind Anime characters (haha it had already started) which was hard to relate as many out there were more into the 2D world, and that's what everyone was trying to escape from. Too real to my own opinions and needing a channel to talk about this and my parents didn't fancy me talking to myself lol <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span>, I eventually transitioned to talk more about not my school life, and I think started with this new naming since 2012 after I graduated high school.</div><div><br></div><div>The blog has since then taken a slightly more formal tone(?) on everything in my life, which in this case, also for the Anime I watch every week. It started with short summaries of each week's episodes (yes, plural) but I still ended up regurgitating a lot of my opinions to myself, and over time i got comfortable to talk about them in detail more, and as my knowledge of them increased I also ended up talking about the faucets of what makes Anime what they are today. Learning programming only made this blog more fanciful and meaningful as I add more sections and add in images and GIFs over the years enough for me to want to look back at them from time to time.</div><div><br></div><div>The focus in the future of this weekly post which I have aptly named "Entertainment News" for the past decade, will be to then allow easier search, filter and identification of content that has been written all this time, with a redo on most of the paging of the "series" so far, and including sitemaps and image archives if possible just as how I've done so for my GitHub page.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>THE NOW YEARS</div><div>This will be shorter than above I promise, because despite the many platforms and ways to watch Anime today (I personally have an active Amazon Prime account which you would know, has access to Prime Video which streams Anime, and then there's English licensed sites so Funimation and Crunchyroll), I still ended up wanting to dictate my thoughts somewhere where I can still take screenshots and write comments down where it matters (and that's how you get so many more quotes apart from each section's opening), because I spend time to reflect an think about stuff as I watch as many will do but in this case I just write them down, it's probably better to do the way that it has been so far, and (don't cancel me but) watch fansubs or get raw sources in order to make this so-called hobby of mine sustainable in the long run. Yeah, it's like YouTube reaction videos, but in text, that's how I view my Anime viewing experience now.</div><div><br></div><div>In recent years too, I have also learnt enough Japanese to follow official sources (social media, official websites) to know more about the stuff behind Anime, behind-the-scenes stuff, special projects where the voice actors do stuff and honestly saying I like those a lot hehe, and if anything else, it was Anime that taught me Japanese. Well, not 100% I ended up listening to a lot of music and learnt stuff from the lyrics, but I would say this is the motivation to do so since great accompanying theme songs will make of great shows in the first place.</div><div><br></div></div></div><div><br></div><div>THE ANIME PROFILE</div><div>At this point, I feel like I should talk about what my tastes and/or biases are in Anime, just go settle things right here and now so I can save you some time understanding me later down the post.</div><div><br></div><div><b>I was initially very open to all sorts of genres walking into the world of Anime</b>, from the early days feeling the greatness of variety in comedic characters (WORKING!!!), blossoming romance in any situation (Hatsukoi Limited, cute girls in a band (K-ON!), exciting plot twists (at least, back then Kuroshitsuji was), mysteries for stuff that don't even relate (Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei), and much more. From adaptations to originals, I've had my share of seeing them in action, and this is what constituted my first 5 years from 2008-2012. </div><div><br></div><div>It was afterwards picking up on more popular series (Attack on Titan, Nagi no Asukara) that started to make me think otherwise about my tastes in Anime. <b>I did still watch certain genres from time to time though that offer niche genres</b> because damn is it Anime if it's the same damn thing as real life drama series, but obviously, as you can see from the calendar below, I am more towards realistic genres along the lines of comedy and romance.</div><div><br></div><div>Why though? Because my focus changed over time. From the days of just seeing anything I liked, today I will consider things like animation, whether I liked the trailer and/or theme songs in it, and the voice cast because if you haven't been finding the people behind your favourite Anime characters you aren't as in this as I am. So you know, <b>many of these factors will come into deciding whether I will like anything today.</b> I can give you examples for days, but if something hits like a movie trailer when I first saw one for an Anime series... then that will be it. I will talk about my reasons for giving any new show a chance in my season previews so I guess those will be a good gauge of my tastes over time.</div><div><br></div><div>So I can only say that my profile now and my opinions whatsoever is pretty much surrounding this meme image as adapted from an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/OVA target=_blank>OVA</a> episode of "Seitokai Yakuindomo":</div><div><br></div><div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=225 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFVtM_jow_JyhbCeQzJRqz342OFwfYhpaVX-uGInMB1PddWYgF6PRsdC3hrq-WZhXSgpAb1I_QEgG9G68ABU0IO5plaOE8ETRKK59_nk7IS9uDDkbzAjH2eoVHmVEHK86vJI8wp4hJOWh-eiHfKro13XAoO8Wp-ATp_LD0lyifKqWKWUSMVTmb0UyF9-w/w400-h225/14318499-a0f7005d-28e5-45b7-ba6f-a79b7d644519.jpg width=400></div></div><div><br></div><div>This also represented the thumbnail of this post in case you didn't notice since this looks like an interview from me too...

(Okay maybe not for the birth of the keys but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>) This original series, along with "money vs future" economics suspense thriller "C" are the only action series which helped define the human-like futuristic world I desire to see in fiction, and has since shaped what my novel project "A Pack of Life" is based on today.</div><div><br></div><div>And boy do I not want to talk about "Glasslip" again. Pretty much the only reason why I picked this one up was from the Anime's theme songs: ChouCho sang a great summer song, and nano.RIPE ended up being one of my beloved Rock music artists. Everything else is not to say at all, because despite the decent animation and great music, the original series failed to write a solid plot or sound logic on the mystery of... whatever is happening, which makes it even more disappointing when the truth is revealed, if you have realized if that happened.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=anime02>[2]</div><div class=datatable style=margin:auto;max-width:480px;width:100%><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><th rowspan=2 style=font-size:1.2em;text-align:right;white-space:normal;width:50%>BEST &amp; WORST ADAPTATIONS<td style=white-space:normal>👍 <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/33337/ACCA__13-ku_Kansatsu-ka target=_blank>ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka</a><tr><td style=white-space:normal>👎 <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/14921/RDG__Red_Data_Girl target=_blank>Red Data Girl</a></table></div><div>"ACCA" is a simple choice as I like to watch shows with deliberate mystery, as we are brought into the journey of main guy Jean to travel the country for auditing purposes, only to then realize (spoiler alert) there was an ongoing coup d'état and he is fundamentally involved in it. So cool, the story is so well presented including the plot twist, everything else including the worldview is just so perfect, I would love to recommend this adaptation. And it's not because Lotta-chan is cute. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>"Red Data Girl" was honestly so bad, I keep reminding myself what was good about it or what was the reason for me to watch the Anime. Was it because of Hayami Saori? I don't think so. I think I was expecting some action or cool stuff at some point, but unlike "Koukyuu no Karasu" which despite its ancient dynasty context still had some action at the end with the build-up on plot, this one just has none, and even what was the slice-of-life parts didn't deliver. Also, destroying electronics? You need to stay away from me forever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=anime03>[3]</div><div class=datatable style=margin:auto;max-width:480px;width:100%><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><th rowspan=2 style=font-size:1.2em;text-align:right;white-space:normal;width:50%>BEST &amp; WORST MOVIES<td style=white-space:normal>👍 <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/597/Neko_no_Ongaeshi target=_blank>Neko no Ongaeshi</a><tr><td style=white-space:normal>👎 <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/36098/Kimi_no_Suizou_wo_Tabetai target=_blank>Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai</a></table></div><div>This one was hard to choose, but if I have to mention a good one.... I still like "The Cat Returns" back when I was a student watching this Studio Ghibli classic in class (by the way) after the exams were over. It's the perfect fantasy adventure you would want to live as a kid similar to "Spirited Away" just without all the creepy stuff I guess, they have a certain magic. Outside of Ghibli though, "NakiNeko" can be that runner-up just being in relation to this masterpiece in terms of storytelling also serving as an ideal romance scenario in animation.</div><div><br></div><div>I legit thought "Kimisui" was supposed to be good and I totally enjoyed the story though with a sadder context, but it took a bad turn at the ending to a new level - a level so new, you wished it had ended with a standard crying bed scene because spoiler alert, she was stabbed by an aggressor. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> This is probably the reason why I will mention this in a negative light even if at all.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=anime04>[4]</div><div class=datatable style=margin:auto;max-width:480px;width:100%><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><th rowspan=3 style=font-size:1.2em;text-align:right;white-space:normal;width:50%>BEST SOUNDTRACK PIECES<td style=white-space:normal>👍 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfRo9G4rPHA" target=_blank>In the Garden of Sinners</a><br>(Kara no Kyoukai)<tr><td style=white-space:normal>👍 Tetsukazu no Kanjou<br>(Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun)<tr><td style=white-space:normal>👍 Yasashisa no Ashioto<br>(Toradora!)</table></div><div>I was an avid fan of listening to just music back then, so I appreciated more of Anime soundtracks especially in iconic scenes where it matters, or when the tunes appear more than often. I would say impact and me still caring about soundtrack back then is where I will be at, so it's no wonder the list here does not feature newer shows just because.</div><div><br></div><div>For selections though, I went for "Kara no Kyoukai" and despite it being a dark movie (will explain later) it does have a strong, depressing view with a soundtrack written by Kajiura Yuki (which you might know better from the "Fate" series, this movie series is effectively its spin-off) and chorus sung by now disbanded Kalafina? Man, this was that perfection to an intro of a movie. This is the music that filters its audience. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> This was also what led me into the series and Kalafina, all music produced by Kajiura-sensei herself.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the other two, they symbolize what I distinctively remember for the Anime I watch, whether it's the theme music or just something sad and quaint after a hectic day, these have never disappointed me. Shout out to Hashimoto Yukari (for "Toradora!") and Kousaki Satoru (for "WORKING!!!", "OreImo" or anything Aniplex) specifically for making great soundtracks whichever direction I go and meet them in.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, there are other so many good ones out there that make the show they were in recent years, so I'm just listing these off my head to give you an idea what I liked back then that were so, so impactful.</div><div><br></div><div class=omake><div><a href=https://jisho.org/search/gougai target=_blank>EXTRA!!</a></div><div><br></div><div>I would like to also give a shout out to a playlist(?) which I distinctively remembered I have burnt into a CD (back then) which is a great summary of the first 5 years of me listening to Anime soundtracks before I fell off, as seen below:</div><div>[All links to VGMDB]</div><div><ol style=text-align:left><li>High Heel Shoes In Pink (pf ver') (From "C" Original Soundtrack)<li>avenue (From "A Channel" Original Soundtrack)<li>MANHATTAN ~Utsukushisa~ (From "Bartender" Original Soundtrack)<li>going home (From "BLEACH" Original Soundtrack 1)<li>Suite "Going Home" 2nd Movement: Piano Solo (From "BLEACH: Fade to Black" Original Soundtrack)<li>feel your heart (From "Hatsukoi Limited" Original Soundtrack)<li>Narade Arukou (From "Hatsukoi Limited" Original Soundtrack)<li>pure heart (From "Hatsukoi Limited" Original Soundtrack)<li>Kimi ga Tw wo Sashinobete Kureta Toki<span style=white-space:pre></span>"Kekkaishi" Original Soundtrack<li>Ii Yumemite ne<span style=white-space:pre></span>"K-ON!"

For this, there can be so many produced by the animation (collaborated) music labels because they can have more control on the genre and style of what is, and thus song like those from Anime "K-ON!", "Chio-chan", or even "JoshiMuda" will be a hit. But we don't want to only about those intentional perfections (or flops), we want to talk about what's great and bad about making mainstream artists who are affiliated to these music labels, that come up with memorable songs to shows we remember.</div><div><br></div><div>The best ones, I can remember, are those that define the series thanks to the artists themselves, by mistake or by spending time to make their craft go into the world of Anime. Ironically, it's also those long-run series who will have such rep, from ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION to Ikimonogakari back then to today's Anime artists dominating the Anison world... they are what makes of the best, but I still think of the oldies as when they brought me in. And the worst ones we don't talk about, and pray to the gods there are the ending theme songs to carry the impression for the show.

"Kaibutsu-kun" takes credit in just life-changing one's circumstances, teaching the studious girl that one's soulmate can appear anywhere around them at any time even if he's weird or just plain handsome (lmao), and I think "KimiSomu" is probably the best in progression in recent memory. I mean, there's "Tada-kun" which was pretty impressive for an Anime original, and "Shikimori-san" for a twist in circumstances each with its own story to tell, and I think this is why I can never get tired of them yet.</div><div><br></div><div>I would also argue that most of the (not Studio Ghibli) Anime movies I watch are even more worthy of praise for this genre along haha why do I watch only those movies though? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=datatable style=margin:auto;max-width:480px;width:100%><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><th rowspan=3 style=font-size:1.2em;text-align:right;white-space:normal;width:50%>MYSTERY<td>1️⃣ <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/28621/Subete_ga_F_ni_Naru target=_blank>Subete ga F ni Naru</a><tr><td>2️⃣ <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji target=_blank>Kuroshitsuji</a><tr><td>3️⃣ <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/10798/Un-Go target=_blank>UN-GO</a></table></div><div>Now we come to the minority stuff I watch in genre, because honestly speaking? Mystery series are hard to stand on its own and still be good, or else every action series or even "ACCA" will make of a good mystery. Still, I think that having plot twists and stuff is vital for such a genre even if I would expect a more proper resolution even if you don't lead me on anything because I'm not that smart and you can make me confused until halfway through the series, I'm totally fine with that.</div><div><br></div><div>I did not get the mystery on "F in Naru" but damn is it intriguing thinking about how that can work back then (spoiler alert there was enough years for the same woman locked in the room to be replaced), and "UN-GO" I would argue is kind of cheating with this genre and that's why I prefer not to talk about this along with the fantasy genre (which we will cover later) since one will never understand enough to be a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/meitantei target=_blank>great detective</a> at any point and the solution can just be magic for all I know which is cringe in my opinion. Point is, the more true to life for the plot the better, which makes London history-based series "Kuroshitsuji" earn a spot even if there are many more I can mention, and despite having a demon on our hands. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>There are other interesting plots for mystery like "TanMoshi" with the recollection dump and "GREAT PRETENDER" if you like to be in crime yet know of nothing every single moment.</div><div><br></div><div>I think I'm just too dumb to understand mystery series lmao</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=datatable style=margin:auto;max-width:480px;width:100%><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><th rowspan=3 style=font-size:1.2em;text-align:right;white-space:normal;width:50%>FANTASY<td>1️⃣ <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40571/Majo_no_Tabitabi target=_blank>Majo no Tabitabi</a><tr><td>2️⃣ <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/35557/Houseki_no_Kuni target=_blank>Houseki no Kuni</a><tr><td>3️⃣ <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asu_kara target=_blank>Nagi no Asu Kara</a></table></div><div>For this? I have to say, I don't have much requirements, and it's really due to unique circumstances. The more unique the better, and hopefully not on generic fantasy stuff like magic and magic though I would argue "MajoTabi" taking up this spot is precisely because it is done so well with an interesting worldview and immersive storytelling though I was told that the original work was more depressing, like Elaina would eventually be so poor she has to work on the streets. So yeah, please more sequels hehe, and apart from this exception, I will take <b>no <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>alternative world</a> plots where someone suddenly appears in another world for some reason</b> (though "BLEACH" is technically one so welp), and I chose "Houseki no Kuni" because damn is the idea of the moon people such a intriguing thing the stellar cast pales in contrast to the story (or not hehe emo Mikakoshi is <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span>), and I think many people agree with "NagiAsu" on their storytelling and worldview of sea people which I appreciate.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In summary, I would like to think that, many of <b>the international audience will think very otherwise form my thoughts</b>, that maybe, just maybe, I'm more aligned with the Japanese audience but haha that's also unlikely since I browse through Japanese forums too and I see polarizing opinions, but yeah, I like to have different opinions, things like soft appeal and impactful minor scenes; I like that I always will have a niche opinion wherever I go but no one to talk to. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>MOVING ON!!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=omake><div><a href=https://jisho.org/search/omake target=_blank>OMAKE!!</a></div><div><br></div><div>THE ANIME GOODS</div><div>Though I told myself these aren't real and it's better to support 3D girls then spend money on 2D girls lol that was long ago, but in years going forward and to not fill up my room, I would wish to buy some Anime goods in remembrance of those shows I have watched and liked. That is the ideal, something that every show has sold in common... the only thing I knew about are badges, so maybe I will start from that soon enough of whenever I want to drag myself to Japan to buy them since it's hard to buy them for the vast 15 years of shows online. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br>So far though? You may have known some of them here and there, and it's mostly for "BLEACH" so far. From <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjco4GIs7dB8lmeMT5x_fnte44WOcjBK37XigJTGfWXhjXgh7JnompwQHpRotlOAI6wazFMcEbStqIWU0J0A5sm3_S6ZlKJYrZM62cDnYW7MKgNZUwBKbVQk55guKK_UA7wn3pC77xWMUnU/s320/704651_10151299184962460_2132619891_o.jpg target=_blank>a large calendar</a> to <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvMiEkoUYYC-Ve9sCgmgADTUgerGZOxBdt-ZvhQMbqT-W2gZXjYSadAgfUBrVSXwTbbE8jWBxw1oOGDOLyHk99U0sjO9vJ1CKQXwm6Hsn7cQBm8MVvsPm3omMKvOFOdstdmxIGiANaSG_EEHProseQgKah0WHm2EhsPn8YcIOWVEm8jNFFua6hzJHW/s320/PXL_20230509_130253714.jpg target=_blank>karuta cards</a>, these are still exceptions to the rule for being the most impactful series I have watched thus far, so they deserve some form of repayment. But I might be extending soon, as said above I am trying to find a common item to buy that does not take up space (it is the digital age after all), so we shall see how that goes moving forward.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This shall be it! May I watch many more years of Anime and love the dynamic of real people voicing behind more ideal characters (lol) and NEVER like the movie industry or Netflix or whatever but we shall see, I'm only starting even though it has been 15 years already. I mean, I can go on forever talking about the stuff I like about all the Anime I watch but why would I? Maybe it's time for you to experience it for yourself. <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Oh by the way, my Q&amp;A did not include ranking or even rating of Anime characters because not only is it unimportant to me (though when I started I thought <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/12305/Minori_Kushieda target=_blank>Kushieda Minori</a> and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/1038/Naru_Narusegawa target=_blank>Narusegawa Naru</a> were my love hehe but turns out I just like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/28/Yui_Horie target=_blank>Hocchan</a> more <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>), I also judge shows now based on the voices behind them. But yeah, I do like Anime characters within their shows, so you can't exactly ask me to rank them- <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/210/Kisuke_Urahara target=_blank>Urahara Kisuke</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. ROLEPLAY TIME!! Haha because of my love for the voices behind Japanese animation, here is some (just some) of the role(s) I can imagine they would be involved in my life:</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>A father who sounded like Hayami Show (or Miki Shinichirou)<li><strike>A mother who sounded like</strike> [I have no idea haha, never had that desire]<li>An elder sister who sounded like Toyosaki Aki<li>A younger sister who <strike>sounded like</strike> is Natsukawa Shiina (hehe)<li>A long time friend who sounded like Asakura Momo<li>A (jealous) girlfriend <strike>who sounded like</strike> Koga Aoi (hehehehe)<li>A high school classmate who sounded like Amamiya Sora whom I never had the courage to confess to because she's perfect<li>A woman whom which I might share a physically intimate relationship with <strike>who sounded like</strike> Kouno Marika (umph)<li>A childhood friend who sounded like Nagae Rika (or Kanno Mai)</ul><div>... Not going to describe more because you can catch up on The Fanfiction series in this very blog to find out if most of them were true. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I'm done!</div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEverydayLife">The Everyday Life</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
