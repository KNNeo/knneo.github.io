Uh, of course it feels awkward to have to talk to Shino after what has happened so far if you would recall this friend found out about whatever Naoya did to more than one girl lol that's the whole point of this series anyways, but turns out their reason this time is just to help Nagisa study because damn, do I not need to remind you about how much effort Nagisa needs to do... anything in life, honestly. It's like a bimbo but the voice actress is married. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Alright we can't keep making fourth wall jokes here haha, but yeah, all this makes so much less of any reason to be able to ask Shino for such a favour. Like, who would help her friend to enjoy her boyfriend's two-timing summer holidays? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I know I won't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But as a reward since Shino can state anything and they really mean <em>anything</em>, instead of just ensuring that Naoya is dating one girl which might as well just be herself- She instead chose to stay at their place since she also just found out about that too haha she is missing out on so much I can't even. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah, good time for someone to play catch-up until you realize someone else has been doing so all this time. Yes, she is called Milika haha hey sorry for putting you aside for half an episode when these guys are flirting, but of course she will not let that happen considering she hasn't even taken a step into Naoya's current living quarters when there are two, no, three girls who did it already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Since they blocked her path to his place, she will block their path, by... blocking the entrace to Naoya's place? Uh, I mean, don't we have a back door or something to the backyard? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, why are we watching her pee in public? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not like we will let her do her thing, and not like we are going to let her dad witness this spectacle and it really makes me think why not that first, but instead Naoya introduced to us the new character, Milika's sister Risa! I mean, I didn't expect this to be so soon I really thought this will be a 4P thing and maybe they will join back afterwards but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, why do 4P when you can do 6P- Really, why would Milika think that selling your sister out to your love will make him want you? I mean, I would've just dated your sister, that's a possibility. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, lack of reason upon logic is this series' strength, so is the strength of Milika-san being able to carry Naoya into a trolley and push him out of school unconscious because she drugged him (high school, by the way) just to bring him to her place to showcase her sister? Maybe calling the cops was the right choice. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... I think Shino-san is basically Plankton from the SpongeBob series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She's the necessary evil, but she will not able to do anything anyways for the status quo, even if it's stealing something from them. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> But unlike the next episode where we are going to see Shino-san naked again... Wait, isn't Plankton <em>always</em> naked? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> SHE IS BASICALLY FLAT LIKE A PLANKTON TOO- I think I will just laugh until the year ends if you don't mind. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, just great for this to be back, I don't think this will break grounds like the romance series I've watched just this year alone, but boy will I be here for all the jokes. Also imouto because why not. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah I just need a reminder to NOT listening to ClariS singing the ending theme song? Hey prove me wrong but did the song glitch a bit in the first verse? Yeah, sh*t can't even produce a decent song with just 2P LMAO ok we are done</div><div>[TL:DR; "It might be a chance to get Saki-chan's friend to approve of my two-timing!"

Like that, but we are not pretending to be criminals. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Uh, that isn't the focus of the series though I promise you even though that is part of the lore, but in this first episode I didn't expect to pick up just because (#UnderNinja01), let's talk about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ninja target=_blank>ninja</a>. How much do you know about ninja? Do you know as much as that foreigner who just went into a government building to ask to meet an assassin? Do you know as much as I do which is basically nothing but some knowledge from hating the "Naruto" series? Haha *ahem* Or do you know as much as Kuro-san here and his clan, who serve to observe society as it moves to take action in utmost secrecy when the time comes? If you are interested in the latter, then boy do I have an idea for you. I would say though, that this still started off very, and I mean <em>very </em>light-hearted and dumping a lot of jargon to what looked like some high school gang fight upon the rooftops (lol) and this isn't by any means some masterful knowledge showdown or anything. Not like ninja need 200 IQ to be good at their skills, the main guy didn't even go to high school until this very job. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, with the guise of strategic planning and not being trained by anyone and having a name for taking down some foreigner terrorist and I promise you I am not being racist at all because I didn't write this story lol, we still did not have much idea about who Kuro is as a person. We were directed to pretend to enlist into the school, we know he belongs into a clan of ninja, and that's pretty much it. I assume that foreigner will be here to expose of what ninja are in this society, but for now... it's hard to even point even though they are everywhere. Also, we are dumped with flashbacks. Maybe that's the issue here. No, our issue is "where are the damn ninja" haha what else is new. All in all... I thought I would be able to see some ninja action before I can give a more solid decision on whether to continue with this. But for now... Hmm, I don't know. 7 out of 10, I guess? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I am rather keen on what this fight here means especially having to deal with the government and whatever was in the war of all things, but the stage hasn't been set much, so I don't know what to deal with this. Maybe I give this a little more watch, I kind of like the jokes in this somehow lol I thought we were supposed to be secretive? Well, we shall see if I can even figure something out in 3 episodes, just like ninja should be able to in 3 steps? I don't know, I can't share with you enough ninja info otherwise I wouldn't be aliv</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeK5G6kFA2BgzjtGQ8vDJX74PxuncJ4POCqw07E-mOVVZsamfJhVXCAJWH6FmFr81rH0Upc8_Srs8ln7Yf-2sKhC3Zubc4ISnJkbnULtzz7-gIsBraRv7ZgPdFdd02Y6w-tF1jrwYOrFBWYZI_WJdy4LAfWmrkEVpZG6SOOioJbzVeK2thhzt0fEUUJGw/s320/underninja01_foreigner.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What we think ninja look like today<br>(lol cosplay)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6IoqzwgeXS8VVCsgx2KIgw5n-Lq7uQ_JFjasdgxghFvpjigGgexoShk7zdc02xM668jJU-5BTg42UMyzxlob1zGoUQW-BJ7B5kGSOGmAbMZjmBj7nuElLS-6AMBt8xAH_AW10-cNt6ncBEicDhdAqZalBdG_SQ7eISaIGhqsUtU2Sn9wDEXCN6Iqqv3Q/s320/underninja01_hibi2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What ninja actually look like today<br>(ew)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Don't doxx me, thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this romance series I don't know if I have enough experience in my 15 years of watching romance Anime to be able to watch this lol (#KimiZero01), I know enough to know what's great about this series, what is actually bad about it, and most likely why I wouldn't give this the get-go. Let's talk about why. For starters, the animation. I don't know, but damn was I not able to stand all the cleavages- Please, that's the least of our problems. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But damn, was I not happy with the animation so far because you know, if you want to sell on some girl that the guy likes in the first place, you gotta make her look good. And I don't mean that this <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gyaru target=_blank>gyaru</a> doesn't look good in any way, people can have opinions and like such type of fashionistas, and not like I don't lol if you would remember Anime "KiseKoi", but the way she moves and talks, it's just not that appealing enough even with all the sparkles to make sure she is. Next up, I think I am reminded of this, and I don't get why so many romance series are still stuck with that logic, is the monologues. Remember the last time you watched a romance series without heavy monologues of idolism and self-reflection? <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/50796/Kimi_wa_Houkago_Insomnia target=_blank>Me neither.</a> <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And that's what I think is the core issue here, as I've been watching a lot of those these past couple of seasons, I need a change of pace and not have things like this be the focus of the storytelling already. Maybe because it's adapted from a light novel, but who is it to say the scriptwriting isn't ideal. Last but not least, I think I have a bias. I have a bias towards who was casted the main girl here. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yes, you should know by now because I talked about this last time too in the preview, when it was voiced in the light novel promotional video by Asakura Momo here really sounded great even with just a trailer, but damn did they change her out. I can't say by how much worse because I am a fan of Oonishi Saori also, but you should've seen how much I liked the last time she did a role along those lines, and how <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/45613/Kawaii_dake_ja_Nai_Shikimori-san target=_blank>"Shikimori-san"</a> made my impression of her in romance shows much more appealing than whatever this was. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like, compared to this, in that one at least the guy was cooler and they had a backstory to talk about together and stuff, right? What is this free-to-play mobile game riddled with ads bullsh*t right here. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know, maybe I did not have enough experience (get it?) in watching romance Anime after all I did not even give <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/50425/Fuufu_Ijou_Koibito_Miman target=_blank>the one she did with TakaMina</a> anyways and that one had a better plot that this had though! Story wise I still have to give it credit by the way, because the idea of just being forced to confess to someone you like and NOT getting rejected and IMMEDIATELY inviting you to her place sounds like a dream like Ryuuto here would have said many times, and boy is he just basically the male audience if this is what is serving the demographic these days, still required him to calm down his Johnny (lol) in order to be able to walk out of her place still a total virgin. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all though, I know that Oonishi would've made of a better girlfriend, but just being with Mocho was going to be fuel for watching this, I promise you. I think we going for clean energy now lmao but seriously though, after saying this much and I have convinced your virgin b*tt to like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/13639/Maaya_Uchida target=_blank>onee-san</a> who sang the opening theme song haha we know who she is there's only the one in the Anime industry and don't tell me you don't know, I hope this has made you happy so far.

Starting off, <b><a href=https://music.apple.com/jp/album/1557155200 target=_blank>w.o.d.'s album from 2021</a></b> was alright I started with this because the one song in their band summary video(?) got me intrigued, ended up giving more songs than I expected so that's good news going forward. I also listened to <b><a href=https://music.apple.com/jp/album/1707122629 target=_blank>Enfamilia's album</a></b> which released last week (and also took me a while to know <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1709375217498558609?s=20" target=_blank>what this band is about</a>) and boy am I just glad they did not conflict with the stuff I listened to last week because damn, <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1709375875706486822?s=20" target=_blank>did the punk rock hit real hard</a> for some reason. Coupled by collaboration artists to sing for them including Tsuji Shion and HALCA-san from HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR to name a few? I didn't give the song from the latter though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But I did give two other songs which damn hype, I wonder when's the last time I gave so much punk rock to be honest. SWANKY DANK? Yeah, probably. *head bops*<br><br> Alright, this week's news on music is a lot, so I hope you are prepared. Yes, more than last week I think. <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1709010380414976261?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new album will release in December</a></b> and boy this is their first in this two-piece band formation so let's see if it's as boring as their album cover art. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (GOTTEM) <b><a href="https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1709177111519646200?s=20" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's new album is also announced for December</a></b> so damn I really wonder how I am going to end this year in Klassic Note already lol. <b><a href="https://x.com/scandal_band/status/1709223392640204890?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL's new music video</a></b> is for their new song and single so I shall elaborate no further since it still didn't hit me since the first time I listened to it weeks ago. <b><a href="https://x.com/midori_2434/status/1709194822056345999?s=20" target=_blank>Ryushen's new music video in collaboration with Polkadot Stingray</a></b> which of course I know of the latter artist, is nonetheless interesting despite it not being like, ground-breaking but you know, maybe I'll like it if it isn't electronic heavy. I guess collaboration season after all because <b><a href="https://x.com/honkidance/status/1709493611526869405?s=20" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance's new song with Kenmochi Hidefumi</a></b> will be out in two weeks and I wonder what that will be like. <b><a href="https://x.com/sambomaster_txt/status/1709841542238867822?s=20" target=_blank>Sambomaster's new music video will premiere on YouTube next week</a></b> so in case you missed out maybe start remembering that their album is next month and we are leading up to it now for more Rock n' Roll. I tried my hand at <b><a href="https://x.com/VP_official/status/1709855960645435758?s=20" target=_blank>VELTPUNCH's intro quiz</a></b> which I only got on the beginner's version since most of them are familiar songs even if I didn't know the songs themselves, but damn if you know the intermediate version then you are more of a fan of them than I do. Haha I didn't listen to all of their songs so I won't know. <b><a href="https://x.com/lounge666/status/1709902505004642591?s=20" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE somehow did a stealth live video reveal</a></b> an hour before <a href="https://x.com/lounge666/status/1710285916793651444?s=20" target=_blank>they appeared in THE FIRST TAKE for the first time</a> and boy did none of them hit me because I missed the former and the song in the latter wasn't one I gave from their new album. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on I wish for the other song for the latter to be something I know, <b><a href="https://x.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1709946544756007321?s=20" target=_blank>Aimer's live from 2022 is now available for music streaming</a></b> so I will listen to that next week when I have the time I guess, also also <b><a href="https://x.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1710265823456305627?s=20" target=_blank>her new song is for a drama</a></b> which I assume will appear on her upcoming single releasing in December. <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1710643874274906302?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's song for Anime "Naruto" is still the most popular song for overseas listeners</a></b> which shows how backdated some of us are just in general lol that's why I chose to listen to the newest stuff, honestly. <b><a href="https://x.com/codamappimusic/status/1710612400926503219?s=20" target=_blank>Kodama Hikari's major debut music video</a></b> is actually real cool and I swear I've seen her before but damn, this might make me like her... debut single releasing end November. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Last but not least, we got a <b><a href="https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1710973311998669294?s=20" target=_blank>preview for Natsukawa Shiina's new song</a></b>, and I think I know this was from her late night radio show since they promised that, isn't too bad a listen, so I know I will enjoy the album when it's out in a month's time. Busy months to end the week, huh, I gotta prepare by buying a new smartphone then. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span><br><br> So next week, I shall give listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/magie-magie-ep/1706816344?l=en-US" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's new single</a></b> for Anime so I really hope the B-side holds up I have not heard of anything yet though let me be surprised since I am already with the title song hehe, and because I watched a live video this weekend I might just give chance to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/geniestar/1576698486?l=en-US" target=_blank>Genie High's album from 2021</a></b> to see if I can give the one song I heard in that video. I know right, 2023 is so overrated, I'm in 2021 era now! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><br><br><br><br><br> And we're done for the week. And just as I thought we are done, <a href="https://x.com/tenshisama_PR/status/1710950594167644578?s=20" target=_blank>in the Anime "Tenshi-sama" event they just announced a new season</a> which I don't know if I should be happy or not because on the downside I just watched two romance series which are likely better in plot than this, but on the upside I am still keen upon realizing that this will then cover <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20230718/11/natsukawashiinablog/53/70/j/o0337060015313796471.jpg target=_blank>Shiina</a> (haha) Mahiru-chan's return on the guy's feelings without any secrets, full force. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Alright, this one is probably worth looking forward to. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you guys next week, if you are done with these maybe help yourself to the week of posts if you haven't (especially that photobook hehe), and I shall see you next week haha of course I will see you next week we are ending this week real soon<br></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
