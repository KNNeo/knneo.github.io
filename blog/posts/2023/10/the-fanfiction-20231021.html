<div>Well, that was a great Saturday afternoon nap. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> The cold wind was of great help, thanks for asking haha</div><div><br></div><div>We are back for another series of me thinking that I can get laid with other women in real life! Yes, this is fictional me trying to blend in and maaaaaaybe think of ways to incorporate all of them into my ideal life. Please, we can't be that lame and STILL be single at 30! We gotta have a girlfriend by now, maybe think of marriage.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span><br><br></div><div>Man, even this intro is fiction lmao what is less real than this though!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright let's write a flashback to explain our story last week!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Kitou Akari wearing a long-sleeved knitted top, smiling and surrounded by decorative mini-LED lights" border=0 data-original-height=358 data-original-width=512 height=140 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl262170.jpg title="Kitou Akari" width=200></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>This happened at a friend's place years ago. Kitou Akari and I were invited by our college friends for a party at the end of the year. We sang songs, everyone was down on fried chicken and beer, and my friend passed out before they could send both of us home.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I was too nervous to even do anything. I casually commented that they should stop drinking, but Akari who sat in front of me was just staring at my direction. She was all eyes on me because my drunk friend blurted out I have been eyeing on her for a while ever since the study session at a fast food restaurant, but I have not been taking action since. I explained that if not to concentrate on the exams as a first year student, I would love to spend more time with her.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=君の言うことちゃんと守んるんだよ>"You have to keep the promise you said here"</abbr>, she said softly in the quiet, dimly-lit room. My heart melted along with my anxiety, I ended up chugging a can of beer. She laughed out loud in response.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>We started dating not long after the exams were over.</em></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Well, if my story isn't much of a hint enough, and thus I conclude the description of my relationship between Akarin and fictional me... she was my ex. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yup, I don't think I will ever mention how we broke up lmao we really shouldn't, but who knows? Maybe that current girlfriend was part of the problem. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, I feel like this is quite a journey *kinda* similar to my own experience in college where some girl told me to study with her for the semester's course and... that's it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this story though, I brought in some friends or maybe just course mates to look like I have friends (lol), and slip her into the story previously where we hung out to study, in case you wondered how that worked. So yeah, Akarin would have been a great girl to date I would think, so this is my imagination of what would have been. You think she will take some action if she found out that some dude likes her? Only if he's <em>super</em> attractive, right? RIGHT?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Teaser for next week since, in case you didn't notice, next week's post will align with Toyosaki Aki's birthday... You can figure out yourself from here haha see you then</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
