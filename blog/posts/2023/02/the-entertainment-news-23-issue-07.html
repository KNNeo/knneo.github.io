Which is why no wonder you may think it's not a lot this time around but hey, slow start for the year, yes? I gotta beta test paying my item-level taxes first lol <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span><div><br></div><div>Anyways, hope things will turn around after this week going forward, I didn't realize I've already paid for Fiona's birthday <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gacha target=_blank>gacha</a> in DOAXVV before (she was 2nd, 1st was Tamaki hehe) so welp no free set of episodes and ring for another member on the list then again. Why do we need to though you are welcome for the lipstick Fiona lol</div><div><br></div><div>Alright Kyokou Suiri is FINALLY downloaded (lol don't narc) so let's start the Anime! We got a lot to talk about music too<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KyokouSuiri17><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kyokou Suiri</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"(Kotoko) and Rikka-san did actually get along at one point, don't you?" WHAT lol</div></blockquote>It's not GPS or satellite communication system, dude. Even if the spirits saw anything Kotoko-chan can't know immediately. Which is the problem. Rikka-san you b*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I swear Rikka-san is constantly up to no good just by her face alone lol (#KyokouSuiri17), I guess we shall find out what happened to her recently. According to the spies Kotoko-chan has questioned lol, we know that two months ago I guess with respect to present time, Rikka-san is living in an apartment which we are quickly introduced to the manager and his girlfriend which has a respectable rack the last time I saw one is from the Steel Lady haha quick flashback to season one, living in a... spooky apartment that is available because of cheap rent. But contrary to the history of tenants which are <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> suicide victims, at least we know she won't commit suicide. I mean, she can't. Did you see how she tried to get herself rammed by a truck and survived? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah dude someone else <em>might </em>commit suicide because of you, Rikka-san. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, in the very apartment she is in? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, that counts as 4th time, right? RIP Kuro-san you will be missed haha then again you can't die too. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Technically we can stack that suicide number up just in the one apartment but cleaning up is a mess so maybe not. We also found out a little more about Rikka-san ever since her sort of satellite appearance in the first season of the Anime, now talking about how she has been with Kotoko and hated her (lol what is new), and gives others the impression that Kotoko might be the new Satan of everyone's lives. Not just hers, but seriously, this is just private matter so manager don't think too much into it your intuition of jealousy is spot-on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The manager couple was showed all the reasons Rikka-san could be the next suicide victim but to no avail, they knew she wasn't in financial trouble or else how can you even bet 20k yen in horses lol that's basically part-time salary in Japan, and just as Kotoko said since Rikka has the same mermaid body as Kuro-san, she naturally wards all spirits away as contrary to what people believe about the haunted abode. Nonetheless, she was right about Kotoko and Kuro-senpai appearing soon after to give the manager an explanation good enough he can rent the lot out again, but of course, like we would spend more time investigating into someone who died after the girlfriend died before him in the same place. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Who cares dude just get over it and move out or get another girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right easier said than done. Anyways, simple episode to wrap up our recent sighting of Rikka-san, and may the next time we see her get involved in more of these 200 IQ plays, I guess. Not sure who learnt this level of reasoning skill from who, but somehow, I feel like either of them are involved, if not both. We shall see what happens ahead, Rikka-san has barely made any action so far.</div><div>[TL:DR; "I wonder if Sakuragawa-san (Rikka) was just jealous because (Kotoko) took her cousin away from her" That's it dude, the manager of the apartment nailed it haha]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPNS8BwScJum9KY7vNW0ZYJc_E1KBWPO-GN2YjLE_CxMsk4OYSj7iHAiHpVtPVmXWBHHDcpKN54-HzVdT6kV5Tyuzow8vvjX19x8b7WpxjkunYtuO-MJ61-CivjeJL6UsWd3G7hkOSqPLfYhdES9iUrCo-X5CgSGFYQxslsDrKNRD26-zztlnEo9vD/s320/kyokousuiri16_marumi1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Oh damn can you be my girlfriend??

Like, an AirTag? You think he knows? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where it's wrong to stalk on people unless they are cute and shy (#KuboSan05), I guess we can talk about more of Shiraishi's weird life in school. Hey, it's not weird my experience in middle school is pretty much like this, co-starring a Sudoku book and a pen if I'm not wrong. Please, an erasable pen, you know how popular those are in 2007? Haha okay history lesson over, Shiraishi loves to find places to eat alone and looks like the school is big enough to find one, but always, he will get noticed by Kubo-san. I mean, not hard, right? Just following him out of class? Yeah, it's easy when you are a Kubo lol. They got to eat each other... bento omelettes haha chill, I already saw Kubo-san eating it from the fork a mile away I can't even, and there's NO WAY she can make something edible. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, maybe she did make it and it's good. Good enough. I know of a someone who specializes only in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/14776/Tsugumi_Aoba target=_blank>eggs and vegetables</a> and that's all her childhood friend gets to eat so what else is new. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (That's a "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/3958/Kannagi target=_blank>Kannagi</a>" reference) Kubo-san did eat his wiener out though so MOVING ON!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And up next and I swear this is the best part besides the White Day stuff, it's the girls' talk, dude. (At shout out to Denny's, my American YouTuber knowledge is only used at times like these lol) What else can we talk about besides knowing that Kubo Nagisa doesn't know about love and has to let her friends tell in on her if she has, even secretly, been over possessive of her newfound boyfriend. Please, "boy friend", gotta include the whitespace. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Tama-chan is just raging over this reality of her friend not liking an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> lmao I guess Shiraishi isn't one, but as Hazuki mentioned we shouldn't spoil things for them so just watch this blossom would be ideal. But yeah, we need more reality checks like the whole of "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san target=_blank>Takagi-san</a>" series so make this quick or something. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up is music lesson for the couple and I swear all I am thinking about is the <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/not-as-dramatic-as/1660530654?i=1660530655&amp;l=en" target=_blank>opening theme song</a> but I guess we are not doing that which honestly it's a damn shame, so it's probably an old song from Kubo-san haha boomer vibes from her already (Edit: Trust me, I can't prove this at all don't know if this will be on the soundtrack, who knows), but it's still better than whatever Shiraishi is talking about some Anime song when the hero starts fighting like it's "BLEACH" and its infamous theme with Ichigo. F**king NERD!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, talking about me too. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, Shiraishi doing the White Day thing. Problem is, he doesn't know who gave him chocolates on Love Day. Haha, that's awkward now, huh. But hey, we don't have very far to look at since Kubo-san dropped all the hints and somehow, SOMEHOW haha, Shiraishi thinks the neighbour in class ONLY knows who did it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Haha yeah did you see Kubo-san's face change when he said he was giving it to someone else? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't know, maybe it's for her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I sense some <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en" target=_blank>j-j-j-jealousy</a> coming haha this doesn't get old dude (didn't know why I didn't mention it in "Kyokou Suiri" lol), but yeah those aren't necessary since we DO know who gave him chocolates on Valentine's Day. Uh, look back previous episode for answers, thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, damn the hints are dropping but so are my hopes for this series lol but really we are still good I'll stay positive like her friends are and we will be fine. Shiraishi can't go away he can't be snatched by someone else because they don't notice him. No problem, market dominance here. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or so Kubo-san thinks but damn, this is as wholesome as it can get, and we can always get more.</div><div>[TL:DR; "Let's keep an eye on her on things until she figures it out" Yeah, just keep the rice cooking, will ya?

Yeah, those were great times. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, I miss <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/132966/Lucy_Maud_Montgomery target=_blank>Kana-chan</a>, what of it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode though we are going elsewhere with this flashback series lol (#BungouStrayDogs43), we talk about the Angels of Death. Yup. You want to talk about internal corruption? You got it, dude! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, it's about time, innit? Like, we have been going for three seasons of Anime NOT talking about how Sakaguchi can still be in contact with like, Atsushi and the others without being found out or eliminated because he takes care of or monitor the Ability users in the nation? Hey, I would like to say that this is the only legit job in the government because everyone else is just wanting the Agency's downfall. Really, the idea of Nikolai threatening government officers who are then wanting the end of Detective Agency is kind of ironic, even Atsushi knew something was wrong just by smelling a liar who hasn't drunk coffee. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, I guess the main point is then, what's the purpose of destroying the Detective Agency? Remember Natsume Souseki had to create this triage to protect Yokohama and even Japan from harm? Okay never mind, let's get to the non-spicy part first. Also, a 101 guide on how to stop the Detective Agency! Okay let's go. Firstly, stop the Ability user who can disable Abilities. Haha that should be obvious who we are talking about, so I assume one of the five Angels of Death back then known as "V" which is a name Ranpo-san is more familiar with, is with Dazai on the horse races for some reason. Well, that's settled for now I guess, don't have to kill him or nothing. Second, find all the crimes the members of the Detective Agency have made. Or even better, put them in a crime scene. But first, let's bring us to Nikolai's power. Just beating Atsushi's level of understanding seeing him walk into the threat first of the government officers and trying to save them though they are also corrupt lmao, we know that Nikolai has the Ability of creating portals in all directions within a range. And I mean "all" directions very specifically because did you see how he got Atsushi's leg stuck IN the ground? Which ironically looks like a video game glitch so that's kinda screwed up if you think about it. Also how the locations of the Agency members can be switched this fast. But that I don't think is from him. Because according to the Chief who is still clean, he explains to Ranpo about the members of the five Angels. We know of two of them already no surprises there, one should be with Dazai because he's such a game changer, and we also know one of them can manipulate the mind for information? Access one's memories? Think of it as futuristic, I guess, can't comprehend which real life author that can be from. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Because it might be this last dude that is very different, being able to switch I don't think bodies, but locations of bodies, so that let's say Kunikida squatting on the door can be switched with one of the enforcers in the room, but likely with the same uh, bodily content? DNA? Yeah, I guess. Oh no wait, isn't one of them able to change narrative? Just write them as the enforcers? Yeah. That sounds kinda f**ked up though! I guess I don't understand it all, and that Tonan dude who already doesn't believe in the Agency has all the power to *ahem* call the cops on the Agency so I guess why not, right? <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> All in all... I mean, you guys get what happened just this episode alone? I'm very confused. Now that Nikolai is dead (lol) can someone explain to me what happened? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay jokes aside, we know not to trust the jester so he's likely still alive, but the idea of this episode is definitely to show that the Angels of Death are the Detective Agency. Easy, right? Then the government will remove of them, and then all will be over. As in, no one to be able to protect the nation. And we're not relying on Port Mafia, by the way, they don't have the wooden arrow. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Wow. I gotta say, really hyped about the proceedings on this my blood's flowing crazy. No really, can't explain this tension I got right now that's not on my crotch, really. It's real impressive so far, and I want to know where this goes. Probably not their downfall, but someone has to believe in the Agency. That is not them. So that's gonna be hard. Also, is Fyodor free yet? We don't know. All the answers we need to know soon, I guess. Damn, is this still the best action series so far that I've watched.

Haha is what Amane is likely saying so I won't repeat what he said again, but in this episode (#OtonariNoTenshiSama06) I suppose you can guess where Chitose is going with this, but true though, Amane may not be "youth" enough to know about it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You think <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20220601/21/natsukawashiinablog/b6/5c/j/o0280050015126698830.jpg target=_blank>Shiina</a> knows? Ah dammit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, let's talk about the two Love Days. Yeah, not just the one, but yes, as with tradition it HAS to start with the girl. I mean, can't be any worse than that dude who got chocolates from all the girls in class, he will at least get the one as the buddy mentioned. Don't worry, the chocolate here can't be as bad as like, stuffed with frog meat. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sorry for the "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/12291/Acchi_Kocchi target=_blank>Acchi Kocchi</a>" joke there only <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/55845/Mayoi_Katase target=_blank>Mayoi-chan</a> is evil enough to ruin Love Day, but suffice it to say that I can talk about the differences of what Chitose gave which are <a href=https://jisho.org/search/girichoko target=_blank>obligatory chocolates</a> so it's for anyone without love interest or else the buddy will beat him up lol, and what Mahiru has given him at his place because I SWEAR those are <a href=https://jisho.org/search/honmeichoko target=_blank>sentiment chocolates</a>. Yes, it was the hot chocolate drink. F**king jebaited dude, she gave you the chocolate already, you didn't even notice. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ah that was a great Valentine's Day, so of course we fast forward to a month later to let Amane worry about what he should give back to her. Obviously not chocolate we don't want our angel to be fat lol, and I promise Amane dressing up as his ikemen side is probably making Mahiru-chan frantic with excitement haha we call that falling in love by the way, then also found like, a <strike>wrist accessory</strike> what the heck you call those bracelets, for her for White Day. Like, really? Not chocolates, huh. That's great. And you dare ask if it's making her uncomfortable? It's making me unwell so what the f**k dude go take off your clothes and show your abs or something, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Interestingly, it's more than that because I guess he did put in effort to give her like, wishing cards from the guy obviously thinking that Mahiru won't use this for... indecent purposes but what do we know, we have enough of these cards until Episode 12 so we can expect something. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As usual, tell me they are not in a relationship already. The romantic type. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I think I know what I hate about this series. I hate how much everything is laid out bare. That might be the issue. From selecting the right gift for each other and giving to them on the special day albeit not in their faces, to them bothered about how they look to each other, to even how much they want to celebrate their birthdays and not knowing of when whatsoever, I gotta say it's as cringeworthy as it's also very... how should I put it, silly? Yeah. Almost said retarded lmao, to think that I'm not here to enjoy a romantic relationship between this neighbour helping each other situation. But I see another thing coming, and Amane's buddy might be right about this, that this friendly relationship will not last long at this rate. Someday someone is going to think that advancing into going steady is a good idea. Yes, and that will ruin pretty much everything we have seen up till now. Not that it's bad, I think it might be coming sooner than later, and I wonder if the story will even go in that direction or I guess we just keep this storytelling rather monotonous so we can just enjoy more Mahiru-chan since why not, we are here for cuteness anyways. Excuse me, here for angel. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Not much has changed since Episode 1 though, I still gotta say.

Meanwhile, let's talk about what I gave! <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%AE%BF%E7%B8%81-single/1667782199?l=en" target=_blank>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</a></b> is the newest disappointment of the year to be frank, so I just skipped it. Like, even <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hurts-single/1014370527?l=en" target=_blank>Homecomings' indie single from 2015</a></b> is more interesting than that, dude. Also, maybe because it featured so much broken English I thought I was listening to No Buses for a second. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, goes to show how little I know about these guys in their 10th year coming. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/dear-doze-days-ep/1659808217?l=en" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's new single</a></b> did not fascinate me further despite me tuning in to <a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1622917557262123008?s=20&amp;t=QJ3rJy5gXA0zIHXuYtDQkQ" target=_blank>her release livestream</a> a day before the release since the B-side didn't get better in my brain and the A-side is barely even good. I guess cute voice Akarin is not much to go with, huh. Next single is likely for action series Anime so maybe we get cool Akarin back. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/love-crazy-ep/1659368337?l=en" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new single</a></b> is the new Klassic Note Review since the last time I did this almost 6 years ago by the way, not that this is a fantastic release but I gotta say the first two tracks are really good in my opinion even if they are credited to something which says a lot. So yeah, you're welcome, Sumipe. Wasn't there 10 years ago so yay for your <a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1624369908460187649?s=20&amp;t=z6wl160HvMNHJfXcJxUdsw" target=_blank>10th anniversary</a>, I guess. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%90%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%81%8C%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E3%82%82%E3%82%84%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8B-ep/1666494087?l=en" target=_blank>miwa's new EP</a></b> should be getting the spotlight I assume because I quickly changed from a meh review to like, I'm just desperate for Valentine's Day okay? miwa-san, <a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1623140772571914240?s=20&amp;t=QJ3rJy5gXA0zIHXuYtDQkQ" target=_blank>I'll take anything at this point</a>. Maybe you too? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Not getting that on my shelf though, we are really one song away, and I'm not talking about the acoustic self covers. Last but not least, I then found out that <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sweet-pea-e-p/1665540258?l=en" target=_blank>SpecialThanks new digital only EP</a></b> was released... last weekend lol which featured songs which I've listened to and forgot last year. So yeah, giving them now but not like I'm giving them all there isn't a CD to buy anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So no, no Review for this.</div><br>We have more news to talk about from Twitter which is about music of course don't mind the new season Anime announcements lol. Thanks to Kanno Mai once again (hehe) (I pride on her recommendations now I can't even) I took a listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/nbuna_staff/status/1622249133720600576?s=20&amp;t=QJ3rJy5gXA0zIHXuYtDQkQ" target=_blank>yorushika's new song</a></b> which is for drama I think, isn't bad at all and I think I grew to like it despite the obvious familiarity so don't ask me why, guess I just want a new song from them. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1622883838316912642?s=20&amp;t=QJ3rJy5gXA0zIHXuYtDQkQ" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new song</a></b> makes me tired listening to their new songs over the past couple of years lol see you in the album. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1622973777998155777?s=20&amp;t=QJ3rJy5gXA0zIHXuYtDQkQ" target=_blank>cinema staff's new song</a></b> also suffered the same fate so I won't even describe how much I don't care about giving these guys now, I'm sorry. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Yogees_band/status/1622920440665759744?s=20&amp;t=QJ3rJy5gXA0zIHXuYtDQkQ" target=_blank>A new Yogee New Waves' new song will pre-release next week</a></b> in view of their EP next month so that's exciting. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1623970527642542081?s=20&amp;t=QJ3rJy5gXA0zIHXuYtDQkQ" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's recent live digest</a></b> is nothing short of great, but hey I didn't listen to everything from her recent album so maybe I'm missing out.

What are the chances I'll give anything from it? Haha hey as long as we don't have the trend from last year we should be good.<br><br> Okay, so plans for the rest of the month, basically. I'll remind myself again next week until March drops by. For next week first though, I'll finally give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/empathy/1501798857?l=en" target=_blank>Ueda Reina's 1st album</a></b> a chance since I've heard a little something from her radio show (which I missed this week lol I'm terrible), which is likely the only thing I'll listen to honestly. I know there are new digital songs so I'll have a lookout for those. Following week I'll give a listen to <b>amazarashi's new single</b> which is ending song for Anime "NiER" which goddamn has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsQko0cn8qU" target=_blank>15-minute music video</a> which I have no mood to watch they literally collaborated with a producer to make this, which I hope the song will be good enough for me to talk about lest Aimer come trash this dude coming March with the opening theme.<br><br><br><br><br> Oh well, I missed Koko-chan's radio show again. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, is this a problem because, as I will explain to you in my birthday post yes it's happening the following Monday as I take work leave, it's really hard to catch some of these radio shows especially their airing time is close to dinner time here so I can't just sit here and not eat with my family. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I should just move out to live alone haha that's how you get laid, right? If you say you live with your parents no one will want to date you? Haha what do I even know. See you guys next time then, and until then... Koharu-chan just saved me from this week's event gacha shame. Thanks, girl. Your petite build and perfectly-sized boobs are the best-<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Oh come on, we know Koharu is good because dear Naganawa Maria is voicing her- Where is the part where this girl turns masochist? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We not going to get the miracle that is Alternative Girls anymore huh</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
