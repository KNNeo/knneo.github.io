With my sheer luck and thanks to Google Maps I took all the last buses of my journey and reached home safely... at 1am. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, the night is young, they say. Guess I don't have to be 30 no more-<div><br></div><div>Speaking of time here lol what is the relevance even, the upcoming package which will be coming in soon probably in time for Valentine's Day... did not go according to plan. No photobook review within so that will not be until March, and I am TAXED BY ITEMS SHIPPED NOT SHIPPING FEES so that's already going to make me rage lol maybe I find another service which doesn't do that hehe<div><br> Okay okay me stop listening to more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5yvpYSsktA" target=_blank>Himemori Luna Electone playing</a> why must Luna-tan be playing it at a Sunday morning haha let's start I love watching niche content like Anime! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KyokouSuiri16><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kyokou Suiri</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I know who the real culprit is... There is no need to rush..." Yeah bro we have the whole episode and no boyfriend around so we can take our time <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div></blockquote>Because you see, the problem is not finding out who did all this, but to find a way to NOT put the blame on us. That's the harder part. Fortunately, we have sleuth master here so we good. Also, not <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/132504/Ranpo_Edogawa target=_blank>famous detective</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode what is with the special extended opening  maybe that's the actual length (#KyokouSuiri16), we conclude the murder surrounding Muroi-san, who, if you haven't realized, is always cursed to have issues with associating with women. Hey, let's not say the snow woman is also going to be an issue eventually lol Kotoko-chan stop predicting that, but let's talk about the murder first. Well, for starters, we have to remember something, which is a thing I thought of not saying but then I really forgot which was that, Kotoko had all the access to all the spirits in town since she is the goddess after all, so is able to know what happened at the time of murder. So yeah, surprise surprise, it's not the guy after all, and boy did I thought that the ex-wife would kill herself and frame the husband but then again why would she since she could've done that long ago, brought us to the next suspect and obviously murder on the line, Muroi's partner at his previous work Itsuki. She's a b*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also she did a lot of things to keep his beloved in check even after he left the company, like wink wink, checking on whether he has an alibi before committing the murder and then framing it on him. Like seriously, who puts the murder's name on the hand? There isn't even a marker on the location, dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah, Itsuki here didn't do everything cleanly, and as Kotoko mentioned, it's super unlikely the police are still at the Muroi-did-it accusation mainly because he has been so secluded even without the camera footage, that it's super hard to find any more clues as to whether they can pin him as the murderer. So yeah, and as overheard by ghosts near the police station lol why, they are investigating the possibility of Muroi-san being framed of murder, which will probably make more sense at this point. And for the details of the murder you can watch it for yourself, but suffice it to say that you know, betrayal of Muroi-san somehow must come with a cause of women. Yeah, he too handsome, dude. Waaaaay more handsome than Kuro-senpai- GET THAT DEMON MONSTER AWAY FROM ME!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Says snow woman because yeah, remember we see him fine but as spirits they see him as... they can't even see him straight because it hurts their eyes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, I wish I had that kind of appeal like Muroi but hey, I honestly also don't want that kind of betrayal action but maybe after I've earned a fortune that's fine hehe. Still alone either way so why not be rich too- Then again, I'm already living the secluded life so frame me for murder, why don't you? Haha please don't I don't want to eat prison food. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Kuro-senpai asked a good question though, that why would Itsuki who if she loved Muroi-san, frame him for murder? Why not frame someone else? Maybe she doesn't know anyone else? Yeah I guess, but the irony of being there for him while he is framed for murder sounds like a f**ked up idea for me. Unless you can tell me you can make Muroi-san innocent by exposing the murderer in which case it'll be... you? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, no one said this is a <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/158884/Mushitarou_Oguri target=_blank>perfect crime</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, wow this might be the best episode of this season so far, no joke. We are doing pretty well so far and so is the progress of Kotoko-chan's report lol don't forget she has to go to college/university too, so I wonder how many more cases we will have that actually will relate to the snow woman again. I thought she will be main for this season but maybe I'm wrong. Or that Muroi-san will be frozen solid soon enough and she will be. Haha let's see how then maybe Kuro-senpai will be killed by Rikka-san already lmao</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9Je8owbC5zC5cWDZZEEOvvduK6-L-rtC_r6dpZCbuQDM_oEshzUL0uWYhq6V0PVixm5MsENgwrJyn6oVs6QR9KvZpP4NocE6AJz0zpLCQWFHyvlHMobNO8TeiTt3KYZm38V2e_Tpq6nJc1yJwSEl8L0-U_v9opPz-63ue2H5L7e_aVaiOYifeJKo0/s320/kyokousuiri16_couple.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>EXPECTATION<br>MFW girls hug me in fear lol I wish</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXmty1HOv8Mjk6AjtAuIMOBmdaej6OEH74UGNMcN7YiLfL7tww_t_XFSZaRf_X8PoeqFMCMTleCpJ-dbeNUnliIwULxsBUKjVOF-Ui9Zo_gCOcmbC7HJ4DaowqkwQptyhWtjVtAKTPBKorszrXX8geGSsPeABmz4FCefXJYinuWJLEcXNm8-ZCFs2j/s1600/kyokousuiri16_confetti.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>It's so worth celebrating this is my new congrats GIF from now on haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTNEqYpwQ96kgt4eHSzWo88wZBg9ZzJGEZtX1nFBJV2ibWTJltMQom2yGeKng0XBbK9uDN-5Q1HcXeMD5VZLEVbXQbq6E9bDkTRWMSbxzT2HA5dkCoRCIEUsVFhrMRdAjFtYfonOKBeBIVNNEMFI8qHgJ63my7fO9LIsRFM8szAmWBAjUme4-iwsW-/s320/kyokousuiri16_frozen2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>REALITY<br>Wait like, 3 more months or something</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha Seita-kun how are you already winning</div></blockquote>Hey, Shiraishi-kun, if you are a kid you WILL NOT get bored doing that thing for hours. Ask all the hardcore Power Rangers fans when they were kids. Oh but I won't even at that age so can't relate I was too woke already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#KuboSan04) boy did we start this with a bang because get your cameras ready we are going to record Seita-kun, wait, AND the brother doing it together? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Well that was a great start as we see Seita-kun getting hype over TV today and boy do I miss those days instead of dealing with YouTube livestreams and gameplay videos. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways lol, we got more kinks lined up for the day haha, where I guess we are not into feet so we have wrong socks on Shiraishi's side which no surprises no one noticed and I wish the same can be said for me because that gives me anxiety to no end my mental health will be in much better condition if I were him. Interestingly, Shiraishi did notice something different about Kubo-san but don't know what is it until they BOTH got a chance to stand on a chair to put up posters on the notice board to notice <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> that Kubo-san is wearing tights. Yep, she didnt have socks to wear lol. Also, one would think that she might not be wearing anything inside her- lmao but thank goodness this is still a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/seinen target=_blank>seinen</a> series so we are not going that far, but she was wearing them outside, I guess. Also, to be able to notice that difference means he was STARING AT THEM LEGS DUDE??? Haha ah hey, there is little to appreciate these days we take whatever we can. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, Kubo-san wants a convenience store trip. I'm not sure what you call those in convenience stores here but they sure aren't as cheap as those in Japan to say the least and I won't even vouch for their taste, but the girl wants to try them out, dude. Never tried that before living for 16 years? That's a problem. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Thank goodness <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tennokoe target=_blank>the voice from above</a> and I don't mean Ten-chan's voice lol get it? Kubo-san was able to order a drink for herself with help from Shiraishi who wouldn't order one in fear of sharing half the drink with her and killing himself with embarrassment in the process. So he got a bun. Man, imagine if they bought TWO buns and- Moving on haha, but Kubo-san did not give up on the teasing, so she went for the kill on the bun. Yup, no tearing out a piece of whatsoever. You see bro, the thing with a drink is that you can open the cover and let them drink from not the cover. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Well either way he is screwed since people just bump into him like he's a wall or something so there's that. Really could've eaten while it's hot, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And we end with Valentine's Day. That sad day that'll hit me in a week or so where no one will give me chocolates, not even by mistake. But hey, Shiraishi thinks the one below his desk was a mistake, so what else is new. And you would think one should put their name on it at least, well, "to Shiraishi" at least, to let him know. But well he did bring it home so we're good. And no prizes for guessing it right, Kubo-san made it for him. By herself. Not purchased from the store. Made it in her kitchen. With the sis watching- And THAT is what's the problem here lol because even the sis knows this miracle is happening in front of her eyes where her sister is trying to make chocolate for her beloved by herself, and no surprises there from the sis' statement, her first attempt came out, uh, very racist-ly black. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I should stop making such jokes lol. Anyways, I guess the sis did indirectly help her make some of the cookies presentable to the public lmao, so yeah it was a happy ending. Well almost. For Shiraishi might be getting the best one out of the batch, and maybe Tama-chan and the others get the oddly shaped ones because who cares. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Man, I should stop describing episodes but even so, it's a joy to watch these unfold so don't mind me talking about how good this series is just in general.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEkBhkT9_Y7I7SJUE5GKO8L5W8mXM7pEdy0J55BZW6a8q9Jut76a3ioUy1aGq9RFaAgf_TJrukzjG86klZ0SPF2QlRgIF1e-iw4FKj7eYRNPS1bqNi632FjCtrsoHLkDEaKrfXob0lgvq3xZ1GjRtfwgtT0aEOQV8pQ5nd4rSfmC7MYE9rpezZuGSb/s320/kubosan04_seita1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MVP Seita-kun strikes again!!

For some reason, when you have one, you turn into an idiot" Haha Ranpo-kun I wish people knew of this tbh</div></blockquote>Wow, this episode is really leading up to the rest of this season, huh. Man, my blood is rushing I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we conclude the perfect crime which will otherwise be if not for Ranpo-kun haha we have to save Kunikida dude (#BungouStrayDogs42), let's talk about the mystery in general, how about it? Yeah. No surprises, Mushitaro is the one who killed the author and stealing his final volume of the novel, is probably trying to sell it in the black market for a profit. Problem is, that is just a copy, not the original. For what seems like just one taking the life of another lol it is still true to this aspect, there is a lot more to this supposed mystery from the famous mystery novel author on his last work. Firstly, it's impossible to stop Mushitaro as Ranpo-kun exposes him in the car they were in and tells this to the police. There is no evidence, that driver is pointing a gun without bullets though to Ranpo, and they were above all, in a diplomat car. Yup, you heard that right, they got their own butt covered well. So yeah, they had to let them go despite Ranpo tipping it out to Poe and to the police to get these guys once he has revealed... well almost everything. Which brings us to the next point, why we had to trap Mushitaro in his own mystery to get him to confess. Not surprising, we know the same thing as this dude that Ranpo doesn't have an Ability he's just smart lol, so he had to use Poe's powers to trap him in so the only way he can get out is to reveal the truth. Even then, Mushitaro was still lying till the end, for Ranpo then figured out already that he committed the murder in orders from the author friend himself. Yes, they were friends, that's the whole point that he can get this close to the author, but in a plot twist for the novel I guess haha, he hired his friend to kill him so there is motive and intent. Yup, weird thought, but the author is already going to die of a tumour in a year or so so maybe this is a faster route. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Anyways lol, and it's also BECAUSE they are friends, that Ranpo knew how to deal with Mushitaro who can cover all his crimes with evidence: To let the suspicions behind the friend's death be as what Ranpo will reveal to the public OR fulfil his friend's wishes and reveal the actual ending proper. Which he wouldn't if he wasn't directly involved in this, so he is basically busted already to be honest, serving as easy evidence for the whole thing and probably enough to get Kunikida out of prison... or so we think. I wouldn't think too much about this Nikolai person who just appeared out of nowhere but I would guess Mushitaro won't be walking out of this alive lol thanks Ranpo for the career recommendation we don't do after-prison job opportunities here let alone afterlife ones he has no chance anyways haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, is obviously going to be killed by, wait for it, one of the FIVE angels working alongside Fyodor to take Mushitaro down lest he reveals more of their plans. Yup, deja vu already? And as the Detective Agency take on their next assignment haha it's already too late Mushitaro if you can DM like maybe Fukuzawa they might still have a chance to say no, we are already in a deep hole of no return as we take on directly the actual antagonists of the series. Yup, all those earlier is just for show, ladies and gentlemen. This upcoming group? We might not even be able to stop them. Boy, is this series delivering, and I like that. Plot twists at every corner possible, and we haven't even seen Atsushi-kun. Not really missing him but you know, I hope he's not dead. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, do we think Ranpo-kun has an Ability now? I don't think so, right? He's just manipulating information he knew from mystery to get back those to f**k with him using Abilities? I like to think of it that way, makes more sense. *looks at Wiki* Yeah, still no Ability haha</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiClsiuFw8TG80AfeYlCmvcM0ybWcaFDDW56kxg5CLdOP5fx0OxYi1dtZbeZF6kT0SgHf6WrrxLll7HNHPac_aAD13BXkbAxlCOA_vCos15JRYeuH3J_oFcFnOPTIJWJh1DPDVPBGFp4bbowNpQvhwLhj9mu2EDO2Fo-uovYX-eVwQ-ODhsLTMiiRTb/s320/bungoustraydogs42_ranpo1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How Edogawa Ranpo acts in public:<br>Dude just making a mess, really</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXBh9sMgeRU2Q256M4z9ZB3rbNbPa4uOANFwjBANGl-f2Fl93sTDMTKbv0m4QAYOKyDkPuIeWnDiMeB3pNr2HmQsgmU-e1nWgMaSK1rf-tIOEfnSqACNtI_G2XGPcg7aPNPDBnaGiyvKmvkbK-3KOmhh9cRc0QugbR38bQyIKXYZ71gYYqg98DSCpY/s320/bungoustraydogs42_ranpo3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How Edogawa Ranpo acts in public:<br>I swear some people do this and peek on leftover copied documents</table></div></div><div>[Well I've got nothing much to say at this point but amaze at the conclusion of the idea that the final page was photocopied due to the fact that tears were on it.

Aizawa Saya I know your hobby is sleeping and Akarin may say that this isn't a great hobby to do with others but can I sleep with you somewhere? HAHA Then again that might be too good to be true... for now haha, so let's not tell Amane's parents about it, yes? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh hi dad. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Don't worry he didn't find out he was flirting with the mother anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Many jokes here just having these people interact with each other, but I guess the purpose of the parents coming over apart from witnessing whatever thing he has with his cute neighbour and how much Shihoko wants Mahiru to be her daughter lol that will be incest my dear <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (ah hey step siblings is okay though? lmao), brought some <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kimono target=_blank>kimono</a> for the girl to go shrine visiting for the new year. Amane looks <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> as usual lmao why, but I think the joke is on the fact that they were seen, well Mahiru-chan was seen, holding hands in public I guess. Oh well, what'cha gonna do. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> They also shared drinks with each other unlike the other couple in another Anime which didn't (read above for "Kubo-san" thanks), which just goes to show how much of a joke this series is already treating friendship like holy water and throwing romance into the gutter. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> They also shared compliments with each other but then what else is new here, and man did the relentless teasing from Amane get the girl every single time I can't even. All in all... guys, we all need a <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20230201/14/natsukawashiinablog/da/ca/j/o0360060015237305969.jpg target=_blank>Shiina</a> Mahiru-chan in our lives. And a handsome face. Yeah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, just fill yourselves up with not a cuppa hot drink but with some wholesome Anime like this where embarrassment is fuel, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, ladies too I swear this demographic is very universal Amane should be the reason you watch this hehe. Also, I found out that LISTENING to this Anime will make me happier and not complain about the... the drier scenes or poor animation quality that would otherwise only be better on close-ups. Man, I guess I'm giving this till the end. We have some backstory from Amane and his dad it seems on why he moved to live alone so welp I hope it's not a bullying story again lmao TYPICAL, but yeah, it's peaceful days going forward which I don't think so. We need more drama in this drama even though I swear we have a lot of it already haha I don't know what else better to say about this series dude just leave me alone</div><div>[TL:DR; "Like how he is always so cool without even trying" This plot in a nutshell- As I said dude it's not an angel dropped into the guy's life as per the title THIS SERIES LITERALLY GAVE HER AN IKEMEN lol it's like "Romantic Killer" we should just change the title to "Otonari no Ikemen-sama" haha]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhttTyN6HMhXGrvUf9X2UjQM2mLZG35XVXYzVLT9gQL5YfqU0rQl0QhXTtrPZk2LNMGu5mOW7-COmF9NfyE3-V8EqhKXY-M-kUue6GjQ-K6oPsUG4CqbDc11KxliSwZmeLwu9Zn5h85KjwlU46G4SyLG0Sca_n7Zibwi3YBuqzkOSHE_756Gip_wzaZ/s320/otonarinotenshisama05_family.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>EXPECTATION<br>...<br>WE WISH haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghURg3LSvhX9KixuIpaGJa3dhFqkXlgI5_4aNRb9CI0gzU3KEtaJR44xcn2PerDNgLmaJc9XjlOBTLZ7TFrg7NyQaT4ov0wS8uloRcYPJ1rIo0-EaQds2INu6Ne_Udp_so52-xm_S4k1-3TpuMthWWeX72b8LLN8fNdgD7ptgi7Y7-r4XRXX_oHr7X/s320/otonarinotenshisama05_amane4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>REALITY<br>Yeah, just this, this handsome dude hehe</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Yeah, that's how boring the rest of February is going to be haha Ueshama will be then I guess</div><div><br><br><br><br>And boy sorry for the late post but I doubt anyone is waiting besides myself lol, because I was dragged by my mom to whatever community dinner (for senior citizens) and our whole family begrudgingly joined in only for me to be blasted music on my right ear for about 3 hours in the evening because we sat nearest to the front. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> I promised myself to be happy this year, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Thanks mom, now that we just won a new toaster I guess we're having bread for breakfast for the next few months. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> See you guys next time then, my life is as exciting as I just need to agree to say yes and leave the damn house, but until next time hope for next week I can actually spend more time at home and... maybe fix this blog loading also to be honest. I hope I did something yesterday to speed this up, but I'm not sure, can't be as fast as that Qwik framework that has been gaining in popularity recently I've read up on. Sorry for programming talk but hey if web is still the future then maybe the websites can load faster so I can buy more Tomita Miyu bromides hehe yup she got me again I'm going to order some stuff right now- IS THAT A RAFFLE FOR MIYU-CHAN THAT DID THOSE MARUPI ONES?? Uh oh haha my wallet noooo<br></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
