I'm just counting all the fanclub birthday messages and so far it's three? Yeah Marinka, Naobou, Akarin in that order. We'll talk about how many more I've signed up in tomorrow's post though so stay tuned lmao okay Ayachi also hehe you think she took this photo before her pregnancy or- RIERI!!! Come on Outlook why you put her in the Junk folder lol<br><br>Also yeah did you see what <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1626159459381772291?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina did to her official Twitter account</a> (not run by her normally) on Friday? Yeah, she (and her manager) posted so many photos of her I already died of cuteness seeing this at work *ahem* I did not slack off I swear lmao it was Friday dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah because of that, this week's requirement will now be that now every time I say "Mahiru-chan" I have to put one extra image in the thumbnails later lol who am I joking so don't mind if I spam this supposed joke of this post down below because I have plenty to show from <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1626438713159958531?s=20" target=_blank>Nan-chan</a> anyways hehe (yes they refer to selfies as social media "bait")<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KyokouSuiri18><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kyokou Suiri</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"And you could definitely use some exercise once in a while" Okay granny just leave me alone haha</div></blockquote>What, this cat drinks alcohol?? PUT HIM IN THE RAIN AGAIN lol oh we can't because it can't get wet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, looks like in this new episode (#KyokouSuiri18) we are dealing with a ripped granny raising a... <a href=https://jisho.org/search/bakeneko target=_blank>monster cat</a>? Man, that sounds like trouble already. Looks like we have another mystery in our hands, and this time it's from a faraway fishing village. Featuring a spirit cat who doesn't even care about taking over humans even though that's their lore lol, and a granny who's older then all of my grandparents who already passed away (RIP), we are just at the beginning I guess, about a little story featuring the village's dead fish. Well, long story short, every day the villagers have only seen more dead fish float to the surface, which is seriously affecting tourism and everything around the area, making people who rely on the fishing life having to leave just because. We all know that since we are talking about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/youkai target=_blank>youkai</a>, that this is obviously more than what it seems, and that is what the mayor suspects as he... literally chases Tae-san our old granny, down the road. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Gotta say, he got the stamina, despite his build. Then again, we are chasing down like, an 80-year-old or something lol. Of course, since we are in the Kotoko-chan camp, we are unlikely to believe all the stuff about the previous villager's death Zenta after his grandson passed away... I won't bother about the story it was a sad affair all things concerned, but yeah, the old dude had to join him. Interestingly, he didn't pass away quietly, well, apart from the heart attack. It's probably more of what he left behind that might be a problem. According to Tae-san and police investigations, Zenta carved out a wooden doll similar to Pinocchio but I guess it's just the long nose that's relevant for now, which of all things, had some electric stone embedded on its right arm. Let's just imagine that this wood Zenta got from is likely from a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinboku target=_blank>sacred tree</a> similar to the one from Anime "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/3958/Kannagi target=_blank>Kannagi</a>" lol don't worry only 15 years of Anime watching experience, but somewhat had a stone in it. Hey, maybe it's some electricity god or something, I don't know Japanese folklore. Nonetheless, something bad probably will happen if you craft anything from it, let alone say, if you craft something that looks like your grandson. Not that important, but the grandson was human, had limbs and can walk into the ocean to zap fishes?? That sounds like a problem before we even knew of it. Also, I like how the cat is dealing with this rather casually as so with Tae-san, but she is right she already is just waiting for her retirement (from this world) (oops) but the cat won't let her so I guess she has to stay and help to solve this mystery. Also, she is likely the first person to think, even after the cat mentioned that the Goddess it was about to consult is human, that Kotoko-chan is a monster. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Joke's on you, old woman, the man assisting her is probably the <em>real</em> monster. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm still surprised why the cat didn't freak out on the sight of this mermaid-kudan monstrosity. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, even if we have Kuro-san deal with the Pinnochio, this might not be an easy task. We need like, sniper rifles or something. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, the reveal of the mystery is normally a rough start, but at least we know next up will be the action we have all wanted since the start of this season which we had like a short fight with the sumo-like doll. So yeah, I'll look forward to that. Might be another short story here, I would say, leading up to whatever Rikka-san is plotting next. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Let's ignore her for now and anticipate more youkai action I guess!</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2wFpV0j8d8Qk9h2HKwnyNqsRpzZXD5lciKcLTd0OwjWZzQ0e-hG2dLrQFUd9fKPljftknxTBLYQ3LiQZOT0prP_HHQeWPME-yg5smj9SUT43aOhRjSsfj5g3TJh6Mkozb3UKuhnZ9OmT_FiLQ2WftoSYslVqMiMlVfCyRBHHddBfFyo0IeQ1220xF/s320/kyokousuiri18_pinocchio.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Things you should not be seeing IRL:<br><a href=https://twitter.com/amazarashi_info target=_blank>amazarashi</a>, is that you?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuTxe2VvOEmLJGI2fc5bhsbQRjSrjmyXmhgwDPjF1Y_AOA7F_XejfTMqWRvYjpTp0Zuo2154pZ5G8s0TSkBSRlp1rBgm64zVB1HyGdnlEWGfQqfj27BK-hsSyXOnATGBQjaOZGcdELDR6Z0aOgwDTm4I9U_OSSZr3zrdEj27G0zhOD_mgRofMHqELE/s320/kyokousuiri18_spirits1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Things you should not be seeing IRL:<br>I mean, I know the obvious but the cat is also a ghost btw haha</table></div></div><div><div>P.S.

I'm !@#$% jealous haha</div></blockquote>Okay Tama-chan the dude is just at his seat which is right in front of you what are you mean where is he? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, Kubo-san gotta pretend she didn't see him? What madness is this?? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where possessiveness of your boi is based and honestly is cringe lmao (#KuboSan06), we really should not think too much into the power of Kubo Nagisa in school. But outside though, literally where any Kubo-san can find him, that's where things start to change. We are introduced to Kubo-san's niece Saki-chan on the streets, where she helped pick up something Shiraishi has dropped so many times it's hard to believe he is preventing the dropping of his own belongings and not praying that people will return it to him. Well, going the lost and found route I guess, at least Japan has that policy around. But yeah, that's where Saki-chan's dialogue cuts off though, namely because she was accompanied by one other Kubo who also can see him but more precisely, saw him previously in a bookstore. Yes, "trying" to read a porno magazine, please. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah, introduction's ruined, and yeah, I am Nagisa's boyfriend, what of it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> INB4 we then realized how much of an idol Nagisa is to the niece, then also let us in on the news that Saki-chan looked like Nagisa when she was younger ie. in middle school, and is growing her hair out to look like her too. Oh yeah, maybe Saki-chan can identify Seita-kun in the future. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This Kubo family DNA is really exquisite; I wonder which strand is the one that can identify a Shiraishi. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Gotta say though, Saki-chan? You can NOT be as cute as Nagisa. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But who am I lying to, we know <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/21517/Sora_Amamiya target=_blank>Ten-chan</a> is cuter than <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa target=_blank>Kana-chan</a>. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Next up, exams are coming soon and boy did the mom drop on the son real quick haha deja vu here too by the way just without the video games because my mom didn't love me enough <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span>, Shiraishi then had to study alone because even if he studied with people, the others won't even know if he has any issues since they won't remember he exists. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm so sorry dude I'm just explaining the lore I didn't mean to insult you in any way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, Kubo-san noticed him as usual, and is even kind enough to teach him how to do math. Now THAT is a better Kubo-sensei than in "BLEACH". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> They thought of studying together, well the girl did hehe, but sadly, Shiraishi got the fever the next day and was unable to attend school. Not like anyone would notice that lmao the teacher did don't you worry the paper can't lie about his existence. Well, at least when they made sure to put his name in lmao the jokes, but we know Kubo-san is more than worried about him, even her friends know. I personally liked how much she struggles to want to go visit him, but for not disturbing him I guess we conveyed the same message as with the <strike>LINE</strike> PINE messaging service so we good. Shout out to Seita-kun and Akina for the save lol I'll leave you to think which one is the lie, but we are just glad Seita didn't get the cold. Because Kubo-san did. She still came to school though for very obvious reasons <em>because she wants to see him come back to school</em> but he was late which probably got her worried increasing her feverish symptoms and boy was it risky to leave her to go to seek medical help herself. So yeah Shiraishi, you late already so why not make this more of an excuse by going with her? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... dammit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I legit thought we will get some hanky-panky in the doctor's office. So, no? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, Shiraishi be the main character alright. He has been for six episodes- So I guess we are still getting this fever going, eh? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> But yeah, as you can see, this series just has enough to make you cringe but not enough for you to be touched and/or excited, and that always hits the spot for me, if you ask of my opinion. We are only halfway through, we pretty much know of the main cast, so let's see what will be of Shiraishi's test results. And if he fails, I guess we not playing video games no more. That's a pity, just go play with your female classmate then. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you then. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div>[Speaking of, Episode 7 onwards will be delayed until, and I'm not joking, until NEXT SEASON and will start again from the top, so this will likely continue in May. Uh oh. Well, at least we can copy paste this again haha no I wont, but yeah, can't be worse than Attack on Titan lol]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQlwnU2pau-PkNI80MZHILaTcfyI3PiZxLBJjMPABbJFGMf_h4bsWBgBCy_ooqIZSIuygKDjaesEOh8LxOWeVBvAfHOwDwjkloJlazTbXH24oC5myYdgzC6ZyXoJ0Wn1IbawILlq5I6nLQq5p4dIYA39eDpWHPR5TYdS7jp5mOaAWjAol3HB-E-Dz7/s320/kubosan06_saki3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I envisioned Amamiya Sora to look and behave like as a kid haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhltzcAnSQ-XpTXbNyDMadyjSAUACRUzuZl58dnQ2-J1eMELdOlDUICKL5ly0vsq_-Md4wQtMK3SUUt_iavQpbC08iTRPLoUhi3jZuyr_VvnFbzzkMd9-SJYld5U1GQ9qefogIee8DA-ntgv6meWUuWMRKkRGHxsFHxBw7Gi0Y0kEEGBY_QfElsLapL/s1600/kubosan06_pout.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This just looks like a good GIF haha <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kawaii target=_blank>kawaii</a></table></div></div><div>P.S.

Real screwed up of a power though, how you gonna fix that? In this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs44) where it's likely impossible to assemble the Detective Agency together unless you mean in prison lol, well we'll take the cemetery as the alternative, thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay serious talk though, but what else is there to say? Someone is already cheating. Even the military knew of how to deal with these guys in advance. Say who's the one afraid of Ability users? It's history repeating itself again, I suppose. Anyways, it's all the good stuff happening besides everyone who got framed of a massacre of government officers so NOT talking about Nikolai, the five on stage have to find a way to escape. I mean, you think the confirmation of that one dude Tonan saying that they are the perpetrators will help? Haha I think the military already has their own bias. As much as they try to stop them from escaping, thanks to Yosano-sensei they literally gripped on the edge of their own lives through death and did walk out of the place... unscathed? I mean, they did kinda kill themselves lol okay Hunters time. So, the new characters of the series. So now we know that, the military themselves have their own squad(s) of Ability users obviously more used for battle, but looks like they might be too overpowered to be used in the first place. But it is Ability users we are apprehending and/or killing, so yeah, fight force with force. Also, how did they just put the cutest character in this series but is also a masochist to the leader? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You tell me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, the Agency members had to plan their escape from the premises they are technically still in town but just outskirts and they know the military will have more reinforcements even though that likely will be dealt with by Kyouka-chan and Atsushi we will talk about them later, but the rest had to escape. Kunikida will not choose trains since many lives will be at stake also it's hard to run away from a train, so car. But damn, did that dude cut through the car clean in half from a mile away. Suck it up, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/1087/Gin_Ichimaru target=_blank>Ichimaru Gin</a>, he has a longer one than you. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> And it can bend too?? Bro, not even close. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sorry for the "BLEACH" joke but damn, this is already as impressive even with just one of the four Hunters showing off their Ability. Well I guess the other one did use his field sense to find out where the escapees are, so yeah, no extra points to the Hunters for figuring out Kunikida's purpose in life. Also my anxiety works in the same way without being an Ability user so what else is new. Three decades, dude. There has never been relief. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, it's still impressive seeing the guys at work and yes the two Hunters chasing them down have noticed one of them is missing, which yeah I guess Kyouka did go back to save Atsushi because good chances they think he's stuck somewhere which is why he isn't joining them at this point, thank goodness. While they hold up the military uphill, I guess the Agency has to deal with these two themselves, quite literally doing a dance of protecting each other from a ridiculously flexible sword... or do they? So alright, no much of a surprise there to be honest, Port Mafia has come in to help the criminals. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Of course, the Hunters will not be able to deal with these guys if they come in numbers, but the guy who manipulated reality can still do something, so we shall see how long this can last. Well, at least to assist their escape?

And see all the lovey-dovey stuff these two have been doing. Understandable, have a nice day. Haha probably what <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1626461617721602054?s=20" target=_blank>Shiina</a> says in this new episode (#OtonariNoTenshiSama07) where boy, I wish I had a father-in-law to quarrel with. Can't have that if no girlfriend though. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> This week, yep finally lore drop. Before that though, gotta drop other people's lore, namely Itsuki. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, bro thought it'll be a great idea to leave house haha and stay by his buddy's yeah this dude also didn't have many good friends here or probably Amane's is the safest lmao, and what else can he say besides welcome to his love nest he is currently cultivating without other people here to break it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not that it really affects the two of them, but definitely for the guy Amane it's working. Even if the buddy doesn't really have to constantly remind him in his sleep, we know this love is going somewhere. Hopefully. I mean, the point that Chitose also wants in on this sleep-in lmao girl this is your boyfriend running away from the dad, I guess she probably also dropped in the "maybe you like Amane" lore on this poor girl. Then maybe she knows. Maybe. But you know what else she knows? That she cannot tell others about her pathetic life. Hey, I'm not the one exaggerating, she is. Because NOW we can lore drop. Specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1626481600824512512?s=20" target=_blank>Shiina</a> lore. We talk about parental love. What is that anyways, really? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> You want me to elaborate how much a mistake a man and a woman can decide alone and think that they can raise a kid until they are independent enough without ruining their lives through their selfish or even bad influence? Dammit this just sounds like "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40938/Hige_wo_Soru_Soshite_Joshikousei_wo_Hirou target=_blank>HigeHiro</a>" again- I really need to stop picking up such series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1626485784617558017?s=20" target=_blank>Shiina</a> did summarize this quite well because seriously we DO NOT need to know more about arranged marriage and how heartless these parents can be without attending even just the graduation ceremonies of their only child, but hey, what do I know about parenthood I'm not even married to anyone. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Oh well, what else can we really do but hope that these irresponsible adults will be out of our lives when she graduates high school where they can actually file for divorce so that Amane doesn't have to deal with what Itsuki has to deal with now. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> There's good and bad, I guess. Either way, <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1626486354245984256?s=20" target=_blank>Shiina</a> just wants someone to cry on, and it's just SO conveniently we have the one <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> to lend her his shoulder other than his ears. Yeah, in case you wonder how to cure shoulder pain from "Stray Dogs" above it's not riding on aircraft... I'm VERY sorry for contextual jokes be sure to watch all the stuff I watch to be relevant. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways coming back, it's ok to cry on such a reality, Mahiru-chan, everyone has to deal with their own issues. In your defence? You have people around who will care about you even if it's not your family <span class=emoji title=🤮>*pukes*</span> so yeah Amane the boyfriend lmao and his friends and actually people who like you in school that you didn't want to interact much with- <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1626493980526673920?s=20" target=_blank>Shiina</a>-san why didn't you take in all the popularity? Have you ever thought of that? But yeah I guess it might cause trouble for the parents so maybe not. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> All in all... <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> As they walk down the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sakura target=_blank>sakura</a> blossoms in view of the new year of school, it's hard to tell if they are really just toying with each other on the friendship thing. The guy's already twitching, can't you see? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> On the other hand, the love is growing. I know, <a href="https://twitter.com/tenshisama_PR/status/1626944120832016387?s=20" target=_blank>the official Twitter account</a> told us. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So we shall see how this goes. <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1626517882892066818?s=20" target=_blank>Shiina</a>-san after graduation is just going to be super sad OR super in bliss regardless of their parent's marital status, that's for sure. Screw adults, people. We need to high school love right now!!

Even so, giving the styles is still not helping much, so I went with that and picked a couple of songs. Literally, just two. I'll talk about them in order though. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/whale-living/1436832430?l=en" target=_blank>Homecoming's 1st album</a></b> I thought will be a great introduction to the upcoming album within the year but then I felt like I didn't feel like giving any of them and so I didn't. What I did give though, is the similar judgement for new release <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/this-ones-for-you/1668934485?l=en" target=_blank>Itou Miku's new album</a></b> which I guess I did listen to her single from last year and it was "kind of" good lol so I listened to more idol fanfare and probably gave one because of it. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/empathy/1501798857?l=en" target=_blank>Ueda Reina's 1st album</a></b> which I've withhold for two weeks so to listen to it on a week not slathered with releases did not help its cause, since much of the songs back then aren't as unique or interesting as the ones I've listened in the past couple of years. Also, this album is literally released half a year before the first time I heard of her. Yeah, that one for Anime "MajoTabi". So don't ask me why it rose up that fast. Last but not least, I knew I shouldn't have bothered with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E8%8A%B1%E9%99%8D%E3%82%8B%E7%A9%BA%E3%81%AB%E4%B8%8D%E6%BB%85%E3%81%AE%E6%AD%8C%E3%82%92/1669146292?l=en" target=_blank>a flood of circle's new album</a></b> which released also this week because I listened to one of their songs earlier this year actually start of the year specifically, and knew their melodies won't hit me despite the Rock music style. You see, they like to "rap" on their songs which isn't my thing so tell me again when you come up with something similar to your album in 2019. </div><div><br>Oh yeah this week is Love Day week on Twitter so expect something to happen in the Internet I guess and please ignore what was on the intro this is music only. Saying that though, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1625147787338719234?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's 1st live in audio is in music streaming services</a></b> if you just want to listen to her sing in that perfect <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> level voice hehe it's just me huh. On sadder news, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kusoiinkai/status/1625691699933765635?s=20" target=_blank>Kuso Iinkai's regular guitarist is leaving</a></b> the band and the group will continue with two members and let's hope it won't end up with one. Also new songs please, I've almost forgotten about you guys. Happier news though, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/PHONOTONES/status/1625823244485009408?s=20" target=_blank>BIGNOUN's only album is now on music streaming</a></b> because this legendary 2014 release got me real good in association of PHONO TONES, this is just as cool and different in feels it got me the first time I've heard of it. Give the topic song "FRICTION" a try to have a feel for it. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/UZSPYAIR/status/1626506756682817539?s=20" target=_blank>SPYAIR's guitarist UZ has something to announce in a week</a></b> which is likely his solo music release so maybe I'll change gears seeing that I won't exactly be keen on the vocalist changed band. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1626522206007328768?s=20v" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new single releasing in April</a></b> has been confirmed along with cover art of that and the live tour Blu-Ray release so of course I only care about the music. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/anisonha/status/1626540378601168896?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's album song has been given an Anison Award</a></b> and if you misunderstand nowadays Anison is just ignoring everything in Klassic Note about solo mainstream artists so yay for her I guess it was a good song. And I guess I like a <b><a href="https://twitter.com/tenshisama_PR/status/1626944374872367104?s=20" target=_blank>Iwami Manaka Anime character cover song</a></b> released on my birthday. It's not mind-blowing but ask me again next week if I'll give this song. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><br><br> So for next week, I guess we are in another ditch once again with new releases, so let's hope <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%81%E3%83%8E%E3%83%9F%E3%83%BC-single/1669237541?l=en" target=_blank>amazarashi's new single</a></b> for Anime "NiER" will hold up. I'm not bothered to watch the 15-minute music video but I'll give a 5-minute song if it's good. I mean, can't be as long as a three-parter when I listened to Suzuki Aina's debut album lol yeah "Eternal Place" the first and last are just 10-minute instrumentals<br><br><br><br><br></div></div></div><div>Ah~ah, was Inorin's fanclub event great. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know not to expect much because you bet this is just another way to get your money lol also it's better to be on location anyways, guests Hidaka Rina and Kakuma Ai played games with her which most exciting I guess is just them skating around a course or making cute faces so not your university orientation ice-breaking with cross gender physical contact lmao local joke, Inorin sang and danced, and it was an interesting 2 hours starting at 1pm Japan time. Yeah. </div><div><br></div><div>And to not lie about whether I did watch it, here's what she sang in the live portion of the event:</div><div>- Aimaimoko (Fans found out she wasn't singing at her best state; No wonder, she was talking all this time)</div><div>- Kimiiro Prologue (From "Wonder Caravan" single; Fans dropped the title for me haha I'm not true fan)</div><div>- Snow White (From same single, yeah but I didn't care about that single much, "Wonder Caravan" is just too good compared to these B-sides, also when I took the screenshot)</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNmPLIem6KZ_Z-U27xtyhatqdUDvSlhPCgM7r9J3pcmGx6z1JrNR1M5G_baFaQvPAu4jJ-SHW-pNCZKpEC4UrMm2j0iCAm3dlf7G-x6kPYfNFVItHG1ui3ivvnEcfcaTsIqdH7Fp_o3-VfUIz3EEgWxjbjn-mOc0lYw6SFtYManHSQoDzuG67K0tTp/s1920/Screenshot%202023-02-19%20143747.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNmPLIem6KZ_Z-U27xtyhatqdUDvSlhPCgM7r9J3pcmGx6z1JrNR1M5G_baFaQvPAu4jJ-SHW-pNCZKpEC4UrMm2j0iCAm3dlf7G-x6kPYfNFVItHG1ui3ivvnEcfcaTsIqdH7Fp_o3-VfUIz3EEgWxjbjn-mOc0lYw6SFtYManHSQoDzuG67K0tTp/s320/Screenshot%202023-02-19%20143747.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I did not prepare for the wallpaper it has been around for weeks hehe<br>(Shown is 2.37pm Singapore time, so 1.37pm Japan)</table><div>- Arpeggio (From 2nd album)</div><div>- Korekara mo (Also from 2nd album)</div><div>- My Graffiti (From 3rd album, did not give this though but I thought it was familiar)</div><div><br></div><div>Oh don't worry I didn't add any of these songs I've not heard of to my song library lol I only liked the first one btw <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And yes, I'm not that keen to watch the night event haha it's pretty much the same content in general (eg. play games with different themes) and Inorin is not close enough to the camera. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Cya guys soon enough, for tomorrow I'm on leave so I'll do up a special post to talk about what I am doing with my solo life from here on. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Until then, stay happy. I barely did for these two months already haha</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Okay I got just in time after dinner for Koko-chan's radio show 200th episode special. It's live video instead of audio, they have a gacha machine where when a chime randomly rings, she rolls once and dons whatever accessory it's written. Well turns out it's all ears so we have seen her as a cat, dog, tiger (lol), rabbit and demon (hehe) as she does impersonations and reads fan mails. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'm SO glad I've not missed this and as my first listen haha you bet I was just listening for the chime. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We will talk about me listening (passively) to radio shows on tomorrow's post and why it matters.</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. Okay my plan to hijack Pyxis' last-minute announced livestream just now worked: They were starting the stream before playing a game ("Momotetsu" a.k.a. Japanese monopoly) so they were reading YouTube chat, and I sent a Super Chat writing simply "It's my birthday, thanks for the stream" which could've been better phrased as in streaming on my birthday, and they read my name. REAL. NAME. So if you want to know you can watch the archive by the time you are reading this. My hands are still shivering by the way turned on the fan for the first time this year lmao BEST BIRTHDAY EVER haha I'm done</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
