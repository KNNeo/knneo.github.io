Good, 'cos I was already going mad when I had to fix this up myself thank goodness there is still some salvation on this. The code, uh, was back when I started learning and couldn't figure out how to create elements so I was writing raw HTML lol<div><br></div><div>Ask me if I left the house today on my nation's birthday. Really, not for my mom (because it's a hassle with the mask and all and I've got Anime to watch b*tch) (lol), and not even for the planes flying by ahead of me and the rest of my family who went out to take photos. Because you know, they like to see that stuff and I rather watch animation. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Ah, such is life, people. Still REALLY glad to live at this age me born like 50 years ago will never be able to execute on selfish freedom hehe let's start<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=GREATPRETENDER05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> GREAT PRETENDER</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I'll work alone for now" Yeah you will. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Man, how do you think Makoto is going to pull this off? Haha in this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER05) and also the conclusion to the first story arc, is Anime going to introduce us to drug addictions by showing us how it's done? I doubt they have the recipe too including the author but I don't know lol. Anyways, story. Firstly, the conclusion. Well, Makoto ended up having to make the drug in front of Cassano anyways, this time, not backed up by Laurent, but backed up by the FBI and Dickens herself. Well, gotta fake it to make it right? And of course, everything went to plan, Laurent and the Cassano family got swiped hard on the transaction by the FBI, and they all surrendered. Makoto was revealed to help the police, and the guys are in line for a jail sentence. That is, until, beware though, the plan took a turn. Firstly, Abbie retaliated by grabbing a gun. Then, Laurent defended her on the shooting, so they both got shot dead real good. Makoto, again, measuring his lengths for emotional confrontation, then decided that whatever the FBI did to harm his... friends? Yeah, friends. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> It was horrible, and he decided to take Dickens hostage to leave the factory. With Salazar, of course, for the sake of his son because Makoto. In a wretched attempt to escape, Cassano did the evil thing by pressurising one of the cookers in the drug factory and letting the place blow up into pieces, probably taking down the local police (remember Anderson?) in the process lol. And then comes the fun part: the interrogation. Yes, if you have anywhere suspected this already, then good for you because I did not. Please, I'm trying not to reveal the mystery. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Cassano did get caught, along with Salazar and Makoto who betrayed the lot of them lol, and got taken under Dickens. Surprisingly, Cassano did manage to bribe the police for his escape of this capture, amounting to a total of 100 million (USD of course) (from his Swiss account), and Pola Dickens walked away being a millionaire- Wait. Not the REAL Pola Dickens though; that bitch is like 60. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So, I guess I can tell the truth now, considering how far we have come. So turns out, even the FBI is fake. Remember we mentioned about how Laurent just uses one lie to cover for another? Yes, so the FBI thing is also part of his plan. Why? Probably because he knows of Anderson who works for Cassano, and that will make this "deal" work too well for them since they may not even leave the place alive, thought to cover his own butt by covering up Anderson's job, letting him follow the orders ofÂ  the "FBI" (lol) in order to control the outer situation that Cassano may have connections on. Checkmate, brother. So yes, the so-called "Pola Dickens" is a fake, going by the name of Cynthia (and boy she is HOT haha), and of course, is part of the board of... "confidence men" (which I will refer to as con artists from here, as in English subs) that Laurent is under. Assuming he is one of the top brass, and that he got away from this deal a lot more than what Makoto has gotten (though 5 to 10 million is impressive, but 5 to 105 is better haha yes even without Makoto jabbing in), so yeah, he has to work under him now. Man, is this rollercoaster ride exciting in every turn. I swear I only thought that Dickens might be a scam only when Makoto woke up at the beach, and thought those must be fake guns and blood. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Guess I'm as dumb as him then haha. Then, we talk about redemption. On Makoto's side of course; all the others don't give two shits lmao. So, ignoring the awesome heck of lives of Laurent's group (apparently comprising of many people around the world, which makes them real strong as an organisation), Makoto decided to tidy up his screwed up life before joining the ranks of the... screwed up people lmao, but yeah, he still has a mother, mind you. So yeah, he told Laurent he'll be back after a couple of years. In jail, if you didn't realise as he went to the nearest police station... in Japan to surrender for his (local) crimes. Why though? I guess it was for a clean slate. Also, for his own redemption, to be honest. I don't know. Makoto is such an emotional person in this world of scammers, he's so suited to be the main role because all main roles are PUSSIES!!! Haha cue the ending animation would you? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> All in all, man, fantastic series so far, and I think with this we can believe strongly that there is no other turns in the future plots, because Laurent's side is always going to emerge victorious. I just can't believe how that can work out in this arc until we know the FBI is faked lmao. Man, love this series now, and I can't wait to see what's up next after Makoto pays for his sins in a couple more years onto the next story arc. Yes, happy birthday Singapore, because you're next. Haha cya guys next week man if that arc started this week how great would that be<div><div> [Bear in mind that the lot are prepared to give up Salazar if not for Makoto wanting him alive because of his kid. Think about it.]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzGerEY54NAPM_83cDt5Bkus1UDusUSfBX5Oazpc8ooFnzjOuj0DEd9DA-CIjGloJyK_leu-yWWeJWPV-OA3K_Plzj-jW3HxcsBe0boOz8XUe5ZWqNBtGOlEAE1b3yoQjQOQgLk_4Z9AA/w320-h180/greatpretender05_cynthia1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Is Cynthia going to be hottest girl this series?

"He wanted green tea." "That's not the point" lol Abbie with the jokes</div><div>P.P.S. "It's so scary! My talent is so frightening" lmao Laurent that's me when I accidentally ace the exams<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=UzakiChan05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Dreams of falling from a height, for example, indicate deep-seated feelings of anxiety..." Hey that's me! I dream of those ALL the time lol not that much recently but as a kid</div></blockquote>When I hear Sakurai say "summer" I would expect Uzaki sweating like heck (lol) but I'll settle with a sleeveless shirt hey Mikakoshi set me up with this fetish now I'm loving it haha. In this new episode of (#UzakiChan05) whatever this summer game is that is not Uzaki Hills (lmao), wow f**k you Sakurai that cat just sent you off the building- Yeah he was dreaming. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> And yes, can confirm Sakurai's voice is perfect for psycho-ing the heck out of Uzaki if necessary. Hey, we got a new guy in town! Man, that's quite some content for just a slice-of-life show. But first, let's talk about dreams. Well, coincidentally the two are taking a lecture about dreams (I assume this is some cr*p course people take about psychology haha that's how you can see women in your school), and well, Sakurai dosed off I guess. And guess what, Uzaki caught him doing it. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Well, the rest of the stuff you can guess what happened, but suffice it to say... Uzaki is irritating. Again, alternate title for this series be "Uchi no Kanojo ga Uzasugiru!" lol okay she's not his <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kanojo target=_blank>girlfriend</a> yet let's not get too hasty about that hehe. Then, it's new character time! It's Sakurai's friend (yes, he has one lol) Sakaki (*gets serious Acchi Koacchi flashbacks*) who is a dude (lol) and is his buddy in college/university. But yeah, he doesn't know of his relationship with Uzaki-chan. Well, not yet anyways. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> He'll know soon enough haha. But yeah, they all did sit down a bit of a talk, and unlike the two in the cafe that want the couple to be purely doing sparks on themselves, Sakaki wants to help his buddy get laid. I guess so, right? Or else why the obvious boy-girl relationship here the author has to come up with something lmao. So yeah, just like Sakurai's parents probably, Sakaki asks on their relationship progress so bad they decided to leave. Really man, and guess who came in with the interjection haha Ami-chan. So yeah I hope you realised it already Sakaki, but stop ruining sh*t for those two they need to maintain a pure relationship so we can see through it to the end haha Ami-chan "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0UV0mdJLRw" target=_blank>She knows</a>" lmao. (sorry gotta make that VELTPUNCH reference) Yeah, we don't need ideas too just leave them alone and the magic will happen. Really, gotta see it to believe it, those two. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> *raises new glasses* (Man, they keep falling off lol, my glasses) (Also, isn't sadist Ayachi actually <em>really good</em> hehe I feel bad[?] for <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuki_Kaji target=_blank>the husband</a> lmao) Lastly, they are talking about my life goals here, so I guess I should talk about it too. No, not about choco-mint; that shit tastes like toothpaste. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (Best joke of the episode btw) Okay jokes aside before Uzaki-chan beats me up, but she is mostly right about that flavour anyways, and that of course, toothpaste mint came from mint flavoured food. Really, actual toothpaste tastes like... well I've never tasted that before I brush my teeth with it I don't eat it <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> But yes, the main point, is to not mock on other people's interests even if it doesn't interest you. Sadly this is part and parcel of living with a plethora of options now to choose from unlike our ancestors who probably can only read books all day if they can even read it or watch the same TV channel, but now as we speak I'm doing something that NO ONE will do as an interest so... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span> Yeah, so Sakurai, hurry up and say sorry so Uzaki doesn't have to start a speech about choco-mint's history lmao what is with the applause. To make things worse, she got Sakurai to try it. Uzaki is basically digging a grave for yourself, because that's not how you protect stuff you like, by the way. Oh well, all's well in the days of these two, isn't it? Sakurai didn't say he hated it though despite hating it as a kid, but hey, I assume he doesn't want to hear another speech so to not offend her? Man, people can be so nice sometimes. And also dumb, because I think they just did an indirect kiss... well it's just the one stick it's not even close lol. Anyways, great episode by the way, I can see the complications on the perspectives upon the relationship on the main two, so that's going to be fun to... watch haha I'm like Ami-chan now</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkTXRkZynHzDWEgso1nCjPkN6TALlK2v2iuY-zuxHYXQTHUSBpaMTxQJa50lEUOlUl3ualPQD8ypPDpZXz1CyKusWbRK1nqg2jtPKc29T4oI7vkhPMTHoIrJmhRmc7x18fgmGKZddxrWE/w320-h180/uzakichan05_kusocat1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That's me with anxiety as a cat falling off- Wait. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUZyof_NR0k0CuSQzKL1A9mTWPxWHkJ3HDnMVvfu8gasEpnMIxHdnfp99PQB_c2ZpC3BCUz7dH1-jWECmwUvtUgGjxzOTO-xOJdr30X8NU_1YoYBjw7pMsLpD8Mi-uHkNkS20jD3R_IqM/w320-h180/uzakichan05_uzakitower.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>lol the Uzaki Tower is very similar to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tokyo+big+sight" target=_blank>the place where they hold Comiket</a> btw<br></table></div></div>P.S.

"I prefer a more stylish approach to drinking alcohol" Wow what might that be? "In the end, sober me is left to clean up the mess" Ah, the guy has super high alcohol tolerance haha that will suck every time on a drinking party I'm sure</div><div>[Yep, I laughed at the "choco mint is toothpaste" joke hard lol joke of the episode]<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanoKari05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Kanojo, Okarishimasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I guess real life isn't as easy as movies or drama" Yeah you have to physically work for EVERYTHING Kazuya I hope you've learnt that</div></blockquote>Well, it's to save her, right? After all that she's done for us? Besides whatever is charged for as rental girlfriend? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Again, Kazuya can be a man sometimes; I personally won't jump to save Chizuru though...? Ask me again if I would if Ten-chan <em>was</em>Â mine haha no really. Also, Kazuya's dead. We're only at (#KanoKari05) this far by the way we're done already? lol of course not he can't die yet. And because everyone learnt CPR in school... okay I did but I'll never use it in any emergency besides my country is filled with AEDs but I still have to do the air intake I guess... anyways, yeah, the two are fine. Kazuya managed to scoop from the deaths of the sea to save Chizuru, and <strike>in return for the gratefulness she kissed him</strike> seeing Kazuya unconscious Chizuru put her life-saving skills to use. That's all. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I guess what both of them are doing are unsafe to some extent (not the kissing part though) so they got scolded by the adults (even though they are already) (FYI that is jumping off a ship, and man overboard when ill) and the guy's friends for some reason (Kibe-san just shut up haha) and I would argue it was kind of hard to watch how this went, but at least all of them are fine. What's hardest to watch has yet to come, because after Kazuya went home and saw so many swimsuit photos of his beloved (ex) Mami-chan (haha) I guess he gotta do it immediately? Like seriously, besides on the largest load (cum joke) of ecchi scenes (screenshots) we've gotten so far, it's probably done also to show Kazuya's conflict of liking women at this point, I suppose. Yes, straight on perv level haha. It's more crude than just thinking about it (he did afterwards but not much as his load lol), but hey, someone placed tissues by the side so why not? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Again, a reminder that Kazuya is not your usual horny boy he's above that haha. Probably also the reason why he'll eventually find another rental girlfriend to forget about this one- ANYWAYS!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (But seriously though where is Ruka-chan haha we're almost halfway through this series and I want her NOW lol) (ooo next episode preview though!!) Then, there's another trip. Yeah, you thought summer vacation was over. Cue part 2, starring the grandmothers because they have discharged from hospital as heard from last episode, with Kazuya still NOT having told her gramps about the breakup, ended up in the same room with her because you know, the two elders set them up on it. Hey, normally I would be glad about this (I mean, Kazuya did become happy after seeing yukata Chizuru YOU SICK FUCK haha) considering it's just <a href=https://jisho.org/search/futarikiri target=_blank>futarikiri</a> situation here, but Kazuya still sort of did the manly thing by behaving himself... for as long as his dong can hold on lol. Chizuru's enjoying the heck out of this though so whatever haha. Ignoring the real two alone time of Chiruzu and Kazuya's grandmother, and the fact that the breakup hasn't been mentioned not even remotely close, I guess we'll only get to see that next week, for hopefully, we'll get an "ending" to this relationship thing... we shall see. And then we go to Ruka-chan haha why does Kazuya never learn his lesson you know this shit's not cheap right? But then again it's him being a normie so whatever haha I'm not even close to his level thank goodness lol.Â </div><div>[TL:DR; Chizuru will do anything for money (including CPR) because she never has enough of it haha like really if it's me I let Kazuya die and kick him out of the room lol]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEic9CgC1Xy3vlQsJT9R-CVTGt0ttXPK_QS5VGV5cO6hXeRVswozm9vjbf1FhuGduO5AhZv-zmMGd-5Gd46O74j1VoRe5g9_98hRni_FvHHemxW6H8r7YMWbquWJLgsmVLcxA47KX3ClSqo/w320-h180/kanokari05_chizuru7.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Okay I have to admit this might be the cutest <strike>Ten-chan</strike> Chizuru has ever been<br><span class=skip-section>(Ten-chan cosplay please hehe)</span><br></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeG5mkPNb-tSGkkxCIY-AgRkrYjbvedlsWxLw70K6Wn6nKGWzMT-_6tO1iC7BJupkpAWOAyzWSLTAuJgCJprYdCCJ6PkijtbY_liIQDn6Dqs3qhsqNmPntTsac31HDWW3-Pp4vVw7Zf0Q/w320-h180/kanokari05_mami5.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How much porn have you watched, Kazuya, to be able to jerk off to this? lol TMI from me<br></table></div></div>P.S.

I think they are pretty representative of their style now so be sure to listen to them on YouTube. Other than that I think I did give one new song from the list which is just reminding me of how I like song titles that are so long I need to increase the length limit on my Klassic Note database so I can store those values lol you don't need to understand that tbh haha</div><br>On news concerning music that is on Twitter because where else you go to get news now, thanks to NakiNeko theme song artist yorushika's retweet I now know <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new album is releasing end of September</b> which is pretty hype I can't wait to give Mia-san songs again, <b>VELTPUNCH liked 3 out of 3 tweets I mentioned about their album</b> this week though I'm pretty sure they don't English lol, and <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</b> is... I mean, if you like the animation and not like the song that much I can understand haha it's not that bad though<br><br>So for next week and I think we are picking up momentum because of all the announcements over the past month, we're giving <b>Anime "Uzaki-chan" ending theme song</b> single because there isn't a slated physical release date so I'll give the one first, and <b>vivid undress' new mini-album</b> since they went major last year December. The latter though... I didn't give the topic song though so first impressions aren't great so we shall see for the rest of the release then dear guys don't disappoint me. Oh, and <b>FLOWER FLOWER's new single</b> if I have the time haha okay I need to give yui more credit she has been an undying veteran in Klassic Note already despite the image change</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br>Okay I'm done. It's like that every Sunday where you know you're done watching Anime for the week and writing my thoughts all on this post, and then you're tired of doing the music part of this post already haha or maybe it's because of the fireworks festival in Animal Crossing: New Horizons now lol. Cya guys next time then, I'm going to enjoy another public holiday tomorrow before going back to work so I can get over the OT I burned yesterday haha sadded. Anyways, until next time... I hope the next package is arriving soon. Yes, talking about the magazine and Inorin's single... and Earphones' single. Yes, I think I talked about that, so I ended up giving it. The physical edition has like radio show elements though? So I'm giving an exception to that for Klassic Note Review I'm not going to review a bunch of girls talking at double speed anyways lol and I can't even understand half of it. And with the recent shipping... result analysis, I've managed to get the "pre-order bonus" bromide even though the single has been released almost a year ago so... yay Marinka!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So good, totally worth buying it from a different store and actually missing it like, two days after I confirmed the other one. Yes, it was that close. Yes, I found out I can review the Earphones one when I checked the lyrics and it pointed me to the single and not the album. Ok, too much talk that I should've put it above we'll talk more on actual review haha bye</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I'll just give the one Light Palette album topic song ie. the music video and pray I'll get to hear it in the near (or far) future in full this is the best song in the list from the album preview anyways lol</div></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text Â© 2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
