Just a head's up, I'm not attached yet, so no plans at all, from Friday to the weekend. Or else, how do you think I have time to watch Anime? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I want to stop shitting on myself but I can't I need to feel the burn that is the flirting of others on other people who are not me haha <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span><br><br> On the other hand, I'm having good luck on getting laid (lol) in the THREE girl games I'm playing thus far haha that's the problem I guess. Aside from getting anything from event gacha in DOAXVV (but even then I've been getting SSRs daily) I've gotten good streak from Alternative Girls (couple a love song with the new event characters, it's perfect) and Kirara Phantasia (Koufuku Graffiti joins the publisher based RPG) which I've lovingly posted in my Twitter profile in Japanese so be sure to share those or otherwise you'll have bad luck on romance all year around- Isn't that how they jinx you on your Facebook wall now? Haha just trying to get more likes lol let's start<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=HatenaIllusion06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Hatena Illusion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"No, she (Ema-san) tried to forcibly undress me" Well well maybe that'll be a good omake episode haha just joking Yumemi</div></blockquote>I think I just realised something: There might not be any more action in this series because the author may not have lived long enough to write them. RIP author, by the way; it's still a good story otherwise I wouldn't be here. But in this new episode of family issues lol (#HatenaIllusion06), we... okay there is some action haha is it though? I feel like I've been watching a porno this week lmao okay let's talk story first. Remember last week Mariah-san talked to Hatena over the mirror INSIDE of the mansion? Hey, you still don't think your <strike>aunt</strike> mother's sister is not evil? Anyways, that gullible girl met up with the woman, and she told the girl that the one in the gallery we have seen a couple of episodes ago is a real thing. Even though that's all the information we got, Mariah wanted Hatena to retrieve it for her, but the girl didn't even question the validity of this mission. I mean, it could all be a trap, girl, why would you promise such a thing like that? And so she did it (ugh), because apparently she thinks the mother won't be coming back for the time being and wants her back earlier?? Oh you dumb b*tch REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN EPISODE THREE??? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> I can't even trust Jeeves now and you can trust Mariah? Good on you, Hatena. Anyways, ignoring middle schooler common sense lol, she went to scout with the other middle schoolers in the gallery and thinking that no one will notice them in such a disguise, but yeah, didn't take much for the fat b*tch (haha, okay I'll call her by name) to know of her presence, and you know, ambush her the night someone wants to come steal her Artifact... okay, we'll talk about how it's actually hers later, but first, Yumemi. She still doesn't want to go to school, and in an effort to learn how to control her powers, Ema-san has witnessed a couple of things that would not have happened to this <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hikikomori target=_blank>hikikomori</a> if not for Makoto, that is to go bath willingly, and go outside of the house. Yeah, that's me in a nutshell lol. But it's also because they went to the nearby temple to meditate and learn to control her powers that the two met the other kids, who of course, told them about Hatena's not plans because we don't need to know them to know that Hatena is dumb enough to do this stuff alone. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Again, no prior training from the mother, as far as we know. Hatena is a real life risk taker, this girl. Haha anyways, Hatena gets caught, and it's not because she can't fight a fat bi- Okay, Tominozawa. It's not just because Tominozawa is powerful, but hey, it's a trap. What can I say? So yeah, there's a lot of suggestive content in this haha, but suffice it to say, she owns that one Artifact somehow (probably learnt it from the family itself, whoever taught her it), and manages to capture Hatena with it, forcing her to hand over Muff-kun to her or else she would likely die of a heat stroke haha I thought that was an army thing. I mean, surprisingly for a 12-year-old Hatena can last this long before the others can prepare for an infiltration with somehow Yumemi coming along for the ride for the first time, and disabling Tominozawa off control of her Artifact within seconds, thanks to Makoto, of course. That's it, actually. Things to talk about probably are why (1) this is likely going to be family related problems for a good amount of time because we still technically let Mariah go because she thought this will be a good test for a kid who doesn't even know how to plan for a heist like her mother lol, (2) how straightforward the action is in this series which is passable to say the least, and last but not least (3) what Ema-san is wearing that is actually an Artifact which will explain how she can be so physically formidable up till now. Hey, learning new stuff from this series every week, as they say. What's for next week though? Well, at least we'll get to see Yumemi at school with underwear haha why make these jokes<br> [Okay we can't really show the porno part lol so here are some cleaner ones haha]<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9oKdIz0YdA1OlxZ3fPoOw_Uz5Ma1xPEqgcv5Ca23wE3PeVf_aMcPGZB60loYz2ztOn7r8V_kry2tX91e_6JgznEkhGFdUPwi1vT8WC24h98eE2ws6X4XWRKODrMDq0fVhATLbYifk7Gc/s320/hatenaillusion06_ema1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW they say they gonna tie her up and make her hot haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioWWFGgXdloFA8DUGBZUovZ-H0JwPG-8oq8hACCcB2_crNfIyeHExR9H3B6sRjkWboBXPE8iNNs1SLY1YwHzuUTbRfnMkM968Na_NX8daD4s2Z1w8zgJFTzSL60cr1xTrimRR0_loOcHI/s320/hatenaillusion06_yumemi4.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Again, I need a Yumemi superhero side story series real bad Anime production do something about this</table></div></div>P.S.

And then inside it's just all the lewd things he did in school? Ooo boy this gonna be a good episode haha</div></blockquote>Haha I like how the future for Yashiro is till "we're not going out together because your legs are too fat" lol hey you gotta slim those legs down girl otherwise no guys will want you. In this surreal episode (#HanakoKun06) we venture into the 4PM library, as I would like to call it differently from the subtitles because those things are dumb haha then why am I watching it. Anyways, we did more than venture into another apparition's world, so let's talk all about it. Firstly, it was peaceful. Yashiro just decided to go into the library at four with Minamoto because she's worried about going alone also Minamoto could learn a thing or two of Hanako's weakness haha, but yeah, they went in without much trouble. Yashiro accidentally read a red page of the book which I assume all futures should be red since one shouldn't be knowing of the futures of anyone even themselves, so... well it wasn't that interesting anyway for Yashiro haha. (Although I would argue besides knowing of Seven Wonders that first date though we gotta see in this adaptation hehe I just want to see it) The monster in the world which came in and looked like the person in whichever book you read appeared but was quickly dealt with by Hanako since... he knows the Fifth Wonder of the school. I mean, he knows all seven of them including himself but yeah, took a while for introductions haha. And so they gathered because Hanako believes someone is behind all this rumour spreading and making things up for their own benefit, so he as the boss decides to disband the Seven Wonders so we can know who's the culprit. I mean, it's literally anyone who doesn't cooperate haha. So, that's the peaceful part, unless you want to count the embarrassing stuff the trio mentioned which... okay Yashiro wins haha and she scored a 3 btw the others are not even graded lol. Next, is the story in general not including Hanako's story. Basically what Hanako has described, but he dictates who gets to live in this school as an apparition, I assume. And to that, he probably should know about the other Wonders in the school, including the culprit who has somehow, also recruited a human assistant to falsify some rumours to their advantage? Haha this one we will not know for now. And the best thing is it... might be a splitting image of Hanako himself. Not going to question this further considering we don't know much yet (getting yin yang deja vu here though), so let's talk about what we actually know now we're halfway through the series, is Hanako's past. Since the youkai in question this week is an actual teacher in school, and we kind of have to destroy that Yorishiro thing which I would just argue is like an appointment letter for being a Wonder in this premises lol, the teacher chose to only let Yashiro do the job of destroying it. Why? And how Hanako-kun would have accepted this conciliatory request without much objection? Well first, it was peaceful, mind you. Probably because they know each other. Then, it's the story behind the Yorishiro, because whoever destroyed it has to watch all of it, just like that fox one from two weeks ago. So you think the sensei is going to let his boss (not true, but yeah) see all his secrets?? Haha, read on for answers, by the way. Story goes... major spoiler alert from here on because it's about time, it was when Hanako was alive. Back then, he was a student. Obvious enough, but he was the teacher's student. So you can kind of guess how old this story might be already. And as shared by the teacher... he knew all about the kid. This one might have lacked a lot of explaining, because how would anyone have access to such foretelling books is in the first place itself a mystery, but suffice it to say, he knew about Hanako. All the way. Yahsiro wished she knew that much about him. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Well, they know about the donuts thing so I guess there was development haha. Anyways, story goes that it was around the time of the moon landing, and Hanako somehow got his hands on a moon stone from the orbiting satellite itself? Highly unlikely story, but this kid the teacher taught had plans for the future. He was obsessed with science and astronomy, and probably would be a teacher himself teaching at this very school in the future which is now. But... You know. I mean, you should've noticed, he's dead. So... how? What happened? The teacher may have told us the origins, but left us with the empty space in between as he tells the story to complete Yashiro's thoughts after seeing the Yorishiro. Hmm... I don't know what to make of it either, because seriously? We still don't know much. From the start and specifically from Minamoto, we only know he was a murderer, and he killed someone (probably heard this from the brother), and thus his weapon as a knife. And we now know that his future has been changed by the sensei at some point, to shorten his life. That's all we know though, by the way. I guess we will know sooner or later, since the future episodes are probably going to be narrowing down the suspects and getting to that girl who chatted up to Yashiro last episode at some point. What might be their impending fate though? From what we have seen so far? It might not be pretty. No really, Hanako's past is for sure, not a happy one. Hey, at least Yashiro is cute amirite?? Haha I'll take sex jokes too lol bye<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjx_Umoaj_aQ-OI5P_Wusko1YT4dcKBPWtZL2VrfUO3keoWSXgxQu4AD2bSrSnkXm00q-LljrO2m6YKMagfAysGiUom0Cea4pg9AkqRyB2cmlZeCyxkdBpWNIclzFeOqpITc1uMEPh2lgk/s320/hanakokun06_hug.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Find yourself someone who can hug you like how Hanako hugs Yashiro haha happy Valentine's Day</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4D_pqzsKTdgfyg6rUX3bLCxl9HVa1n1rN7fbAVj9WOLpSCN1TwEkW4lRyPr7XMUwxUTKubGBzc8ttE70R2yDHRuOoYksiCmIb7nwkaDoxg35foGVbwbyhHu7A4e_M51hjS8fb1JEo1K8/s320/hanakokun06_peek.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW there's has a ladder holding scene and I can't look lmao</table></div></div>P.S.

Really, everything that did not make sense slowly making sense... I want to see this replace that as the best build-up to an origin story haha]<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=RikeKoi06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"When people are in the dark, they start thinking of naughty things-" Remind me to not be in the dark with anyone else besides myself haha</div></blockquote>"I thought you loved me!" Yeah not when you're measuring whatever angle we're kissing at!! In this "hurry up and kiss already" episode (#RikeKoi06) which I've said probably since episode 1 lol, we finally get back on track to watching episodes in sequence haha. That, and kissing. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Yeah, it's going to be a whole episode on kissing, so I hope you're ready for... scientific analysis!! Yes, what do you think this show was, your usual romance Anime?? Hah, we don't need <a href=https://jisho.org/search/riajuu target=_blank>riajuu</a> here lol. Anyways, analysis first. (Somehow this sounds like my job but I'm only doing programming which is a joke compared to this haha) Yukimura and Himuro gotta determine how to kiss, because some Ibarada decided they should do it. So, this is going to be theory heavy, so I'm going to skip all that, because besides having the most exciting episode on the line thus far, this... this might be the most equation heavy episode we have seen yet thanks Kuma for going through these with us is this what it feels like to learn math with Mocho?? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, the five criteria for mood for kissing in terms of location can be summarised by inverted charts and what we call... I need to dig up my textbooks to remember this, where you have to chart based on conditions (Edit: Piecewise functions), and of course through knowledge of graphing equations will get you the stuff that these scientists are real good that, but that's just on the surface. Since we're talking about kissing, we also should talk about the quality of the kiss? I guess not since most of them can't do it on the lips (I mean), but even then, we'll need a control of kissing someone who is not Himuro so then Yukimura just go kiss a slut- Okay no one will do this with this nerd lol. Even so, they had to do experiments between themselves as unwilling as they are, and... I think we got most of the 15 pairs to do this experiment as we mentioned from last episode lol okay maybe not the sensei, so lesser. Many are dumb, some are weird, some are breaking the fourth wall saying Ikeda lab is weird lol, some may have people like Ibarada looking at the couple from the nearby stairs haha yes she probably was there when it's Kousuke vs Yukimura, and some are heartbeat racing like how Ibarada and Yukimura ran around the rooftop for 5 minutes haha. And then, we reached the end. If you are expecting a perfect ending then this would be the last episode already haha. Of course we're going to talk about the last one in a more detailed manner, yes? So, Yukimura is at the location, Himuro walks in, they get to stare at each other for a <em>generous</em> 30 seconds lol, the sunset is beautiful, the place is quiet without anyone interfering them... IT'S TIME TO KISS BABY!! Happy Valentine's Day, by the way. Haha I gotta get over this joke because... they didn't get it. That mood value all went crashing down which we hoped that helicopter flying above them would too (lol no jinxing in this blog please), pretty much going against all they have set up for, but in the end, Himuro got desperate. I mean, if I had someone who I want to kiss with and has been playing around for weeks you think I'll care if the building staff and my lab mates AND my lab professor is looking?? Okay, Yukimura kind of cares, so he end up just kissing her hair. Cheh, boring. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay I gotta admit the end quote from Yukimura is as cool as he will get haha "I'll kiss you with the highest mood value" that might be too cool even for him lmao. The results? I mean, and that's why you shouldn't test heartbeat rates only remember when two people were running around the rooftop? Haha let's get drunk next week<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUG5P8NxmHSHn1FqZdsML5ht2QlsaR-YYg9r-sMm4F9nqHhUK4PM41DqSTi7ln-kQrt0DDnAwY6YSt_nbb73ndIaLf4De7qLMYEir42PpAx13mi5SNH1U6DahCX7LAobgKxcQD6iuWteg/s320/rikekoi06_couple3.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yeah sure Ibarada I'll kiss you I have no one to spend with on Valentine's anyway haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRdhYVvT-I9aE6CK5XAPMWwR0FO4DovMsCx562INRWsOGGRjGl5cekGQs7-kbD72a9qIyCQhMcBSDoNwhXvhnfDtR8D2Hive7l7HjL-t0RKGdipGMJAraS57xAMeQ9MvDpAYc1H6nrmQs/s320/rikekoi06_crowd.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is the point where you will do it though, on the cheek only though probably</table></div></div>P.S.

Man, this is literally episode 2 all over again, huh. An adequate title for this series though, I would admit. So, to clarify what we have been talking thus far. Let's talk about what we are NOT going to do to resolve this crisis of Steel Lady Nanase. Firstly, we are NOT going to close the wiki page. No, it will never work. Doing it will only trigger a circle of influence that will probably go against the government or police on, in this case, the entertainment industry, so it will never work. Second, we are NOT going to just override the forums with another rumour to belittle Nanase's rumour which is currently making her strong as heck to the extent of being immortal. Since people can believe whatever they want, it will be hard to talk about what is right, and even if it stems from the truth it will not be able to work as convincingly as like, a media scoop where things are exaggerated and click baits are made so websites can earn some shit level ad money lol #RealityCheck for a bit haha. Lastly, we are NOT going to just come up with a story and hope that it works. Even if it's the most convincing story out there, as Saki-san said, it might not be able to move people around that easily. And in contrast if people still fall back on the Nanase rumour of her ghost being around, then we are going to be even more screwed by that point. So, according to Kotoko-chan since Saki-san can't really do much besides providing investigation information from the police, we are going to come up with a rumour to show the other side of Nanase's death which is accidental death bordering suicide, and then make the rumour believable by making something happen. You might wonder how that "make something happen" phase can work, and that's why we have Kuro-san. Remember he ate some weird kudan meat and can predict the future? He's like "I'm going to die for you any amount of times" to get rid of Nanase haha that's literally a quote from him lol if you need a Valentine's Day quote there you go lmao. As sad as it sounds, it's also not that easy. Not only because you can die from doing it, but the doing process is rough. Instead of picking an ending or seeing one of the endings happen in typical foretelling powers (I assume), a kudan (in this series) actually chooses one and condenses it by removing all the other possibilities of futures available. So, one can say "you'll get a good harvest this year" and get rid of all the other ones like "there's a flood" or "yield is low" or whatever in between. By saying that, of course, one has to die for it. Since Kuro-san is kind of a mixed breed, his "prediction" is not absolute, and he can't choose just any, but just the most likely one. So yeah, observer's perspective, I guess. Even so, that'll make making a rumour happen a lot easier as long as we stay close to the future as viewed by Kuro-san. Even then, it'll take a lot of effort to even let Kuro-san make that likely ending a reality, because he how has to condense the endings together into one confirmed outcome. As fun as this sounds, seems like the hard part if still thinking of a good enough rumour for people - especially the ones from the forums - to believe. That, and no wonder Kotoko-chan is the God of Wisdom. I mean, she managed to convince the one serpent God to believe her story about the one murder and corpse thrown in to the river, so... I guess she's smart haha hey she got that university acceptance though. (The serpent was scared of Kuro-san, we know that already haha but) What will happen next, we don't know. But we know that this will have to happen faster than ever because... we got our first victim, guys. (Not coronavirus joke) So that's going to be a problem. Aw man RIP Tereda you will be missed haha man have I gotten bored of deaths since I've seen a couple dozen of them in Anime "Babylon" lol but still. Cya guys next week<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjD8n00Pt2Qi1uvkbccw-TNQNHNxFB-IptZ_Aq5JrxA3T-1PhlRvJI0PpTVhkVZ6bgtc6V-qhbsOCmfoCc1tWgKB2B1EA63of-DRSfnIEH9sAAUZu0eijlZViG0B6TXr_oyWgcngwCC2BI/s320/kyokousuiri06_kotoko4.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>lol wtf is this some <a href=https://jisho.org/search/mahoushoujo target=_blank>mahou shoujo</a> Anime??</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjESyn5i-jl7bWHXo7W1hPDs1ALfDH-cX7I_XdLHDbl0uN9HsAZZn-GslxNA5oWFy_iKn4l-JgKsw1S2_34_lKsDxlStteXnYEhPtzvq8XyXKrZLNsxbmRT5TtwSHHlD2nm2cIkl5Q40aI/s320/kyokousuiri06_ghost.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW my dad sneaks around my room lol he's not dead yet touch wood haha</table></div></div>P.S.

RIP btw]<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week was quite a week in Klassic Note, so let's talk about it. <b>SCANDAL's new album</b> is not going to restore my already weak confidence in their music, but then again the many topic songs they had over the past few years aren't bad, so I decided to give as many as I can. Again, I'm still into the J-Rock part of them; the Pop part I'm not too keen. I guess this is the "I just need to like one of your many styles to give you" kind of judgement then. <b>yucat's latest mini-album</b> released last year is... passable at best, as I can't identify with any refreshing styles and/or melodies from the release itself besides hearing steampunk style music, and that might get boring if she goes on this direction. I remember Dr.Code so well, and that is just LIT haha. <b>SpecialThanks are back</b> after keeping quiet for some time with a slew of monthly new songs (still going on this month, for Valentine's), and hopefully we'll reach a new album that I can give formally. After some time, I decided to give <b>Miyano Mamoru's new single</b> a chance hoping to give male idolism a chance in Klassic Note... those Kuroshitsuji character songs featuring Ono Daisuke were better haha. And yes, if you haven't noticed, Nu-chan wasn't mentioned here, so that will be reviewed next week.<br><br> Talking about next week which is in my opinion, THE BEST WEEK mainly because my birthday is right smack on release day, we're still giving indie band <b>Humbreader's 1st album</b> a listen consdering I can give at least one song which I heard last month, <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</b> for Anime is already winning whatever is mentioned in this paragraph, and <b>yanaginagi's new single</b> is going to be for obligation purposes considering from the preview it isn't great. Not even for an emotional song. And yes, <b>Numakura Manami's best album</b> will be reviewed to give her last chance of leaving more of an impression on Klassic Note. Music subscription services did not help her appear on time so I can give this last week, to be honest. I think this delay will continue to happen, hopefully not as bad as Aimer's because her's is only releasing the latest release on a new release. Yeah, I found that out somehow.<br><br> In the news from the Internet Twitter and beyond, <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES revealed their new album details</b> including a new topic song music video which is dope I guess, <b>FLOWER FLOWER is releasing a new album</b> due March with a new music video preview I can't get into somehow, and <b>nano.RIPE is going to release a new single</b> for Anime "Shokugeki no Souma" once again since last year which I'll probably not listen somehow. Man, the future is bleak haha we know the topic songs are a farce to the awesome songs inside those releases. Come on, ask my B-side Survey for evidence that topic songs don't matter. Music videos are a distraction man I wished I wrote that post I've reserved for this for weeks to prove my point.<br><br><br><br><br> Okay we are done. Still thinking of whether to write that survey down from Kitou Akari's 1st photobook, but I'll probably not do so due to my lack of confidence in... everything. I mean, I know the stamp is cheap probably a few bucks, but I rather treat myself to a cup of Starbucks just joking Akarin you come to Singapore I'll treat you to some bubble tea haha go see my review again to see cleavage hehe. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I should find some time to do the stuff I want. They don't earn money but I can make myself happy doing things I want on my day. Until next time, I guess. Maybe I should continue writing APoL before I die of the new coronavirus haha bye<br><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text Â© 2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
