Or maybe not, whatever. I'm kinda burned out man. Maybe it's because of the "lockdown", maybe it's because I haven't had a work break for some time, probably since my birthday I think. So yeah, sub 3 months already? Last year I took a break at this time of the year but with the stay at home stuff? Suddenly that is unnecessary. Maybe I should start applying for a break next month when all goes back to normal. Well, as normal as society can be.<br><br> Let's Anime then, I guess. Not that I'm not interested in the drama, but I'm just too excited for stuff I'm too lazy to do. That or I'm still anticipating a HUGE package coming to me at some point next month. Not going to talk about it too much, but I think I need to prepare the upcoming blog post for it so I don't have to burn another weekend to write it haha let's start<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Kakushigoto07><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kakushigoto</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I'll only live for about ten years, so please stay by my side as much as you can" Aw... and in case you don't know what that is, it's not the mother haha *sees Kakushi cry* Uh oh.</div></blockquote>"When walking a dog, people usually only look at the dog" Yeah that's actually true one time my colleagues and I were out for lunch and a hunk came in with a dog and it's literally all the girls swarming up to... the dog. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah, I don't know if we can call this bliss or not even getting a dog (that I'm potentially allergic to) can get me laid lmao. In this new episode (#Kakushigoto07) we.. are getting a lot of plot development. This Anime is serious, it seems. And I might be getting more lore to this story then I may have expected. I'm getting scared. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, this week is all about getting a pet. Specifically, a pet dog. I have been recently examined (a year ago?) to be slightly allergic to dogs (and none to cats), but even then I do not have any luxury to have one. Well, because I'm the pet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Uh, I mean, I have an elder sister. This might be a bad analogy so... okay, to Hime-chan. She wants a dog.The father feels stressed in getting one not really because that he doesn't want the daughter to have it, but then realises that she wants one mainly because she might be lonely. Yeah, that "missing a companion at home" thing is hitting her already. And as Kakushi looks around for opinions of others around his life other than Hime, from Ichiko-sensei who has one to the assistants who want one in the office (lol), to whoever sent that piano over ugh (haha), everyone has an opinion to give. On the other hand, Hime-chan starts to think that whether having this "burden" on this single-parent family is a good thing or not. The point is that Hime-chan is such an understanding kid at her age, all of this doesn't matter. It's not because she lost her mom; it's not because that she doesn't mind about being alone. It's because she knows. She knows it'll only be a burden to others, all this time. This is the kind of kids you want to have by the way, parents out there. Anyways, the dad in the end did decide to get her one after all, amongst all expectations, but the one on the poster has already been fulfilled so... the father-in-law gives a hand. So, more family lore, and thanks to Keshi-kun for bringing that piece of artwork into the workplace, we now know that that man in the limo is likely Hime-chan's grandfather, and is himself a professional artist (considering Kakushi's as a manga artist isn't professional) (whatever dude like I buy your paintings but I buy manga though), is probably saddened by the passing of his own daughter, and feels that the granddaughter will feel the same for her own childhood. And thus, most likely, the accidental gifts that have been appearing on their doorstep. I think we know why Kakushi chose independence over reliance of the wife's family, but it seems the connection can never be cut off, as we have mentioned before. Nonetheless, Hime-chan's cooking as a kid is getting better, and with a cut back to reality... Hime has been followed lol. At the end of the episode, now I guess bijin-level Ichiko-sensei who followed the "detective squad" who are following Hime-chan (lol), reveals to them (and maybe Hime) good and bad news. What are they though? I sure hope it's not the mother coming back to life haha hey we don't even know if she's dead or not. Remember: Hime-chan has not yet burst into tears as a kid. Not yet. I'm getting worried I might be getting a lot of jokes but a lot more lore down the road, and that might be a good thing.

But seeing the pandemic out there, I'm glad I still am.</div></blockquote>You know your girl's pissed when she can order her portion AND yours plus half the people in the restaurant haha Haru-chan don't eat too much you'll get fat also you guys aren't together yet so chill. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte07) I think we may be getting another Rou-kun episode here. I don't really like people who look like me so... I'm glad he isn't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, maybe, but it seems like a tie-back to Shinako which we have been waiting for. So, about Rou-kun first. So, Rou talks about how wild he is and doesn't really like to be in situ forever especially with relationships I guess, and especially with childhood friend Shinako. We know that he already has feelings for the woman who took care of the brother until he passed away, still can't get over the brother after all these years. Hey, before we carry on? I would like to argue for Shinako's case that she is a mentally weak person, that she really cannot get over the brother after all these years. This, I think we may have seen enough of it all these weeks and also this episode to understand that. But considering we know how Rou-kun and Shinako think... Rou-kun where's your respect for the elderly? Haha Kana-chan I'm so sorry I just wanted to make a joke, sorry. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But really, Rou has his selfishness tucked into his wild personality, and that is making people around him uneasy, considering Shinako is in a different age gap AND thinks differently from him. His aggressiveness would've worked well on Rikuo (we will talk about that later haha I can't wait), but for Shinako... I would say he has made the wrong move. I wouldn't say is that he was late, but she isn't interested in you. For her to put down the fact of a dead person whom she loved, she has to forget about you. You cannot repeat history to make it worse for her, man. To know whether Rou-kun screwed this up already, I can confidently tell you he did because he said "I'll protect you in my brother's place" because in case you haven't realised then, you are NOT the brother. You screwed up bro; you're not getting anything out of this right now, I can tell you. And I SWEAR if Shinako appeared in front of Rikuo's place to not talk to him about things but it's to confess, I'll be even more darned for a roller coaster ride. Thank goodness from the author, we know this series isn't so direct of a case. Phew, got me worried for a moment haha. But secretly we know, dear author, secretly we know it's going to happen. I think I better say it here first, but whoever Shinako confesses to first will be dealbreaker to the relationship hogs we have here so far. <strike>We shall see if I'm correct in the next few episodes haha I said it here first.</strike> Well, turns out, spoiler alert, that we don't have to wait for next episode. And because we know Shinako does have feelings for Rikuo, and he has been a great listening ear thus far (I mean he is, and so am I) (haha I take pride in this btw), Shinako finally decides to take action after not being pushed for so long and realising no one will. (Basically my life in a nutshell) Oh boy, would this change things up. See, Rikuo? Changing your career path ain't all too bad after all. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> To end this, I swear I stared at how Shinako was staring at Rou-kun's arms for the longest time ever, and I paused to realise that she's probably thinking about the brother. Ah... AH!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This show is deep, in many ways than other. Let's see how deep this rabbit hole we can do, we're only halfway through this. But I believe, we might be just getting started. I dig this ship, this Rikuo Shinako ship. We're going to depart for the high seas, boys! I can't wait for next week where Rikuo gets LAID lmao about that<br> [And BOY am I SO GLAD I can recognise the voice in that new theme song, so in case you don't know of "Sanketsu Shoujo" Sayuri, now is also my time to get back into her music this one isn't bad]<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZYnMSr_8SepEls2Iz3SVEVwlFTAhW1f8mmQiQ4AaGGw5GrZZGkPYUCmVXyP24R2vGvAyaCsF9zOiYO8O1ghvBh8-chAQj60JnIjbygGtcMdwkDtT26qr0rzX2PspIaLPF9uzY4y-Dyyo/s320/singyesterday07_rikuo1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW... anything, actually.

Yeah Haru-chan, you're the best haha<br> [Oh yeah just realised that Haru-chan is the first victim in this. Yeah, this episode is the happiest you'll see her in, by the way. Sadded haha]<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KaguyaSamaS206><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"You just want us to win such that we don't make Iino Miko a laughing stock?" Haha Shirogane, didn't know you can read human minds, out of all of them.</div></blockquote>Man, with all this seriousness, I can't get over the fact that we aren't even getting a joke dropped down half this episode, but yeah, this is what happens when you get a second season Anime adaptation haha. So, it's time to get serious. In this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS206) we reach the final part of the Elections arc I would like to say, and it ended spectacularly, in many ways then other. Firstly, Shirogane's edge. Obviously, through many means than other, he is at the winning side, mostly due to Kaguya being scheming as heck even to the extent of bribing and getting teaches to stare at students who are not on their side (wow, just wow), but that's not the point. On Miko-chan's turn, that's where the focus is that this time around. We have learnt that Miko-chan has never won Student Council elections thus far, not even once. For being too serious, she is never liked by anyone other than her best friend since she started school. That said, when standing upon the stage for her own speech, that's where everything including her past and present hit her. Not the awesome grades, not her confidence, but the lack thereof. One should know even without listening to her backstory as explained by her friend that, over the course of so many years ever she started running for Student Council elections, she has been infamously... bullied, in many fronts. I'm not going to start sh*tting on her because I am one myself to a smaller extent, but I would argue life treats all of us differently, and evil is mostly what was placed upon Miko-chan. Looking at you, Kaguya-sama. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But going back to Ishigami's request at the start of the episode, he stated one thing that he wanted to do, and that is to win the other candidate by a landslide. Though rather vague, he didn't explain why until he showed Shirogane her stage fright due to all the years of trying to break through, and if you didn't have that of a conclusion from Shirogane... I hope you have learnt a lesson too. Because really, Miko-chan has suffered enough. Just like Kaguya but she never changes so I won't care now refer to season 1 for that haha, but suffice it to say that helping Miko-chan is better than killing her. Mentally, I mean. It takes a lot to voice out what you want (ignore those protesters please, I swear), but as an individual, doing that requires a lot more than confidence. Finding that new comfort zone is never as easy as doing it forever until you get it. Coming out from all these years of growing, I can say that too. So Shirogane dropped the bomb on Ishigami seeing how he was pissed at her, is that they should help her learn. And thus, Shirogane, instead of cutting her off just as she was speechless at her speech after Kaguya literally railed on her election speech, chose to let her present her point to the students in the school so she could get her point across. Though she did not win, the students then learnt of how bad the prestigious school's reputation was on morals ie. rock bottom, and why there is a need to improve on it, basically her as a member of the Morals Committee. But yeah, seriously, Shirogane's team has been enjoying life too much in school. Didn't they say the worst of life is at school? These kids look like they're on a vacation lmao. In the end, Shirogane still won because we know the election was rigged (thanks, Russia) (haha), but that didn't stop Miko-chan in getting her own group of followers after that ravaging debate on stage that the whole school witnessed. And of course, we now know why she was the new girl of the series (sorry to her friend lol), but yes because she's here to set things straight. That is, if she joins the Student Council. Hey, it was a long and rough run, guys. Now let's get back to the jokes and see how she can ruin the lives of the other four in the room haha and I tell you, I want to see things happen I WANT TO SEE HAPPINESS TAKEN AWAY FROM SHINOMIYA KAGUYA haha not the hair taken away from Shirogane though please don't<br> [I'm putting more of Miko-chan screenshots in view of her last... episode lmao]<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5bsDb8IOv_2tj8lyalOo1UJne2pQgmnhyphenhyphengJDPZtG4ulUv2__gjAurW6sS8Qs-_y6ibOIfAAaTa2wh7JgyJaepPmNvCIQjdIL6WMDnthBJUvzTol-1mARIToADKDnMaNKW6RjteEzQM34/s320/kaguyasamaS206_miko2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Literally me every time I stand on stage and that's why I quit drama club</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjUK3-scYUb4kl5m-STeFJB0-KgV8wqwtludPG2p-oQtW9ypD_Wg_Cgtx6SD9vJx54O9Dhq9xagT0qMkaEPVhYtbgK9rDHnU1Jk5Jh1jTgpjwOpVae9RPkJImXOir1ZoieSocFtBc8A80/s320/kaguyasamaS206_miko4.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Goddamn can we talk about her contributions to the school thus far? lol</table></div></div>P.S.

However, <b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new album</b> delivers some promise that their style didn't fade off, but I would argue them now is really between past them and acoustic them which probably made them more mellow and softer than they should be. Remember "PB"?? Yeah, those were the days. <b>Waki Azumi's new single</b> is determined by me to release digitally this week despite the physical release delay to next month, so I'm giving the one song first since... even with 4 tracks she can't hit me with another one. No, not even the one which is literally techno don't do this to me I don't like that haha. Lastly, <b>LuckLife's new single</b> is... meh, to be frank. But I can give the topic song, to say the least. Compared to their mini-album last year due to their shift in music label, this is far from that level, I would argue. Well, something better next time, guys? I really want to see a new them in this band.<br><br> In news all around Twitter mainly, <b>Amamiya Sora is releasing a new album</b> by the end of the year (so yay?) (I swear this should have been earlier since that single in January but you know, pandemic), <b>VELTPUNCH's new music video</b> and also 2nd in the new music video series up to their new album is not as great as the first, <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai released part of their live performance</b> last night which I haven't watched yet since you know, things haha (that or I can wait for the second half to watch it together) (ah, available until next week), SCANDAL has a new song coming next month, <b>TrySail celebrated their 5th anniversary with a special YouTube video</b> which you can see online (they, uh, sang their debut song at their homes), and <b>vivid undress' upcoming mini-album has been delayed</b> from June to August. What did I say about the delays, eh? Haha I'm getting tired I need more music as fuel man stop pushing them backwards dammit<br><br> Next week, I'll be giving <b>flumpool's new album</b> a listen mainly because of Anime "Kakushigoto", but we shall see if I can give more. I mean, they are a lot like BUMP of CHICKEN by my impression and those aren't exactly my style so let's see how far I can get. And maybe I'll remember/forget Numakura Manami's best album at some point haha<br><br><br><br><br> Okay, I'm done. The lightning is bad out there, I'm kind of sweating somehow from typing all this and I still haven't showered today my hair is real long and I need more sleep.
