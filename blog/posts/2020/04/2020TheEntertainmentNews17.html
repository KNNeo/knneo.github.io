I'm trying to not screw things up here haha rest assured<br><br> Another week, another set of new episodes, I guess. Somehow had an urge to watch more Shinako or Kana-chan if you're into her instead of her role in the show haha time to get more bromides lmao shut up I gotta spend money when cooped at home okay?? Haha let's start<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Kakushigoto04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kakushigoto</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Apparently artistic jobs aren't your thing" BURN haha Hime-chan don't mind us your dad is DEFINITELY not doing an art-related job</div></blockquote>Wow this guy had to use an alias in public so that his real name wouldn't be tied to the manga artist so that his daughter wouldn't find out about it lol if you're daughter is a detective then she will bro haha. (By the way my alias in Japan is "Aozaki Shouhei", no joke, just look at my Twitter now) In this new episode (#Kakushigoto04) just like every episode, a good analogy is like someone trying to grind the ink tablet to write calligraphy, but just that you never stop grinding until the ink gets so thin and dry but you're still doing it. That's... how resilient the jokes are in this series haha. Okay, plot. Firstly, fortune telling. Hey, them girls gotta do it, and people do it around the world, and I paid thousands to change my phone number because my mom believed is in it, so... it's a woman thing man, just saying. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Hime-chan got into fortune telling with names, in which we also found out that Kakushi debutted as a manga artist with his real name so that's a problem when he starts using it in public eg. his credit card purchases but hey, the name he gave himself is ten thousand times worse which is probably why then his manga is selling like hotcakes. Thought to be influenced by fortune telling though, is the new editor and everyone in the editing studio, though it's more like an coincidence when the maid Nadila introduced to Hime-chan her native way to doing fortune telling... lol the new editor liked it though haha. Next, Kakushi gets to draw stuff. I know it sounds normal but hear me out (lol), it's for Hime-chan's assignment. Yeah, now that's a problem. So Kakushi is apparently stuck between afraid of being too good for the daughter's standards as a kid (if you would recall her making curry that was too professional haha "Namaste!" lmao) and his pride as a manga artist for not showing off his skills lol thought I would argue in this case the latter took more attention since he was asked to draw scenery and... he isn't great at it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So you know, he wouldn't be found out anyways. Still, with his pride back in place, he still kind of wants to be better (even though we know art style doesn't matter in manga because really, shit drawing manga get their Anime adaptation too just watch any number of shows in my Anime List haha), so... he takes on a (kids) art lesson lol. Taught by none other than the one young idol high schooler he found on the streets a while ago haha what a coincidence. So cue HAREM PART TWO!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This series is great haha Kakushi just NEVER explains his intentions for doing anything to them anyways lol. Besides accidentally picking up Naru-chan, he also picked up the sensei once again (lol) by proving to her that he did not participate in Hime-chan's assignment so she wouldn't get flagged for it haha she probably won't even if you help. Anyways, the two go to the zoo, and the sensei gets to watch. Haha that might sound cliche for a date lol, but what's more of a cliche is when she gets found out by the other kids from school alone, and thought she was solo dating ie. going out alone while missing his/her (probably) dead partner haha this show is great. To conclude, I would like to bring your attention to whatever Hime-chan was recollecting about at the start, and at the end, as a grown up. So we now know that the mother played a real improtant part of her life as a kid, from making the boxes for each year (the ones after 17 is still a mystery maybe) (Haha did I hint it was from the dad? I, uh, did some fortune telling for this series lol no I didn't read the original work at all) to their trip with the mother to the zoo when Hime was younger... ah, it wasn't imagination after all girl, you have seen it before as a photo. As the single father family memories surface episode after episode, we might ever be closer to this confrontation at some point, and boy would I be ready with <strike>manuscript paper</strike> tissue paper to cry when it happens haha. Meanwhile, we can still enjoy a good amount of episodes worth of jokes, misunderstandings (mostly from the "women of the streets" lmao) and Hime-chan innocence while we still can. We can, I assure you. I don't want the reality hit to happen this quickly, really. Hime-chan is still cute let her stay like this in this series for as long as we can hehe<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCgn_eQIEUZxBphYM5_WLR4JYWWtJpLQpg2tp0P9DdawHkqLfiQrZPAd_0vdtldRk5I-cBy2N0SwRpl7JaOX0ubh4nVy5nkJxNMKF8dxWVTrxwXB52IWmuf5I2tSeEhu8Z1MVkfiUzNpg/s320/kakushigoto04_spirits.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>They be trying to summon the mother back haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnVzzX1N3Kae7IgCPCjMojXYk6fmybSBt1riw5a7HzsfnNzRv9LX_DWE4D4G7es5Bc25Gf4u0bJQ8kk7R2hzbkuHM876WEOrr_a0vgLVM7AoApcZf_W7zhI4WjuxXn9Ce4gmfBm42VWAM/s320/kakushigoto04_family.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Talking about the mother... lol can't see her face</table></div></div>P.S. I swear in the 16 years old box is definitely a porno mag, I tell you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br> P.P.S. "You haven't even debutted (as a manga artist) yet? How dare you (think of an alias) already!!" I mean, why can't we? Haha also bantering with Sakura Ayane (who voices the one girl) sounds like something I would dream of lol<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=YesterdayWoUtatte04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Yesterday wo Utatte</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"And once you get decent, it gets kind of boring" Yeah, he's not wrong haha</div></blockquote>Man, did I jump into this faster than I wanted maybe because I'm thinking of <strike>Kana-chan</strike> Shinako haha okay let's talk about not her first lol. But seriously Shinako stop trying to date his brother!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay in this new episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte04), we talk mostly about Rou-kun. Rou... he's your <a href=https://jisho.org/search/wakai target=_blank>wakai</a> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/dansei target=_blank>dansei</a> type of problems, all of them. He's young, he's motivated to pursue his dreams, he... can't get relationships. Hey, aren't we all? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Okay maybe not the motivation for me but) So yeah, we talk about why Rou-kun matters in this series. Firstly, what we know thus far. He's the brother also technically childhood friend to but not really, to Shinako who is his neighbour back in Kanazawa. Problem is, Shinako is only here to take care of the brother Yuu, and yeah probably regards Rou as like a brother or something. Like family, than lovers to any extent. Is that good though? For Rou, it might not be good enough. Between juggling his current art school goal and dealing with living outside of the old house back in Kanazawa, he has a lot of things going on while still remembering the past. I mean, like Shinako, he also can't get over the fact of his brother's absence. However, compared to hers which is affection through care, his is snatching the spotlight through Shinako herself. You see, if you like someone... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, but we already know Shinako is probably around the grey area but slightly towards the love side between sympathy and love in this case, so Rou you already lost in this aspect, bro. It is hard to move on, as we can see in Shinako's case of rejecting Rikuo, and whatever misunderstanding of rivals there is at the convenience store lol, but suffice it to say that Rou at this point still thinks that he has a chance with Shinako, I guess. That ambiguity, is his presence, and probably his drive to screw things up between the lot. Again, as we know so far, Rikuo got rejected, but not like that boy knows about this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> To be honest? I don't have such problems so I don't really get how it feels to be in this, but I would argue like Shinako, Rou is also stuck with this past that he rather forget. Though obviously Shinako is getting a harder time in doing this compared to him, as the boy tries to pick up his life altogether so he can, at least, prove to Shinako that he's grown up after all. (I mean, being an a**hole kid by leaving your bro at home in bed while asking the girl to go see fireworks? DUDE WHAT THE F-) Maybe it's this lack of a grown up story, is what will drag him down to whatever he wants in his relationship between Shinako haha. I don't care personally because you know, I dig the Rikuo x Haru-chan ship now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I hope for the sake of the series, the Anime is still throwing us character focus episodes so we can actually come to some confrontation (or probably misunderstanding clarification, with most romance shows like this they gotta) after giving us this much context behind all their stories and their motives within this love... rectangle? Should we even count Haru-chan in? Haha we will once Rou-kun starts liking her haha oh the fourth guy is me? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah I like Haru-chan and Shinako too but I'm not really into shorties so... *gets punched by Haru*<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6RdL5V8xDSK4bQ32ibvHg-Af5l-eId5tdRE6xtzxgGhDSKKHPKSaiCdKYeCcSVW2r8gjvn2Wzliyy725kdVezeBvYZjeHVBR7_BRoNLihFffVta2U-jw6UETEGsHbpV2VP_GDH-WmX9U/s320/singyesterday04_shinako3.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Since kid them is so cute then might as well<br> (Kana-chan is cuter hands down haha)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7kaZtSGVOfbjJ6FRVJs0avsQiQr3CiThFGGy0XeFIz2XpVLnB1Mua16mBL4xI0NuXyK9YSDET7Gh_eiZ119j4MsfK6pW9KuGPb3wZD3DooDGCaq7ZH_Z2-CcxjfLsw_El-O1M5TxXRDo/s320/singyesterday04_rou4.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Since kid them is so cute then might as well<br> ("Too pure pure boy" lmao)</table></div></div>P.S. "Are you never going to get over my brother?" BOOM GOT HER man that is the best burn this series by far haha<br> P.P.S. "Could you wear a maid outfit?" Man, the cafe manager knows Haru-chan has potential haha <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bqanime id=KaguyaSamaS203><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"They say nothing pleases a man more than a woman being interested in his interests" Sadly for Kaguya-sama, this will not turn out well like most other cases haha hey what do I know</div></blockquote>Ah, now I see where this is going, with such an abrupt "end". Hey, finally new character next episode? We sure hope it happens. Man, at this rate we might be able to get season three- Okay in this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS203) we... get a little sad. Hey, probably the saddest of episodes in this series so far, so I'll take one once in a blue moon. Talking about the moon, (I call that perfect comedic timing haha) we start with watching the full moon. Well, the fullest of moons. Yes, if you need an astronomy lesson here because I took one in university, there is one time of the year that the moon will be particularly close to any part of the planet, and that is normally where many like to gather to look at the moon, amongst the 11 other times the moon lights up in full brightness. So, didn't know Shirogane is a fan too (I mean, I sort of became one for a while after going through those lectures too tbh), but yeah, he may be too much of a fan. So much so he is so distracted about it, he doesn't even care what he does to anyone. And sadly or not, Kaguya set herself to be his target. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, I say that as a joke but, you see all those lovey-dovey stuff they did? I mean, I've never been that enthusiastic about anything to do this to women or maybe I did, but hey, I'm not Shirogane. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this battle alone, Kaguya probably lost to the moon until the guy realises what he did but not until you hear the story about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter target=_blank>Kaguyahime</a> (if you need a summary and don't bother clicking on the wiki page OR if you missed watching "RikeKoi" story goes woman on moon gets born on Earth taken up by a man who cuts bamboos and they eventually fall in love with each other, but she has to go back to the moon, rejecting all suitors so that one day she can go back to her true love) and think, hey maybe Kaguya-sama is like her too. Well, I guess so. Shirogane is right though; the guy did not take the hint. Besides, I'll live forever as long as I don't live forever as an old man haha please keep me young immortality pill just like Kuro-san from "Kyokou Suiri" haha. Then, we move on to the epic conclusion (okay just joking but it's) of the student council of the school year. Yep, The President is done. He got tired. Doing that work for two years relying on caffeine to survive (lol), he earned his reward for carrying out his duties way more than he worked for it, so he deserves a break. And thus, the Council is disbanded. Well, I guess that's the end then cya guys next week for the other two shows <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, obviously that did NOT happen, because Kaguya wanted it. Hey, somehow I feel that she is being more desperate than usual in this season, but seeing everyone pack up stuff which brings back our memories too maybe not Ishigami lol like for example the French exchange (Sally-chan you will be missed haha you can follow her on Twitter though not like I do lol) and Ishigami being hit to Shirogane wearing rabbit ears (kyawawawa haha MARRIAGE) to everything else Kashiwagi related... lol those were great memories. (I would argue that Kaguya's suggestion for Student Council is <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span>) And as they end, Kaguya felt empty. Yeah, not just for Myu-kun (lmao), but also for the rest of them okay maybe not Chika-chan haha lmao Kaguya please she got this Anime millions of views on YouTube with that one ending song. So yeah, another year then, I guess since high school is 3 years long. But in this case though, and that's where the new character will pop in, is elections for the Student Council, and now that Shirogane has to do this all over again, he might either have some competition or maybe have some more help since he's working his a** all the time anyways. Which one might it be featuring this love rival though? I don't think we have to wait long to find out haha this Anime is already topping the charts at this point even my charts haha<br> [Yes <a href=https://twitter.com/anime_kaguya/status/1254062612435918851 target=_blank>this Tweet</a> on their official Twitter about the Student Council disbanded is intended to make you cry NICE TRY ANIME I already did in the episode itself haha]<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGGLD-QPPC9sEkr4vD48RYWXuRvE5Ugd8Vxq57DkezoJ8CiS7jM5h-wZ-Yq6fg7k2VwutSIKe4TGvjKnMdgguJCmg1i90wSyZSLHxJl1IqyQJqPTOOziMzdf14J8CsyATI4QT0buo-R8Q/s320/kaguyasamaS203_couple1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is so good I can't even</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4ZjW9Hz7EahTVegVWjsP5z2lUZzlGoNxDwVHEcMeGttKpqGHRt3z20Ewx7fhVJcMGCydW0v848JijQNDR6kOM62-H9SKV1TtveexLwoYHynjNQzk-tj_PNNXldeNunMqBxFHyBYc8GTY/s320/kaguyasamaS203_couple2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is so good I can't even</table></div></div>P.S.

I'm skipping nano.RIPE's new single since I'm really not into them anymore now so next album maybe? Haha meanwhile <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new album</b> is great, but not as great as I expected from their first album (this is the second), but you know, I'll try to give a few. Okay maybe only just the one topic song since I'm only trying to find songs to get hype now. <b>SpecialThanks' new album</b>, however, is raking in all the songs in Klassic Note so I'm giving them as much as I can, those short but sweet songs, happy and sad. It's their new band formation, and I'm glad I can get into some punk rock once in a while. Thank goodness that's not all of them otherwise I might just leave haha<br><br> On news on Twitter and beyond if any, <b>VELTPUNCH's new music video</b> is onset to the three-part music video release every month until I guess an album is announced so HYPE!! (Mostly because of that like on the tweet hehe) <b>Aimer releases live music performance videos</b> on her YouTube channel so be sure to check them out (orchestra anything emo from Aimer is weird imo) <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai did another video</b> for "FIRST TAKE" who strives to only give artist one chance to make it good (and it is good), <b>SpecialThanks released more music videos</b> in view of their album release this week, <b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new music previews</b> as I'm constantly trying to avoid them to not ruin the first impression experience I so desire, <b>UNLIMITS released their library of songs</b> since they left major to music subscription services which includes of course Apple Music Japan, and <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES pumped out a new music video</b> because you know, they can. Again, not a fan of music videos because the music matters more than whatever the video can present. Nothing beats the beats of imagination, bro. Ask VELTPUNCH how they imagined their songs that music video is really good hehe<br><br> For next week... FINALLY we get to <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new album</b> (let me check the date) (yes I think so haha that virus man killing all those release dates) and I hope for their sake I like their songs because if you have been listening to their slew of music videos which covers like half the album by now they are... very different to what I have heard so far. It's great, I must say, but man, it's not appealing to me right now. Hope that will change next week. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br><br><br><br> Okay boy am I glad I have some creative time to myself so I can write some code to make myself happy like create an <a href=https://knneo.github.io/image-gallery/image-gallery.html target=_blank>image gallery</a> (go ahead and fork that and slot in web images if you want) so I can view ma girls anytime without Pinterest haha yes I do use that to see pirated images lol. Talking about those, I got myself another batch. And mainly because I have not been spending anything for the last month besides on bubble tea which my local government just banned exclusive shops on selling (sigh) I thought I should burn a hole in my wallet to celebrate... my pay raise. Haha yeah, it's happening. Now that I have more responsibilities including having to deal with random shit on the weekends in case any of the hundreds of clinics which are still operating have a malfunctioning server, I hope I still have some time for myself haha.

It cannot because instead of clicking it yesterday I did it a day later which some of them already are sold which include some good ones from Kotobuki Minako's photobook Mina-chan no!~ I hope she's well in England haha bye and take care guys<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
