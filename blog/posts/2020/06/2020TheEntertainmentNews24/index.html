Guess what I was doing all weekend.<div><br></div><div>If you didn't say work you're out haha part of it was still work. And after that? Well, besides the bunch of games I'm obliged to play on a daily basis, scanning every single one of those photos I just bought. Yeah, I'm a real <a href=https://jisho.org/search/otaku target=_blank>otaku</a> now haha<br><br>Anyways, let's <strike>clear this burden</strike> enjoy the best part of the week!! Hey, don't quote me on this but Anime is better than real life drama (lol talk about myself here)<div><br></div><div><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Kakushigoto11><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Kakushigoto</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I'd like to hold a family meeting" Wow Hime-chan being the head of the household now I didn't even know lol you think she's bigger than the grandfather? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>"It doesn't matter, they just want to have a meeting" Haha that can never be more true but somehow working from home recently due to the pandemic is making this less frequent lol which is bad news actually miscommunication is the devil that'll come back to haunt you if you don't deal with it. Hey, in this new episode (#Kakushigoto11) we talk about meetings. Many hate it, some like it, and some are just to "show face" as we colloquially call it here, but it's all to align ourselves at the same page. The characters in this series aren't though, otherwise it'll not be a comedy anymore lol. But yeah, somehow Hime-chan wants to have a family meeting. Yeah, it's just two human who will be involved, and the daughter be the serious type, so she's just taking things a little formal here, I assume. But yeah, as Kakushi and Hime-chan's classmate mentioned, you can do this anywhere. My family's typically on the dining table lmao yeah we only talk during dinner time. But yeah, somehow three of them being relieved of their worried through quite a big misunderstanding, still worked for all of them to know the reality of having meetings, and well, all is well. But yeah, who gives a sh*t about your editors' meeting, Tomaruin. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Talking about this idiot, he then thought of the greatest idea that would change everything... before this episode ended lol. It would seem like Tomaruin is just trying to get the editor-in-chief and Kakushi to meet up so he can eat good food since someone that is not him is paying for it. Wow, and they both have bad feelings about why do so too at a time like this? Man, you really like to Toma-ruin things, bro! Just stop. (Yes come back for more adequately used word puns made by yours truly) Things got real awkward with the two victims of Tomaruin's excellent dinner plan (because he just eats), and has good reason for Kakushi to believe that his manga series has to end. Well, apart from the bad idea of ending a series because he'll effectively run out of a job since he has no new ideas just yet, the assistants finally get to have a break. Hmm, must be tough just doing a weekly series for... weeks and weeks without breaks as they would like to take as and when they like, but yeah, the series suddenly got good so we can't end it now. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Well, Kakushi eventually found out that he thought his series was ending haha. I mean, them assistants (including Keshi-kun) (gotcha covered, bro) should still get a break though. Then finally, the meeting. Because Hime-chan finally found a well to have a meeting lmao (again, you can have meetings anywhere), she and the father finally can talk about... holding a birthday party. Yeah, that's it. What do you think the 10-year-old is thinking? Okay, 11-year-old since her birthday is over by the time I write this, but hey. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> It was all great (Tomaruin gave a gift to Nadila wtf), Hime-chan is cute I'm not a pedo (lmao), and Kakushi made mountains of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/karaage target=_blank>karaage</a>. (Wow, that karaage ramen I had this morning <a href=https://zenpop.jp/japanese-ramen-pack target=_blank>bought from Japan</a> is great you know) Good job, dad. <font size=1>Well, not really, but hey, we don't know yet.</font> To end this, in this week's reverse flashback, wow Rokku has grown real big haha, and Hime... she finally found the entry to Kakushi's secret. What is might be? I guess next week's the daughter confronting the father (I assume he's still alive) then. Hmm... please tell me this is a good ending. I want this to end happy, to be frank. If it's the sad ending? (Illegitimate daughter? What??) Well... I can imagine what it's like already, but I'm not like all of them who like to be misunderstood, so I'll see next week on what will be the conclusion for this series. Man, this deep lore is not what I expected; it's so deep, it's deeper than that well Tomaruin fell into haha</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIPRdI8DdIqh3ImK_n0KYzn4zp0eMHsyjR9hQBm-TszqvTOk2H3qxMzVMc1HLPLIXYwUJm4IwfF4YUkOTnyokL87WWclk09GADCnOFCDsmVLBG7EuAd29RwvIyHX7mW_J_paWh71-OXeY/s320/kakushigoto11_team1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What is this, the Soviet Union? lol<br>(But seriously though, worker benefits for your assistants, Kakushi)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifbhZpciVysLWqKSIkYK0lyq4NmQkN6fVxn8K8w0OzjNdmr2NWU9O6vo-OJZ7YX_Ltd242hHzdrwr2xVSgCo7qRIRw5jtKHxTSraGIkCAMK-yLkjgkMpjtk939ZPX2TaS27eQGTgB-fbg/s320/kakushigoto11_punch.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When someone says bad things about my girl lol<br></table></div></div><div>P.S.

Is someone else there?" Haha Shinako got found out!! Quick, hide in the wardrobe- Is what normally people will do? lol</div></blockquote>Yep, Haru-chan wants some protection from you, Rikuo. You can't run away now. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Wait, you gonna sleep at her place?? Oh, I underestimated you bro I thought she's going to your place haha. In this I wouldn't even say bizarre new episode (#YesterdayWoUtatte11), I mean... this is pretty much decided already right? Who Rikuo is going to be with? I mean, he's eating at her place?? Well, I don't mean Haru-chan, by the way; That's one's just for the break-in. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Let's start from the top, shall we? Story goes that Haru-chan's place got a break-in, and thanks to the cops, the guy probably got caught, but you know, there's the trauma of a break-in still, to any extent. Out of kindness, Rikuo decides to stay with her for the night, and don't ask me how he even came to her at any point because I don't think they were together when the break-in happened haha that will be WILD lol. But yeah, it's not much, so we shouldn't think too much into it. Though we should focus more on the main couple's relationship, and specifically, how everyone is going to learn of this bond. Again, hurting others along the way is unavoidable, so I don't think both of them should avoid it. Firstly, from Rikuo. This guy man, enjoying all the cooking that Shinako offers, is getting bento every day for work until the colleague wants in on the action. Well, girls, not his girl. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So much so that we see the point of them hanging out to eat and such, you know, dropping by his place to cook too. But yeah,Â Haru-chan decided to pay Rikuo a visit on the night that he called Shinako over for dinner. Man, this world of coincidences will only create more misunderstandings haha. So yeah, this is rather inevitable, and thank goodness Haru didn't drop the bagels and coffee (lol), because it's not worth it to do that for that one guy which you like seen going out with who he likes. I mean, that also means the war is over though. Remember the challenge issued from Haru-chan to Shinako? Yeah, we can confirm the results now. And as this hits Haru-chan, again we knew this is going to happen, but I can sincerely tell you I would hate to see Haru-chan cry. Like seriously, they gonna make her cry AGAIN!! <strike>Well, there was the break-in though so I think she got used to it haha</strike> O~kay that's a bad thing to say now sorry I gotta make my jokes somehow. Moving on!! We got another idiot who's going to hit the wall again haha. Yes, we're talking about Rou-kun, who <strike>after a quick time lapse of</strike>Â has been secretly making bentos for Rikuo from Shinako lol, has passed his entrance exams. Hey, keeping the secret was vital in making him succeed. But the thanks are good, she can't go steady with you now haha. Ugh. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Just before we hit Rou-kun hard, let's talk about Shinako hanging out with her teacher friend. And as the friend mentioned, it's really important for Shinako to do what she likes now, even if obligation is in place or whatever reason is stopping her from like, you know, going out with another guy. (Haha I like how there's "an eyewitness" lol how resourceful are your friends, Shinako? lol) I guess the bigger problem is that it's making her guilty somehow. Like what, you guys aren't actually going out if you don't spend big bucks to go to Disneyland? Who cares?? If it doesn't make you happy then don't do those. Screw those normies (sorry haha) out there; do whatever even if it means just hanging out for dinner or something. You know, it's always these small stuff that make of a couple, not the once in a while gift bomb lol. Okay, back to Rou-kun. He graduated, Shinako went with him to pick up an attire for the ceremony I suppose, and I swear Rou still thinks she doing all of this for him because it's family. Okay, he may not be wrong, but can you even take it if she lets go? Or if you know about whatever her life is now? "Without You"? (sorry for the Yoru no Honki Dance reference lol) Haiz this is hard to pit against this kid though, considering how weak Shinako is in her emotions and actions. Maybe comfort zone, maybe guilt, maybe she can't keep a secret. I would argue that say like in "Servant x Service" Ichimiya didn't have to go out with her girlfriend because his sister's birthday is in Christmas Eve but the girl also had stuff to do on that day so it's fine?Which is why I think that obligations aren't a problem if (1) you keep a secret and (2) everyone else doesn't mind. Both don't apply in this scenario though haha I guess that's the problem. And as they hold off their plans to do anything else because of obligation as I would like to refer to now haha, Shinako... Shinako just wants to be together with him. That's all. So pure. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> I like. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> And in some freak coincidence, Rou-kun shows up at her place. Oh well, but NO WHY NEXT WEEK haha yeah so this is going to end even more dramatically compared to this week? Well gg guys this kid is going to ruin everything now. I really don't want a train wreck, Anime. But hey, it's kinda unavoidable, don't you think? Haha let's see how well this goes next episode then it's the last, and I won't expect it to end well. No really, don't.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgTAmkMj_hm6gOnsUZJe6PXladBkPU21L1y_2QIAswB9p9S8qo6gsZP8UaHbG13pCc5s4veOdj9Ns-50phDipKbZAABcS2sSGBpvR0ZZgVnB8k8BrOPqokBi0KIscS-N49w2yXP0smXd4/s320/singyesterday11_couple1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Really, really envious on what these two can do now tbh haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6zQ_SPsw661CVw7apfP-EEwdZLjy7FgPlQNj2DPp_erCsUnOgdgeuXRT-EAl4Is6nQxgLERwbRqOECCtjyFbNMBcRin10PMHFtLFr0HlMF_D8-V2TV3BumYng2hqhcvOz8t7Ukfx1cdQ/s320/singyesterday11_tug.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Really, really envious on what these two can do now tbh haha</table></div></div><div>P.S.

So you grill your bro on his love life? Come on, be a better sister here haha</div></blockquote><div>Ah, Kaguya, what have you done to your Shirogane? Like seriously, "return us our Shirogane" is what most of the female audience would day haha.Â  In this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS210) Shirogane Miyuki... actually sucks. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Sorry, Kaguya-sama, but if you were to marry him you need to bear his complaints like a whor- Okay, where were we? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Oh, before we start? You know Kaguya is taking breaths from being too close to Shirogane when she puts her hand to her face. Remember that and watch the episode again. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, story. Firstly, Shirogane after being avoided like a bullet from Kaguya. Well, we know what's the reason, they played two episodes of it already. Problem is, the guys doesn't know. So yeah, he is just depressed at home now, and thus, the proper introduction of the members in the household. Surprisingly, Kei-chan the sister is still the most useful for advice as despite the father's efforts of trying to hear his son out, his advice as a father who had the wife walk off on him, refusing to sign the damn divorce papers and not having a job currently wtf, still has a worse love life than his son who is trying to get one. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Take that, father!! Haha anyways, from this we can deduce that the sister is a masochist haha I mean, getting shitted on by the brother all year long and still wants to give advice to him? This can only happen if- Moving on!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Someone lied about his skills again. This time, it's about the traditional Japanese soran dance. No as in, we know who it is, it's Shirogane. Teaching him again is a pro artist and everything is perfect about her besides her temper, <strike>Kohara Konomi</strike> Fujiwara Chika (lol Koko-chan don't hit me) (but seriously <a href="https://youtu.be/rvWXCEo_4Z0?t=14" target=_blank>if you need evidence</a> I have them haha), is again at the behest of this motherf**ker who lied through his nose for the nth time since we have to go through his life lessons (literally) again and again, could not even do a dance just by following the dancer. Seriously, Kaguya, even if you stepped in it wouldn't work on him haha. So, Chika-chan like seriously and I agree with you girl, has had enough of his lies, is probably giving up on teaching him even if it means destroying her pride because even if she has one it's already gone. So, with the sports festival upon him, Shirogane has no choice but to learn it himself till the day comes, and that's where Kaguya comes in. Besides her earnest desire to touch his slender, pliant body (lol I'm not gay btw) she intends to use this opportunity to teach him stuff so that she can show how good she is at dancing? Well, not until Chika steps in and noticed it. In the conflict between science and art approaches to dancing which I think you can watch yourself, the two friends ended up quarrelling with each other on what they know about the dance. Somehow Shirogane got how it works though and manages to nail it in the festival, so good on you bro. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (I want to me pulled by two girls too hehe) Then, it's... Miko's friend? Yeah, let's call her that I still don't remember her name. Her observation, of Ishigami's life. To summarise, people might think Miko-chan and Ishigami might have something, but it's because this somehow special bond is only forged because they all know each other in middle school (obviously, Shuchi'in), and... Ishigami almost got expelled and it's Miko-chan who brought him back. I don't think he knows, but you know, love is a secret in itself. Haha Miko-chan don't kill me. Still, according to... the friend lol, and that's why people today hate Ishigami, because he had such a past, and how he was saved without knowing what he did to himself. Again, it's a bit touchy anyways, and hey it's youth, so I won't dig in too much into that. If you want to guess who Ishigami went violent for... I don't know. I don't want to know haha. So, last but not least, the sports festival. Besides the fact that his (useless) (unemployed) father is creeping him out haha, Shirogane technically has to stop the father from finding his girl, because you know, the dad sucks. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, about that, and you know the father is going to slip away to a corner just to... corner the girl she likes, you know, like a confrontation? Funny thing is then, Kaguya doesn't know of the father. Really? Not even though the voice? Well I guess she isn't blind so her hearing isn't heightened and it's a terrible quality phone call but. Still, Kaguya's argument thus far as from episode 1 (of season 1) is still that she like him for who he is in impression. I mean, we know how terrible the guy is at his home, but hey, Kaguya doesn't know of that. Now you know why they say "marriage is life's grave"? I mean, look at the father. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So that's that. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Wow, are we close to ending this series, and I expect something better than the last. Remember, we have seen a lot of fathers this week which reminds us of someone else's father missing in action. So good chances Ishigami's father might have something to do with the ending haha bye (yes I lied)</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2jB3KjcGsUUThRVHOrrvspAKQ1AusM8lmEpBH6h7qdXM-Nw1EVOlzunjyaRp7B3di5_M7VwMLDAzNYI2fswYW5XOSaeo_mJeQ-VqyP5D7JTbXp_VbWYGj5rAUtcE9e0xiRp8NELhB1HQ/s320/kaguyasamaS210_chika6.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Things that hit me hard this episode<br></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8QjTtmHr2TtcvhTVisP8nPGc_zZM1sS-K7wiLra29YS2cutOuAvpkiuYSS3dP8iy4SJ-_iGscQT-NeUBjStxSZtYHqh24nnE3A-rrp9Xfs_AM1QjaDuTQMAliVoAgz5pQeT3SaV3G9_4/s320/kaguyasamaS210_bdsm.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Things that hit me hard this episode<br>(Ah, well, TIL Miko-chan is a sadist lmao)</table></div></div><div>P.S. "It would be like <a href=https://jisho.org/search/burakon target=_blank>brocon</a>!"

"She's been hanging out and talking normally with another guy I know" Oh that's Ishigami haha<br></div><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hmm, I guess I should talk more about Akarin's album then. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/style/1510534444?l=en-US" target=_blank><b>Kitou Akari's 1st album</b></a> is... okay I guess? As with many voice actress idol-based music albums this one is similar as the production try to explore as many styles and especially genres, for future developments for the artist herself. This one... I believe it has given her more variety, although I would argue those aren't the ones I gave haha. The topic song with a music video is a meh, there's one song which sounds like when Minase Inori released an album ie. inspirational so I gave that chorus real good, and you know, Akarin's great as hype songs and I'll take that anytime of the day. Although I would argue that I would like more.. you know, seducing songs. I mean, Akarin singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhIeiUbH2gg" target=_blank>that Sumipe song</a> would be GREAT though it'll be hard to sell the music video haha she has no rack and butt THEM LEGS THOUGH lol<br><br> Talking about stuff that is still music and it's on Twitter, <b>VELTPUNCH announced their upcoming album</b> to be on August after revealing their third music video for the past 3 months (which is actually good), <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1272133514683486209?s=20" target=_blank><b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new music video</b></a> and <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/smile-smile-single/1515097841?l=en-US" target=_blank>digital single</a> is fine I guess but I'll wait for an album or single release, I assume to prevent spamming <b>Amamiya Sora's music YouTube channel</b> is up with short versions of the music videos thus far, and it's probably not related to music but I just want to say, <b>Minase Inori opened an Instagram account</b> on account that (pun not intended) there is out there an unofficial account raking in followers, including me. Don't think I remembered this too well but I don't follow fan accounts so I suppose it's real. Maybe I really thought it was a related account to follow back then. That or maybe their account is hacked. But thinking about it all these years, it's always mirroring of content from Twitter and hardly anything that is original so I suppose it's not real haha uh oh<br><br> So next week... it's a whole lot of nothing, actually. Until the following week I may spend some time to listen to more songs from other artists, I guess. I don't know if it's recent events or the lack of active artists that made this happen, but as you can see in Klassic Note just this year, it has not been looking great. Yeah, my follow-up on these since I am working is already weak in comparison to the first 10 years, huh.<br><br><br><br><br> So that's it I guess. Another week, another post. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, there's that one big thing this week following my efforts to scan every single of those 60+ photos I bought online because I'm bored at home haha, so go check it out. Maybe when I'm done I'll put them up on that Github Page so I can admire them in the digital world without having to see them physically. Also, I need another photo album my current has reached its limit and my local MUJI is not open to sell them yet haha. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... well I'm trying to stay happy, and so should you. Hey, Yoru no Honki Dance's music video is a good one; go listen to it.
