I think we really need to watch these types of animation movies once in a while. To get moved, to cry (lol), and to love again. My life is so mundane I need something else other than buying stuff to keep me moving haha. Talking about buying stuff... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><div><br></div><div>Okay I'll leave the "Phase 3" talk in another post, because I put a heck a lot more into what I mentioned previously, if you don't mind. I won't mind so whatever haha let's start</div><div><br></div><div>As you can see above, instead of manga I opted for an anime movie, and... I loved it. Really good. I could watch more of these and be a lovesick f**k or until I get laid which the latter might be harder to happen so... my emotions are in your hands, Anime industry lol<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Summer2020Anime><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Summer 2020 Anime Preview!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>[Source: <a href=https://randomc.net/2020/06/30/summer-2020-preview/ target=_blank>Random Curiosity</a>]</div></blockquote>So yeah, this took a while for those budding bloggers. But they finally got around to it, so let's see what I have to say about the list. As usual, those with air dates represent what I intend to watch:<div><ul style=text-align:left><li> F**K YOU ALL SEQUELS: I'm not in the mood for that right now. Besides, where is Attack on Titan Final Season? Haha<li>I've heard things aboutÂ <b>Appare-Ranman!</b> and about how, of course, Yuuki Aoi is main again, but that's not the issue since it's Anime original they don't reveal too much and from PVs it's like an ancient cross-continent race. Okay, if that's interesting to you help yourself haha they trying out steampunk or what? lol<li>If you think I'm watching an Anime about girls fishing you've got another thing coming haha<li>I thought <b>Gibiate</b> was cool until they threw me the action AND THEN the apocalypse. The latter is not appealing to me at all. Reminds me of BLEACH though, the main guy. Not going to power me to watch one episode of this, I'm afraid.<li><b>Deca-Dance</b> looks cool but it's Sci-Fi and it's not cooler than "Fractale" so no thanks haha also Anime original so they are just testing me again so nope<li>Ah, this. <b>GREAT PRETENDER [premiers July 8th 2020]</b> reminds me of Anime "ACCA" but less cool (lol) since there aren't idiots in the latter and this upcoming show that I will give a chance has some idiots. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Jokes aside because this one from first impressions has many, I think I can forgive the deception upon deception (not inception btw) against bad guys and even among themselves because I don't have to do the thinking. Makes me smarter already by comparison haha might give this an episode if you haven't watched exclusively on Netflix lol<li>And as mentioned, I will be watching two shows that I have already confirmed since last season lol, and they areÂ <b>Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! [premiers July 10th 2020]</b> not because of the rack but because of Oozora Naomi who voices the girl and it's just about going outside which I will need convincing again after the pandemic lol;<li>And also, <b>Kanojo, Okarishimasu [premiers July 10th 2020]</b> because I'm as sad as the main guy even though I don't have a breakup with a girlfriend because I don't have any (BOOM GOT ME) (you're gonna hear this a lot next week onwards), and the cast is stellar. No joke. With Ten-chan as main girl, Yuuki Aoi as your <a href=https://jisho.org/search/motokano target=_blank>motokano</a>, and Naobou so I can FINALLY get laid and maybe if I have time for Rieri... this is a harem I DO NOT want to miss haha hey I wished they had more guys</ul><div>So, uh, next week, I guess? It's... jokes and romance again, it seems. Well, kind of my thing now that I have work stress this seems to be the way to balance things up? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=NakiNeko><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>æ˜ ç”»</b></span><span class=head-title> Nakitai Watashi wa Neko wo Kaburu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I get to hear Hinode's sexy voice. I can die happy right now" Then DO IT lol is probably what the guy is thinking but</div></blockquote>The girl's fascination of her guy's voice is like how much I like all my female seiyuus haha but man is she living the life. Okay, I walked in without much expectation (and Mina-chan was in it lol) so I decided to give it a try, now that we have a break from Anime series. But I swear "SWEET CAT LIFE" is going to be the reason I start raising a cat- Okay just joking I won't. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> As much as I don't have allergies of them, I don't really want it ending up to be someone who likes me but in cat form- Wait. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, now that I've spoiled the living human out of you, let's talk about this movie (#NakiNeko). It's popular. It's on Netflix. The girl's desperate. Pity you're not the guy. Period. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay seriously though, this is literally it, that is, if you can take the story. Story goes, that there's a girl called Miyo. (Muge's the nickname people give her at school FYI) She's having a bad life in middle school. Her mother walked out on her, she has to accept the stepmother who keeps asking for her acceptance (like, seriously, bro) (haha), and she likes a guy who doesn't like her. Well, not really, but you know, it's not a yes. So yeah, Miyo-chan lives her life greeting her guy with a butt kick (man I want it too lol you think this works? Haha), getting bullied by classmates who think of her outward personality as weird (now that I saw the mother for a bit - the biological one - I can see why) (lol dont slap me), and lives on her dreadful life because.. she can transform into a cat. Now you may say, what's the perk in being a cat? Besides that Mask Seller who will tell you everything but good stuff lol (well for example, life expectancy is a bad thing here for cats, they can't live past a decade) (*did Google search* okay maybe two decades haha sorry but I don't know cats), in Miyo-chan's case since she has been given a mask from the mysterious big cat, she can transform into one. And at this point, cat her has already made friends with the guy she likes. And probably the house and the people in his grandfather's clay workshop for good measure haha. Too bad, as we know, human you is never going to be anything else people want because you as a being are not replaceable (more on that later), but that's the conundrum Miyo has now. She can choose to be a cat forever (or for as long as she can, more on that too later) and of course, be showered with love by Hinode the guy for as long as she can without dating him as a human, OR live her pathetic life never to be appreciated forever. Hey, if it's what Anime has taught to me for years Miyo will just live her human life all the way feeling happy on the outside and sad on the inside anyways, so why not the cat, amirite? Not so easy. In a change of events, Miyo defended her guy in front of classmates (while doing the cat pounce, as a human lol), and you know, got an interaction chance with him in return. (I mean, sharing <a href=https://jisho.org/search/bento target=_blank>bento</a>?? Isn't that what couples do? lol) And maybe, just maybe, this has let Hinode to think. Like, Miyo-chan you're on the right track with your actions right now you guys will be together by graduation lol. Hey, prove me wrong, Anime. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, but the drop has to happen right? For her to think being a cat is great? So yeah, since she has been enjoying this for a while, she thought that being just a cat wasn't enough (you know, she wants to be loved ny the guy as a human), so she decided to do the thing many will do without having to transform into a cat: write a love letter. And she did, but of course, she passed it to him in front of the class, which might be a bad idea considering there are jerks in school who will just read out her letter in class so yeah... Hinode is trying to cover for you. No really, since you know the guy? He wouldn't just say it to your face like that. But to appease the class off rumours means hurting the girl, so that sucks. Then, there's the stepmother with the killing blow haha. Technically Miyo has been sneaking out every evening to be a cat, and her parents found out about it. Well, the mother did. Excuse me, stepmother. But yeah, it's an eventuality that she would be found out, and with her pushy attitude to want to talk to the stepdaughter... that's probably where Miyo-chan broke. Yeah I can see why, and I must say this is good enough premise to not be human. And so, as the Mask Seller anticipated, Miyo's human mask fell off (wow, just wow), and he took it away. We'll not talk about what's on his business end, but suffice it to say, that's it. "SWEET CAT LIFE" . Well, besides the lick your butt thing you're good!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> And of course, we reach the other half of the story, to why she wants to return back to being human.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwrmYgZa7Ieg_IUi8I6Evy9rwDLSHB1PCDQX9YC0SUdYIBzaWzLgK-fX3NLkyJDsTpokdB5rwBglN-ajCp3ywaDfk_03oavovLRa8f5oXnsJ2vS0C-ZdfOSda2Drjntp6m77EGUhgHBMc/s320/nakineko_scene1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[OFF]<br>No really, this is a good representation of the "infatuation filter" when we like someone haha<br></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVLL_bD0Ew8f4XzQwPnza3IEEKGOeQclwDLVEZL76RuF5luN_oi5v0i8ozzqjDEUags6VamL_KBTfWo3uSk0KYIcKXhgOh2JwEWK6V4fyUPmiskmyz_IouV2vYs0xWFHLIdBbXtoBkCS4/s320/nakineko_scene2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[ON]<br>No really, this is a good representation of the "infatuation filter" when we like someone haha<br>(lol I like how the friend is still intact)</table></div></div><div></div><div>Since technically she left home to become a cat, then (for now) human Miyo no longer exists. Eh, this is human term for "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/yukuefumei target=_blank>missing</a>", for you cats out there lol. And like every other Anime, if people are desperately finding you when you are missing, that is meaning to live as human. I mean, I probably have a worse life than Miyo-chan so I should become the cat amirite?? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Nah, capitalism can keep me alive haha. Anyways, and also, to add on, that's where Hinode notices how important she is to him, even if all he did so far was just ignore the heck out of this girl who likes to butt him every morning lol. He decides to help Miyo's friend (sorry Mina-chan I only mentioned you until here) (oh yeah, Yoriko) search for the girl even if it's lesson time because... they all care about her. And it's not just only her. The family is looking for her too. Yes, even the stepmother. Yes, even the biological one. All of them. Which is surprising because Miyo-chan never saw this side of all of them before. To the friend who thought to never give up on her despite having done that in elementary school, to the mother to ditched the daughter and the father... everyone. I guess it's also this importance that made Miyo think things through about what it means to be human, and how pathetic that will be leaving all that and being a cat. And then, we have the second drop. Human Miyo is back! Wait, what? Yes, you heard me right; I didn't say cat Miyo is back to human, by the way. Then is the question: who is acting in her place? Remember the Mask Seller who picked up her human mask? The cat took it. No, I don't mean her. Remember there was a cat in the house? That cat. So yeah, the reversal, ladies and gentlemen. You would then argue that why would human Miyo be able to just come back without much care of everything and pretend to like a half-human life previously as a cat? Yeah but this one likes the stepmother. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Well damn, Taro. What'cha gonna do now, Miyo-chan? Amongst all these, I hope at this point you would have noticed Miyo wanting to be human is a lot more than she would have asked for now, isn't it? If you were expecting an ending where those two souls switched back, you aren't that far ahead. So honest is on the ex-cat Kinako then. Not like everyone is mortally evil in this story so that's good news, because Kinako then realised how much she is to the stepmother (for reference let's just use that, and also her name) Kaoru when she started searching for the cat day and night because she thought the cat left the house and never returned. I mean, I wouldn't understand this since I'm not a cat but <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I can understand the human perspective, that's for sure. And as time passes, the transformation slowly turns both of them into their expected forms, making Miyo weaker to understanding human speech (I legit thought the audio had issues lol wtf Netflix) (haha) and behaving more like a cat. Well, besides the licking butt thing lmao I'm not into sc*t. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, in the end the guy Hinode was brought to the cat palace with the help of Kinako who also decide it was best to revert back to a cat, in search of cat Miyo with hopes to bring her back again. And there's the whole thing but we'll talk about production later, and they... I mean, if you get to go out with someone in middle school your life is great. Period. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEU4sAmmrInfJsD189JI_rPVvtrusDG9ohcPfiDy4UhyphenhyphencrQ1hp-hndhG26pNQxrGsbJnjHp3hX9pY1WqWyC0yynq9LBTvo4_qfa-ytCApoV0dd9EsL3gpW8x3X6SA787RDc9ptS0sq0aU/s320/nakineko_taro8.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Miyo-chan crying is too sad so here's cat her being sad haha<br></table><div></div><div>Overall, it was a good lesson to learn. As you can see, production wise it's spectacular, I thought audio was an issue until I realised what happened lol (prolonged use of the cat mask makes you one step closer to being one) (or maybe I'm turning into a cat lmao), the premise of the story in general is pretty good. It was rather complete, it covered a lot of aspects of Miyo's life and even Hinode's to the finest of detail which I'm impressed, talking about teenage dreams and love and everything in between, even friendship as seen by Miyo's relationship with her bestie. I'm thrown away by Miyo's bubbly personality (even though we know of her true self), the Mask Seller's scheming looks even as a cat haha that was actually impressive, how I can recognise <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/22/Shinichiro_Miki target=_blank>the voice of Urahara Kisuke</a> in this movie (yes it's the wisest in the bunch of cats who saved all of them), how I didn't expect Yoriko the friend to be involved in the story so much (I guess it's because of talking about loved ones all of them are heavily involved) (hey I get more Mina-chan so that's good hehe), and lastly, how much the story ties in together. Not that I don't see logic flaws, but I would argue they did explain the story well enough for you to not doubt about everything else. Finally, this thing is a tearjerker. So prepare some tissues; you're gonna need it. And don't "Aoharu ka yo" me because this one isn't a joke. No really, it's a good one. I really enjoyed it. And now even as the theme songs are imprinting on me playing in loop until I finish writing this (lol), I didn't regret picking this one up. My initial impression was really, only from the one trailer which was a "meh" to me, but I think I miss these movies. It's not Studio Ghibli (they don't do these anymore) (Spirited Away, I mean), it doesn't have to go too far, but this is the kind of Anime I want to watch, to be honest. Well, not my age range now but I feel that I can watch this once in a while. A simple story about love, and what it means to be in it. Hey, I'll learn about that someday I guess. But first, can I borrow that cat mask? The girl I like from back when I was in middle school would love me so much since she's a fan of cats haha no seriously how much <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Maybe I also need to transform into a cat to learn what it means to live life as a human. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> I'm good haha no really I'm not faking it I'm not as good in doing that compared Miyo-chan lol</div><div>[MORE COMPARISON SHOTS because they are awesome]</div><div></div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiU0wxhV0VOsReKEyNw-j8dkfo52OtidhIQkkTP7UMSA7eajgfRIl2q-WjUI0f2QF4VTwCCbG1AshaE6uYUeiVpZpPsh8mM_sarnbjF1NO22z63pkwbKnqk5av3z_kgJ2xoD-jIa1KytGE/s320/nakineko_window1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[REALITY]<br>Even then it's not that real, that transformed cat</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdqCxF_PYe3vuRcrw6M3rIMXt5-EDTK6c3Av2zMf7FDzpszTDXh21NtDxJmJvqlI-J-KCPML6_p3ETj-LyPVo3blpTLOeJwC_tcU5SoJg3MQnx2K3i5n0TgFLhD6cdvtTUpUZZbBEhaFc/s320/nakineko_window2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[EXPECTATION]<br>Now <b>this</b> can become a shoujo Anime series haha</table></div></div>P.S.

Hopefully I'll <strike>get used to</strike> like them and put them on the list haha. And of course, <b>yorushika's new songs for Anime "NakiNeko"</b> aren't that bad at all, and of the three theme songs two are going to be in their upcoming album end of July (I have a feeling the ending theme is reserved for the Anime itself and never to be released; it has happened before trust me), so I'll wait until then to give a different impression. Meanwhile, the rest of their catalogue isn't too bad, so I'll check them out next week or something since this week's about to end.Â <br><br> On news from Twitter and beyond, didn't know <b>VELTPUNCH released the rest of their music videos</b> officially on YouTube now so I have liked the wrong videos for more than a decade (sorry guys!), I did just drop by <b>fumika's LINE LIVE</b> for a bit after a nap (lol) and I heard her play a song with her ukelele, <b>SPECIAL OTHERS released another studio live</b> video which is the last of the series I think according to online sources and it's one I gave from their latest album so that's top, congrats Aimer for breaking the Anime theme song charts this new season with her opening theme, and <b>Amamiya Sora played a (short) piano cover</b> of that one song she sang too in Anime "Isshuukan Friends." Yes, that one from Sukima Switch. Ten-chan, didn't know you can piano. Probably she can since I've never gone to her lives but hey, that's a skill.<br><br> So next week... ah. Yeah, we're going to go two weeks without new songs. Well, time to find new songs to listen. I mean, I tried yourness again but man are they not great. But yeah, maybe <b>yorushika</b> then, their songs are easier to swallow, provided if they have impact.Â <br><br><br><br><br> Okay, just a little about the "Phase 3" thing, if you have read about <a href=../../2020/06/the-pandemic-upturn-shopping-spree-2020.html>the PUSS of 2020</a> a couple of posts ago lmao. I thought some of the other will take a while since they were pre-order and won't be sent out on time for some reason, I decided to also jump on TrySail's cancelled tours to buy some merch and recently THEN realised they don't deliver immediately as it'll only start 13th July ie. two weeks from now by the time it reaches to the forwarding service to let me compile, and then ship here. So yeah, I took the liberty to order some more from... uh... official stores instead such that we can pad this shipment and I went for Ayachi. Yeah, I know she married but whatever there is surplus from her tour last year so I'll take a couple. Not cheap though, but still cheaper than the tour pamphlet that costs two photobooks worth, by the way. SoÂ  yeah, review probably by the end of the month instead of next week haha I was really aiming for the holiday next week- Yes it's Election Day here. You can guess where I'm from if you haven't. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully the new shows won't disappoint. I know two out of three won't. Haha bye meanwhile stay sane I'm not already for work I don't even know what to do tomorrow lol haiz bye<br></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text Â© 2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
