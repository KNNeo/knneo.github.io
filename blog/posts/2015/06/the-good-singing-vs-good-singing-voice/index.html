<div class="title">The Good Singing vs The Good Singing Voice vs The Good Voice</div>
<div class="page-header"></div>
<div dir=ltr>As I pre-order Aki-chan's new single, I think about the reasons behind my purchase. Even though the gifts is one of the reasons behind it (you can bet on it) but then it's also about the voice. Let's talk more about it.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>(Note that all opinions are within Klassic Note, and I am definitely in no position to comment about any of them. Purely my own opinion, yes?)</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>THE VOICE</div><div dir=ltr>Let's talk about voice. Over here I shall refer it to p<b>eople who make use of their fantastic voices for speech</b>, in general. That of course includes seiyuus, which is my point of attention. Of course this must also include those voices I take a liking to, whether if they know how to sing a song or not. We all definitely know of people who have a cute voice we like but don't sing that well probably because they aren't made for it (or without training) or they just don't have recognition for tones, like, tone deaf. Of course I wasn't meaning that Aki-chan is tone deaf, but her voice is one of many, especially talking about her being able to speak like the usual Japanese female voice too (watch like Anime "C"), despite her usual cute voice.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>THE SINGING VOICE</div><div dir=ltr>Here I shall refer to those people who have a<b> wonderful singing voice</b>, which probably means whoever has that voice if not made for singing would still kick butt in a karaoke room. Here we talk generically from both sides, from professional singers to professional voices, who have the qualities to sing, even if their singing isn't perfect. That does not happen in many music industries, but it's not like that for Japan. Apparently more voice actors are out singing songs related to Anime or independent (releasing albums of their own) releases, all these show how much they can sing. And don't make me wrong, I think Aki-chan can sing. She is suited for certain music styles, if you listen to her albums. Songs written by for example <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chara_(singer) target=_blank>Chara-san</a> somehow goes along her alley. (Trust me, you don't want to click that link)</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>THE SINGING</div><div dir=ltr>Then we get to the main point of this post, practically. Because we know there are people who cannot sing well or even better than that, we give compromises, such that overall it sounds great, despite it not being able to be termed as "singing", as humans would understand ever since the human voice was discovered to have that ability to sing. Of course, I'm talking hell a lot of history here, and with training one can perfect his or her singing, things like slurs and tone differences when singing can be corrected and improved, but that is another thing all together. I bet you guys walk into a new song and never thought your requirement for listening to that song is how complete this song is PURELY DUE TO THE SINGING. We are not born to understand the deepness that is music appreciation (that doesn't mean I'm not in) (haha), but at least we know: <b>A good singing makes of a good song.</b> And it's everything. It's a package.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>In Aki-chan's case, I've come a long way to compromise many of the song and the singing to give her chances of me having excuses to continue buying her singles and albums, BUT STILL! It's quite a lot on the voice, and the way she sings it. And that, we can never weigh how good it is besides our hearts. (Aw...)</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>Appreciate music, people. That, is also part of the Klassic Note spirit, "always searching for the new melody". (I think I said that somewhere before, but I don't know where. Hmm...) That is part of the singing, you see? Cya guys soon. I've got some singing to comment this weekend.</div><div dir=ltr><br></div><div dir=ltr>[P.S.: Wow I must be crazy. I should stop doing this. Or maybe not? We shall see.]<br>[P.P.S.: Oh I forgot. Also note that I use the word "good" in the title. Which obviously means <b>I recognise I'm not talking about the best songs and singing. </b>I hope that will calm those who are pissed.]</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote"><span class="material-icons small-icons">music_note</span>The Klassic Note</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text Â© 2015 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
