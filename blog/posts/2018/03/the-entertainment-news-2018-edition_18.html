CSS magic, baby~<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=DagashiKashiS210><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Dagashi Kashi 2</span></div></blockquote>For once, the new episode (#DagashiKashiS210) comes back right at Kokonotsu on his aspirations, just when my mom hits me when I want to get work lol. Anyways, the story. Shikada Dagashi gets delivery services, and unexpectedly, it's that piece of cr*p of a dad who is still in hospital who supposedly did not call for the delivery. Right back at the son who actually complains about his hospitalisation, he asked whether the son has been continuing on his manga drawing, considering he's so enthusiastic in running the shop. Funny I already noticed that the moment he was talking to himself last episode on the Internet stuff, but yeah, he's just busy. That's what happens, "Dad", when someone else doesn't want to seriously take care of the shop. Man, and that's not worse off than Hotaru-chan who just left him. How sad can Kokonotsu get? Well with friends who can barely help him, and a deadline to target so that he can get a chance at being a real manga author... Makes you wonder what will happen next. For once, we're going to see progression. And what more of a progression is there other than seeing a familiar figure that stands out so much, you thought it's Hajime-san lol I meant the huge rack haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpFIH2Fo2R3xEgyoOEhAvjEysN-ZkMHxnnvS9pACNzGBPst7VUB64iX0fy8li3kHLtWC6PwwOQPNQwjeXqdJM579Y2U1xBnTfiCbFBuR4-iPzcvg2qB7b_xBmWShyU8-AQoALu9k9e7YKn/s320/dagashikashi_S2_10_hospital.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How did that toe become a leg injury?

In the new episode where Nishikata hasn't got rid of his 'acute embarrassment syndrome' as I would like to call it (#TakagiSan10), the easy solution to not getting pranked by the girl is just to not get embarrassed. No really, can I just show him porn and wake him up now?? lol Okay the episode. The two decide to compare heights, and what's the best way to do it? Without using a wall even if there are plenty around? Things we only do with our siblings (you guys don't?), these guys are doing it. Can't help but make the class think that they are going out, huh. On the other side, we have the wonderful trio who somehow didn't manage to solve Yukari-chan's problem of "finding someone to flirt with" lol man can we just ignore the sh*t out of that idiot and get to this already? (I DEMAND A SEASON TWO haha) On the other hand, Nishikata is now worse than machine learning, failing to understand human tricks and constantly falling into them, even obviously given a way out. (Then again, not everyone knows how to twist a question in one's favour) So yeah, for the lead up to his plan two ask a "would you rather" question is tricky for him to say the least, but to get him immediately just by the options he came up with... Takagi-san is not just smart, Nishikata is just dumb. Let's take a while (it's been some time) to talk about the questions and how (I) people would normally answer them, without the embarrassment. (All questions assume we're against Takagi-san, but not as Nishikata)<br><br><ul><li> "Tasty drink with fever VS disgusting drink" - We'll take the disgusting one, but throw it away. Simple. And the tasty one if I'm against Takagi-san. Then again, she won't ask such a question<li>"No allowance VS No teasing" - This one has its problems since Takagi-san didn't answer the "for life" part, and I don't want to assume her family is rich... I don't tease people anyway. Do you guys do it? As a hobby? lol<li>"She disappears VS Get teased by her forever" Can we change the latter option to be "be with her forever" because I'll take that any time of the day haha also you cannot choose the former option because the Director says so lol<li>"Zero scores for life VS Kissing" I don't kiss schoolgirls <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Also, life is not all about tests to be honest; Nishikata needs to be woke about that. So much to sacrifice just to kiss? She didn't even say kiss where? Ever seen kissing on the back of the hand before?</ul><div>I'll count the last one void since it's incomplete and I can't do handstands either haha #DamnYouTakagiSan you got me</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8_hbTaF0rr10Wk6B0GI2xyHXXXxiM3Dh9_g8eQoZ49jowPMRXN64fBtTnjGqQ_nskHlKcvEe59iOtvCdBxHZoh89TB5d4CpHIljbsB0D2Feixsb_ufypkWg_hXNBwRhAS-7Ajzm7XxTsJ/s320/takagisan10_backs.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Seriously I'm totally enjoying this haha #DamnYouNishikataSan</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJPIVxKS8WRJtdkdMg37qwPQVYa-ieMgSa0e2Czvd8RX-CgLcFag5OMyzyg_VerzK0R4QOjd2Ak1Dt7LL-PrvbDvqttN-LcZA7iKi4BiMAXVwBdDgcyGB-WM02vhb80MZpDCG9izOgzfEr/s320/takagisan10_invitation.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>And I hope these guys have woken him up about being with Takagi-san.<br>Well clearly, he hasn't.

You bet it's all the push-ups haha <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> BTW is the "just fit" thing in the manga? Anyone can confirm that for me? lol</div>P.P.S. Hey I must say, the last questions in this episode perfectly summarises Nishikata's feelings for Takagi-san. But seriously, when we getting the episode where Nishikata watches porn? No? Not even using his phone? Haha<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=3Lion41><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Sangatsu no Lion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Well, this is good enough." And then his inner thoughts haha the old geezer can't stand her grandkids taste in food lol</div></blockquote>Let me get this out of my gut first before we don't talk about the old man: being him sucks to see generations of women before and after him help him out in the shop. There, I said it. The new episode (#3Lion41) has plenty to talk about, so let's get the best parts out of the way first. The festival. Aside from the above stuff I've mentioned, I'm actually impressed personally but Hina-chan's enthusiasm, maybe because she's relieved off that burden of a classmate in school which we'll talk about in a while, but yeah, it's doing good for the family. Hey, even Kiriyama came in to help too, so that's good news. Also, we got some more insight into the life of the traumatised classmate Chiho. Once again, I'll never understand this because I don't have this weak of a heart for society to think I'm good to bully (I'm male too so that sucks haha), but at least I know one thing: That living in a world of care and concern will help remove that past. But of course, as the story has mentioned, it comes back to hit her once in a while. Well, time's the best medicine but the problem is its long. So, I guess it'll be some time before she can put that away. On the other hand, the school hasn't let their hands of the mastermind that is Takagi (not that other show that one is cute haha) but the head teacher just decided to wrap it up, I guess. Not wrong from his perspective, but it's hard to explain life to a kid. Try doing that yourself. You'll end up just dictating your life experience and totally forgetting that your life is just one but many who have experienced otherwise. Hey, if the parents/surroundings make who you are and they are bad, don't be like them. Oh well, she doesn't have to hear this anyway. We may be in for more positive stuff next episode (I LOVE the festival part btw totally cute and lovely) as the season draws to an end, and I haven't decided on which theme song to give. Ugh, my head hurts as bad as Chiho lol<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuE93xqHp_2HAfIBo9yKvtsyYBc1BJyE0pvzMXtkzteDoIKaViWjj6zl8-dltX6V8thNreic9Q8EHi9byln2rCs3zSDnMEeg6XtDUHbw14A1cAiEImlYsrgAPc50riuq0xbMtNAYZ8QL2L/s320/sangatsunolion41_momo1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>And since I can't resist seeing Momo-chan again, here's a couple of her reactions.<br>This one is her after eating something awesome...</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0Wsd6-Cpf2h5HdCO7wh-rQ-djnoXqs1NkV8yeXNaZ0CyKjELyuhxtydB61oEnFRMB1u6OJ_XZF5GptOmaXst36xTWfPmyC5d0-dntwqHQ75WN3zcSxBmr8HpkH03Xg8bYd69uvGrP6qPA/s320/sangatsunolion41_momo2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>...

"Anime magic", we call it haha<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SlowStart11><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Slow Start</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"(We're) going to invade!" Man, Kamuri-chan with all the puns lol</div></blockquote>Just a good reminder that it's summer and not Thanksgiving (which happens around November), the new episode (#SlowStart11) is about - you guessed it - the summer festival. Screw holiday assignments because we're going to have a blast! And yeah, you bet Kamuri-chan can eat. Also, that boysih accent. Also also, the puns. Didn't notice half the jokes came from her instead of the lively Tama-chan, who can't help but be spoiled of her opinions of her friends thanks to her two elders lol. To liven things up, we add on more of the regular (and even irregular) cast so that we can gather everyone around for... a summary? Yep, as much as Tama-chan said it's starting, it's about to end for us. Sorry, guys. Not spoilers already at this point lol. Anyways, the episode. Highlights include (I will always mention the niche stuff, just so you know) the interaction between the teacher and Eiko, Hannen showing herself off from the moment she was suggested to go to the festival by Shion ("camouflage" lol) to her revealing yukata (hehe), Sachi's seriously sadistic replies to Tama-chan who kindly fixed her sandal, and the end card. You suck if you didn't notice the voice actresses' lovely drawings of their own characters. All in all, wonderful episode - or if I'm underestimating it - an awesome episode to show the wonders of slice-of-life Anime, and all in all we may have to end it on an emotional note?? Hey, I wonder. Hana-chan, are you going to say it? Are you?? We shall see it ourselves next week.<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisS4UG-7-JaxJIzcxkxBErg14xFt-yTrG2LsCJTCPwCiASy51GD3O_db8Q78yGmYNOYVUhXxVq8api2AxrmAVoU2NIVThjEJjZ5V1NgDMW-L0tmFD1VPdQS-oIuhnvhxMNhw-z5rtz9J6k/s320/slowstart11_tomato.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>My best laugh this episode is...

The end. Okay, just joking. Let's continue where we left off. Story is that Machi (the shrine maiden from the West of the island, the older one) is interested in special beings and how they tie to Kairyuu-sama. Well now that we know of her hidden intentions of noticing she is being spied on (lol), there is also little myth about this being untrue, as the Priestess of the island has also revealed the one human who is also under this category. This chapter also clarifies why certain beings are outside of the equation, especially the tiger (Lord of the North) and the cat (Lord of the West, also Suzu-chan's sensei) because they were both apprentices of the old grandma in the village. Yeah, that old-woman-turned-kid-youkai was also a martial art practitioner. Other than that, we now only have one mystery left to solve, and what has that got to do with the recent events that have happened concerned the Lord of the island? Hmm, things are getting interesting all of a sudden...<br>P.S. Most of the images are either too many text or just panties. So I opted for neither.

As of now, maybe not. Which means I'll be giving the other theme song, I guess.<br><br>Talking about that, <b>UNISON SQUARE GARDEN's new single</b> sounded disappointing to be honest, but then again their style in composition and music flows in the single, and I can't say I hate it, but I'll give it critical review as a conclusion to this... reluctance ever since I heard this in the Anime. <b>Yogee New Waves' new EPÂ </b>is probably the best of the releases which came out this week, and I must say it's mostly because I've gotten used to their style maybe. <b>TrySail's new single</b> is on the shelf already, <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/974117633908924416 target=_blank>just in case you didn't know</a>. I've yet given a listen to FLOWER FLOWER's new album (as a closure to their presence in Klassic Note tbh I'm not liking yui's new style), and I've given a listen to <b>Anime "Slow Start" Charatcer Song Album</b>, and... thanks to the one guy who was producer to the album, I literally picked the most familiar style which is reminiscent to Hanazawa Kana's albums (does "<a href=https://twitter.com/roundkitagawa target=_blank>Kitagawa</a>" ring a bell?), so yeah, Eiko-chan's character song. But seriously, me giving Anime over mainstream even if it has been some time since my last Anison review... my brain is broken somehow lol. <b>Roys </b>(the girls I've given the Anime ending theme song but gave up watching the show on) released a new digital single yet again for another show, and I don't think it's bad but man, where's the formal release? Okay never mind I haven't made my mind yet on that one<br><br>On new news, <b>SID is releasing a new Anime best album</b> which - you might have guessed it - has most of the songs I've listened to over the years. Two songs are stopping me from buying that album off the shelf right now, and one of them is a self-cover of their own composition written for LiSA (if you found the music video I tweeted familiar) so yeah, still mulling over that one. Technically it's their song, which sounds familiar to a situation I have to deal with when YUI (the one in 2010) released her self-cover of STEREOPONY's... 3rd single, yeah, topic song "I do it". Hmm, I'll probably give it I guess it's a short song anyway, the SID one. I've also not gotten my hands on <b>Ryokuoshoku Shakai and their 1st full album</b> (from here on it'll be "Ryokushaka") as mentioned last week, and damn, I really want to give them chance. On other news, <b>Kalafina is broken</b>. Like, literally. As summarised perfectly in the Tweet below, we have little to anticipate once the next release (in Fall apparently) gets around after the shuffling:<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en> You know that the moment they remove Kajiura-sensei (the only composer) from the group, Kalafina has officially ended.<br><br>Oh well.

It's kind of late and I could use some sleep after a day of productive work... done from home. Man, I can't do work at home the distractions are too many. Maybe getting a government job is better. Without Internet and limited mobile data (if I make it happen) I'll be more focused on the job. Yeah, my mom is nagging on me finding a job already. To be honest? If you don't have the skill set can you go brag about having them? I can't, and I'm not a confident person by nature, so yeah, job hunting will be later, I suppose. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully by then I can finish that project of a project (there's two active and I cleared one just now) ("cleared" as in "I did my part liao dear partner it's up to you to do the rest" lol) someday within the next two weeks. And I'll update when I get to review TrySail next week with the revival of my phone, the dear Nexus 5X.
