I'm going for an interview tomorrow. Wish me luck. Probably also will fail like, 2 minutes into the "interrogation" because I suck at my university major and any question they throw at me I'll just screw it up. So yeah, wish me luck.<br><br>You may notice, therefore, that my reviews for the Anime below may take a dip in quality (is there one?) so yeah, maybe you should take it more seriously? Haha I don't know like I don't know what to do for tomorrow too <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AsobiAsobase05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Asobi Asobase</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Two of them graduated, one transferred, and the other was teleported" She WHAT??</div></blockquote>Wow that took quite a turn, that pen to the other table. I'm referring to the animation btw haha.Â <span style=text-align:center>Oh and Hanako-chan? That's not Harajuku style that's more like arson style lol.Â </span>The new episode (#AsobiAsobase05) has so many laughs, I just forgot I've got real life problems to deal with haha. Firstly, Hanako sets a restaurant on fire. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Besides totally summarising what happened, we need to mention a little bit more about... you know, Hanako's fashion style. I just hope this is not her usual style when she leaves the house it'll make the fire department really busy lol. Also, don't ask me how that happened but man, does indirect arson count as a crime? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Secondly, we're introduced with a new character. She is Aozora-san, and... she is suspected of being a futanari. Yes. That. (Don't search if you don't know I can't put the mature rating gate in front of you) Despite what might feel like it from her unusual activities in school, and the fact that she might be voiced by a male (no really, it is) (Edit: It's Yuuki Aoi btw no wonder), she apparently has perfect excuses which make her look like a normal girl who Hanako hates haha. But hey, we gotta wonder. Next, my favourite segment. We're introduced with another character Oka-san, who for some reason, just "lost" all of her members in the supernatural club she was in. So yeah, kind of a problem 'cos the club's gonna get disbanded by the school. She overheard the girls play an Ouija game board, and decide to join in. To add on, she brought her own game into the table, and it's probably the scariest hide-and-seek the girls have ever played. Well, spoiler alert because someone took away the doll of "Maeda" (lol) in the end so I wouldn't call that scary but Olivia and Hanako practically died so... we only need one more member to form back the supernatural club now? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (Aozora-san you want to join? lmao) Last but not least, ranked second in this episode, is the talk about having babies. I would say this got as far as Seitokai Yakuindomo level of wrong, and the teacher's involvement didn't make it any better, but thank goodness Hanako decided not to have kids anymore. The funnier things are the common knowledge questions we deem common aren't as common on these middle school girls. You guys know what a French Kiss is, don't you? I know, because it's a kiss between French people. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> I mean, doesn't have to be both of them one of them can be like, the great-grandmother is French will do lol<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIQlzOvzmObpSzuqhvuKSNI58Ug3m-Q0dmBrg_8zSpm4pyoNswrhO7dLYrt17ct2Wur_Bc3qyKS0AXoCKhyphenhyphenvLtnyv8neN4NtKuFWRcII_-Bwhu7k89nBwIqhZ-q0zYRpUwHvl38p4Cto-O/s320/asobiasobase5_hanako2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>No really what's with all the censorship using wiggly lines lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKGxfOh6A18Amvo9pXCu2vssV2l0k8VNyje_BSb-gsCoFs1xFKax2SYg_F3bkUoOShWkNjPOprMqv5_O4AMWah2h0zmyAzhN8aP85ywvcZrfqPrIpuxS02959qo_QpGVGI5pTHrBxqnH6s/s320/asobiasobase5_sleep.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Okay I admit she was cuter than the cat because <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3zxnlQ1Yb3nUPvCVTiBm-4rzwHc6XYjp0FxHWVAZNIeag8454sR9y8Mhl8nx8IXmp66C8UB6dhYZRqYR3phtv0zdmzY8MOvkrRzKuiTgyKg-cuQzS_6ufaMjpGVIbhrWtJlwwLc-t0FHI/s1600/asobiasobase5_cat.jpg target=_blank>it looks RETARDED</a> lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Haha these idiots are so dumb</div></blockquote>Wow that's quite a lot of truth to digest after one peaceful episode. The new episode (#AttackOnTitan40) talks about the story behind the government, and how the royalty came to be. According to most accounts from Erwin, Historia's past and the father, we can come up with a pretty good deduction. Allow me to paint the inglorious history for you guys. Story goes - as seen from episode 1 - that a century ago, humans were forced to be behind walls with the emergence of Titans. In there, they hid behind the walls while maintaining prosperity, keeping what's left of the human species alive. Well, at least they's what they tell you. We now know that the government of the Trost district/country/kingdom had to take severe measures to ensure peace within the walls. I mean, why be so extreme with its internal affairs? Why only do the Titans attack at episode 1? Remember there was total peace before that? So yeah, something must have happened with the government itself, and apparently, it was due to the then King who was not meant to be. At this point, the relation between humans in Trost and Titans felt more like a threat, but yeah, the current governing body is balancing between keeping its people alive and quiet while making sure they all don't get killed. Too bad with Eren that might not be possible. Eren's Titan powers might likely happen thanks to the new knowledge of intelligent Titans (read the eyecatch ie. image in the middle of the episode for details) where it is possible for a Titan to get stronger by consuming another. Chances are Eren's dad got hold of such a sample (don't ask me how) and "fed" it to Eren, resulting in his warcry-like Titan powers, which obviously could prove useful in battle. Considering this, the current government would like to of course, take Eren in and you know, NOT make him the superpower. You know, like, let him get eaten by probably someone who is within the walls and knows how to control that power already. Lastly, I'll end this story with supposed plans of Erwin and Levi's squad right now. Erwin aims to seek for the truth to the point of sacrificing for the greater good, and Levi... let's just say his cowboy-looking brethren is getting in the way. That, we'll have to leave it to next week. Man, this is getting exciting.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWRg6U2NEQX2sMEESLFkPsutFfGIsjCL1lAtYI0V63C9TEsRCEgDrDbIcK9V33Y9QKF9snsUVLDTjVxdXkTL9vVBy7hSk60a4PhAOhCiWmarNowHMq_bnPHlokAMNroS3GrIk-Kybc4tYk/s320/attackontitan40_reiss.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE KING? WTF HAPPENED?? lol</table>P.S. Society advice #40: Do not kill anyone in front of kids. Even if he or she is not one's family.<br>P.P.S. Also also, congrats on Hange taking the new role of Commander of the Scouts! Pity there wouldn't be many people left to command after this lol<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Tsukumogami03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Just who is borrowing things from your shop?" Your husband, for starters. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Wow! No introduction that was played over the past two episodes? That's new. Haha okay the new episode (#Tsukumogami03) brings in the new #TheGossip character (oh that's the new hashtag now haha) Nadeshiko, recently bought in by the Izumoya, by Okou-san since in relation, Sanae-sama who was the wife of the first episode victim lol and needed a change in apparel as <strike>all of them</strike> most of them are childish and rather inappropriate as a grown-up according to the mother. (Sorry ladies of today the women of the past were cooler haha) And this difference is mainly because (and I don't want to conclude this quickly but) the mother and daughter lacked the communication to listen to each other's concerns. So yeah, the mother probably gave in since the husband did not mind of the childish apparel anyway. And that is thanks to Usagi the tsukumogami and the comb, who was originally used for a mother to comb her daughter's hair. Sorry for sending that purple bat to go do scouting, but overhearing the conversation between Sanae-sama and Okou-san you gotta find out because it's #TheGossip haha God I love this show. Turns out that is of course, Okou-san's obsession for a newly released comb which she could not afford, so yeah, Seiji is still fine since the one handsome guy who the sister likes did not come back lol. Although that leaves us for more stories next time maybe, I would prefer #TheGossip to continue as is instead of going into the romance Anime direction haha. Sorry Seiji, you are not going to get any love from your sister lol. Also also, there are so many expressions in this show I can't even talk about all of them because the story of #TheGossip every week is so complete and good I have to share, so be sure to check out the most entertaining bunch of Anime characters I've ever seen in a decade. No seriously, Usagi (voiced by Iguchi Yuka) is great tbh. Also also (I'm Usagi now lol), we may agree with you Sanae-sama's mother on the rabbits origin about bringing luck in numbers but man have you not heard of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Austin target=_blank>Thomas Austin</a> dear woman <a href="https://youtu.be/qKX9Oq8UvBI?t=2m19s" target=_blank>Australia is hating you now lmao</a><br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidVTBXxULEaGeJYKu6nFNNBFcaj4Y0N-7FmWn7GBi9kn2hLSw7gyjxxXHaOhCB9gOfP7nohKQHZPWXUYe-HJx9nOp7HDwgbtRz7Wlt5F39Wlv8nEbi7z-tNTAfXYmHGTCa3ji-3dRlKmg4/s320/tsukumogami03_notetsu.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW my colleagues want me to do sh*t work but I don't want to be made use of</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMdiBiXJcKMwUXJzfR4sZcgq33oh45GCNnCpyUZDEf7Arvm0ufo2CMps2a2U4XreCDGw5ldwN0hKpbEyt70jmeU4dbcuAjgLfX0dlgVuydj_8pZPv0I6mINrbmTc7ud97oHuZk9FtgUCuR/s320/tsukumogami03_glare.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW my colleagues want me to do sh*t work but I don't want to be made use of</table></div></div>P.S.
