<div class=news-thumbnail><img loading=lazy src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyaE-adCwitoF_hFg9cmC16d8U3B9YrckSsf69ZVxxD5kIxvsGvot1QeLV2aIjEkGBIj_yI2pef8qNg22jYq_VeIYYt-4yfvVhrWU_RRK7uq_MY_P_g5lujYm9Jx_aADH1kKNvMWNHiJVS/s320/asobiasobase03_password.jpg></div><div class=hashtags></div>Hey. So it has come to my mind I will be reviewing a couple more Anime episodes every week, so in order to reduce the content on the now I would call "Main" issue, I'm going to do this like how those newspaper presses like to do: slot in an extra issue for either latest news or some extra content compiled for the release. Introducing for the first time in Klassic Note Web Reports: The Entertainment News - Anime Extra!!!<br><br>"It's the extra! It's the extra! Come grab a copy to read all about it!!" I wished a newspaper boy would read this haha<br><br>(*Bear in mind that this only contains half the Anime episodes reviewed for the week as late night Sunday Anime is technically not within reach for the Sunday main issue. Be sure to check out the main issue too for more... Anime reviews.) (No one cares, huh.)<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AsobiAsobase03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Asobi Asobase</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>I don't know which quote from the student council president isn't the most critical lol</div></blockquote>God they gotta start the show with something out of the world like armpits okay it's not alien we just don't... okay let's talk about the other stuff haha. The new episode (#AsobiAsobase03) seriously always wants to one-up that going to school Anime as they did their own Anime Betrayal scene too. Damn, it's not a coincidence after all. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> The story goes, as usual, in three parts. Firstly, I spoiled the story above. So yeah, the girls were playing as usual, and Kasumi hates the punishment of doing work, of course, shadowed by her experience with her sister, but this time around, Olivia gets to set the rules, just without the work part. So armpits? Sure. Thing is, they've got a stink bomb amongst them. I won't say who, but it's the one who put the most makeup haha. Next, is the teacher? Wow didn't expect the English teacher to be in focus at any point, but yes <strike>this is now</strike> she is now the adviser. And with no minimum amount of members and occupying an unregistered room brings us to our last part: the takeover. The Shougi Club recently filed permission to use the classroom where the girls are in, and instead of conciliation, the Shougi Club president decided to play a game with them. I mean, it's a good choice considering this is a pastimes-themed Anime, but yeah, guess who won. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> As everything might seem status quo now, we do have some sort of development, although I must say it's still riddled with absurd jokes, crazy actions and... seriously horrible reaction faces. No seriously, can we just stop that? *speaks in Hanako's voice* <em>It's disgusting.</em> <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> OKAY THE TEACHER PART OF THIS EPISODE IS STUPID WHY PUT AN ADULT IN THIS SHOW THIS IS FOR CUTE ATTRACTIVE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WITH SPECTACULAR NEWBIE FEMALE VOICE ACTORS DAMMIT lol (I mean, I gotta scream like them somehow)<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyaE-adCwitoF_hFg9cmC16d8U3B9YrckSsf69ZVxxD5kIxvsGvot1QeLV2aIjEkGBIj_yI2pef8qNg22jYq_VeIYYt-4yfvVhrWU_RRK7uq_MY_P_g5lujYm9Jx_aADH1kKNvMWNHiJVS/s320/asobiasobase03_password.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>There's a "spelling error" on there, otherwise it's called "kekkon shitai"<br>(ie.

Eh just a reminder to all who are making new social media accounts please note that all new passwords must contain at least one capitalised alphabet, non-capitalised alphabet and a numerical digit. (So, the teacher's suggestion doesn't apply. Might I suggest "Kekkon&amp;Hayaku69" lmao)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan38><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Man, that still sounds like a LOT of traitors in the Trost district can't they get all of them at once?? lol</div></blockquote>Wow, that was quite a comeback. Considering the lack of an ending theme FOR THIS SEASON??? And the fact that the opening theme is not done by the one Linked Horizon, you got to think the stuff from this new episode (#AttackOnTitan38) onward could be nothing but a haphazard attempt to make sure audience like us don't forget about them. And yes, my suspicions have been confirmed. This season in particular focuses on two main things which will blow your mind BEFORE we even get into the plot. Red Dead Redemption 2 and... Captain Levi for some reason. Okay, the former is reference to the... bunch of killers with... air-powered guns? I don't know now. We're in the... 13th century, right? Weird things aside, let's talk about plot. Several things were mentioned in recollection to what happened in the previous season, that the Scouts now have a mission to track down whoever did all this to them, those weird, fully grown and matured Titans with some level of conscience, but also the importance of Eren (as a growing human-Titan hybrid similar to those out there who kicked his ass) and Christia/Historia (considering she knows a lot and she's of royal blood?) in this particular case. Problem is, I'm totally speculating because this show is not that interesting and it's constantly surfacing in this episode all the time, we have a lot of rats in out midst. Yes, remember there was only one in the first season of the Anime series? Well now... I can't even count. The Military Police in city might be involved, but also this can go up even further to... I don't know, maybe the King knows something of the Titans which will lead to an eventuality where we see a world of Titans through the obliteration of humans in its entirety? Hey, they didn't tell you about the other districts under this kingdom. Well, at least we <em>know</em> there's a kingdom now. All in all, too much plot, plenty of conspiracy, and little action. Was Attack on Titan like this before? I mean, it's despair up till now, but this... we going emotional at some point? Hopefully. All this politics is making me sick. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7-R5qucG1usJUNlzix0pg48je9g4ZDbeubuEkYcPwx_DyeDbVYyzsJ1Rz6mrfvYinOhMGQrYAL5jw5ijLhrt5ZhtOKjHFdvpvyPP3SVEx3J4of7171fzYwN4wuh68uOddx3JCpdY0A2Yz/s320/attackontitan38_caress.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Hey, Armin IS indeed female so this is normal lol</table>P.S. It doesn't need to take more time to figure out that much in this show, I suppose. They like to give it away many a times when they expected you to notice. I mean, it's the season premier episode anyways. We've got some ways to go from here.<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Tsukumogami01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style=text-align:start>"What do you think of my hair ornament?"

And hoho I like this show has the gossip 'cos what are you going to do in the Edo period (covering 16th-17th century) anyways? Firstly, some context as to why I'm watching this. I was here because of Mikakoshi. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, I was here because she tweeted about her in this show. So yeah, and it's been some time since I watched a historical-based mystery Anime, so here I am. And boy, am I wanting to continue with this series, it's quite interesting. Now, the first episode (#Tsukumogami01) makes me think that the tsukumogami are like a paparazzi squad where they can go eavesdrop on others to help solve mysteries in the district. Then aside, the story goes of a rental shop (in this case it's not just specific items like DVDs(?), bicycles, umbrellas (lol China) and cars etc.) who lends items to people who might have a need for it. Say, you want a change in accessories. You don't have to keep buying them because in this pawn shop you can "sell" your current one and switch it with another, technically speaking. So yeah. But the exception in this Edo period shop is, many of them are possessed by gods. (We're not talking about single-entity overlords here like Jesus and Buddha, mind you) Gods which manifest out of care of the items treasured by humans. Amongst them are (I'm going Yachiru naming mode here because I don't remember their names) bat brat, moon head, fake smoker, miniature female shop owner and hair comb rabbit lol. They live in the shop Seiji and Okou are in (the latter being the female elder sister here), and first up we have... well this is literally a gossip episode so I'll leave it for the tsukimogami to give you some sweet headlines, but yeah, it's a marriage come unwanted. So... you know we're going to hear this often, but yeah, if you had no choice but to sell your treasured items for survival, you gotta do it. That's too bad. On the other hand, just die with it already the god in it is more important than you haha. Lastly, I would like to compliment on how well this show was done. The animation is great, the story is told well with modern society references in case you never lived in the Edo period in Japan lol (they need to explain the koku thing though), and there's sick theme songs to get the kids in. All in all, it may make of quite a history lesson that I've never seen before, and this might take be on a journey. My last time was that Koisento OVA back in 2010 which technically is not an accurate depiction of history anyways. but yeah, I expected that kind of theme songs. So yeah, sorry Shishido Kavka; Kuraki Mai will be next on my music list.<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitcQbUo0bSHKGSZIWOyVHJnfBQPdEwWctI6Ffn7xpEaD0BxuNK3ewWyduQ7I6oQvid6ZnU676FtW4tp_K0PFX6VLoL6YsePRd48Ti_XL1wica02T6EcKxsrGmJE_r0JwN9SzgMv0pkvn1j/s320/tsukumogami01_eyecatch.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you like just any, any one these cute characters feel free to watch this you won't be disappointed</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZB3hQQ2G6Yuh8OI2kMQdFfh30cELxOMOR2USj1d8Gvx44SrDBSTu0ECvrs4ScLVq4-zCCL2oxNDj7czkgx0H1ZVC4OxVP3gzSJ0cO7jWJGilRMDo9pkhE3BC0fWviqYZrK_bs7wBFYljc/s320/tsukumogami01_pout.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is the 16th century equivalent of a "pu pu" in those moe Anime haha</table></div></div>P.S. "You want to quit?" NO I'LL NEVER QUIT I'LL BE WITH YOU FOREVER haha that's me as Seiji if Okou was ever Mikakoshi in her past life hehe<br>P.P.S. Mikakoshi sounds perfect in this setting tbh everyone else is just there to compliment her voice talent HAHAHA *breathes in on cigar which has a tsukumogami*<br><br><br><br><br>That'll be it. This will be posted on Mondays for now and until then... I hope these Anime don't air on Sundays I may not live in the US but I'm still behind time here give me a break haha. On the other hand... I might end up with 5 SHOWS THIS SEASON??
