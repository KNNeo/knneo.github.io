So yeah, gotta cram watch these in one night then.<br><br>We're going to say goodbye to one(?) of the shows this week though, so we'll be back to normal next issue lol oh wait<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan49><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span class=head-title>Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"There's more than just Titans outside these walls" I mean, how did YOU know, ARMIN?? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Okay I better check if I did mention that Eren's father was from outside of the walls or not... Oh I didn't haha good. The new episode is an episode of hope. Man, how many episodes of this series we get one like this? Not many- Wait, there's something in the ending theme song?

But first, where we left off. (Oh yeah, this will be the mobile site thumbnail too, oops) This week's episode (#AttackOnTitan49) was an episode of hope. We now know from the internal meeting that Eren's father was one from outside of the walls, and apparently he may be coming in to save the people within, but unfortunately encountered that memory-wiping of a Titan from the Reiss family, I assume. The rest, is probably as you know from the Commandant. Moving on, Levi now takes control of the serum, even though he got it from... Kenny (wow I forget the names of dead people <em>real</em> quick), and showed it to the higher-ups. He also had a confrontation with Erwin, who practically isn't fit to be a soldier right now. Well, he can still ride a horse. And scream. And wave his sword in the air. That's good enough as a Commander, right? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, re-taking of Wall Maria is in place, everyone had one final night eating the rarest food in their world now which is meat, and the three main guys talked through the night. Man, if we ever get a beach episode in this series I'll... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> On other things, Beredo- what's his name, may already be waiting for them. Hey, not so fun now, isn't it? *looks at official website* Wait, this is it for now? Okay, then I better summarise. No wonder it was such a positive episode, this one.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4519 u-sz_w_100-sp js-lazy" data-loaded data-src=https://shingeki.tv/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/f94f377bdb5b5f10e6c53a9dc068a886-292x400.jpg height=400 src=https://shingeki.tv/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/f94f377bdb5b5f10e6c53a9dc068a886-292x400.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=292><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Still Season 3, huh.<br>(Hey! It's <b>the sea!</b>)</table><div style=text-align:justify>This season (I wouldn't say that actually since next season is also called "Season 3" for some reason) brought us a lot of hope. Mainly revealing the truth behind most of the stuff within the walls, we now know of how Titans came to be (or can form), mostly through injecting that serum in you hoping that you're of royal blood so it works best on you. However, it may be more than that as they continue to witness the marvel of technology ahead they can't comprehend. Moreover also, the conspiracy regarding the politics ruling the walls. We also knew about Historia's real identity, and how she contribued to bringing peace once again to the now reduced region. Hey, we gotta expend again someday. Too bad it isn't this season. Things I got to wonder are why the theme songs barely lasted one-cour (which is on average 12 episodes) (okay it was close), why the haphazard conclusion which will be slated for explanations half a year later (like, why), and still mainly why the humans haven't gotten wiped yet. I mean, with the powers of the Titan at this point? An ambush would have easily wiped everyone in the walls. Hey, ever wondered how the walls were built WITHOUT the Titans f**king them? Me too. These, and many more questions unanswered, but I guess we'll just have to wait. Bring back better theme songs, man. I feel ashamed to have to give Linked Horizon another song lol (Like, where's cinema staff and Hikasa Youko?)</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyvtdWZbXmEvBDZXAkOipdoo_Fq9As_xUt25TXYsoDTFgXahSImQ5F14eJV7EkHTz0DHug_xWm6B814FWyN0Fy4THl9ol2bZNHl1J1jsJaXTiOPMBGTzzasBsFNpFz2qIdJKpy3fmiBsAC/s320/attackontitan49_erwin.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Let's end the "season" with two of the most pathetic people this time.<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcZRtRBrnVF8CskUBZ6q7qIy1Nce3UjX4ikelP39WKUMgbadYCU4t2edCntpZprtvXHn4dVvCQ_GiVyfkni_wNrtd3Th1NaboikompmiwcmYBYu3ZXhBO4IXSc03PmZBnXBHd6u3pc0ZV4/s320/attackontitan49_sasha.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Let's end the "season" with two of the most pathetic people this time.<br>(lmao)</table></div></div>P.S. All that idiot can do is scream, that Erwin. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> &lt;= Very deep meaning in context btw go figure it out yourself<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Tsukumogami12><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span class=head-title>Tsukumogami Kashimasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"He made a fair bit from the rice market in the Kansai region..." Hey Sataro you forgot your 80 ryo debt to Okou-san? You broke her stuff, remember? (Also she could use the money to pay off the lending shop's debt <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span>)</div></blockquote><div style=text-align:justify>Hey despite Notetsu sounding like he's talking crap he actually makes sense. Not because of finding another woman, no no, but with the uncle he can ask around in there what they need, that last incense burner. (Notetsu gained 11 episodes worth of balls to say it though lmao) In this final episode (#Tsukumogami12) of this wonderful, wonderful series that is... oh come on, you guys know it. In the conclusion to #TheGossip we finally got the happy ending we all wanted. Did I wait 12 episodes for this to happen? You bet I did! Did I wait 12 episodes for Mikakoshi to flirt the sh*t out in front of a man?? YOU BET I DID!! Did I wait 12 episodes for Sataro-san to be indirectly rejected by Okou? You bet- Wait, what?? Okay, let's go over things. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Firstly, what happened. As we have learnt of last episode, Sataro-san is in town. And with Seiji's inquisitive mind, he figured out most of his motives for returning quick enough, of course, with great help this time around thanks to the tsukumogami which they keep saying they shouldn't converse with, but heck, this is last episode so we can break the rules haha. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, back here. And so, Seiji went on a rough but eventful search for what Sataro is seeking, and where he is likely at now (stuck in the store room, so typical a hiding place lol). Hey, he did report home but other than that, he was totally prepared to marry Okou, I swear. Unfortunately, he thinks that all women are that fimicky that they will remember things like "Oh I broke something worth 80 ryo so I'm going to pay it back to you" and then we'll also propose to you for the marriage so now my mom can't say anything? Okou be like "what an idiot", and gave a scolding to Seiji too. Yes, guys. Apparently girls don't care about money. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, jokes aside, but yeah, something Seiji and Sataro actually have in common that they will never understand (actually, I think I do) (but does that make me a woman? lol) and that is they are too apprehensive when it comes to love. If you really care, everything else should be forgiven. Hey, says a lot to what's bad about you and your girl is living with it. Think about it. I don't have one but you probably have, so think about it.</div><br><div style=text-align:justify>With all the forces coming together to solve this final mystery, and an afterword to conclude the series, I must say this is the best show this season. And yes, I mean that. Didn't really expect this ending, but I'll take it. Just like taking the debt for Izumoya, the incense burner from Sataro, the brush with a rabbit carving, the cigarette holder, the portrait of a moon, the figurine of a dancer, and the handy-dandy waist accessory. All in all, to deliver a sense of indifference and sense of satisfaction of solving communal mysteries in the Edo period. And that, I say this is a nice show. Kudos to the original author for thinking of this, for I would never believe such a concept will be that sound to make me love this every week. On the other hand, I would argue this last episode may be abrupt, since everything is going so smoothly. But hey, we can afford to have a show going according to plan, right? No? Then let's go over things again then. I think I might not have written this review good enough lol okay let's stop (I wish tsukumogamis were a real life thing; I love my phone so much back then it should become blessed lol) (What was your most treasured thing that isn't an electronic device?) (I don't have one now btw my dad threw it away because he didn't bother to fix it when the eye popped off <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span>)</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9OZiMfSDuRci0f39_LNgo_Nv2kecuQSWVmsjLZLaT13u56feda4XrPnjB2nwT9ifg0Phv_VHSWD8zdTt1eb3csLeDinecZj-8ERfr7v0NDtmpuvk6rS6AvA4UlBmSpKvxVgMj0kiedtLB/s320/tsukumogami12_stomp.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>He does deserve it by the way, whoever's not in the shot haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxR8b4ci79HkrEvxX_tGDVqOzBW7ZmFabTOmvVYB642SURbhYidtDLO20YwW4qLo3CwNLWfdSapgGy3lwfEPwsbiG_R27qvKCbu_vJ0g0rYscIsurlUFbfRIF7aP9v5WLTLeoy-xPG4QDE/s320/tsukumogami12_slap.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>*slap* haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3UXufKQhANgVmRAsyFPuOCLWCFg9wm8gowVsDivFtDxJwWuLQJkAdDDcZo2J3Cl2y31EDW25krDHyUHOHXE0xBxNO4Z1wsUnVymTp58zJ6C7-m0yKKPbmqHhO-4hO-dNpWhH0144X95SS/s320/tsukumogami12_notetsu1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Real MVP this series though.

You're breaking the fourth wall, Honda-san. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div style=text-align:justify>Wow, I might just like this show now. Sorry, Denkigai no Honya-san, it's time for me to move on. This new episode (#HondaSan02) cannot get more real on showcasing the busiest day in the bookstore, and for what reason? Because it's holidays and every other publisher has to push their books to release before that so we guys get to enjoy your books during the break. (Sorry, no personal experience as a customer so I cannot relate lol) (I will attempt to do it this holiday season, I promise *looks at Kawai Makoto-sensei and Hazuki Matcha-sensei*) So yeah, the guys at the store are going to have to work hard to display the stock, like it or not. Hey, if this is the first show about bookstore management you've seen, I'm sorry. Not the best example for this show doesn't provide fanservice, but jokes are still the best thing this Anime can offer, so I'll take it. Hey, more laughs in half an episode compared to many other shows out there? It's an achievement already. We also got chance to listen to some character stories, well, mainly on their roles and who are the largest manga publishers in the country lol. I mean, if you don't know how to piece up any of their names you're not experienced enough. Between Shueisha and Young Jump and Kadokawa and Koudansha and Shokotsukan... there's bound to be someone you'll be meeting along the way if you read manga. Oh, those were company names? Oops. For mostly this show (besides Honda-san) focuses on naming their characters after what they look like in their face eg. Paperbag, we shall refer to them by their nicknames. So yeah, just another quick insight to whatever this mess of a show is, but hey, I'm enjoying it. I'll definitely be picking up this show for this season, but considering how short this is I may just put these with the others but it'll be a day late. Oh dear customers, you guys won't mind, would you?
