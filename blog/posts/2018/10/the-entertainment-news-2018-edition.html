So yeah, I have to wake up early tomorrow to travel halfway across the country so if you'll excuse me I'd like to finish this quick<br><br>Should've read the manga earlier today haha<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BANANAFISH16><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span> <span class=head-title>BANANA FISH</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Why am I always being pulled down by old guys?" Oh Ash that's not what you wanted? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>I like how the whole escape involves Max's decisions screwing up with Ash's escape with the Professor lol sometimes in life man you just don't know. The new episode (#BANANAFISH16) completes Ash's escape under the supervision of Golzine and action of whoever that took the role of the old man for the Foundation. Hey, remember last episode when Golzine told him to escape? And that's why he's just watching now, probably also because he has "no power to do anything anyway". You know, legal stuff. But now, I guess everything's back to normal? Okay, what happened first. Firstly, what Ash did to escape. He was planning to escape alone, but he knew he needed evidence to tell the world once he leaves, so he brought the inventor of the drug with him so he could tell the full story. Secondly, Max and Ibe-san's involvement. Well it's mostly Max's fault, but suffice it to say their participation during the events that occur while Ash escaped were nothing but a hindrance. As a result, the Professor has been bonked on the head by a security guard, Ash has been brought up and down an elevator and he still has to save their asses after he successfully escaped with a hostage AND without their help. Thanks, old men. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> All in all, they managed to disguise themselves and leave which was great mainly because Golzine let them do it, but also in consequence Ash found out that Eiji is missing. I mean, we know where he is (for now), so there's nothing to worry about maybe. So next, Ash is going after Eiji. Which will likely involve his engagement with the Lee brother (the only one left who is still sane and is in New York) which may get dirty if you want to compare it to the trash chute the three fell in or the time the guys have to watch a doctor and nurse make out. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Man, this show has everything to laugh to and I like it! <span class=emoji title=üëç>*thumbs up*</span><br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp58NYXPNgZDk_uPfWt4Cb2p_1C6ojDtiwYnyt9LviqZ1H_TJnRkPrlA-_LPDZVAHN3O5Yr7lk8-rKqhW1dQNDmxA4QrYtAsm0EEFel7eti0oDUXENQ-aUiGbaQsDKsVRVIPaQsMH8Cfql/s320/bananafish16_faces.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Lol why is Eiji in this even though I'd argue he's technically in the same category too haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYkLhogVj4vg8qly8Kr5PN6Knr0u01P11o1Y1LACg1Woe8Jv1HyaMcwPNorjISFHy64CUJlXzgXC1P47_X3T4DLGaiYcAyL2JhE5uM1pvHt6cLhtyBeDK97dXw-2J444mCqgJRO5po80-K/s320/bananafish16_pissed.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Dear Max, if I can beat you up for everything this episode I'll do it for Ash haha</table></div></div>P.S. I mean, the fact that Golzine has created a genius which surpasses anything that the government has made technically makes him one of the most revolutionary people in history ever. Well, ignoring that Ash may be a genius as a kid before he was under Golzine, I guess.<br>P.P.S. I sure hope Mikakoshi watches this because she has not been mentioning this on Twitter (I suppose she is busy) or she just doesn't want to talk about it because I think it's a good... watch-bait? Yeah haha<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=UzaMaid04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span> <span class=head-title>Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"No matter what evil tries to attack you tonight, I'll protect from you all!" Says the evil itself haha</div></blockquote>You also want to stay at home, play games all day and laze around? What a coincidence because me too, Misha!! <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> #SlackLife haha anyways in the new episode (#UzaMaid04) of this fantastic series which is still bombing you with pecs, lolicon and small animals (I totally dig the last part for some reason) and to top it off, displaying how much of a life you can have over the weekend. Well, if you're Misha-chan, that is. The first part brings us into the life of Misha over the weekend, and with an assignment pending I'm even glad she can forget about schoolwork until only at the end of it all. Hey, #StudentProblems, am I right?? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Okay. Thanks to the father being busy over the weekend, the maid has to stand in because how can you just leave a kid alone at home? (Okay now I'm sounding like a lolicon) More importantly, it's also because she doesn't know what to write for the assignment, as it's an essay for your future. Hey, I know I'll have problems doing that as a kid and boy am I glad I'm smart enough to write some cr*p to make up for it back then and not write what I am now doing my first full-time job (lol), but still. Thanks to the maid, she figured out what to write. It may be too realistic for a second grader (who is about 8 years old), but hey, there are more realistic things she can do as a human haha. Which brings us to the other half of the episode, where Misha brings her closest (human) classmate/friend Washiwashi (lol) to her place because she keeps showing off her animal squad to her. (And that's how you know Misha has a close resemblance to Tsubame it's literally Tsubame if she led Misha's life but with small animals) To think that she's living the life of a satisfied person (refer to Asobi Asobase for the significance of being a ‚Äù<a href=https://jisho.org/search/riajuu target=_blank>riajuu</a>‚Äù) based on the things she do now seemingly being of a popular person (inviting friends over, playing around with them etc.), you can only guess how good this afternoon after school has become. Of course Tsubame can't get her hands off the classmate, but just slightly, she behaves herself until she gets to tell the girl to wear one of her hand-made clothing. Well, what do you know. No Misha-chan dressup. I'm as sad as <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGhcsRqEUe2TqK-5Zx7cv6ZfXSNty-QtgWljpfFJ0cyW4YypAFVfIFYpIttAphRd0P2Jcozb1nvsW1Dv2dymC8A4ML-mtrtaaDkjJtaC71k6rBzUgFbcoOk6fjuY1LsLjDxSTDPPN9FlNk/s320/bungoustraydogs13_mafia.jpg target=_blank>Mori Ougai</a> right now tbh haha. Anyways, the girls had a good time, Tsubame stoned so hard she's rather die (please do so then haha), and... Misha's a lucky girl because she doesn't have to worry about money now. Well, sucks to be your father then haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiG-uX8bJHuDsoT2Gli9sV41pLwnwNKQQc3ZRD2dZkdbW8-UB5UF4Yxss-OPRLeUys_rhgdJuK2omACX5-eG9D9eZ_-B3klSgqfv8AsudyI-Sv4M4UAJRzxMmDb2GDko0zlyoLmlpOyefU3/s320/uzasugiru04_squad1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>God I love these things you wished life imitates these cute animals hehe</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI9004YjL9-K6vtWLmD0VP4SV2ey7QJkUnmr7SqXiO2K5LEokD0O8P6lThSZ4PojfhooMTSK4BEmyJQwKbAe3jJ2eOepGvUNRhphzoJCqh2sPKzSEpK6mGY1NWLdciBZ6lXo0GihpthnpB/s320/uzasugiru04_aura.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What's with this aura close resemblance to every other action Anime lol</table></div></div>P.S.

"You push when it's time to push, and pull back when it's time to pull back" It's just like Taichi haha you want more of this? (Audience: We didn't ask for-) "I'd rather shave all my hair then let you touch it!"

The faces, I mean. Specifically, the smile. This new episode (#HondaSan04) of this short episode series makes us wonder why we aren't smiling enough. Heck, I would smile all day if I'm paid more than a bookstore staff haha. Okay, for the whole thing they feature Honda-san going to this training session for the staff, and apparently it's just a sacrifice done for all stores for the sake of customer service lol. I guess it is important to train the staff even for a bookstore franchise, and we technically can't just change faces in an instant lol that guy, so yeah, Honda-san had to go through Hell, literally. It's like boot camp but only for the face muscles haha. There are a couple of things to take away though besides the cr*p that is learning how to smile: Honda-san may have found someone to like (hehe) and he is actually taking this course easily. I mean, Okitsune-senpai probably got it worse maybe we don't know we won't get to see it please don't I don't want to see it too haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiunfwH67J_0iRCtYISxwfWK2e8fqNuB-qRljtCH_6w_cVmUMu1JK77qLO19w56gcifPiTYQvz8-RgKmxAdG03RIONcworaMmLNGakiFixDDY2dAb_D0ek4I7M5dFCmWp3WfQWumRHtXLb9/s320/hondasan04_sunset.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This episode in a nutshell</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOmv0xBmtMWWlLCSHrpXDpNPogCxkM50oRw7zu24AwEYIhYpRmuYDLB2ElFoeFx0s5P35Tm9zeie1m70CiKT8Cmig3FRQxFpZEWrLNxVGsCiJ8-IQu1HLlVjwdX7KW1Gu6RVuFenwIj0v-/s320/hondasan04_grin.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This freaked me out, even for just a moment.</table></div></div>P.S.

How boys seemingly want one from a girl. And Sayashi can't make one. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Hey, not that she dodged knitting class in school or refused to go to the store where his childhood friend resides and watch the girls to find him for sweets (lol), but just that she's not that type of woman. And yeah, so is Hotaru apparently. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> I mean, apart from thinking that Hotaru-chan is only good at sweets (mostly on eating them probably) I can't think of anything else even in games that she is good at. So yeah, again proving Sayashi is a genius, and it'll probably take an old lady from the village to teach her to make a proper sized muffler probably for Kokonotsu becuase that tiny one for the brother must be a good April Fool's Day joke haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=430 data-original-width=482 height=285 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyTJaGZ4UmxEZEvMy1zQZmMInCJOcukVgQ-5rg-tgfnHW9Rwe4W7yv_fZjSP1gC6zNndpSkC7cLgmpQ4GZoZrFT6xNh1AbjCKBPCqfukw1ZqbCQaq4zJh7No44C0GYSB6aK8zMBuwgcNMc/s320/132-03.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when people ask me whether I know how to do my job lol</table><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>Êº´Áîª</b></span> <span class=head-title>Nagasarete Airantou</span></div></blockquote>The new chapter (163) concludes on the journey to search for the legendary eggplants, and if you need a recap they only can be harvested by ninjas because they are hard to catch, only catch them in the forest every decade, and the eggplants spread pollen which can have adverse personality effects on people in its immediate surroundings, as seen from Mikoto and Shinobu when they came back from the harvest. Everyone had a great feast of the eggplants and- Wait Shinobu was affected too? You bet! Haha actually Mikoto being poisoned technically will be a normal villager in the island which will be a good thing maybe until you remember this story is a harem fest so one less (or two if Mikoto stalks on that carpenter lol) of them would be easy on Ikuto to be honest haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=750 data-original-width=776 height=309 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9YBFYQ8ihNXMcKl8idBVapBzJKMLOdwZSJheICG2q6SpD_zWjPlMa475RReyZOwRV_G6BW5-RDBWxHiH5L894xtlZY9CtBu5W8FER6gav9C5PplMPFDAyQzxuMvhz1peqLrSsd0mxgkPZ/s320/16322.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Things that will not happen in a decade to savour it while it lasts haha</table><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Wow this was quite a week in Klassic Note, probably the busiest. And because so I did not have enough time to finish them all. So let's talk about what I listened to this week. I confirmed on <b>Kuraki Mai's new mini-album</b> after like what, 3 weeks in review? Yeah, and also because I saw that music video with Mikakoshi in it haha happy birthday Kuraki-san. <b>Anime "Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!" theme songs</b> are... you just need to know I only gave the opening theme because I'm kind and that is your stereotypical theme song so I just closed one ear giving it haha. <b><a href="https://music.apple
.com/jp/album/%E3%82%8F%E3%81%9F%E3%81%97%E3%81%AE%E7%8E%8B%E5%9B%BD/1437968220?l=en" target=_blank>Tsuji Shion's new album</a></b> is actually rather good, but if this was what she was focusing on after her 2nd album in 2016 I would say it didn't change much. Her further emphasis on pop styles make me want to give less songs but it's not as bad as the melodies because most of them aren't that good and it took her livestream to burn that topic song into my brain and I just gave it because I have the mood and I listened to it too much on one day and that day is Wednesday when it came out haha. Lastly, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/at-living/1539174427?l=en" target=_blank>Toyosaki Aki's cover album</a></b> was... man, I can't give 70s Japanese songs, I guess. That, and it sounds so like her album because it's mixed to her style and while her singing on them were great those aren't spectacular melodies. I'll see if I can even give any of them because fumika probably did better in Klassic Note in terms of cover songs given lol (Aki-chan, this might be the <strike>first</strike> second release I'm going to reject I'm sorry)<br><br>Talking about cover songs, I've yet to listen to (we're still at releases this week btw) <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84%E3%82%8D/1538134457?l=en" target=_blank>Yoshioka Kiyoe's cover album</a></b> ever since her solo debut earlier this year (yes Ikimonogakari vocalist blah blah) so I'll give a listen to that next week. Also on the pending list is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kalafina-all-time-best-2008-2018/1537903154?l=en" target=_blank>Kalafina's 10th anniversary best album</a></b>, which I think is the final, but still not enough to get into my shelf mostly due to lack of new songs I've given over the past few years. That, you can blame Anime mostly on it. What are they going to do besides sing for Anime? I mean, write good songs because they are better without credit? Someone tell Kajiura-sensei that please<br><br>Next week brings us a couple of releases we should definitely take note of besides <b>Anime "Gaikotsu Shoten'in Honda-san" theme song single</b> which I better try to give one of them (opening theme probably, ending is better maybe), <b>Numakura Manami's new single</b> because she's cool and it's been some time I gave her a song, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/delicious/1438103655?l=en" target=_blank>TWEEDEES new album</a></b> because why not? I'll be looking forward to that in particular but as from the preview tracks in Apple Music (three of them) I'm getting worried already. (Did I say that last week? If not then forget about this lol)<br><br>Lastly on news from Twitter because you're too lazy to go check out my liked Tweets, <b><a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1055071486275334144 target=_blank>Tsuji Shion's LINE LIVE livestream</a></b> was literally just for the music video maybe and her... her assets? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> <b><a href=https://twitter.com/specialthanks_7/status/1035331540945969152 target=_blank>SpecialThanks seems to have lost another member</a></b> making their band a two-member group now and that spells a lot of anything but bad news, <b><a href=https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1055762027791056896 target=_blank>TrySail's new single</a></b> sounds... better than their previous single which I hated lol, <b><a href=https://twitter.com/SMR_info/status/1055050474393546752 target=_blank>miwa's new song</a></b> has a "Title" (pun intended) (not joking that's the song title), I will give a listen to <b><a href=https://twitter.com/wacci_jp/status/1054873043162427393 target=_blank>wacci's new album</a></b> releasing next month I swear (thank goodness they are in Apple Music), <b><a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1054244593317728256 target=_blank>FLOWER FLOWER is coming into major streaming platforms soon</a></b> hopefully (some guy on Twitter said he can see some of the tracks on Spotify) (some, bro, isn't ALL haha), and that stupid girls group from Korea (haha) which I gave the one song this week (oh I forgot to mention them above?) <b>TWICE is releasing a new album</b> which is actually their first album in Japan released like two months ago PLUS that one song. Re-released. Full package. It even writes "Repackage" on the title. Totally intended to rip people's money off.
