Turns out if too much happened in a year I have to spend more time writing about everything. Should've thought of spacing all the events out to make the storytelling in the future more consistent haha I'm going to run out of content to talk about for Klassic Note last year lol okay let's do this first<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=FumikiriJikan10><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Fumikiri Jikan</span></div></blockquote>The new episode (#FumikiriJikan10) brings us the epic conclusion (hopefully the guy didn't f*** a schoolgirl lmao) of whatever cliffhanger we're left last week, which is that guy seeing his student self crush but him as an old man. Spoilers are ahead but yep, it's the daughter. Don't worry, nothing happened after the truth was let out of the bag, and man was the daughter dressed exactly like the mother. Just through literary? This kid is real smart, and fearless apparently, to appear dressed in the same way. Well then again we're dealing with one guy who will recognise her so... I guess it's okay? Man, is this the kind of love story I'll see years from now when I'm an old man and my secondary school (middle school for you folks out there) crush appear in the streets? Haha not gonna happen I swear I don't even have a crush on anyone. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEHd-yaanAc3zoBUe2pD0W626ih2Y9WWsfCrS6p4y-7No1C2CcFwXssOX4TDZDMsN04O1aQrgyuZTGcFmXWVurezDwdMNHFDSW6v73XBIRl2ZIZJdIx__w2R1UoCsIEVP8GHH1GlIJU_5I/s320/fumikirijikan10_shock.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>On the other hand, I'm surprised she's surprised at the... confession?<br>Gotta inspire the girl to be a writer hehe</table>P.S. Yeah I saw the cast in the opening theme. Remember last week's episode didn't feature the girl talking? Thanks Tamura Yukari-chan you make a wonderful schoolgirl voice lmao the last time I heard of her is when <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/7817/B-gata_H-kei target=_blank>I was doing her on the bed</a> (Audience: HEY HEY HEY PG BRO) haha oops<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TadaKun11><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I'm sure they have a good reason" YEAH YOU BET THEY DO haha #foreshadowing</div></blockquote>Seriously at this point I want to be an Anime character, enter Tada-kun's cafe and do that Rainbow Shogun action until Mitsuyoshi decides to go find the girl haha. Okay, not going to happen just yet, but the new episode (#TadaKun11) sure got a lot of people sad. IT'S BEEN ONE MONTH ALREADY?? Wait, THREE MONTHS?? I mean, if you got regrets you better do something about it now. And so he does. Among all the sadness is realisation, that their sudden departure is of course, with reason. And of course, still possible to find out the truth. I mean, unlike the last time Tada-kun your dear crush is not dead yet. And I must say the setup to this part is real good; that I give the production credit for. From Tada-kun being angry at them two leaving abruptly without a word, so seeing things around town and reminiscing the good times, to cleaning up the past and finding them out again (I mean, they could've just formatted that memory card haha) and even in all these there are remnants of not only the two, but of regret. Of wanting an answer to conclude the end of the good times. Hey, we all expected at least a year of good times. This motherf**ker just left in six months!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay jokes aside, if watching the video footage in the school computer didn't make you tear up, you're heartless. If you're not touched when your dear grandpa tells you to go pursue what is needed and giving you back your regret, you're emotionless. All in all, I must say this is a real good plot twist aftermath for an Anime original, and I can't wait to see how this pans out. With Tada-kun conquering his fear of airplanes (Teresa-chan be like "he's not going to come for us he hates planes" lol) for the one he likes, things are going to get real awkward when he notices that he can't speak a word of European in that small country lol okay yes chances are Teresa-chan could be married but still YOU WANT HER TO COME FIND YOU WHEN SHE'S CARRYING TWO KIDS WITH HER OR WHAT? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggZ-GZ5gNTqUSFwBZtRh68a0hdiTAmZZ8d0cYh7dLvGI9hsmByrODXkfOBfRuh4W3fxtYK7VJ-VTh9kQA708YxX5pU5SKNzEitVU2HP-oK2-DBFFsA-I18GmccLy1AC8LsMazIMaOfRYa-/s320/tadakun11_cat1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Spoiler-free reaction images to this episode lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZ3k-siUXi2gXyGIwYFHHlpvWCFuzXB5s6YuCMAHnS5SfEBjKqX9DBTD3J0-z7wUr0SMZ9ZyK7M77tBk2p_fcAZXEx4za-Hy0n6-9acF-j-xGb9rAS2ijGFUzZ7yRhNNQvUmu0BY77Bjc0/s320/tadakun11_cat2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Spoiler-free reaction images to this episode lol</table></div></div>P.S."Alec-san took the Volume 7 of my beloved mystery novel and didn't return? We're doing to Larsenburg!" Is what I hoped Yui-chan would say, but hey, this is not <em>her </em>show. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br>P.P.S. Ijiun-kun MVP this episode because he's the only one who can still keep the mood up (for himself mostly) despite the circumstances. Also Miyano Mamoru MVS (most valued seiyuu) in case you don't know how active he is in person compared to his Anime counterparts. Yes, this isn't his first role with an active personality. Also MVC (most valued couple) (lol) are the two regulars in the cafe because I want to say my love to someone someday #RelationshipGoals<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=WotaKoi10><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"He's the type of person who's fine being alone" NAO TRIGGERED lol</div></blockquote>Oh wait, Nao-kun is HITTING ON A GIRL??? Oops. The new episode (#WotaKoi10) is another one of those "And that is how I met your mom" stories? No? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, the story. Nao-kun manages to find himself a <strike>plaything</strike> friend to play games with but unfortunately he, or should I say, she, is a pro gamer like the brother. But before that, let's talk about the glasses. A day with Hirotaka but without his glasses must be my favourite part of this series now because I mean, it hits all the jokes at the right spot. He indirectly gets laid by all the girls in the office, he is mistaken by doing BL with his boss lmao (the hardest I've laughed here so far), and... the girlfriend is jealous. Okay, maybe not the BL part she's enjoying it but yeah, it was fun to watch. Now, Nao. Word pun not intended because it's a lot more interesting in perspective for the title of the show I keep forgetting because I keep thinking it's about those four. So yeah, the little brother thinks his elder brother is just a heartless pro gamer who doesn't give two bird poop about others, but hey, at least Kou-kun (as Nao-kun has referred to so it's burned into my brain now) was kind enough to play with this total noob, and so assist him whenever possible. That's how you make friends, people. Lucky you Kou-kun; you'll not be that lucky again considering how closed and alone your personality is. I'm a living example of such bad luck haha. On the other hand, it was interesting to watch mainly because it's not about the main four anymore, and with some hope we might just get to see some sparks going once that poor part-timer notices he was hitting on a girl hehe I'll be looking forward to that but going from the episode count... Please Anime give me that last part as conclusion you won't give us the main conclusion anyway haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJ6mYg-qsLjmviXSpok7rgoKY5jMiv3tGNuOCze4quXenw164jGA1Er2OgFXqgEeHgj9TYS7gDDLZPKWJHmJ0ULKKvPWxZNFcCZazYyIK7nqRoNb_OqwfR5T577_NHcjt4iVrJijgceYul/s320/wotakoi10_myopia.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The two parts I laughed the most to haha<br>(That's me irl btw it's funnier too that he's working instead of just staring at some monitor)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIc8F1mRRKswNpd-6RwtNRsgFTfF7vmB8wF6wA7_we9J59VvpdUzG6gvEVfLdVNSO9cjSAbmPm0MZ0QVGv4dHMK4BvcZ4gTKILRnpkOaIf5UoO8nk0tUHCkpS9DXYhVFEyJXy1ukBK-ZRv/s320/wotakoi10_BL.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The two parts I laughed the most to haha<br>(I laughed harder at Koyanagi's expected reaction lmao BL is great content for jokes)</table></div></div>P.S. *Watched last part after ending theme* Oh. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br>P.P.S.

The one <b>split single from cinema staff</b> was a real bummer as I can't even so yeah I'm skipping that too (man, I've been doing this quite a lot this year I wonder why) because it's just too hard to even give anyone here. I also gave a listen to <b>H ZETTRIO</b> after quite some time giving them a couple of music pieces from last year, and I won't say I will give a lot here so I don't have to say I never give anything next week haha<br><br>Talking about next week, we're finally welcoming the end of<b> Chatmonchy and their final album</b> along with the sensation I went up on Twitter to make after getting hooked to <b>Suchmos</b> and their new album which apparently the topic song I didn't get hooked back four months ago and this is after their departure to major (though independent) label earlier this year. So yeah, these two, are the plans.<br><br>On other news from the Internet for Klassic Note, <b>fumika is finally back on Apple Music Japan</b>Â (since her departure from major label) so yeah you should've noticed that playlist link, <b>miwa's best album</b> tracklist isn't that impressive considering I missed two of her recent singles already, as I said I got crazy on Suchmos instead of being crazy over #KN10YEARS plans... oh that didn't go up on Twitter haha I don't have the guts to announce something in progress<br><br><br><br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><br>Okay I'm tired from making <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil_6uAL3RBFdjkuiA_rA73sBZveF0B_ZbtFe5vtVSRxLTFTHOqZk8VUImL_5nPdcKhNlIj8phjdb0ZFM1Sb8frZ0DQ07gBLtan3wnTIB58F86aE2yO869lHnwb4qJ0fkoAYmcA9gRvM0w5/s1600/Screenshot+%25285%2529.png target=_blank>some stupid program in Python</a> to help me fetch Songs of the day from my own Twitter account it's overflowing in user traffic for some reason lol.

I better remember to go for that supplementary exam so I can graduate next year??
