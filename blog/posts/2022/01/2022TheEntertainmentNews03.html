Upside is, I'll be ending with KiseKoi which is probably for the better since I can't stop thinking about Kitagawa ever since I met her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Is this what it feels like to love Anime again...? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><div><br></div><div>New week, new... a lot of stuff apparently, so let's get into it! I don't think I remember what happened in Titans I did not watch those recap episodes in Japan lmao I won't get this now<br><br>WHY CAN'T I BUY MARINKA'S LIVE TOUR GOODS COLUMBIA JAPAN WHY CAN'T I BUY STRAIGHT THROUGH YOUR ONLINE STORE okay rant's over let's start haha<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan76><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"If the euthanization plan is carried out, what's the point of all our effort?" That's true, but that might be the solution to all this...?</div></blockquote>Wow, (spoiler incoming) Levi's dead, huh. Oh well, guess I'm done with this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode of a final series I hope this better be (#AttackOnTitan76), I almost forgot a lot of people are with Eren's group now, of course, including Zeke. Levi's not dead by the way lol. What is dead though supposedly, is Zeke, probably after Levi chopped him into pieces, but ironically, he didn't die. So at least he'll still be useful to Eren lol spoiler alert? Well, you read that otherwise, okay? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, we go back to the episode we picked up, where if I didn't remember wrongly, Reiner arrived with the Marley army to Paradis to do a counterattack while Pieck sneaked in to befriend Eren after whatever Eren did to take in some Titan powers such that he has what, 5 out of the 9 in his hands was what we talked about previously? I don't remember but it's close I know the not Erens are at a disadvantage in terms of Titan power possession. What is at a disadvantage now though, might be Eren's side considering this aggression from the enemy outside of the island. Even though it really looks like as what Eren mentioned, because they can convince their support which are the Marley army and Eren's team to back them up, it just ends up being these two fighting it out, Reiner and Eren. Ironic, isn't it? Haha that's war fer ya. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But that's where the similarities end. Since Eren's group is just a bunch of traitors lmao especially Yelena if you would recall, their forces are unlikely to stop thousands of men from Marley's side even though they took a big hit in their manpower previously, and still can bring in heavy artillery via parachute (can you even do that? someone try that out haha) and use that to nail Eren in the Titan brain, which of course, doesn't do much but immobilize the Titan. Speaking of which, we got Titan battles straight off the bat here in this final final season, where Reiner goes head to head with multi-power Eren who ignores Yelena's advice to step down and fight head on, is just playing level field until what's his name, Porco who was at that place with Pieck (umph) (lol), stepped in to help Reiner take down Eren, and Pieck mounting on the heavy Titan gun to shoot him from afar. *sniper monkey* (lol) Anyways, as you can see though, Marley's plan isn't perfect, but it was well planned. They also know Eren is the ultimate weapon, so stopping him here and now will just solve everything, or so we think. I mean, we technically have not witnessed on the Founding Titan power yet RIP that dude who got eaten from beneath the stage yeah Willy Tybur haha, but yeah, if that is not divine like a meteor shower made out of fire I don't think Eren is going to get out of this as easily as Levi might have with who's that face again uh... Hange-san yep, who apparently were stuck with Zeke and some not friendly forces but managed to escape through the river with Levi suffering significant injury, probably keeping Zeke away from his brother. And he's no Titan, by the way. I mean, he has that jab where his cowboy hick friend gave him, but it's not used yet right? And Annie's still hidden? Yeah, is that where we are at now? I think so, I really don't remember haha. What we actually have learnt though, is the legendary healing powers of the Paths, where Titans at the brink of death can be resurrected by some angel lady in an instant? Okay, be sure to give us an explanation sometime soon. All in all, I rather have BLUE ENCOUNT for opening theme lol you don't have to know who they are, the ending theme is probably what I'll go for, and I'm actually glad they got back in pace this quick picking up right from the previous season. Getting me hyped for some action Anime is the best thing this series has given me haha. Looks like next episode they have to convince the army in Paradis to fight. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> That sounds like a bad idea tbh did you see how Yelena's group and existing forced in Paradis died under the Marley army? Haha it sure looks like Marley's side is winning now, so we shall see what happens next. God, I'm glad this series is back and giving us the ending sooner than later. I really want an answer to all this bullshit, uh, I mean, lore haha cya guys again next week.</div><div>[Gotta say though, I'm glad they gave us less than two scenes of recap for me to remember what happened so far from a year ago, instead of BLEACH which will take half an episode to do so, every week. <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> Bad memories for those I guess and thanks Titans for not ruining the Anime series]</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4yv-fXWLn36PAglvowkGfh-FtasSv6oTlKLtFFXLA4f2QLJyt8uZVSFfYmFBnRSmrcqL6V4G6vbxmdo0KpGM4hoTsF_TaAMB6SFplO6p816HJe1qEeuQ3E34tntmg90p2nCmR-gTKJzq1sXo4m-piL1Yk0AYpjdmcxYEF5TlPMlzmgw/s320/attackontitan76_reiner.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How you know we gonna have a good time haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinTpU-ZXw2x7GA3ez5-NklUfyQBG9rgKmf-txQ1UK53BLd-lkf5NnOQj1dIZzYhgJOS_4Nq4N4wz1bVnK9aMjjwpiPRcj4YdLsA07r1Bz7jAUaNv05q4cNAEAkkJBmiTct25BNLsOuzMMZQTR9f4Z9IXO7sOs0KT9sPtzfjI34JpXYIA/s320/attackontitan76_titan1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>TITAN SHOWDOWN!!<br>(To the left, we have the founding power Titan and spikes and shields vs...)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj31zLKyppJzUAbxHE_f1hdUpaW50_3hKeUg4DdD_NhAlUEIQh08Tr34wiyj8Jd3j7feNnsjrOmf5AH0AjNXfS9f4LdSQUN3WnTUPL4FmsvEL2KJZdfsmGaAZkhhRk-V1miITQL6xy8Xctds35k1JuztIvWubpux2HV4s1mpIcErLTExQ/s320/attackontitan76_titan2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>TITAN SHOWDOWN!!<br>(To the right, we have armoured power Titan with ally)</table></div></div>P.S. Aw how I missed Pieck and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/9973/Manami_Numakura target=_blank>Nu-chan</a>'s sexy voice I wish she could crush me with her Titan mouth lol that Titan speech though was disgusting why did you let me hear that <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSanS302><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"If we check your (Nishikata's) desk now, then we don't have to panic for the real deal" Haha Takagi finding his stuff out so she can keep the secret, eh?</div></blockquote>Haha what is with the speechless intro did we run out of budget to hire <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/34785/Rie_Takahashi target=_blank>Rieri</a> and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuuki_Kaji target=_blank>Kaji Yuki</a> to do voicing? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#TakagiSanS302) where ironically I have to say I miss Takagi-san's voice haha they got me, turns out Takagi is just a bloody cheater, no offense. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's not like she's smart or anything, just that once again, if you need a reminder, Nishikata is just dumb. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, first up, this silent drama is great because for once we can appreciate the soundtrack because I haven't since I have to work a full-time job lol <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, it's basically Takagi's stalking journey to meet Nishikata when the time arises, and you know, freak him out while she can. I know, I feel like something's the problem but with Nishikata trying to figure her out to eventually dropping his guard against her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kehai target=_blank>presence</a>, (I know right I'm doing middle school Japanese while I'm at it) it's basically telling us how observant Takagi is normally just so she can always read his boy's mind, but also, if you want someone to guess what's in your pocket... do it at home. Also, you can just say she's wrong and pull out your dic- Next up, okay we also run out of budget to hire <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/43279/Konomi_Kohara target=_blank>Koko-chan</a> and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/10981/Yui_Ogura target=_blank>Ogura Yui</a> too, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Edit: Sorry <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/25437/Mao_Ichimichi target=_blank>Mao-san</a> forgot about you) Man, where's the budget on this episode even haha maybe on the soundtrack? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Did like, the animators watch an episode from the Looney Tunes cartoon series and got inspired by it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, it's the same thing as before but now with Mina-chan who doesn't care and is easily distracted by stray cats and beautiful flowers, probably didn't notice Yukari-chan until she has to, and we know Sanae-chan wins in all this since she didn't get found out lol okay middle schoolers do these huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Thank goodness I'm not the recipient or else it would've been boring for these 13-year-olds haha. Finally we bringing the voices back haha the recording above must be when Tokyo was on lockdown lmao, we check each other's desks. Spoiler alert because there isn't any today in class, but Nishikata thought there is and Takagi just went along with it. Easy. We already know who lost. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Nishikata also gets spooked easily so I won't care too much, but man if I knew Takagi was just trying to return the book I borrowed to her inside her jersey I would've <strike>taken it to smell it</strike> just pretend to be teacher and <strike>grounded</strike> reprimanded her for bringing such stuff to school. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, Nishikata, you don't even know how to be cool. Look at your bros like Kimura and Takao. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, bad examples, pretend I didn't say it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then, we know this is a thing in school when the librarian gets to take the month's break just because her work has been replaced with students, I don't even know how the main couple ended up in the same library shift group. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (<em>IT'S RIGGED!!!</em> lol) Nishikata is into picture books so Takagi just picked it for him, and to (think he) look cool Nishitaka chose some literature for his girl until you realize... it's not a romance novel. Oops, he won't find out anyways haha this idiot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, and this is why we are here in this third season coming, Nishikata showed off his running skills by running to the beach as egged by Takagi. Like really, just give me the wholesome stuff at the end I don't want the Nishikata runs down the beach bullsh*t. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But then again it's dependent on that so I guess why not. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yes, more of this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And yes, I would've guessed it, Takagi probably came for him (lol that sounds wrong) knowing he'll be challenged to do it despite not intending to and wear himself out, so yeah, some wholesome support is what he got in the end. I hope that's what you asked for, bro. Also, some teasing, gotta give some of that too haha. All in all, gotta remind you all including me once again, that it takes a lot for Takagi to convince her dude that spending time with him is great just because her usual image is just teasing him. That, I don't know if it's good or not, but we know it works. They had a kid too so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay that's not even in this adaptation go read the original spin-offs. I'm just glad we got more of this series, and if you can't get over Nishikata losing every time, at least enjoy Takagi losing every time for totally different reasons. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ganbare target=_blank>ganbare</a> Takagi-san can't help you there haha</div><div>[TL:DR; Takagi's movements are greatly orchestrated with the soundtrack until you hear Yukari-chan shuffling at the intersection lmao that was just cartoon level stupid]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSKcoDbTlvdXjxllFB-lWLtfoPo7C-nQDUTNWOsyIIWYnFYBoQEK_In4LF0bXk5UTy0aBFTCTUbXsiygb4_JUYeu_vEPX8kcQIHPT-_e18p2kR_mBZYgPQfBWn_zUOERTWTZoPIQzwMsVV88w54lw8o8GFxnr6mN5koxrqkW9q3ZmmDg/s320/takagisanS302_nishikata3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is going to be the most evil face you'll see of Nishikata EVER haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoPm0s_J4ZwQ3PrdtO8UZUlDa24zD-iwFh3CV2FqzOwr947YKCd5EHWxLjQJ_eQT_mau5g95trbDhGqhU4ExS3-otiFj6K3uTUJafcwB2tlva_lJ0TTctUSHqbBV421bf7SuldzB_6Rn_LLL6gqRqiLz_BxoL9gkVnQZNhjzFCxC_Tjw/s320/takagisanS302_mina2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I wish my mind was as blank as this girl, really</table></div></div>P.S.

Wow there is so many wrong here Kitagawa I can't even</div></blockquote>Wow Shizuku-tan, it's basically a porno and YOU tell me this is safe? I've watched Anime for a decade, girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Don't worry Gojou I'm in with you bro because in this new episode (#KiseKoi02) we get to hear the lore inside the lore that Kitagawa is so crazy wanting to do cosplay on. Not that he has to know it, but that's also how we creep people out, being otaku with people who don't. Also, Gojou probably died of embarrassment in this episode so RIP him, yes? Haha, let's get to the story. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Yeah, like Gojou I gotta calm down too haha but not really from embarrassment because what is Anime nowadays, but more of, I laughed too much just from this episode alone. Let's talk about it. Since we got the devil's contract lol who doesn't, and Kitagawa did explain the lore of the character she was going to cosplay hopefully without you thinking of erotic thoughts but even if you do I'll forgive you haha, there are only certain points including the initial point where you have to remember: We're all doing this for her sake, for Kitagawa's sake to cosplay as her favourite character. Thanks, Shizuku-tan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, she be describing a porno game so whatever don't forget they are high schoolers and you gotta graduate to even touch those things so I wonder how she got her hands on those. But yeah, if you have not experienced me explaining Japanese AV to you it's pretty much the same as Kitagawa's explanation of "Slippery Girls 2" lol the title but you know, let's just say I'm not a girl who wants to cosplay and I knew all these earlier than she does. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha, and it's a literal reference to the first episode and my thoughts, that Kitagawa also had a cosplay beginners handbook bought and somehow she still can't figure it out so at least Gojou knows how to read it, and I guess he has to do all the work instead of just teaching her because we'll need more than a crash course tbh. Next up, since it's the weekend ahead, Gojou decided to continue this on Monday because where got time for his dolls now haha, but thanks to the granddad going out to buy the sewing machine which his dear grandson broke doing hina doll costumes, we know Gojou is going to break the next one making outfits for some girl he met in high school so gramps don't worry, your hopes and dreams for him aren't over... maybe. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Kitagawa dropped by on his day off on a Saturday ironically finding out where he lives through map apps, and drops by to get things started. Literally. And second half is just a joke in my opinion so I hope your jaw doesn't hurt from laughing: it's doing measurements. And yeah, who else is going to measure her bust size, the granddad who is outside? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, you can believe hilarity ensues real fast on this part where... And that's how you know Gojou Wakana here is too-pure-pure-boy haha I need to make that Anime "Kannagi" thumbnail soon, because you know, first time girls appeared in his room. But seriously though, when is mine happening? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, this might be the hardest thing this boy has to do in his life EVER and I meant his erection HAHA BOOM okay I have to put mature rating on this site now thanks Shizuku-tan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In a nutshell and I rather let you enjoy the experience if you get what I mean hehe ah, lucky <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sukebe target=_blank>sukebe</a> Gojou gets to enjoy the pleasure of measuring every nook and cranny of Kitagawa's banging figure (Like really, B86? That's impressive) until it's too late and ONLY (haha wtf really) when the girl realizes some dude is measuring up her crotch... Is that considered too late? Or does anyone not know what is happening here?? Is probably what Gojou is thinking about but that's the point lmao, and I really hope for our sakes this is the furthest this Anime will go in in terms of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> references. Because really, I'm not that pure though but, this is real hard to watch too. (Yeah yeah erection blah blah) (lol) I know it's meant to be better than the game Gojou now has to play to see Shizuku-tan in all angles, but dude, play those when your gramps is not around, man. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I laughed a lot so that's a good thing, but more on Gojou's embarrassment and I wished Kitagawa had more too or maybe I'm used to those Anime haha, but between Gojou bowing down to Kitagawa on his bed  to talking about nipples (lol), this Anime has EVERYTHING normal people would try to avoid.

Like really, the music video did not deepen the impression of the song for me, it's just Anime hype or whatever kids like now. Aimer-san, I hope this is what you wanted. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, these aren't enough, so I continued my journey to give artists I liked from last year and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/five-foot-daydream-ep/1534882225?l=en" target=_blank>Sisters In The Velvet's EP from 2020</a></b> is... very similar to the single I heard of last year in which as I listen then I noticed their rather heavy style is still not so my thing, so I tried to give another emotional song, I guess. Yeah, just one song. So total 3 new songs, not bad for second week of Klassic Note 2021 lol<br><br> On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and did I use back the same intro phrase as before, I'm not going to talk about <b>Anime "Attack on Titan" theme songs</b> I really liked <a href="https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/status/1480200439673102338?s=20" target=_blank>the ending song</a> more than <a href="https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/status/1480200439467499520?s=20" target=_blank>the opening song</a> just because and honestly I missed Linked Horizon lol, <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1480494638024863747?s=20" target=_blank><b>Natsukawa Shiina's new music video preview</b></a> for her upcoming album next month is kinda meh and considering the off beats I really wonder if I can give my imouto the song by then, <a href="https://twitter.com/marika_staff/status/1480873821976817667?s=20" target=_blank><b>Kouno Marika's new music video</b></a> is really different from my impression of what this song should sound like it's all indoor footage for some reason why not go outdoors when you realize she isn't such a person too, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1480918179363065861?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL's new song</a></b> is out before the album next month and I must say like some others they have lost their touch already so we shall see about that then, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ORESKA_Official/status/1480918672495415296?s=20" target=_blank>ORESKABAND's new song</a></b> is actually not bad not compared to <a href="https://twitter.com/ORESKA_Official/status/1481582491240923139?s=20" target=_blank>the lyric video</a> lol but what's better than this is <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ORESKA_Official/status/1481214613341732872?s=20" target=_blank>ORESKABAND's new album</a></b> in years out in March so that's kinda hype it might be the best time to get back to their... rather heavily Ska-based Rock music at this point it used to be the opposite, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1481551594298638336?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's music video for "Shout Baby" has reached 20 million views</a></b> on YouTube so yay #2 in Klassic Note 2020, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1481642289793437698?s=20" target=_blank>SID's new album is arriving in March</a></b> which I must say is a surprise and I can't wait to listen to more of them considering what they gave us since their return from hiatus in 2020, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/staff_azumi/status/1481944181023154180?s=20" target=_blank>Waki Azumi's new music video</a></b> will premiere on YouTube the day of her concept album release but from the preview I don't think I'll like it so we shall see about that they should stop with the pops style really, not gonna comment on <b>the cover art for <a href="https://twitter.com/musicman_net/status/1481917976882278401?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's new album</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1481929331857313798?s=20" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new album</a></b>, we have some <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1482291470942064641?s=20" target=_blank>TrySail live footage</a></b> on YouTube so be sure to check those out as one of the songs have been nominated for <b>"Anison-<a href=https://jisho.org/word/%E6%B4%BE target=_blank>ha</a>" Song Awards 2021</b> which I've never heard of and they just dump people like DIALOGUE+ and Hoshimachi Suisei with 2 nominated songs on it so be sure to cast your votes by the end of the month if you can read the song titles lol (<a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1482604361943420928?s=20" target=_blank>I've summarized my vote</a> too if you're interested), and last but not least <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1482630583767371777?s=20" target=_blank>RYTHEM is livestreaming upcoming Tuesday</a></b> apparently for reaching 10k subs on their YouTube channel since 2020 but maybe also more news...? I mean, we can use another album, you know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also, it sounds like an actual live this time around so I won't expect their mini keyboard or a cappella but who knows. WOW this is a long list lol oh we might as well add in <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1482653859818483717?s=20" target=_blank>SHE'S livestream on upcoming Friday</a></b> with apparently big news to share so... maybe it's live huh the album's recent in October too<br><br>So next week, we have a couple of releases we can listen too but I don't know how many of them I can give to be honest including <b>fuzzy knot's new single</b> and if you don't remember them that is fine lol, <b>Higuna Ai's new digital single</b> which is for Anime "Attack on Titan" since I don't want to wait for a more formal physical release as I usually do, and maybe if I have time or all of them are disappointing then I'll end my planned exploration trip with <b>No Buses</b>. Oh yeah, I listened to some Kitri this week too and that wasn't a great trip so I won't comment much that single was a miracle haha<br><br><br><br><br>Hmm what should I talk about here... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYFxcdHgNnc" target=_blank>Kotobuki Minako's final livestream</a> for her YouTube channel? Wow that sounds depressing so maybe not haha, and I'm not that keen to talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/marupi_baseball/status/1481927680605896704?s=20" target=_blank>marupi-chan's magazine and swimsuit debut</a> but you're welcome for <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CYtT-puvtg2/ target=_blank>her Instagram offshot</a> lol, so maybe I'll talk about how I intend to buy the "BLEACH" manga collection in its entirety of 74 volumes but I've been hesitating to get it since years ago after it ended or even got fully licensed in English, since English licensing has slightly different designs so boo, there's colourized digital versions in Japanese too, and there's even a special e-book made to house an SD card worth of any series in Shounen Jump in Japan but those are not cheap and it was only on pre-order in October of last year so not thinking about those. Even if I buy the digital ones in Japanese I also won't have time to read it or have a good device with a Kindle App to read. I don't have an Android tablet I only have a Surface Pro 4 which I use to grind DOAXVV so... yeah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'll save that money for now, they don't need my money anyways just give ma a PS5 game of the whole series so I can replace my subwoofer with a gaming console lmao. Cya guys next time then I suppose this is long enough for an outro lol, and until next time... maybe this year's photobook showdown is Hondo Kaede vs Lynn huh haha you can see if that will happen in the upcoming months hehe I might just do it tbh if it's for me</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I wish I can just play DOAXVV like how you play the not volleyball aspects of DOAX3 but oh well I can live with this game haha maybe I should give them money it's going to be 5 years for this game already let's see if the new DMM GAMES PLAYER will region lock me by then lol</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
