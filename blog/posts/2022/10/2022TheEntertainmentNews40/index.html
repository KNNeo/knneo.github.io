But now we are at the new month, I can't wait to have to deal with exercise again <span class=emoji title=🤮>*pukes*</span> Haha okay me get over it<div><br></div><div>Anyways, be sure to check out what I've unboxed earlier this week, and starting this weekend, we are exploring new Anime for the season! New Anime, new season you know- We will see if any will stick, or else I might spend more time on weekends to play video games. There's that Potion Permit have I've seen it in summer games festivals that's kinda fun. It's like that Anime last season about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>isekai</a> pharmacy I didn't watch and it has Aki-chan in it. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Oh well haha</div><div><br></div><div><a href=https://jisho.org/search/rettsu target=_blank>LET'S</a> Anime and music talk!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=UzakiChanS201><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! Double</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"One-upping <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>Senpai</a> is what makes my life worth living" We reaching that stage already huh haha</div></blockquote>Merry Christmas, everybody- This should've aired next season. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, we went from them being hostile to each other to in this new season of a sweet romance in progress series (#UzakiChanS201), hanging out and enjoying their time with each other. Wholesome, wholesome content- Wait, let me get my rice cooker going. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, this episode definitely easily served as a summary episode to remind all of us the fun we had over the first season, and what will be like going forward. In summary? I mean, we know they are not dating, but they TOTALLY are. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Because firstly, we have Sakaki and I swear I almost forgot his name, hanging out with these two after summer vacation is over, because damn, whoever sucked at bowling wouldn't even matter if it's just a battle of wits and Uzaki just shouting behind Sakurai's back as he rolls the ball so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You get the idea, the usual banter these two have, and us just watching all of it happening. We are of course also reminded of how to not get provoked by Uzaki so she can't do much to you which Sakurai is often failing at lol, and how Sakurai is also then improving his own skills outside of video games so he can gain an edge when having to deal with Uzaki's antics, like winning her at bowling to not get a punishment. I mean, fair game, amirite? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Then, we have Ami-chan. If you TRULY need a reminder about this absolute pervert of a girl running the cafe with the father who just left the premises for a bit, oh boy let me tell you how much this girl wants to see Sakurai's muscles and Uzaki in... well anything cute because ironically apart from Uzaki having a larger rack than hers haha this is a thing in this Anime by the way "it's so big" is the series' middle name lmao, still loved to don up Uzaki-chan in some of the best cosplay we will see in a decade (haha) until you know, the two of them find out what she intends to do and/or the father appears so what else is new. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But hey, I'll take an Anime where <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu target=_blank>Taketatsu Ayana</a> is an absolute pervert, I'll tell you that much. Heck, I'll even take her dressed as a bunny girl as punishment for making us nosebleed so much. The character of voice actress? Yes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Even the mom wants in on the action too lol MOVING ON haha, I... uh... can only talk about how much I can relate to these two not getting enough sleep but NOT because I played video games till the dead of night, sadly. But hey, what is stopping anyone from sleeping in the school premises? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Even together at a bench? Snugged in tight? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, oh boy I am easily reminded of the pace of the series and also how much fun I had watching this first season up till now, so I'm excited to see more of these banters going forward. With a new cast of characters mostly involving Uzaki's family, we will see how much more these two will go to admit they are going steady. I mean, is sleeping together without a confession going steady? Asking for a friend lmao</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio7208vWaL_SSCVsDcaj8MSriD8nktktl76-JhXH5f4H7EWPe7y6YC6FZJwkCbLMeXiidFRmvEaL1Z8q-t22SBjy5GAw3S0shH0910NEX70rkL2nY42qD4jfhe0TH8unO4Z7fNa8TAGe82_OkebeDdoP4vEf_QTaFaPpJvmSmJ2M7yozGxDa_i-0dM/s1600/uzakichanS201_grin.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center><a href=https://jisho.org/search/kowai target=_blank>KOWAI</a> lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNPodJLkL_FyqLqXNHNeHNi2mhkRP1V55belpDpL7jLggiGg-j8PpYCYfCtUaQu9_mwu4fuXZkcSJJ_XykUx2ujmmiHxcNkJM8DtUZoITv4Qh5pM-lgIfpdW6y-Uk04qrLOw5VlvHplLbCJbZOm6Kwg9VYeyVgJUR3ilii5-5EjIQ5gSGborYvhzii/s1600/uzakichanS201_caress.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't care if this will get me banned but WHO DID THIS lmao</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I'm sorry I'll leave haha</div></blockquote>Oh, looks like someone got disowned and had the balls to come take back his land, interesting. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this first episode of a series I'm taking a look at (#KoukyuuNoKarasu01), I'm not that keen on period dramas so let me put this out first whatever my decision is though, whenever I do this *ahem* I'm stating the fact that "this is a period drama, by the way", so don't forget how unforgiving this story can be. But how can we forget the night where the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/koutaigou target=_blank>empress dowager</a>'s throne was taken from her... for good reason, right? Yeah turns out, we have some story to talk about which should be typical of this series, but getting the reason out will be harder than you think, because women. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> *ahem* Okay me, but really, getting even (I'm going to forget the name "Jusetsu" so) the Raven Consort to help with her mysterious powers likely passed from the gods is also not going to be an easy task. As with the role of this specific Consort, she only does favours after exhausting all options, or that, if she is demanded by the leader of the palace which of course, now is based on this new emperor so I guess she can speak. Still, quite a character to not listen to demand, but hey, maybe some good food will quill her temper. *ahem* Haha anyways, the story we are doing in this specific arc somehow is dealing with a ghost and a jade earring which was found by the emperor, but that's as much as he knew. Being a man of authority, I guess he can't blend in to the masses to find out more of where this item came from but the Consort can? Hmm... *ahem* so what else is new. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She did get some buns to eat out of it so I guess she's gotta work for it. Speaking of work, she went down in disguise to the servant's nest and talked to Jiu-Jiu (<a href="https://twitter.com/kokyu_anime/status/1575077865934114819?s=20&amp;t=tJaXIdRQVH52rsy5FQlD3g" target=_blank>Marinka</a>, by the way, and the first reason I'm watching this lol) which quickly led her to the older servants who talked about the history of the premises, about how the dowager banished the heir to emperor after taking over leadership, how she was more feminist than most men in that era lol *ahem*, and how supposedly one of the Consorts hanged herself after being accused of a murder of another pregnant Consort which, you know, will then be a potential heir should anyone else not bear any children for the current leader so *ahem* haha you see why I needed this abbreviation now? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, and that's how every day at the servants' quarters is a joy with all this gossip haha why know the truth when it's none of your business and you can make them up? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> PERIOD DRAMA, BY THE WAY- Oops. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And looks like, basically, the emperor is intending to punish the dowager for her crimes properly and not be a ruthless ruler like her to use violence which is good, we have a nice guy coming into the new Era, good news. Pity the guys at the doorstep though, they didn't have a choice. *ahem* All in all haha, you KNOW this is Anime because "kawaii" was mentioned in this series lol, you know this is a mystery waiting to unfold considering we have already been given this much just in episode one, and YOU KNOW that old b*tch will not stand to be locked in a palace so hell yeah I hope you will enjoy what is coming up as much as I do, to be honest. As such, and why am I using such a formal tone lol, I'll give this the three-episode rule, which will likely end this mini arc too. Then maybe, <em>maybe</em>, we'll find out why the emperor is in the middle of the lake peeping at girls taking a wash. Haha see you guys then *ahem*</div><div>[TL:DR; Okay doesn't matter if I finish watching this, but XING-XING MVP!!! Haha that golden bird, can we not have that also have a corresponding human cosplay?

Haha maybe it's just the mood, though. But I did try to get my mood back to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%87%BA%E7%94%BA%E6%9F%B3%E3%83%91%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%A6%E3%83%8B%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-ep/1644069211?l=en" target=_blank>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</a></b> because Anime "Yojouhan" series but also because I forgot how chill you have to be in mood to give any of their styles. So yeah, turned back around to give the A-side after I gave one of the B-sides where the guitarist also got his vocal input. No single review though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/armadillo-ep/1644299724?l=en" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance's new mini-album</a></b> isn't exactly the best thing they have released so far but I gotta say they have not been in years I'm rather disappointed, because I ended up giving the song which was released two months ago instead of the new songs that have music videos to top them up. Oh well, nice try, I guess. I did still give a couple more songs because they are regulars though. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/welcome-to-my-wonderland/1644299193?l=en" target=_blank>Touyama Nao's new album</a></b> is also not that great, because as I said the <a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1576497222341959680?s=20&amp;t=BEFOSLuHP8rqpjtbJmU72g" target=_blank>amusement park theme</a> didn't make this experience any better my benchmark is at 2015 with <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/harukarisk-land/972592545?l=en" target=_blank>Tomatsu Haruka's 3rd album</a> and that's why I can state which album it specifically is I remembered it that deeply, still got me with a couple of songs as I listen to them again so I'll take those. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tenk-you-ep/1644991883?l=en" target=_blank>Takahashi Minami's 10th anniversary mini-album</a></b> (where unlike Kayano Ai's album which is not on digital lol) is not exactly what I want especially with the singing voice lol but that doesn't mean the moods of the songs aren't good, so I took not the topic song. Been my motivation lately so I think it is good. This is how you gauge a new song is good, right?<br><br>Looks like we don't have much on music news on Twitter well within my scope, I might give a listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/amuse_official/status/1574715482397196291?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>AMUSE VOICE ACTORS album to release in December</a></b> if I'm really bored because I know Tomita Miyu and Isobe Karin and the latter could use some more singing with others sadly I wish this is a list of solo songs, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/honkidance/status/1574775881582579712?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>Yoru no Honki Dance's new music video</a></b> did not get me again after Wednesday because I swear the melody impression is getting in the way, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/VP_official/status/1575802884163219456?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>VELTPUNCH's new music video</a></b> for their single in weeks is a meh and I hope the other A-side in this double release will be good, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1575835205864419330?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>ClariS is finally on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> in person which is run by their parent company Sony Music Japan lol and they sung their most popular song ever so popular even Alice sung it a decade ago <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie_staff/status/1576149941973528576?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>Takahashi Rie's new song is available for pre-order</a></b> which also means you don't get to hear it yet so I'll listen when it's out, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1576226681374867457?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new music video</a></b> (<a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1576227189686575104?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>with subtitles</a>, by the way) gave us an oldie style tune and music video in 4:3 aspect ratio so I hope this is what carries me to listen to her album in two weeks, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1576174967258959873?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>Aimer's new mini-album is confirmed for December</a></b> release which includes some of the songs mentioned these few months, and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1576494886924488704?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg" target=_blank>GLIM SPANKY's new song is for a drama series</a></b> with Ishiwara Junji writing the lyrics apparently. I guess the adaptation requires more specific lyrics to be in the song, or else why not let the band write it, right? I don't know I don't second guess the Japanese music industry <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br>So for next week, we only have <b>Ueda Reina's new mini-album</b> which the topic song didn't really stick with me so if that sucks haha I now have a larger backlog of live performances so we will find something better than Awesome City Club. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br><br><br><br> And that's all for this week! Man, it's starting October and I'm already tired. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Thankfully, I'll get myself immersed with playing video games... progressing slowly but surely... to curb the work... stress or boredom or whatever until the next package comes. Gotta say though? Might become best package for the year. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you all by then, and until next time, go find out that Potion Permit game and tell me whether I should romance Martha who works at the tavern or Rue ie. the Mayor's daughter which I first saved and the very reason I started on this adventure. I know right, even Stardew Valley didn't give me this hard of a decision lol by the way I chose Abigail because we be gaming day and night <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span><br></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
