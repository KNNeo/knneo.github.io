Haha okay me relax this is only Day 2 out of 9 <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span><div><br></div><div>Hey everyone. As you can see I really tried to enjoy the Saturday before ie. yesterday before I come in to do up this weekly post because goddamn, I'm going to have so much time in my hands. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> For better or for worse, but I have things planned, so let's hope next week's post intro is not me b*tching about what I've NOT done haha I know I'll at least be doing up another post next week so stay tuned for that.</div><div><br></div><div>With all the things going on a Sunday, let's Anime and music!<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BLEACHTYBW02><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Besides, Kurosaki will never lose to a guy like that" Ishida making waves lol "I have no intention to help him" O~kay dude haha</div></blockquote>Holy shit is the opening animation the best thing I've seen of this series in years. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, at least that means they are improving- They even have the overlay text title cards!!! Haha apart from my hype about the new episode (#BLEACHTYBW02), let's talk about what happened. Oh yeah, we gotta do the Sasakibe funeral first. Oops. Well, it was solemn, it was a warning from the enemy or just a coincidence but I hardly doubt so considering they know Soul Society well and have shadow teleportation powers which is a Quincy thing? Haha ah hey what can I say. But yeah, just a summary from Akon twice but thank goodness we only have to hear it once, they are deadly in approach, they destroy Hollows so basically Quincy in nature besides the Arrancars they took captive including Harribel which is de facto leader after Aizen's capture, and (I'm just used to this name so) Kirge Opie is in charge of operations in the Hollow world as of now, and taking the best of the weak to the leader if necessary. Or if they don't retaliate haha when you have power you tend to do those things lol. Anyways, which made the Nel trio leave the place to find Ichigo and the others and boy does Nel's super speed hit the joke every time, and the others apart from Ishida(?) decide to go and save their home world led by I will always be his in-lore discipline, Urahara-sensei haha I was already hyped when I saw him. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Besides the occasional Inoue fanservice- I'll just take Inoue as fanservice for now. Heck, she might be the ONLY fanservice to be honest since none is really as cute and... and as stacked as she is. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> That, and some blood here and there lol I forgot Hollows do take more human form the more power they have even with a mask ie. Arrancars, did not stop the other Fraccions aka Espada underlings from retaliating against the Wanderich army, but to no avail. I mean, we be dealing with God so I would hope the army under him is powerful, and I guess they are. For my summary though, let's talk about what will happen soon but don't tell Yhwach because he will kill us for it he only cares about the present whether it's as his foretelling lol. Ichigo saw Kirge for the first time so next week's going to be that which will be great because this will take many episodes if I recall, and is also the best time to invade Soul Society because Ichigo won't have hands to fly to that other world to help the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> as a main character of this series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, Ishida isn't in this equation... yet because he will be once he is isolated (why the dad didn't appear though?) and then confronted by the enemy to join them because he is technically one of them... and THEN we shall see what happens going on this might be too far into the future haha. All in all... thank goodness I'm only more impressed every moment of each episode despite the weaker characters that are appearing (and dying) and not like I've forgotten about them we need to hit our female quota before feminist groups appear lmao see you guys on WordPress, but yeah so far so really damn good apart from some animation issues I see but that's just me watching Anime for like a decade and a half so don't mind me. The theme songs are meh but show off a lot about the series in general with the opening just being dope and ending with all the swords if you see me defining all of them from left to right later you know I'm a fan or have too much time haha, but overall it is still impressive. Let's keep this going, guys, remember what I want out of this final arc, all the action in <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span> territory so I can keep this in memory forever lol maybe I'll watch this early next week hehe</div><div>[Finally some proper GIFs I can make for this glorious, glorious series for Nel haha thinking back now I can't believe the one and only Kaneda Tomoko singlehandedly did adult her too- Excuse me while I go back and watch it again hehe]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPjjh_xNRmmjkeVsmCKn7LAkFoC6HZpLx2koYWJLIR5znLdHWuZteLKKb_vpthKif3KaKh4PiDD33yDjE-nu_PSyg0gOHrWmwhCuMKW2imnqu59J1jxfMCxvaSfxW1bXXFPqyM9xs4K5TgILgV2W1eAmzzrKVuTEddJkN-piFzNmWfVv9XS7AfFOzD/s1600/bleachTYBW02_fall.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>30 years old coming at me like<br>(Haha yes the kid reference is included)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvjykCVHo5TD0BhTxpTgJNK65eL5YWPwEWtgN2gXgm5dL-mBan0Z9X7AslxTqKbrz9A4QfBFIo6yZEA1ROnLuu5dN3JP5K9zkhUYA1obtlYHdLuaiQdLk_G7mAKDfGL0PQKg2TtROdzh8xdvKHKJTCoiM1MbtRjRIIZbY_N56SZZOcvZAFew4fR_I3/s320/bleachTYBW02_arrancars4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is the coolest these girls have been EVER haha</table></div></div><div><div>P.S.

I get the general idea of the story already and I'm not that keen on the progression considering it's aliens and that's kinda <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>isekai</a> lmao so I'm dropping this. Sorry <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/14441/Sumire_Uesaka target=_blank>Sumipe</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=UzakiChanS204><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! Double</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"There's no way they'll get to the finish line" IT IS LIKE AS IF THEY KNOW haha</div></blockquote>I see Uzaki is still dreaming about her compatiblity with her senpai like he doesn't even care haha ah hey in this new episode where the dream goes on though (#UzakiChanS204), everyone had to bask in Uzaki's joy, whether you like it or not I guess. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So welp, let's keep the ball rolling I guess, as much as this hurts lol can't you see Ami-chan is already quivering like she used to? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, remember how Uzaki thinks the prophet (lol) is so true in their telling of the couple's compatibility? Yeah, that's the problem. Somehow Uzkai has hypnotized herself to think that Sakurai likes her and thus is just waiting for the confession I assume (deja vu Anime "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen target=_blank>Kaguya-sama</a>"?), so yeah, that is kinda boring for the script so far so (haha) we gotta move things along. Cue the rest of the Café staff maybe not including the father he's just there to add to the count, as leader of the group Sakaki keeps pounding on Uzaki... for information haha relax, about Sakurai and why, of all times, she must act more hastily than ever. You know, just citing unknown sources like we always do on our term papers to pad the report lol, Sakaki shows off how much Sakurai is actually on demand despite his introvert personality, will already crush woman if he just takes off his shirt to Ami-chan, for example. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Basically, we gotta slap the j-j-j-jealousy on her real quick haha nice one Sakaki and Ami's dad. Whether that's getting into Uzaki or not, we have many more segregated job shifts to brainwash her in. To add on though, the cooking lessons on Uzaki's place with the mother, I mean, Tsuki-san haha, is going REAL well. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Because seriously, calling her "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/okusan target=_blank>madam</a>" would've sufficed we always go more formal if we don't know how to call someone it's still better than "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/okaasan target=_blank>mother</a>" lmao I mean you're halfway there already, would also be better off not reminding the mother that she has potential to be the next romance drama villain by stealing her daughter's lover(?) from her? Man, this is getting confusing for such an irritating title. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, I think just the mother doing the mother thing by giving her daughter advice might have turned things around, so let's just say this episode doesn't exist. Okay maybe the Ami-chan part is good haha. All in all, we salute to all who have contributed to the (little) progress of the relationship between Uzaki Hana and Sakurai... I don't remember his given name lol this is just making me bleed internally I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Heck, I even know Uzaki's mom's given name but I wouldn't even call her that so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See, the idea about comedy series is that we just keep setting up mines knowing that they will explode at some point because someone is dumb enough to step on it ie. the guy who set up the mine so thanks author, much thought has been done to make sure this is as funny as it's dumb to watch. Oops, ran out of rice again how am I going to have lunch now haha Uzaki-chan though ever thought of not sh*tting on your senpai? Just saying <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div>[Ami-chan is just great for reactions for this episode so]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5-jbWfgw6mdXbSujhdUZYCjlHVRuC37S6XEgTue2bYy9a5QGWf-tKr-DHPoH8K1006Kd0h1nj0kU6uHErkDQVgPJ_OfrXN873RjpbhoQE2yBCIDNAT3q0h5BODU22SaczlYckCgEF-ozp0_DqPuFV_pmhOapdJYy8_1XYobZfQ5Y8lcyYOjl3p08Q/s320/uzakichanS204_ami3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I disable the adult filter on Twitter<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihjKRrxBexMZcegmMFiRzP2pLx41lwlnZDHALPrOkFev-l6Vuk5Opl2-lsDqkcCzF4-96HZaLSnPhCwM3onT4b1lwYBct9uvzCMz8leCttkgFTm6uQph0UCfb3xQqnBi47BGq_R2WElSRtB1dn27RGEj0vCW2zBkMONz4ysq5Lug0jUX2N_e7uUbtI/s320/uzakichanS204_ami1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when that one package with TWO swimsuit photobooks did not arrive for 2 months haha</table></div></div><div>P.S.

CHILLAX TIME!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, we not saving humans now, so what the heck. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we take care of the things <em>inside</em> the palace haha I mean we have been so far just now for the Raven Consort herself now (#KoukyuuNoKarasu04), you ever seen the weirdest interactions between a Consort and her ladies in waiting? Hey me too but *ahem* it's period drama so I don't ask too much just like how they won't too. What we will ask more on though, is that ghost of a bird that keeps appearing in the court somehow. Rumours only talk about the Princess involved with this bird who passed away but clearly the bird has some remnants unable to settle and so it hasn't left the real world, so I guess we helping birds now. It's a problem Jusetsu also knows as she is rather troubled for offending her underlings haha I know right *ahem*, and so the Emperor besides helping her carve a wooden bird also offered her some advice, about the stuff around her she shouldn't just give away. I mean, she did give off the food but food makes people happy. Women, after all. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> *ahem* Also, serious talk, Jusetsu? He doesn't want to kill you the next time he has to, so keep that thing around. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Let that sink in for you guys for a bit let's move on haha if you don't get this go *ahem* on the death penalty exception, let's talk about the actual story in place. Jusetsu finally spotted the lady in waiting to that very Princess, talking about how THAT GODDAMN DOWAGER did not provision medicine for her even though she was ill THAT B*TCH lol me chill, and interestingly, thought of growing medicinal herbs in her garden to hopefully turn things around. I mean, it's not impossible it kinda works even without the lady in waiting helping her out haha oops, but yeah, it was when they didn't after an argument that got her into trouble. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Feeling some deja vu, Jusetsu? Your problem with Jiu-Jiu is the same damn thing- And it all comes around, as the medicinal herb that got the Princess into a drowning incident was in an effort to help the lady with her coughing issues when season change because man, maybe I should grow some of those myself too haha I feel a cough coming already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, blah blah Emperor's greatest friend died because Dowager again, so try to make friends with your ladies in waiting lest they get killed and you have to try puddles then. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Did we mention about the Raven Consort not making contact with people unless necessary? *ahem* All in all... hey, which *ahem* you watched taught you about leaders having to be more matured or understanding to their underlings more than ever? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Even modern society is a joke compared to this Anime. Apart from the Dowager. That woman is the devil. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also, secrets are meant to be within walls, not people. No really, think about it. Heck, this series taught me so many things in just a month, I hope it does for you all who don't watch conventional period drama on a daily basis. I know I don't haha so this can fill in the gap I guess. And goddamn is the last sentence of this episode a little scary, but I hope that for all our sakes, Jusetstu will be able to discern from her position as a Consort and the people around her soon enough. Hey, we can't kill people no more after the Dowager, ain't it? Haha don't second guess me I'm just here for the tears lol and ONLY the tears just because- Yes, what the Emperor saw by his bed was an illusion, thanks for asking</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJ7h8oWbka5gAd0AmWkqXKj_ljvrA6gsz0yaWHH_ax_8kdznXCjZw_MsZ_K4yhkU8aY5Ds2KU9YIsjbw4tGRJuc15Q21tWnohXJgeKri36e76zlJR7xBGj8KpLiuKzO8ToqJ03Fmf_CiApHqP8Y4dJjOFx2PWabJXPJO_AccTn2LrtsRxCcGCefZji/s320/koukyuunokarasu04_jiujiu4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me whenever voice actress I follow on Instagram likes my comment<br>(And yes, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/35441/Marika_Kouno target=_blank>Marinka</a> used to do that too)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkwghuqWdJDynC7JTT_GnTVFTuT-b_CNMWrXE6wlhqDsTp_hfdfr73JueJjs5YM2sXXe_SVX_RavC0ZViE6BDvyZ_ZMM9gI4GZ3oLfuThAc-b-4ijrtpVotrbQSi_zo8NpcgJZeuHTSSoHinme-R7XohkecOfUJhgzlDYGoOsiCjQr7alE080vEygv/s320/koukyuunokarasu04_jusetsu3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me at work lol not true but there aren't PCs in this era so</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEienbDVJ8cPfZ1RzC6gIUGUDAmi0J21R9mTH5QCnZca4LYpvxcqzzyx3T44cRaL5YSMAByJZyKVQYFuejzO1xWrW8rEK5hR2WvD7TDv-CtIf2aS0vQEjDXFOQkPXvmWoyvQtISZQ714xtdbAZKs3FKJJLjoMsrd2tPeEG_H1dSAzgE0sAgm2n1MFBkS/s320/koukyuunokarasu04_oldman.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Dude, how old and wise are you to open just one eye when talking to the emperor?<br>(Also me next year when I turn 30 lmao)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I did end up giving the one <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/flattery/1538899563?i=1538900235&amp;l=en" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana song</a></b> from the live video I watched last week, and I also gave <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/like-like/1648562380?i=1648562384&amp;l=en" target=_blank>FINLANDS' new song</a></b> (yes, the band with one member haha) because I was totally in a mood to listen to it that one day so you're welcome I guess. That, and yes <b>no VELTPUNCH single</b> on music streaming services though so we will get to that at some point I hope.<br><br> On news concerning music on Twitter and the people I follow which are not only just mainstream artists lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ibuking_1114/status/1581896556042915840?s=20&amp;t=tbRtzBzusC1ae_QQlgn8sQ" target=_blank>voice actress Kido Ibuki liked the new

based on listener opinion and it's still not holding up or that I never had the mood for them- Oh what the heck <a

let's just say I'm not keen on giving her songs now- the music videos are GREAT though haha okay me<br><br> Okay so next week is the load of the month to end the month haha, we have the anticipated <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B9-ep/1647153285?l=en" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE new EP</a></b> with their major label debut and guess what it's Sony Music Japan so please tell me we get an Anime "BLEACH" theme song from these guys *copium*, QUEEN BEE aka <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/mysterious-ep/1647144906?l=en" target=_blank>Jououbachi's new single</a></b> for Anime "Koukyuu no Karasu" I hope it will be good if I don't get deterred by the masculine female voice by the way, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/anthology-destiny/1640060091?l=en" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new album</a></b> which I have heard nothing of despite sharing some here so maybe I'll just skim over that one. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br><br><br><br> Okay, I thought I gotta mention about next week since I guess the package will also make me write a blog post but, for once we will have an Anime Extra next week! I'll probably watch "BLEACH" early because guess what I watched the old episodes (the real old ones) for an afternoon which then followed by the manga gave me a headache so I'm getting hyped for that so hope the subs can catch up, and a certain Anime movie which I didn't expect was streaming exclusively on Disney+ when I saw excerpts on YouTube from the official production studio. So yeah, those if all goes well. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... maybe I should find a video game to play I do have a theme park building game "Indoorlands" on my wishlist released but I didn't want to play it so... maybe I should then. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Or maybe I should play "Populous" again and see if I can clear more than 2 levels. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe Worms haha I remember I created all the "BLEACH" characters and then put them in AI mode to fight against each other lmao ok ok decided haha bye<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Maybe I should for every coming episode of Anime "BLEACH" talk about my fanfic where I exist as the 12th Squad Captain shortly after Urahara left a century ago. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Let me think about it first haha</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
