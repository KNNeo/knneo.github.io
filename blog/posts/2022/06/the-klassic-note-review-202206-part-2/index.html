Yeah, we not talking about your music by the way lmao your album is next month, I know. But you are in it though!</div><div><br></div><div>We're back for more music reviews! This time around, which should've appeared first, we conclude on this season's Anime theme song offerings before we move on to more new songs which I hope will not continue to burn a hole in my pocket lol please I need money to buy photobooks and bromides <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>We also have a cheater amongst us again, and just like the Suzuki Productions previously lol, we have another single-track release! So don't mind me as I skip that and talk about the other two which ARE also way better in my opinion anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Besides that, we have a lot of record breaks in a while, with this being the 2nd review post in a month and reviewing THREE SINGLES by the way. Yeah, this year's a miracle lol it's as if it knows we are at #KN15YEARS <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Ok we have a long enough introduction let's do this! Literally should've done this on Wednesday but my retired dad was out and I had to get this from the post office today so</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div id=CHiCOBibittoLove><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq music"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>CHiCO with HoneyWorks meets Mafumafu - Bibitto Love [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=453 data-original-width=500 height=290 src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/29/SMCL-767.jpg width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=453 data-original-width=500 height=290 src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/28/SMCL-766.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Anime Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Artist Regular Edition</table><div>(CHiCO-san doesn't show her real face so you tell me which cover I liked- Artist cover by the way)</div><div><br></div><div>Origin: I have been listening to this Anime artist for a while now, and similar to artists like Sangatsu no Phantasia and ClariS, they have been in cover of their physical image in order to deliver the audio image which they potentially possess, and I must say CHiCO-san here is fine by me. Though for being with Anime producer group HoneyWorks is what made her shine, singing great Anime theme songs one after another, as where I knew of them about 5 years ago. Fast forward to this season where they gave me the most hyped single I can expect from an Anime without such hype, it's still science-related, which really made you wonder how they pulled this off. Let's talk about why.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Bibitto Love [Vivid Love]</div><div>From the intro:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"Vivid Love</div><div style=text-align:center>Receiving (heart) flutters</div><div style=text-align:center>Knowing about affection, about love</div><div style=text-align:center>At the genetic level</div><div style=text-align:center>The 'like' (we) can't unravel with (our) heads</div><div style=text-align:center>Life's quest</div><div style=text-align:center>Let's take it as a challenge"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>This is another collaboration song for the Anime's 2nd season coming, which similar to the first ending song, but this time around we have a slightly different combination, but containing the best of what music production had to offer back then. The bass slaps, the melody is catchy, the lyrics bring in so much meaning into the theme of research of love... everything is wonderful about this song. With guest vocalist Mafumafu on the helm, he helped create balance in this duet, and made it sound better than ever. The lyrics speak about vividly being in love while still figuring out everything else... with science but we won't touch it any further. Now you know why this might be just by new favourite Anime theme song; It's just so good! Okay maybe the bridge part is too long but relevance definitely made it forgiving for the most part.</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7CQPvJqea-M title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Vividly Above Average</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Soreike! Salaryman [Go go! Salaryman]</div><div>From the intro:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"Hooray Hooray!</div><div style=text-align:center>Take it easy</div><div style=text-align:center>Hooray Hooray!</div><div style=text-align:center>Aren't you doing your best?</div><div style=text-align:center>Hooray Hooray!</div><div style=text-align:center>Tomorrow should be better than today"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>I can't believe I got baited into giving this song considering this is a motivational song and it's this girl keeping me going on my working days. We all know the perks and troubles of working a day job, and CHiCO-san is here to cheer us up, is what I meant. That is all you need to know from the lyrics, by the way, and she did a good job of it maybe even more then idol groups out there because as real as this is, it also had a catchy melody I can dance to. Now somehow making her dance in a cheerleader outfit would be even better, but considering such a song is a rarity in theme, I would only thank HoneyWorks for making this viable in the first place, and I think that is what we should be happy for.</div><div>Rating: Cheerfully Above Average</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: This single might be the new best for Klassic Note Review this year so far, mind my words. HoneyWorks, you have once again proven to me the prowess of your compositions, and I cannot ask for more now that I have listened to this for myself. CHiCO-san is just icing on the delicious cake. If you know of her, then this is just another impressive work to add into your library. But if you haven't, this might change your impression of how much you think this singer sounds cute, way more than you can imagine. And to that, I'm glad this single existed to prove my point.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(Okay maybe too much praise but serious talk though this is really good you should give a listen if you haven't. Also, she did show her face to the camera before because search "<a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbQISRBENayjKSXBqgT84aNCMRSen1q4jlypFvLWdpSZqMtosjotjk5bLA1yjMAfN5-j9L6HEvCNWM5VT1bTCwWZmzulHM-Z8WVYSxS70Yy0LC866SXIdC6xEZEQCCqAH-db7pfT3n3bU9UW9b6VRuLpEs3U4hnZZJ2TiBPVpR9mKwCGdRs3ZTjzlS/s320/hq720.jpg target=_blank>the first take chico</a>" and you will be impressed by not her voice)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>FOR ROUND TWO WE HAVE... over-equipped but underpowered boss?

I'm just glad that the Regular Edition exists and it's not an Anime cover...?)</div><div><br></div><div>Origin: I have only known nasuo-san here from Anime, but I did find out a little more about her peculiar style of music from her indie days to her now being under an Anime major label, her track record isn't exactly what everyone would like. That said though, thanks to Anime manipulating this behind the scenes do we get such a unique blend worth talking about. How did this happen though, I think we should talk about it at length to know if this was worth the ride.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Honey Jetcoaster</div><div>From the first verse:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"(A) Want to be loved</div><div style=text-align:center>(I) No excuses</div><div style=text-align:center>(Shi) Want to know, wish to know</div><div style=text-align:center>(Te) Embarrassed, just being mean</div><div style=text-align:center>(Ru) Looping around</div><div style=text-align:center>(?) Like a question mark"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>(Brackets spell "Aishiteru?" ie. "Do you love (me)?"; The lyrics are also loosely joined in a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shiritori target=_blank>shiritori</a> word chain, where final Hiragana character in every line repeats on the first character in brackets on the next besides on "te", and "?" starts with "ku")</div><div><br></div><div>So, from the start the lyrics are already portraying the scenes from the Anime series for the opening song, talking about her being better than the boyfriend, and ironically also the variations of Anime plots apart from original Manga works... the lyrics had everything. Since it was written by yours truly, I would not be surprised how much this mattered as it really helped create an otherwise different landscape of what this might have sounded like if it weren't her. Add in her singing with occasional misses in melody, along with a catchy and heavily transitioning style, it's no wonder this will get the kids in as much as I did. And isn't that what Anime songs are about? So yeah, they actually nailed the formula, and getting nasuo-san in this isn't a bad idea after all. Just, this is not close enough to her usual style at any length. You have been warned.</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wE0N7NcpzQ4 title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Jetcoaster Average</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: This single has its ups and downs including different versions and mixes in the Regular Edition and I won't bore you with it, but nasuo-san here is brilliant in making Anime songs in this single, so I implore you to find them out since she wrote the bulk of character songs for the Anime itself I can't even. Coming back to this though, this song is probably enough reason for me to talk about listening to something different once in a while, and I very welcome such a change. It's refreshingly different and will leave an impression on me for years to come.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE HAVE!!!

It's their 14th single coming since their debut in 2015, and despite it feeling like a haphazard attempt at filling the role of opening song artist, it has also nailed it in execution and delivery, making this a more of a fresh take reminiscent release I have expected of them from the beginning. It was always what was slightly different that made them stand out more than ever from their usual.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Hanarenai Kyori [Inseparable Distance]</div><div>From intro:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"Sure to have no result, with this far in distance</div><div style=text-align:center>Enough to bury it up</div><div style=text-align:center>Breathing in, tightly, choking</div><div style=text-align:center>All of what (I) missed, I'll feed them (to you)"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>For being the Anime's opening song, the producers totally nailed it in song design I would say by firstly making sure the lyrics and singing deliver a subtle whisper similar to ASMR feels, as can be heard from most of the song here and there. And that is probably what was attractive with this song, especially due to the fact that there are three vocalists, their whisper and singing can be fluently interchanged between all of them, and that makes if even more interesting then ever. The melody is simple, maybe too Anime in style, but it isn't bad, and adding in the whispers to break out of the song itself, depending who you ask, is probably for the better overall. Its uniqueness in style plus the usual Anime theme song feels makes it a compelling yet good song in my opinion.</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eW5FbLpZR7o title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Underestimated Above Average</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Etoile [Trans.: Star]</div><div>From end of first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"To the ever-changing future</div><div style=text-align:center>Let's keep walking as usual</div><div style=text-align:center>Let's move on, to where (it is) exciting"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>When I listened to the intro I was immediately reminded of independent band SHE'S and their grand yet warm style of writing songs with impact, but turns out, this is a more reminiscent style of music I would have liked if you asked me about TrySail in their early days, and I'm just glad to have given the chance to them before giving it a pass. The melody is traditional yet different, the lyrics are motivating yet encouraging which again makes this more appealing on an idol group perspective than ever, and it doesn't have a bridge with vocals? What more can I nitpick about this song? Overall though, it does not stand out from the stars in the universe, but it was one that shone, and I took notice of it. That, to me, is good enough.</div><div>Rating: Beautifully Average</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: It has been a while since I reviewed a TrySail single, so I'm just happy it turned out better than what was in my first impression, just singing for a comedy romance Anime. Breaking out of the action Anime series they sang for is so different a world, it made me appreciate their early days singing such songs a lot more. This is also an easy entry for people who have never listened to these girls before, and is in my opinion a once in a blue moon rare treasure to pick up nowadays, so I won't ask for more.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(Okay maybe too much praise for this one too but I'm just glad I can give TrySail again... remember 2015 and 2016?
