Please, my average episodes to watch per week per series is one. I watch every week. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But that might change soon, I gotta watch "Romantic Killer" someday...<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BLEACHTYBW11><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I know the whereabouts of every Asauchi I've created" Holy sh*t is this ye olde GPS? Haha spiritual energy dude, it's better than satellite</div></blockquote>You think Ichigo understood whatever the f**k Namaiya, THE zanpakuto creator, is talking about all this time? He don't, right? He's not <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> too. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> No really, in these final episodes of the first cour of the final arc (#BLEACHTYBW11), let's talk about where Ichigo's soul stands at. With Zangetsu...? Haha ah hey long time joke already, let's be serious. I guess I should talk about each episode at length, huh. Well, not long, I don't want to type so much here. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Story goes that Ichigo was brought back to his hometown lol you can figure that out yourself, and sees his father in a shinigami outfit. So yeah, he will tell us the story. Of him, being a family of Shiba clan. Being a captain, so many years ago. So surprise, Ichigo is basically Quincy in nature but we shall not elaborate just yet, but yeah, if you think Matsumoto with shorter hair and even shorter Hitsugaya in the 10th Squad of the Gotei 13 is stupid, think again. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Because someone is making even more noise in the Real World specifically Karakura Town, and even less of a surprise there, we are talking about events roughly after when Urahara escaped Soul Society a century ago in the timeline thanks to three Captains, and before one of them Aizen decided to pin himself on the wall. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, that. Firstly, we talk about the confrontation. Not with Aizen and the gang, but kinda. Let's. If I didn't remember wrongly it was about 20(?) years ago in the timeline, Mayuri had succeeded me as Captain of the 12th Squad <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> personal fan lore, and after some events in the Real World with shinigami killed it happened again soon after in repetition, so Isshin was sick of waiting in line and decided to investigate this by himself even though apparently it was 13th Squad's job at the time. What he saw though, was basically an Arrancar prototype because looks like it got Hollow powers from a deceased(?) shinigami (Can you die <em>and </em>die again? I mean, ask the guy whom Zaraki took the sword from lol) so Hollow but acted in the form of a shinigami, so Arrancar basically. That term was probably not coined back then, so "White", I guess. Hey, I'm not being racist, Aizen is. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Isshin was supposed to deal with it well, but this time around, maybe also because Aizen knew that this prototype wasn't making much progress in order for them to draw better conclusions to the evolution of their "research", he decided to intervene. So I guess Isshin doesn't know the betrayal thing yet. Yeah, only Urahara and that bunch knew, I suppose. Thankfully, Masaki ran out of her... fostered shelter lol that's the nicest way to say that because Ryuuken can't even do shit haha yes that's Ishida's dad by the way he looks so young, to you know, take action. It went surprisingly well just by baiting the enemy to her side and shooting a spiritual arrow down its neck, almost blew up in an explosion if not for Isshin helping out... so I guess they win. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But what is up next, is what will seal the deal for the backstory of Ichigo's family.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi94v7HZ7J9ReUOxN1AF2aiuR5WUbpFlMX9ZPvNJgeYUJdTUOrtS71JQYco21gdj7QofgA-P6D0mZWD-D36cm2GFaqHpfDpB4M4bf4j66kOEriuKjmj2Kofxfr0jQ-ug5AkttPA4B_15v_hmJSxAB8zuLMCTBzwWS3vipgkCg-yZNEWGs_NGVzbYPXy/s320/bleachTYBW11_couple.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is where it all started, people.<br>A love story of all time haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOLqYjON4VmUQmD_IqDff6SMm7yVw2Cmint2O_5mSuAO7qEXiigNU3ZPsiziQenN7-K1Cdvtb5OM6y4xUEvNPcC_PRmt0cC1VaceNNUdWq8guqo10mZfrqHXJ6AAVSjrImgj55WOo3H-wbfVNrktV58kuwd-KSFFuHzhQvEyeJc75GgRkX-U74AssC/s320/bleachTYBW11_shiba2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW people get my sex jokes I say lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnXdhDWxyGIHQ7W6KN9N3hYWfipCQuB85TQNEBgCBelGMaj_CQ8b9P4dPp5ly3VuQ_PL_Mnwk9QMrJsw3Z0XodptWNgwMwTuhkOnVkppraPhlz5zDwmkKX3JYxS7PhIe6Xb8KoNpKRPua_AG7txyAtgybnS9xyh657eCSsiDVCl14EbTjIGEBZdR8L/s1600/bleachTYBW11_shooting.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is real impressive though, considering she is a Quincy of Ishida Uryu's age</table></div></div><div><div></div><div><blockquote style=text-align:center>"Do you think she (Masaki) will be happy marrying me?" Of course not Ryuuken you f**k even a dead soul is more capable of marrying her- Oops</blockquote></div></div><div>So days later, after Isshin went back and reported... pretty much everything that happened and I swear three people already knew it in the Hall lmao <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, this part (#BLEACHTYBW12) talked about Masaki's condition after that fight. In summary? Not great. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, not great if you are Ryuuken because damn freaking Katagiri opened her damn mouth when she found out that a Hollow hole appeared on a Quincy, probably went to tell on the Aunt of the household who shouldn't be knowing of this so... but yeah, I guess in order to receive treatment, even though at this point you think anyone Quincy will treat her? Haha damn, I mean, we were nice enough to keep her till high school, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ryuuken thought of getting his father to help her out but he's out we never saw the old man again anyways so whatever lol <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but he did see Isshin who went back to the Real World once again to thank the girl who saved his soul. Well, only to find out that she is about to die, and arguing with another Quincy who he doesn't even know who, and THEN dealing with another dude who tells them we can't get Masaki back as a (pure) Quincy and just to save her life we have to sacrifice someone? Man, this is a lot to think about let us sit down with some tea, please. But of course not, we don't have time to brainstorm like Ryuuken, and only after listening to the resident Hollowfication expert right here - well, the only expert - did Isshin immediately agree to Urahara's terms: putting his soul inside a human body and bind with Masaki to counteract the Hollow Quincy inside her, something that would already kill her anyways if we wait any longer. Also, if they did not stop Masaki's Hollowfication, Aizen would have been SO happy, he's gonna be me when I jack off- Anyways haha he didn't and so is my sad single life lol, but heck, on that very day a bond is formed. Sorry, Ryuuken, you can go bang Katagiri or something lmao, but congratulations on Shiba Isshin with the nice snatch on Kurosaki Masaki and telling us his love story... he threw away his family name too lest he got found out by probably Kuukaku but I think she already knew who her brother is like, and they now have to be together for all of eternity. Well, almost. Because remember the mother died? Yeah, she didn't die because she can't fight a Hollow. Grand Fisher, if you would recall. She was just an impure Quincy, but she can fight with a bow and have something to defend herself, even if you didn't know about the Blut Vene thing. But no, that was also the day Yhwach awakened his powers. Nine years ago. Welp. I'm not going to name that godly power of his, but if you understand that his blood runs with all Quincy... So, in case you wonder how this all links to Ichigo, as my dear Urahara Kisuke has mentioned, this Hollowfication thing will be passed down for generations. Therefore Ichigo. I mean, it can be Karin-chan too but that is not the point. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, the Hollow, the Quincy blood thing even though Ichigo is even less pure than the mom at this point, the shinigami powers easily drawn out from little training from Urahara who KNEW of his position as a human soul jack of all trades... You get the idea now. He HAS to be the main character-</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2H1SjQNCDIeO5AwZv7aHE-28e4V_4ai_reH_N2Bw8e_qFMQ9I-2MBWopVZPbpmh7wkbkJHwB3sU-gupfUTLS5VIeoKzQITq2ldDO8PTHxu3coIgeAZEt5sqYYP8AlWZYvdsZYz2KEjs13M4yh6B9zukmp7l0PwyGlJXlKCpEY10A16FQVjIsKih2U/s320/bleachTYBW12_gigai.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me in a corner at parties lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeVArwtz0vZVCTA64c1c7VlhoBzojBgdhRm4Br-lPKxCzjQpAipJZv0XS6x6yXShQ3mdXyTlJ6mCqkM4PDd3hTV6bqE7xe7BW4YVYACubNioiWfzxrJPQIwXEw0BJ3OlITQ-n-zUmRv77QGHAOykONz59oa2EXVeNJ1Hou8dnJg8mJFsLv_FzvRA67/s320/bleachTYBW12_hole.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Aw man her hole is open IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgl3PnQp3UWW-IAXHgDfDy40mrmQyg8V2tUpfBUHukXNJDZi-wWAt_qkbFYgknyK8fgUsnZL2SNdl7DrnHepxqQ7ltMBhqK4AOsZBTlBlCz9jjg3sov9Phm-DR7J1ixRzo4_bAtYocK63CfR2R6UDkmgrgpha5tg-ky2a7QqTuSOjWm4BnHTUjqz2BQ/s320/bleachTYBW12_yay.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I write shit code, show it to the user and it actually works<br>(Yay) (Haha)</table></div></div><div><blockquote style=text-align:center>"... there's a possibility that the Ishida family's bloodline could become tainted!" Yeah, this is a thing. Also, Masaki WAS bit by a Hollow so....</blockquote></div><div>And to end this season, for the final episode (#BLEACHTYBW13) I guess we are making Ichigo's zanpakuto now. Hey, the Asauchi now kinda looks like the Quincy army, right? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Don't deja vu too much, guys, we got story to tell. Well, let's save the best for last, so let's talk about what is in Seireitei now. Well, considering some of them got their Bankai stolen, I can't imagine the likes of Hitsugaya and Soifon being able to do anything at this point apart from... honing their other skills? I mean, Soifon still has her assassination and/or Shunko powers she learnt from the 2nd Squad thing (Edit: Oh yeah Onmitsukidou, thanks Bleach Wiki), but Hitsugaya?? He is pretty much done, dude, if he can't get his sword back. Ironic, isn't it? Like, isn't there anything in the shinigami's blood- Oops, too much deja vu. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But for Komamura though, he has a different story. Considering he isn't a human soul in the first place, and he's under some animal clan or something haha hey guys let's not get into furry territory that fast, but yeah, he desired to get back the clan's power to compensate for his lack of sword power. Makes sense, but I guess the old dog won't agree to this that easily, so he has to deal with it first. I mean, this old thing is more stubborn than my grandfather who is already dead by the time I was born so you tell me. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on lol, Mayuri is doing something real secret and evil which will be revealed soon but suffice it to say he is once again illegally modifying his Bankai to no end but not like he hasn't done that before his sword changed shape so much Namaiya might be confused to see his soul now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hisagi is forced to draw out his Bankai which he did I don't have to do spoiler alert for this because HE NEVER RELEASED IT ANYWAYS also it is not that convenient as with many others which you can find out in novel series co-written by another author under Kubo-sensei's supervision <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, and I guess we can talk about Ichigo's zanpakuto now. For starters, it's not Zangetsu. Well, the name, as provided from the "sword" itself. That's not real. Now that we have gone through the whole thing about how much of a Rojak Ichigo was made to be even as a human lol Southeast Asia joke, one should understand how this works now. So basically, Ichigo's soul is comprised of many things. The Quincy power, for starters. He was born from Masaki who is a Quincy so that makes sense, he hardly is a shinigami to begin with. Then, there's the Hollow. According to the dad, he got back his powers because the bond to hold back Masaki's Hollowfication is broken due to Ichigo doing all the save the world stuff lol, so in a nutshell a Hollow sits within him. Why didn't it die with the mother I wouldn't know, but let's just say it didn't. Passed down for generations, remember? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, those two, and Ichigo doesn't have shinigami powers to begin with. He doesn't even know the four fields of shinigami excellence which I till try to recall right now with a hint from Hitsugaya.... Zanjustsu haha that's swordsmanship ie. when you have your blade that is not broken lmao, Hohou which is movement so the reason why Byakuya can move so fast and I'm not talking about now he's still half dead, Hakuda which is hand-to-hand combat which is exhibited best by literally no one apart from old geezer Yamamoto (RIP) because if you ran out of techniques and had to use this you're a monster haha, and Kido, what fictional me would've excelled in. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ichigo knows... maybe the first one lol not even he doesn't even know how to swing his sword- Heck, even Zaraki took a lesson in Kendo, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Long story short, the sword was remade using the two souls - Ichigo's soul of Quincy descent, and the Hollow - in a very occult situation probably Namaiya has never faced before, but it was a success. And that's how he gets two swords without a new name, and had to say goodbye to the souls he was mistaken of all these years. From the moment we saw Zangetsu, he was just the Quincy power all along. And maybe the Hollow's if he can't suppress it sometimes as with Grimmjow or Ulquiorra or Byakuya... that's all. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So now you know. All in all from the above dude... I still CANNOT BELIEVE I have to wait half a year for the next cour of this final arc to appear. Again it's like "Attack on Titan", but less painful to wait haha it's the same just that this one had deeper connection to me, and I can't WAIT to see it happen. We are teased with a trailer revealing the beating up we will have to witness until Ichigo can come down from the Reioukyuu so this will be fun. No really, we <em>desperately</em> need more zanpakuto releases right now we got a couple this time but IT IS JUST NOT ENOUGH, DUDE!!! Haha see you then I can go on forever but I think this is enough</div><div>[TL:DR; I'm just pissed that everyone is Yhwach's son. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, where are the daughters dude, you misogynist f**k- Oh he killed them. Yeah he did, we know at least 2 of them died. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Call yourself God, dude, you don't deserve it at all- ME MYSELF could've been God lmao]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUNUSdqsRU0i4furmmx1-OOjpScnaEYHAmdvozMpd11SmCkXLnBtjC56zbxpgESzP80on_lYDMAjsyAKZ-6wbjMHgdg0vfZK1l9eAAlzWKWQC7th27dcJQ0v6130uD5wYVQYDCYfHy3-zNRs--ci6hx0a4QC_fKAGDpw76rWcwXyy9Bj6Ij11goFlZ/s320/bleachTYBW13_omaeda1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How I imagine what I would look like in maybe 20 years<br><span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJ7rhMAgf3lPUjGwoFtBMoMrZCtVpgt2Ff3XU7ka1zpgW0GPC5E9_ODA5bE2Hj0aGSxxWoT9Z4ofQAZ6PaU4NWT2cveCgStjQTKa_fF0ijd4mij4J3TCocnm8RAOFCBW5cDeOz7oeBDCy2qO4zIkxDdIvsdcI1YkNkoIv3nJcXmIJ6gWy7hjKXtCAC/s320/bleachTYBW13_zangetsu1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you look close you can see... well, just a figment of Ichigo's real father lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibrSgM0GXoEoKaV92vnHAU_961i-QP2lJR0CDWK93BHmun4IoI3ulXNrS8518KmXWSYTRU7nO3bmyQEjN477QmOEP92UnJRRcAaU0TEMLsq1C9Q-7fl77U1KtfVVNpNtfFfYOjd_-EwUFzYwYa6kLRBUmMxT56ah35ghET5Da1FRuOAoNezPQXQDZq/s320/bleachTYBW13_beatup.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Normally any guy would be happy getting beat up by girls but... uh not in this case haha</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Because I was lazy to write an actual spec script for an animation movie I intended to do about my own lore for "BLEACH" when I was a student lol, I shall put in point form, where I was in the history of my version of Soul Society:</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>Soon after the betrayal of Urahara Kisuke, Shihouin Yoruichi and Tsubasaki Tessai and the missing of many captains in Gotei 13 about 100 years ago, Seireitei hastily decided to reform the leaders of Soul Society, namely promoting members of the Squads. For the 12th Squad though, Central 46 was hesitant in allowing the promotion of then Vice Captain Kusotsuchi Mayuri due to his history in prison, thus 3rd Seat Officer Aozaki Shouhei was placed as replacement Captain.<li>Throughout the 5 or so years in reign, Shouhei continued to develop technologies in a very different direction compared to Mayuri, who seeked more occult means of work compared to Shouhei's more practical approaches to improving combat, by leading of the widespread use of Kido as one of the four forms of shinigami combat being his vision, and creating training grounds and research facilities powered by Kido so shinigami can train better overall. Most notably, he was able to create a controlled environment within the 12th Squad barracks to the extent where power-driven 11th Squad members can train their released zanpakuto in.<li>Rumours started to rise within the 12th Squad about Mayuri's doubt on Shouhei's abilities as Captain and Technological Institute Head, not following the vision of technological advancement into souls and moreover prohibiting the experiments Mayuri was doing. In protest, Mayuri discovered that Shouhei has been in close contact with now in Real World Urahara Kisuke, and has been yearning to leave Soul Society to join his master outside of control.<li>The day finally arrived when Shouhei was spotted ready to escape from Mayuri's surveillance technologies, though bested by Mayuri's inventions with enough evidence to get him executed, Shouhei fought his way out and revealed his long-trained Bankai even on a disadvantage against Mayuri's poison blade. Seireitei was kept mum about the issue especially from Mayuri as this would give him free reign over the rule of the Squad and Institute, in which he eventually obtained.<li>Shouhei in the Real World used a self-made gigai and spent time in hiding before eventually settling down on opening a dojo outside of Karakura Town, where he continued to hone his sword skills since he can't be found out using his spiritual energy. He eventually was able to use all his shinigami power and train a squad of 5 human-shinigami hybrids in the Real World, with Asauchi stolen from Seireitei itself.</ul><div>Call this a <em>special </em>special episode then, you're welcome. Also, if anyone wanted to animate this I would LOVE to voice Aozaki Shouhei myself, thanks. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
