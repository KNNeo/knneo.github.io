BUT I DID GET CHOSEN. I can even prove it in my Club Animate account where the raffle was hosted. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I need to change my email address for this account to my primary lol (yeah or just add that secondary account to my phone)<div><br></div><div>ANYWAYS haha I doubt I missed much what else can I say besides "I want you to be my younger sister" lmao and it's no handshake or whatever idol event that has physical intimacy just because so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again is this what it feels like to be a fan? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Seriously though, wanted Ueda Reina but didn't get it and got <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> but didn't go- I feel like an idiot now I tell ya<br><br>I've done a lot of dumb things this year alone, but at least... I'm giving money out right?? In this season of giving I think I'm already going bankrupt just shipping the new package in, and the hole in my pocket is getting bigger with Christmas events AND my sis' birthday so let's ignore those and talk about Anime and music instead!<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BLEACHTYBW09><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"We may have to say goodbye" Wait, what? KYORAKU NO we just lost the old geezer dude</div></blockquote>Oh Kyoraku is literally me when they had to promote me at work because all the seniors left. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Too real, dude, too real. But unlike my job where I can just leave haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, in this new episode where Kyoraku has to take over the ranks from the old geezer (#BLEACHTYBW09), we are about to witness a drastic change in the traditional Gotei 13 we are all proud of until recently where it got trashed by the Sternritter army. So yeah, change, right? Let's talk about all the changes that will happen before us. Firstly, Ichigo and Renji. They changed. Well, kinda, just in physique they got more ripped- Who am I lying to? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> They are healed though, thanks to the bath from Tenjirou, and are set out to heal even more thanks to Hikifune's spiritual energy embodied food using her modified soul Gikon tech so by the way she was the inventor and NOT Urahara and if you know her she was mentioned in the Turn Back The Pendulum Arc with the story from a century ago, just briefly. And Ichigo is right, thinking about how they are taking a bath and eating and enjoying life while the bottom of this world is just struggling to prepare for the next fight? Yeah, just that he didn't know that they were in a bath made for either close to dead bodies like Byakuya or people who have insane spiritual energy to withstand the heat from the bath, and food that'll already make me full just looking at it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, enjoy the dessert and muscles and slimmed down Hikifune with the rack that puts Hiyori to shame lmao, because she is very right the next guy will be rough. Yeah, the guy who MADE the zanpakuto. *kreygasm* Without him this series wouldn't even exist. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, technically without him I wouldn't have loved this series because it'll only be Hollows and Quincies which is BORING~!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Come on, swords are OP. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, moving on, next change, is Kyoraku is the new leader of the Gotei 13. And yeah, he'll make sure all his subordinates will move along with him to the 1st squad because goddamn with the burn down of the barracks I'm pretty sure there aren't any old dudes left to serve him so old dudes of Central 46 can we chill and let him make the decisions now? Thanks. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> The last but not least change he made to the system is to literally disobey the council and request for the training of Zaraki Kenpachi in swordsmanship. The one which was banned even after the old geezer taught him just one lesson in <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kendo target=_blank>kendo</a> which we saw him take down Nnoitra with- Do you remember that fight or it's just me? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'll take that as consent so MOVING ON haha goddamn I'm going to speak about BLEACH to people and they will have no idea if I'm lying or not lol. So yeah, spoiler alert, Kyoraku then called upon the trainer who will facilitate Zaraki's (and that's why I'm using his given name from here on) training to get him to know the sword's name he has been holding on to after stealing it from some rando shinigami: Unohana Retsu. Or actually, Yachiru Kenpachi. We will talk about the deja vu you might be experiencing now from just the name I remember there was backstory for this, but man, this first Kenpachi is going to hit Zaraki so hard his zanpakuto is going to awaken. Haha it's like Ichigo when he fought Zaraki too, remember Zangetsu came in to save him? Yeah, history repeating itself, boys. And I guess the best part about this fight so far is literally Unohana sh*ttalk on him all over the place like feminism is king in the underground prison barracks of Seireitei haha just because she is technically right that the Kenpachi over generations have gotten weaker- How did they even do the 1-on-1 fighting thing to take over each Kenpachi's place over the years? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, in case you thought Ichigo is a water pipe without a tap, Zaraki here is a water dam but without the flood gates. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all though, man we do have a lot of progression just this episode alone but yeah it's all over the place, but looks like we will continue our focus for the Kenpachi fight for now before we continue on the adventures of Ichigo and Renji in the Palaces which I'm probably more keen on. But considering that I know the former less from the original work and <em>really</em> wish to see more concept stuff added in, let's hope the decision for the fight of the Kenpachis will be one of the best fights for this season. We are also just at the precipice of even more new exciting stuff we will be witnessing at this final arc, and I'm only going to be hyped for every single one of them just because. Can't wait for more action next week this fight alone is already rad</div><div>[TL:DR; Hey, you think <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/80/Aya_Hisakawa target=_blank>the voice behind Unohana</a> ever imagined the day she had to voice an evil villain when she accepted the role back in 2004? I wouldn't. Oh she was Suu-chan in "Love Hina"? Haha today I learnt]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEib9A90oFRLA0j670RZEhiVd1EcCGBVnNqhzxXJDZ1tmNHwCtn2-1XhuMf2k-TehzJHqHa--UBizGWMd_9Kzth5UULfKFBvAWzkhvAVSh1rYIq5RBq2E12NK5gXpD7bnXJltun1MQVIVV74qKqPAIYZe7P-SE-mH4-Ec-8V-pBE_dvUCup0HpuAKH_q/s320/bleachTYBW09_kirio1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>BEFORE<br>(I won't judge, if you are a fan of these body types)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJML64D7TxLRYkYjkYAAOLmuZ1XEPclOpI2lvjYVIatUIDBcbtbfF-w7TcgCapRL2WAhXdB9528Qk_XQ5XT5YpaEVGkihU7j6o1CVSfl3qyxrYEjyZwCu0nUd3poKLsN5cKqnIZZgMZX0ea6lbo5Rw3rXBu5gztsEch9M96rZJXxhF-QH1gcmOIGfa/s320/bleachTYBW09_kirio4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>AFTER<br>(I like how they ensured the proportions stay the same hehe)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtuknwDy_5orvLwjMAdeUmt1xhagvuxvRPwlU1hhsMAFeTp-wefO6tNhifM2ueJReo_3ZLmxJ8pnoswxBtSKmhooWGwYeIxPTIUG6UKdVpDMs70-42L2YaArqJcuPPKPn7zwZlJuF9DVFFEYklPwQ5nPbXzOzSJVEUj9-5LSxbHHo2ufZom15IHHPM/s1600/bleachTYBW09_puke.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Or when my bro and I saw Sumipe's photobook haha</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Man, this episode can only mean that many things (#UzakiChanS211) as Sakurai ponders about his life and specifically his relationship with the girl known as Uzaki Hana. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ami-chan and Sakaki are totally enjoying their dinner with her talking about Sakurai for days to come haha and knowing this girl won't even do anything about it, Sakaki at least is probably glad to see that Sakurai might be looking forward after his visit back home and seeing him back at work at the cafe. Well, at least, that's what we saw. Because apart from just going home and seeing his family gaining a new member but not through adoption or the dad f**king another woman lmao can he even though, the dad just barely, and I mean that then I said BARELY, taught him a lesson during their <a href=https://jisho.org/search/judo target=_blank>judo</a> session (lol) to inquire about his love life and/or find out more about how much of a wuss he is dealing with boy-girl relationships just like how I would if I had such a girl in my life which I don't. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways haha why am I the one sad now, the mother taught those two men a lesson because they didn't finish their battle before dinner time lmao she's the MVP by the way, is still not better than a lesson from Nodoka-chan here who is so cute the only thing I learnt is that I rather deal with this family than whatever the Uzaki family is compromised of. Not even with Tsuki-san, no. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, I thought the gathering of so many men in the café I like how Ami-chan just saw herself out lmao, would actually trigger some sort of thing in Sakurai considering on one side we have Fujio and the guys from the gym actually knowing the other side Akihito who runs the shop- That's Ami-chan's dad by the way. But instead, we have triggers of people getting jealous on the advisory panel here YOU GUYS LITERALLY KNOW HER!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, assuming none of them are in sync lol how can this work at such close range I don't even know this is worse than wireless tech from the 90s, but in case you did not realize, the only thing Sakurai probably got away with all this is probably what his dad mentioned, that he should not leave the girl hanging. Literally. So yeah, he decided to push her away, as seen from Uzaki being rejected of a Christmas celebration together with this ex-loner turned not loner and reverting back as of now. What will happen for their Christmas though? I mean, I know what mine is but do you want to tell me again, me? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> All in all... The guys around Sakurai are just carpet bombing hints to this poor dude I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, I guess Sakurai is taking a hint or two now that he realized his relationship with this <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kouhai target=_blank>kouhai</a> isn't going anywhere. How are we going to conclude next week if he keeps thinking like this, right? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey you too Uzaki, don't think you can run away from this too. Ugh, my head hurts. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, let's see if Sakurai's current stand by letting her go will make any of them feel better about this. We shall see.</div><div>[TL:DR; "How can my son be to frighteningly useless?" Wow reality check on me, dad?

YIKES dude. *ahem* In this new episode which I assume is the signal for the final arc of the series (#KoukyuuNoKarasu11), we are dealing with vampires? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> B*tch said she needed blood so- They are called <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kyonshi target=_blank>kyonshi</a> in this Chinese universe, by the way. Anyways, we are not quite there yet, so let's talk about what is there. Firstly, the Minister's advice is there. Always there. Reminding Jusetsu every time she visits probably until he has to retire to his hometown and stay at his brother's place... he will remind her with every silver hair he has on his face. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What's probably more impressive is how he can remember how many games of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kifu target=_blank>Go</a> he played with the previous Raven Consort who is also his acquaintance, could not even pretend to lose to our dear main girl here as we see her get trashed by the emperor haha period drama, by the way. *ahem* The Minister is also advising her to not have too much fun in the palace as that will imprint on her her own monster within which I would say sounds like a great thing if we're talking about in the bedroom but not really as a messenger of a god, I don't think. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> What else is there is also this week's case, where as you would remember from the previous episode someone was killed under a tree stump. Well, sucked off blood apparently, so you can guess if you have watched enough of just supernatural media in general what that might be. Our current clues are getting more obvious as the episode progresses because from the Magpie Consort being in bed and refusing to listen to any of her servants BUT just the one servant by the way, also was the one who requested upon Jusetsu's premises to ask to revive someone from the dead, probably is now heartbroken and/or unwell due to the passing of some guy she loved that isn't the emperor. *ahem* Hey, at a time of weakness, it wouldn't be surprising to know that someone will come to her assistance, promising her of the power to revive the dead. Just, you don't know the price to pay because you're always bedridden. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> For that, I wouldn't even bother thinking that whoever that dude is coming to kill Jusetsu will be a threat, because whatever we mentioned earlier is already a problem not even considering the political consequences of sending her home. The last thing I want to mention that is there and probably will be even after all this time, is the Raven Consort's social circle. Never in probably any Winter King's life did they get more liberty to make this many friends and/or acquaintances despite being a god messenger and exorcist living her life in solitude all this while. And yet, Jusetsu is worried about getting them all involved till the point she won't even carry out some of the investigations herself, putting them in danger. Hey, sending the eunuch off and telling him to come back by nightfall is great IF he listened, but if you know we might be dealing with something scary at the dark of night then <em>maaaybe</em> don't let him go at all, yes? Nonetheless, the Summer King is here, so let's see if they can be of any help. Oh yeah, next week we are starting with a fight, I tell ya. You thought Bianyue last time possessing Jiu-Jiu was a problem?? Yeah, wait till THIS happens and you tell me. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Anyways, great episode, great lead-up, I want to time travel to next week to see what happens now lol but I can't, so let's wait in patience. You know, at my own abode, at night, with a well lit light source, where them vampires can't get me. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you at your safe places soon.</div><div>[So uh, you think the reason the previous Raven Consort died is because of this "owl"? Or that she can't fight against it? Maybe dude, but Jusetsu technically hasn't found a successor so that's a problem?

Still, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/world-record/1654430457?l=en" target=_blank><b>TWEEDEES' new album</b></a> isn't all too bad at least the title songs aren't bad so that's already a plus. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/winter-tracks-%E5%86%AC%E3%81%AE%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F-ep/1654115038?l=en" target=_blank>ClariS' new cover mini-album</a></b> did include an original song just like the previous ones but unlike the previous ones I finally decided to give it considering the Christmas mood and overall typical of a familiar melody, could not even compare to the super idol-focused <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/first-channel/1655251786?l=en" target=_blank>AMUSE VOICE ACTORS CHANNEL 1st album</a></b> which is just filled with nothing but pop music so stereotypical Anime-style I rather not give any songs at this time of the year. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Hey, I already rejected Waki Azumi and Tomita Miyu from last month you think I don't dare to reject the latter again in her talent agency-based music release? Haha why not<br><br>So the new news from Twitter this week for Japanese music is here and there as strong as it can be at this time of year so it's just for next year, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1599572575918915584?s=20&amp;t=aoYN-nq48teBnrSb5J9H8w" target=_blank>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single will release in February</a></b> which will be for Anime BORUTO series, I guess we only get to listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yucat1031/status/1600092805056974848?s=20&amp;t=t4tD1ycIwmugNQsfG3DePg" target=_blank>yucat's new album trailer</a></b> because even if it sounds dope who knows when we can get it on music streaming services or even to the general public this is also event only just like her buddy Niitsu Yui, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie_staff/status/1600143057243934720?s=20&amp;t=t4tD1ycIwmugNQsfG3DePg" target=_blank>Takahashi Rie's new song</a></b> and even her being in a livestream (which I missed) to reveal more of her upcoming EP and music video isn't too bad if I don't have to go around giving the rapping or speech part of the song, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1600151075062808576?s=20&amp;t=t4tD1ycIwmugNQsfG3DePg" target=_blank>Aimer's new music video</a></b> will be revealed next week in time for her mini-album release so if you are a fan stay tuned, I legit thought voice actress Kido Ibuki would make me listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ibuking_1114/status/1600094889664196608?s=20&amp;t=t4tD1ycIwmugNQsfG3DePg" target=_blank>another Kitani Tatsuya song</a></b> but this... would hardly be called a song and this year is up so maybe not, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/tweedees_tokyo/status/1600432316589146112?s=20&amp;t=t4tD1ycIwmugNQsfG3DePg" target=_blank>TWEEDEES' music video backlog is finally in full on YouTube</a></b> to make us remember the classics from the first two album which are still better than the future ones imo, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1600777704088838145?s=20&amp;t=t4tD1ycIwmugNQsfG3DePg" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new song preview</a></b> is really a meh despite being written by her favourite composer Kitagawa and this might just make me not want to give the Anime she will be in to to be honest we shall see, I am not going to give a damn about Ikimonogakari's producer <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1585103929871933440?s=20&amp;t=t4tD1ycIwmugNQsfG3DePg" target=_blank>HIROBA 1st album release next year</a></b> I'm really done with them life is not real without Hotaka-san haha, and ironically <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1601162238974369799?s=20&amp;t=t4tD1ycIwmugNQsfG3DePg" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's latest music video</a></b> has broke out of preview stage so it's not in full on YouTube replacing the preview so don't go finding that they want the views from the original video lmao ok dude.<br><br> So next week, we have some releases to talk about, namely <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/deep-down/1652643090?l=en" target=_blank>Aimer's new mini-album</a></b> as she started with a single this year she is ending the year with another release I hope it will be good though my impressions of the songs inside might not be, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/my-blue-ep/1653891560?l=en" target=_blank>Krage's new mini-album</a></b> which started from Anime "Koukyuu no Karasu" so this might be a walk in the park. As in, just a walk, passing by, and if I give anything new apart from the ending theme song which blew my mind I will inform again.<br><br><br><br><br> So yeah, we are done for the week. Which also means the weekend is over. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Damn me, don't be this sad. Just two more weeks and we will have quite a break ahead of us even over till the new year. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> See you guys then, and until next time... someone tell me in another timeline I was in Nan-chan's release event livestream and commenting something which made her happy. I hope. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I'm sorry dear imouto, *says in Harry Mason* I'm sorry... okay back to programming haha bye<br></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
