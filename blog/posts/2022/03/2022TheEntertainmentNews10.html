I gotta say, still the only thing I hate of you now is how short your hair is now lol maybe if I'm her boyfriend I'll have a say in this haha oh well I'll look forward to your photobook then I have not been spoiled too much so far so I'll be waiting for that</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe it's all the waiting that is going to make this month real boring in contrast. Waiting for new package to arrive, waiting for stupid in-camp training at the end of the month, waiting for new employees to appear so I can actually offload some of the stuff I do at work to someone who probably won't have an idea what she (yes, she) is doing... This is as exciting as I can make it sorry maybe it's watching too much Spongebob gameplays from the one streamer I follow is turning me into Squidward too lmao</div><div><br></div><div>So! Goddamn the announcements keep appearing for new Anime next season, and I tell you, you be darned if "Aharen-san" isn't the only new series I'll be watching because I'm drowning in sequels dude! <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> I'm the exploring type I don't like to be tied down by <a href="https://twitter.com/comisanvote/status/1498674419639545856?s=20&amp;t=yZ_oXmWgbNVR-oJ3Ngv_UQ" target=_blank>Kaguya-sama</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/kyokou_suiri/status/1499550193116753937?s=20&amp;t=yZ_oXmWgbNVR-oJ3Ngv_UQ" target=_blank>Kotoko-chan</a>~!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, no one said Anime adaptations can't be your new addiction one can only follow this many series lol</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, pep talk over, I wish I did more yesterday with a planned blog post about Klassic Note (not review) but I got lazy as usual so we try that again next week haha let's start this!</div><div><br></div><div>[Note to self: Really need to write shorter reviews just because or else you will hate doing this on a weekly basis]</div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan83><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Probably for the same reason you are not dead yet: because you're an Ackerman" W~HAT!!! lol no really is Levi one too?</div></blockquote>Oh well bad news Hange-san, not like Armin and Pyxis did anything in this situation... which they do not know of yet anyways so in this new episode (#AttackOnTitan83) we can finally talk about what happened to Levi and Hange. I recall now, the last time we saw them and Zeke, this dude revealed his spinal fluid wine ideas and made all their people turn against these two who don't drink. Not gonna make them smarter though, as Hange stayed in solitude with injured Levi, whatever she said did not even come close to what really happened, seeing that she also has no idea seeing the message from Eren soon after they evaded being killed by Zeke. So, minor flashback, and in their conversation with Magath and Pieck (umph) (haha ok me) (but seriously though *gets pushed away*) Magath is probably wise to not shoot Levi and hear what he has to say along with military expert Hange here so yeah. We'll get back to them later, but first, Connie. Gotta say though, from not having a plan to making Falco believe this soldier alongside him is innocent and doesn't know anything about him... great job so far but as how to make your Titan mother (I really forgot about that) eat Falco though I must say that is the weirdest thing to have to think about AND execute so yeah, I can take jokes like this from time to time, thanks author. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, Armin and Gabi walked in on time to see them wash the mother's teeth lmao (don't laugh, Connie had a great plan), and I must say I thought Armin will kill the mom but maybe it's because I forgot about Armin talking about how useless he was from last episode, so yeah, to keep Connie's mom and Falco human, Armin can get eaten instead. Probably most emotional episode in this final season so far, so thank Connie for being such a buddy and not let one of the main guys die this way. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> The rumbling finally subsided in Paradis Island, Annie left with the other guys coincidentally on the streets eating pie lol, and Floch enjoyed the life of being a ruthless dictator under Eren's orders...? Whatever he sucks so why Jean did you not let him get eaten by the Cart Titan? Haha okay that was part of a plan apparently. Apart from the one guy who is looking at the whole thing happening and I don't think it can be anyone left but who knows, looks like Magath and Pieck has arranged to pick up Yelena and the other dude in exchange for some escape plan somehow I don't really understand. But yeah, Jean isn't that much of a follower after all, thank goodness. And last but not least, the talk about a plan to save the world after waking Reiner up. My guess? It's going to be some plan to try to stop Eren in his tracks, but we all know this is just going to end up in a massacre where most importantly, the Titan powers will cease to exist. Will I be right? I guess we gonna continue watching to find out. Man, we are so close to the conclusion, I'm already wanting to- You know how much it sucks to wait for a week for another episode? Haha cya guys in the next.</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9IFHkNQ7Dc6AcKUABIbklMW85OXJbbZKbqNbV6tMykjwoVUoatAiNfNllVtgAHRDjh0XlIEHAUsbW_gjGO38YeE9pjhxTmUv1qMaFiUuQSrgZA0NUDOly0X9pd2Ct45Io7Bt5_5SYQnNeyEXRSjJM1wmxfjHbSg2AysTySq74nkKjqg/s320/attackontitan83_connie2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The AoT "I don't know what face to draw" compilation<br>(Connie just turned into his father when he lied lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaVy8DnQo11VE_LmxnYsjEMTyozqVF34OsfnJ58GunyxLo059mFiRve5EhYlyODnZG81I-QEcMm4MTsUQxqhKoECAenjxz3kfW-1A-Kz_q7x-axmjkV1mgDdeXkI23c2ej2k8qxl8UwFZ-7OzwDvFfubo0raK3ubumyZ7Glk9ikLEpuA/s320/attackontitan83_levi2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The AoT "I don't know what face to draw" compilation<br>(Like really, what face do you draw when you survived an explosion)</table></div></div>P.S. "If we run and hide. what will we have left?" Eh Levi either you all turn into titans or get tramped by them since a wall of them are advancing out of the island lol</div><div>P.P.S. "How do I even get Mom to eat Falco?" I mean Connie, just kill the kid in front of your mother, easy. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> (Please don't do that OR do that and say I said it thanks)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSanS309><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"That means another year of losses to Takagi-san unless I win her today!" Okay that's how you make new year resolutions, Nishikata? lol</div></blockquote>Merry Christmas, everyone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, if this season was meant to be aired three months ago, I wonder what stopped them from doing so. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, new episode (#TakagiSanS309), we know where this is going, so let's sum it up. We got the pre-date dream as always, thanks Nishikata we know you are real desperate, and the day has come. No, not Christmas. The airing date of that movie, dude. I know Christmas Eve is a couples thing but come on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You were late for the date too? So, so rude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, there aren't any parts to this episode since they managed to patch the story into one smooth flow, so let's see if Anime production can do it as smooth as Ikeo is to Kyunko. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Nishikata recalled his losing streak for the year with his girl lol, so he kept thinking of ways to win her, even if it means it's a crane game and he has to not get the stuff he wants because he's an idiot who doesn't know how to play crane games. Please, to get the puzzle you lift the edge upwards that is <em>away</em> from the hole. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways, Takagi is a pro so whatever you get what you want in the end- Why is Takagi doing the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> role? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> They were so ready for the movie he had to tell the receptionist they were together lmao, even bought the couple snack set I can't even, and like seriously, what else is missing in this romance Anime? Oh yeah, glad you remembered, me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This episode had everything: couples touching hands while getting popcorn, scenes to make the girl cry lmao yes Nishikata why are you crying, and Takagi jealous that Nishikata might be taken away from her by Kyunko because she isn't his type. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Hey, if that wasn't a good enough hint, Takagi did another showdown with Nishikata of just a simple race to the next electric pole. And he won. Wow. Truly a Christmas miracle. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, I forgot to tell you Nishikata, Takagi was the Santa Claus so... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, I know he has that satisfaction going on him by winning his girl, but don't you feel a little empty inside? Like, even if Takagi wasn't pretending don't you feel like you lost? Oh well. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least though, if you would recall I say every episode had that moment? Yeah, shoutout to the snow and the Christmas Tree as side characters, but yeah, it's gift exchange time. Takagi gave him the one scarf she did knit for him and not for the dog as I mentioned before because why wouldn't you make another for your boi, and Nishikata got his girl some mufflers because he noticed her hands were cold all the time. Now THAT is a caring boyfriend. Good for you, sir, I'm so proud of you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... is this not the most chill episode of this series EVER? Like, seriously, right?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't know if that's a good or bad thing though, after experiencing this much so far it really feels like this is real mellow as it is wholesome of an episode for this series, it shouldn't even be in this story. But hey, I think we can gracefully let these two be a couple in peace for once <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>, and you know, let their relationship grow just because. I can't believe I wrote all this haha cya guys for more wholesome moments but really this is good enough for me even if for this season we've reached the peak lol</div><div>[TL:DR; This episode really made me think, about what makes of a perfect gift, and how much you can screw up. What if those gloves' colour isn't what she wants? And then you realize you aren't as cool as Nishikata. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Haha I can't even]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPBI2OrD3RmbiV0GWYb4ai3zIwf2uzvYeXHBLsuQXPP9INI4NrHd6PMZSpSLLPsAm0DJTPxxbYfpShTtnHvZvGM51S7hVCVw7Ok4cr4DHm-hEc-Jz0jOpeLccGpk9g8LT6kcgW3YfrW4rZ218cK4FhYnLjHYrXQdwBvzGep2XTPoZRlw/s320/takagisanS309_nishikata3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I won an SSR in a gacha and think I can get more with my remaining gems lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjrPWZ2v1c1ON-y3qoKJBmMsawc2GUWF8mR47mxfWonEysfz6iDYQpFIlXIvrTQW38rLfo0uG9R5uvbSfwPuGbcVAUn_yuvntdPZbmPtw2ldxTbbzc5aC_zyERkeUqygPCUno1uQZX7N9HcJ10RZWq6oiHTLZxTaU10xyaavrdUN3BOw/s320/takagisanS309_nishikata4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I won an SSR in a gacha and think I can get more with my remaining gems lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Haha Gojou Wakana I do not wish to know of the details, thank you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Okay Marin-chan I know you don't mind anyone looking at you change but can you at least show some shame by- In this new episode haha (#KiseKoi09) you think Kitagawa does the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shoubushitagi target=_blank>shoubu shitagi</a> thing by making sure she always wears the right brassiere just in case Gojou wants to do something to her? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Please, this Anime has <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> references; It's normal to think of it this way just in case. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, every time they meet is a date, isn't it? I mean, Grandpa knows. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah, they met up again for the new cosplay at his place ie. the shop of course, we are one step closer to making all the cosplay magic group happen. Yeah, all three of them. Eh? Yep, you didn't see it wrong, we have a third person joining in. So surprise surprise, Gojou asked her out, Shinju. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay let's clear that misunderstanding, we are talking about cosplay, so yeah Kitagawa we good. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, Shinju's story. So yeah, looks like I was right too from last week, that deep inside her, this middle schooler also wants to cosplay, and after we have seen the marvel that is on Kitagawa and Juju-san and them waiting on the studio location for the sister to appear, it looks like I was right after all. Gojou isn't wrong about saying that anyone has a right to cosplay though, but ironically this is his biggest challenge yet. Because apart from having to do this cosplay for Shinju under a budget since we are dealing with someone without a job lol she still underage bro, we are also dealing with a totally different physique. Yes, Kitagawa undressing is just prelude to what you have to experience for the rest of the episode haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> So, probably the best way to make this miracle happen, Shinju wanted to cosplay as that brother in that "Flower Blaze" Anime we watched in this Anime lmao what (haha), so basically you can't have a rack or have contours in your manly body. I mean, right? The easy part was getting the makeup already, really. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> After much trial and error and finding out that <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifY0rcM02RREfKyUtRW6f3N2hrRukdC15O450Nz2W5TDGBGmere4Z94j7Hn3xl74lBSX_jnAIZHpCl3kmbqUOAmJOGNkAmitcsrSPeZAv-1JpehxqfxvJRm1YO6GnWVV-_O_68Cf1UZ2f7WuaSq7qJG08iFNSV6OHWwbt33UI_WxiGtQ/s320/c4fcd4e65472d0820e8b6a7e2e4c15a4.jpg target=_blank>B holders</a> exist haha that's with a copyright symbol by the way I wonder how much in royalties they had to pay to put this in lol (you can google it yourself, it's basically a specially made two-layer wrap which presses down on the nature of sagging breasts) and giving Shinju some black hair and makeup... I gotta say this is the closest she will ever get to cross-dressing as a man. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She did impress the other two though with the cosplay, I mean, we didn't expect this to have some Shoujo manga crossover and fanservice stuff for the girls but I guess we did. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, thanks for the ecchi references especially this episode to be honest haha, and I still can't believe they made this happen. Somehow more stark in contrast to Kitagawa, and of course I wouldn't even bother comparing to Juju-san just because. But yeah, speaking in Kitagawa's defence, these two might have too much alone time together it's illegal. No really, hanging out with a middle schooler? I have the right to call the cops on you, bro. Haha see ya guys for more honest feelings- Dude, this might be a killer for this season honestly can't wait for the cosplay of that character with just horizontal lines covering the nipples-</div><div>[TL:DR; For those who still think Shinju as Souma-kun didn't look quite right even after so much, I would argue that most cosplayers hardly look any closer than their actual characters so this is already pretty damn impressive especially when we can do camera shots on angles that'll make her face look like a dude so yeah]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp0he9eEXMJ-VMMaidWqtm6Ng9V0Yllprbs-SZEYOww-CPsuUbUYCvsbu1Sjbgg2KBdO49TXd3JCCOkDf24C3MmIMW96wY7KqmD8L13Pn7LUlnmrNOl9ZkbTTtwQtcOKi184mNWLDK4tiqWyd4EJXMrRj6KUaFxZBluKEe6oG4CC8Epw/s320/kisekoi09_excited1.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How it feels like to be an onii-chan in an Anime lol<br>(Gotta say, this kinda cute haha)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxghLC9P1l8gbx88jJLK2FNtAqt9mOpVgD8-CTCw65zsNeELWzGdNNXITJ1_JyEDKMaS-2qLJRj0GIbzHsZbfdk5-UqwQ0rMsG2nl8WuiBUb7q0MCK-fhb07fzxu3uuZJCyTxCI9-BwYMTpDhB4a33zwHjkPDbAkrPa9k74IFtRMs_hQ/s320/kisekoi09_excited2.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How it feels like to be an onii-chan in an Anime lol<br>(I don't know what to make of this but okay)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1394 data-original-width=1280 height=348 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQiG5eI5bgdsV66NZq4PKiA36fdXM3Mh5Fo1iS8VlzWmuOm_fzbFc9SryuQMLc-tMIbfYfHdsJI2tf18-38X-Te0hb56kgcB8xCAQ4-H47OvgRs3QmlcaM-vdq6oxPDiDfmQBed0j-y3gycx9XPsy0qfcuzbqzCOD-AB7hkjcr0P_CAw/s320/kisekoi09_measure.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>LOL<br>(It's that big, guys, it's that big)</table></div></div>P.S.

I did get around to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%84%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8E%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8E-10%E5%91%A8%E5%B9%B4%E8%A8%98%E5%BF%B5-%E3%82%BB%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%90%E3%83%A0-roundabout/1608131256?l=en" target=_blank>yanaginagi's selection album</a></b> which really besides <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m65vpWcBq5E" target=_blank>the new song</a> which started the release and the next song which was from her time in supercell I'm darned how they gave her the song to sing and put in this album tbh, but yeah, not like the rest of the album deepened my impression of the already Collection Artist. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%BD%A9%E8%89%B2%E7%A1%9D%E5%AD%90-ep/1607963660?l=en" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new single</a></b> is rather expected as I did not give the B-side despite never hearing it before, already know she is dropping by as Collection Artist with one song but really wanted to review the single so I can talk about how interesting the topic song is especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxNZjExDkBU" target=_blank>the music video</a>. But hey, at least we can give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/blue-thermal-ep/1609388909?l=en" target=_blank>SHE'S new single</a></b> which DID drop by as Collection Artist recently, now gave themselves a reason for me to review the single as they put in their best for an animated movie so yeah, giving the CD though I don't care about a movie about airplanes lol. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/bohemia/1605988989?l=en" target=_blank>ORESKABAND's new album</a></b> is a major release from them in a while so I did try to give as much as I can, and I think I am very satisfied overall even picking up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQbPEMLLQ6Q" target=_blank>older digital single songs</a> because I think the music videos probably gave me the wrong mood or emotion to give them. They also made in the Collection Artist list, by the way, took them long enough haha you're welcome girls. Last but not least, we have <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ooorder/1608121062?l=en" target=_blank>mol-74's new album</a></b> which I only knew of last week but I think I better follow them on Twitter because besides a strong first impression trying to give half of the album's song for some reason lol, I eventually got critical and dropped it down to the topic songs that are new or I missed. I gotta say though, one of the reasons I would do so is probably from giving so many songs from the above I feel bad queueing them at the back of this, but also because I really preferred their indie style which was more emo in nature. So yeah, I picked up the not-so-emo styles instead, if that makes any sense to you.<br><br> For the newest stuff about music on Twitter, we have... <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1498645478979694595?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A" target=_blank>SID released a new music video</a></b> for their upcoming album but I think I'll leave that for now, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/_kanaboon/status/1498855766207643648?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A" target=_blank>KANA-BOON pre-released a new song</a></b> for their upcoming album which I did not listen since a music video is likely in place if you can guess, I saw this YouTube premiere on my way home from work so <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1498978695326748675?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A" target=_blank>SHE'S music video</a></b> is just as awesome as the song I mean we have given it already at this point, shoutout to the awesome <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1499580419666235427?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A" target=_blank>cover for ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new album</a></b> by if you don't know who Nakamura Yuusuke is you need to see the sophisticated art and Anime character designs done by him, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1499686029921456128?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia appeared on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> with arguably her most popular song to date, and we have a <a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1500423314732290048?s=20&amp;t=yDtSq-6oLqMs9eR7s_EJ4A" target=_blank>Mia-san livestream planned on the day before album release</a> which I would say might give her record number of viewers just because she revealed herself after all these years. Last but not least, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/HiguchiAi/status/1500466830137511942?s=20&amp;t=l_8I9LwNPYxBFtZ9gaBdAQ" target=_blank>Higuchi Ai's new music video</a></b> is for the single for Anime "Attack on Titan" but of course done in course of her recent full album. And don't be too surprised on the view count it has subtitles in 10 different languages lol that's how you do MVs, Japan.<br><br> So next week, and I'm glad to take a break of those crazy packed release schedules from the past two weeks, we only have <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%82%82%E9%80%85%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3/1609913895?l=en" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new album</a></b> which I hope will be good not because vocalist Mia-san chose to present her image in a more honest manner, according to her. So yeah, if they suddenly get into the Klassic Note Collection Artist list don't ask me why. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And maybe I'll listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/HiguchiAi/status/1498677446174179328?s=20&amp;t=l_8I9LwNPYxBFtZ9gaBdAQ" target=_blank>Higuchi Ai's new album</a></b> from last week if I have the time because why not.<br><br><br><br><br> Oh yeah Sasaki Nao happy birthday to you too- Dude, if not for <a href="https://twitter.com/sasaki_nao_0306/status/1500401556507742213?s=20&amp;t=te_AkpXM4s58ICvSASSHwA" target=_blank>your Tweet</a> I really forgot how much you will impress my parents compared to Ede-chan if you were my girlfriend. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, I got nothing besides photobooks and/or social media posts instead of a real girl, so I lose. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Cya guys next week then, the package is coming together, my life is getting boring by the day lol, and be sure to take a look at the <a href="https://twitter.com/_m_aaii/status/1500456144254681090?s=20&amp;t=te_AkpXM4s58ICvSASSHwA" target=_blank>behind-the-scenes of IDOLY PRIDE in real life</a> to remind yourself how you are the leftmost girl who forgot how to cry. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>...</div><div><br></div><div>I should sleep more haha good night</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Oh current plan for this month's photobooks, they are now in pairs, with Ede-chan this week versus Naobou next week, and Lynn releasing end of the month versus...?
