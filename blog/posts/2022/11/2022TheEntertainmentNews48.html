Ugh my headache is acting up again<div><br></div><div>Anyways, welcome back, it has been another week, we have more things to cover this week because the new "ToniKawa" OVA is out now, I can see the "Takagi-san" movie in the distance, so this year is going to end well, regardless of the company sponsored Universal trip. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Then again, probably not going to enjoy coasters with my head in a lull and without a girlfriend so</div><div><br></div><div>ANYWAYS to the anyways in the previous paragraph I need new phrases, so if you have any suggestions hook me up on <strike>Twitter</strike> <strike>Hive</strike> <strike>Mastodon</strike> Twitter (dammit I'm not that cool yet), let's get this train wreck going! I've slept the afternoon yesterday to prepare for this and had a cup of cappuccino for breakfast so I <em>think </em>I'm ready lol</div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BLEACHTYBW07><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"That's a monster that appeared in Soul Society long time ago" <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> It's the old geezer, young Kyoraku Shunsui haha</div></blockquote>Okay, gotta say, the full flashback from a thousand years ago is really cool. Like, not inside original work real cool. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> No really, and that's why this final season of Anime is fantastic just from this new episode (#BLEACHTYBW07) because we can show off things like the Gotei 13 Squads from some time ago. And I know they won't explain much apart from Unohana <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, we know there's a Shihouin in there so Yoruichi's ancestor, we know there's a Kenpachi <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, we know there's a Kuchiki so Byakuya's ancestor, probably the most <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a> one in there. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Of course, the attention was about the old man and even then he's not that young, and boy why is Sasakibe here?? Maybe that's why Yhwach got rid of him first. ANYWAYS, RIP to both of them lol the latter won't have time for a funeral so I hope you're okay with cremation old man <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> but we know he can't be cremated just because (not going to be in this arc, unfortunately) so let's move on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, can we just appreciate the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> appearances- Wait, did I just say Ichigo was coming to save them? I didn't, right? I said "not" Ichigo? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah yeah so haha, apart from the despair we are seeing in front of our eyes as the battle quarters of Seireitei is done to ruin, we got a nice flashback to justify Yamamoto's death, I guess. Showing off what happened a thousand years ago without putting this as canon material sure was a treat, and seeing young Kyoraku before his *ahem* own flashback is also cool, I guess. Okay, hot, because that picture. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> The Sternritters started bringing in their soldiers which ironically were stronger than the shinigami side ones which really made me think if Yhwach was right in saying the soldiers on the good side are already weaker these days which yeah maybe true since some of them even ran lmao, they were real discrete in explaining Akon's fall by a Sternritter and even then that dude lasted for about 3 seconds haha, and Ichigo broke out. Out of sheer will, I guess. But not really, as Yhwach fought him for a bit and yes the previous episode don't matter anymore now haha this fight is already better, Ichigo did not die because of two reasons. Firstly, his Blut Vene got triggered. I would assume the Quincy leader is right, that Ichigo absorbed some of Kirge's powers to subconsciously awaken his own Quincy powers lol more on his mother's story in about 20 episodes lmao, and with that it made it easier for him to break out of the absolute Scrift power we mentioned a while ago made by the Sternritter J who is probably super dead by now haha. Anyways, Byakuya did ask of him to save Soul Society, but not like he could which brings us to the other point of why he is still alive and not joining in the precession with Yamamoto as a human: Yhwach's time is up. I shall not elaborate that too much since it will be soon but let's say his powers don't last too well outside of his palace, so they had to leave. Why the rest of the gang had to join him I'm not sure maybe the Shrift powers won't work with his presence in the shadows I assume, so everyone else left with him, leaving Soul Society in quite a shamble hopefully with Unohana maybe being able to conduct some funerals apart from treatments. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Man, this is a sad episode, I can't make jokes here. But yes, this is the recovery arc of the season so far, our guys are beat up real good and who knows what happened to Urahara-sensei and Orihime who would've healed the old man's left arm lol, so let's see who else will appear to help them then. We are not yet reminded of the legendary Zero Squad from where to access their quarters one would need the King's Key as mentioned by Aizen some time ago, so <em>maybe </em>we can form a red carpet of blood to welcome them soon. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Hey, it's hard to make jokes when Byakuya is breathing his last breath, okay? I wish I didn't remember that he "died" at some point lol okay okay spoilers over see you next time for probably a more light-hearted episode because I hope you remember this is also a comedy series at heart despite all the killing or else why would be we have one of the first Gotei 13 members be cute with a braided ponytail and have a rack-</div><div>[Interesting fact: Ichigo fighting against Yhwach is basically him fighting against his sword Zangetsu because you know, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/37/Takayuki_Sugou target=_blank>same voice actor</a> haha]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOSerBDciErlE0W45ofCafzy0KxR4JKzJOgKFNrp5ZALR0cbaycq4up8Vare94htHAt-KzFrSsTWOOmzs2WIsMdyHSlsrQ7_1ZR-7mn2aGFNlhTX8Xv3IkyElxMvo_vhDb-tuHn6arIx_EAtZBjo37HOw5WZR9js9zrk16V4D8Mxt_nZG4WJ5Gs_t0/s320/bleachTYBW07_picture.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The legend that'll burn the world, by the way</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUjPrsppkDmF9wAxmM91zK5beJ0o6NZiOAypNPq5o06u6ZmXYG_G9oEVau-UDaCu1uWDtcTJYqm7aEuJqCjR-aiVZrRtlYWJ_eN_OO8nUiPSIriJGJQ4o9hzCeu1ULuazjpd9iO6mV5Iz4l1j8ATkQbZEotv9Izl3TdfKGKRE7UIeXxay-7IumxMGJ/s320/bleachTYBW07_yamamoto5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Billionaires after they have had enough of money lol advocate time baby</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Yeah just, I think Fujio-san here has problems driving. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe we should've called a cab. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, ask yourself if organizing family trips is as bad as this family, because reality check though when's the last time everyone in the family hung out?

They had a great time. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Wait, is that it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, don't expect me to describe what they did because mainly if you didn't get the hint this is a PR stunt because surprise this place actually exists in Japan thus the warning about how seasonal changes will change the baths anyways, but hey, all of those are real by the way. And that's why living in a tropical city sucks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, we got all the stereotypical family happenings in here: Son refuses to go lmao, daughters get picked up by random guys who aren't Sakurai and Sakaki haha, mom also gets picked up lol ah hey I'll go for the mother just so you know and it's not because of the voice behind, the foot bath we can skip talking about lest this place gets flagged haha, Fujio is doing his trainer work even at the park because now guys are depending on him to advice them on how to be as ripped as him, and I guess Hana-chan did leave the group a bit to then coincidentally meet with Sakurai and Sakaki who are also there by chance. Gotta emphasize, nothing to do with the mascot and KUSOCAT lmao what is that anyways I really thought that's something like Ami-chan in disguise, nothing to do with Sakaki planning for Sakurai to appear in her life once again... pure coincidence. It said so on the script so it must be true. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also, we've already seen Ami-chan half-naked we're good. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And I guess the main couple is chill now now that they got to talk to each other and agree that Sakaki is in their way lmao. All in all, short write up because I really don't know how much longer to talk about any of these already, as I'm just in awe this episode looking at what, muscles and boobs alike?

Haha okay this is *ahem* so maybe not, satellites aren't invented yet. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, we have another story to unfold, but ironically it didn't take long even for me to find out what happened maybe because of the hints that were present from the time it started, I assume. The servant who visited the Consort this time around was a Lady for one of the consorts who died some time ago, and thought to seek help on hearing voices from the lake as with the water taken from it to wash clothing since this particular servant was situated at the palace's wash house. Story goes though, that she was in this plight mainly because of what happened to the consort she was serving. In short, she was helping her get into the inner palace and when finally the back then emperor (so I assume this is not even the Dowager was in power) decided to visit the premises, thankfully he did not get to see the consort in person because well, she drowned. Damn. *ahem* Anyways, so the Lady thought this might be due to her wanting to come back to haunt her and thought this was part of the thing where someone dies but refused to move on. So you see, from my experience watching this *ahem* we know that one can't just die and be done with it. Yeah, you gonna have remnants unfulfilled. So can we stop burdening our dear Jusetsu and- Welcome back to this review. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But it didn't take long for the Raven Consort to notice a few things that were weird about this particular case compared to the many we have heard of. Firstly, people did not know much about this Lady. The people in Jusetsu's abode hardly know of the requestor, and the eunuch serving as her guard found out that, well, this Lady just passed away. Well, which is why I thought my eyes were seeing things haha didn't know technology can make me experience that but I guess I was right, the illusion of seeing a skinnier figure at the lake already brings the question of why this was drastically different from the human form we saw knocking at her doorstep. Next, flipping the logic. So turns out this isn't that surprising, that as someone who has raised the Consort to her place but seeing her take her own life instead, was probably more in fear of her returning to take a grudge against this old woman instead of have other issues moving on like whatever she did to the dirt where the blood of her supposed love one was beheaded- Period drama, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, turns out, it's just her suspecting things too much, getting old and dying was part of the procedure, and ironically which I assume Jusetsu was just thinking on behalf of the God tied to her, which I guess keeping that spirit down by the lake might be a better idea than destroying it, I guess. Good guy Jusetsu... or is it just part of her now? Besides her having great friends and now someone to write letters to ie. the emperor- F**KING PENPALS!!! We've reached yet another level of friendship lol. Yeah, looks like people outside are thinking that this cushy role of Raven Consort might be taken too lightly at this point because damn, is the last part riveting. Yeah, I don't know why, this is probably worse than the vengeance felt in that Lady. Damn. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Wow hey as I mention every week, this series has not failed to deliver stories that touch the heart, and provide even more depth into the mysteries of the powers and life of the Raven Consort, and I could not be more hyped than the emperor to know more. Hey, looks like this is what will end the series formally, so we shall see what other sorcery others can come up to pit against the Winter King. Oh, bringing back the dead, you say?

Ask away. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So uh... in this long awaited special episode of this wonderful marriage series which we are still in season one I guess (#ToniKawa14), because what better way to promote the upcoming second season with another episode, yes? This time around, not surprisingly, it's about cosplay. I mean, you would think this is nothing special, isn't it? Hey, if not for finding even some way to distract the husband from work (lol why though) and also because the TV quiz apparently did nothing to stop Nasa-kun here from creating a database haha... So yeah, this motherf**ker doesn't do algebra, he just takes the aggregate of possibilities like doing probability. Damn, AI brain, this Nasa-kun. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Also he's right just use simultaneous equations, so if A is the mom and B is the kid, then 4B = A and 3B = A+4) (And yes you can put these in an online equation solver lmao 2022 BABY) And yes, the other question's answer I learnt from YouTubers playing that Mario Party minigame. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sorry for being a nerd let's move on who gives a sh*t about math and literally three women who want to answer them before the guy does also this isn't a punishment thing <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>, but I guess Charlotte did trigger the main topic of this episode first so why not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Apart from the fact that the maid uniform changed colour lmao I assume this is just another set of uniform the maid had... yeah I guess this did work on Nasa-kun real good. Problem is, unless you can heat his brain up enough for it to overheat which apparently considering he hasn't drunk a sip of water in front of the camera it would be safe to believe this guy is not human or has an internal cooling system which might be his small dick- It would be safe to think that he won't do a blowout like many other Anime characters out there because he would just kiss the bride anyways. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Aaaand we lost. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Upon asking of more of his fetishes though lol this series only has one male and he's Yuzaki Nasa lmao, we also found out that once again, these two as basically high schoolers never went for dates like normal high schoolers do because they are special. They are already married to each other- Okay how are we going to follow up on the joke like this? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But you know, after being convinced by Aya-san (aka Sumipe but as a bossypants) on both sides, I guess we can see more cosplay because why not, right? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> RIGHT?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, I didn't write the script for this episode and charge money for this in Japan for the DVD, the producers did. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (Yeah apparently overseas viewers can just pop in on streaming services while Japanese have to buy physical) But serious talk though, we all expected the last part where they make... out... and kiss thighs apparently because that's the guy's fetish or something. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Overall though, can I even complain about this episode? I mean, if you wondered why the reviews out there can be negative, it's just they don't like cosplay. Period. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not that, but yeah, the pace is slow and almost feels like just slice-of-life and I guess they are leaving the actual topics in the next season, so this is just fanservice and you won't be missing out if you didn't watch this. Or maybe you will miss out, I don't know. Depends on whether you like maid outfit or school uniform haha I just want the voice actress herself to do this- Yeah, she did NONE of this EVER, by the way. Not even her upcoming self-produced photobook is going to have any of the cosplay shown on screen. None. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Haha we got no swimsuit here so she wins IRL I guess- <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> This series is just perfect "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/2026/Hayate_no_Gotoku target=_blank>Hayate no Gotoku</a>" author you have outdone yourself hehe</div><div>[TL:DR; "What better way to distract a man than with a charming girl, yeah?"

And since I listened to a live video of their recent 10th anniversary live (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG4FUbRCTV4" target=_blank>released in full on YouTube</a> by the way, don't know how long that'll stay) I picked up <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC-%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF%E3%83%87%E3%82%A4-ep/1536268154?l=en" target=_blank>wacci's debut album</a></b> from back in 2012 and it isn't bad though outdated in style, still managed to hit me with some ballad songs apart from the rather interesting topic song, so I may be giving those. <br><br> Well, in this week's news on Twitter, I hope you're just here after what was <b>YouTube Music Weekend</b> series of lives videos on premiere throughout this weekend... on YouTube lol but I only listened to a few which are namely <a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1594530035678838784?s=20&amp;t=JWMv0NfrrHWCj9Nqdg5wjg" target=_blank>Kitou Akari</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1594526010518781955?s=20&amp;t=JWMv0NfrrHWCj9Nqdg5wjg" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire</a> on Friday and just now with <a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1596464801823477760?s=20&amp;t=JWMv0NfrrHWCj9Nqdg5wjg" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai</a> even though it's interesting to see how there is continuation from video to video now because that's how I know before them was Kitani Tatsuya (see previous paragraph) and after was YUKI-san, dear <b><a href="https://twitter.com/anime_kaguya/status/1594480962900983815?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>Suzuki Masayuki's new song is for Anime "Kaguya-sama"</a></b> and their conclusion arc movie, we have some single covers for <a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie_staff/status/1595341395098624000?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>Takahashi Rie's new EP</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_staff/status/1595371588374904833?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's new single</a> both for next year, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/mol_74/status/1595386729435115521?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>mol-74's indie EP is in music streaming services</a></b> now which was released in 2015(?) so maybe I'll take a listen when I'm bored next week lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1595733978538905600?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>SHE'S new song</a></b> might not be too bad so I might as well give it, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/marika_staff/status/1595733973686136833?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>Kouno Marika's recent live digest</a></b> does make me happy listening to songs I was familiar with even though for a moment, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/staff_azumi/status/1596096360209604609?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>Waki Azumi's concept album preview</a></b> does sound really good and might be better than the one early this year but doesn't explain why Tomita Miyu's from the same music label is worse somehow lol we shall see about that next week, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1596112040137216001?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>RYTHEM's first ever online live digest</a></b> from earlier this year is cool as much as I am so not familiar with pretty much everything in it to be honest I think I only recognize one song, and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1596745638817026048?s=20&amp;t=RLrXrCv8u6nL2IMtEkszpQ" target=_blank>Touyama Nao's recent live digest</a></b> is I guess fine but might pale out compared to the others above.<br><br>So for next week, to end the month of November, we are still technically going to listen to <b>Anime "Uzaki-chan" collaboration single</b> as if those songs exist but now just only in digital because their physical release fell out for some reason so this will be the deciding week which I should be giving both opening and ending without any issues, and <b>Waki Azumi's new concept album</b> which I hope will be way better than the one earlier this year which I didn't even bother giving the topic song and this one's already better so let's hope this will be good. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> It's like they say "concept" and then it must be a trash dump of bad melodies because they will make all the tricks with music style and forget the melody-focused Klassic Note motto altogether. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br><br><br><br> Oh boy are the upcoming packages going to be a treat.
