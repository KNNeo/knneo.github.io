BUT!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also Elon doesn't like me so I may think of moving Klassic Note to Instagram; They have support for sharing in Apple Music too.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>On the good news side though, after much dedication (for the week haha) of doing some exercise for the week ie. like every other day for an hour max... hey guess what, I feel better now, what a surprise. Turns out I just have to be normal and watch more Anime and listen to more Japanese music!!! <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Okay let's get to it though I saw enough spoilers for BLEACH on the <a href=https://anicobin.ldblog.jp/archives/59899515.html target=_blank>Japanese bulletin boards</a> haha yes I read that also apparently they review episodes by putting screencaps with Twitter tweets and people commenting on those is actually ironically funny if you can understand OR have Google Translate handy lol<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BLEACHTYBW05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"(Ichigo's) Bankai can't be stolen by Quincies!" Well, ironically it's not that it can't be, but also, he's main guy so of course not haha</div></blockquote>I appreciate Zaraki's enthusiasm for Ichigo's arrival to Soul Society haha but bro, not this soon I'm afraid. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> For what happened in this new episode (#BLEACHTYBW05) wouldn't make the Kenpachi himself too happy just yet, because damn, is Ichigo stuck in the world of Garganta. Alone. In a spiritual energy jail from the enemy. Hmm... now what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yes, guys, this is the beat'em up arc and I mean the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> because damn did the enemy put themselves at such an advantage I would say they are cheating, and they did steal their powers away from them so yeah, totally. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, do we still have so much to talk about, just like Zaraki's overflowing desire for fight. So let's ignore Ichigo stuck in that jail and discuss about the fights of the shinigami. Firstly, Byakuya not doing too well though, as so is Renji. After losing his Bankai, the captain really can't do much as to even fight against the enemy considering also yes, they can use their Bankai against them. As As Nodt (lol) noted (not grammar mistake btw) with his deep voice and boy I've never heard harem master voice actor <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11817/Yoshitsugu_Matsuoka target=_blank>Matsuoka</a> sound so boring before lmao but I guess it's adequate haha we have been here from that Lycoris Anime, there's no way one can fight against their Bankai with just even their Shikai, and even then you still gotta find out your own sword's weakness in order to retaliate, so that's not fun. (In his defence mine's a Kido-based sword and I excel at Kido so f**k me too if mine gets stolen haha maybe I can do punches like Yamamoto to Wonderweiss? lol) (My bro is right just modify to prevent it from killing thyself like Mayuri) So yeah, no surprise, they all got beat up real bad, and maybe we are hoping that Ichigo will come and save all of them at some point. Not now though, they are on their own, Rukia included. Next up, we can stop Ichigo from fighting in Soul Society but we can't stop Kenpachi from killing three Sternritters at once. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, <em>technically </em>he didn't and we will eventually talk about why he only killed two of them hehe, but yeah, he strong. Not strong enough though considering he wants to fight against God's son so uh, maybe set the bar lower a bit, Zaraki. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also his eyepatch isn't- Oh it's undone already. Oops. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, and this is why I've been so hyped about this final arc, we have our first new Bankai reveal. Hisagi was fighting the one Sternritter who held now deceased (RIP) Sasakibe's powers and interestingly the powers live on as they die, we shall not talk about why Hisagi wouldn't use his Bankai considering his enemy can't hold two but then again what if another one drops in and goes into a suicide pact with him <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (Uh, that's... a light novel side story reveal haha), but regardless, old man geezer arrived to save his life but probably also, he might have realized a familiar attack that got his right-hand man in the grave. Spiritual grave, we call it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, the same fate happened to Yamamoto as with Byakuya ie. the Bankai was used on him just not his which is a relief, because that fire can't be contained as he swiftly removed this overkill of an idiot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Kenpachi, but better. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What IS the highlight of this episode though is the flashback, as we mentioned about how loyalty works here, Sasakibe is THE definition of loyalty in this story probably more than me for my work lol I need to change jobs haha, as he stays by old man all the time even going to the lengths of learning his Bankai to try to compensate for the old man's weaknesses which frankly is none lol, but still. To put a dent on him would make taking this kid more seriously, and also, know what it means to have to fight with someone who knows his sword, not like stupid Sternritter who thinks this Bankai is a toy. Pft, how disgusting. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I'm not going to talk about who killed Kirge but he's super dead now not even Ransotengai can save him lol, Ichigo will be stuck in there for a bit the Scrift's power is kinda absolute and that's the point, and next up, old man gonna fight Quincy God, so that'll be exciting. Not going to spoil the outcome but remember what I mentioned about a beat'em up? Sshh quiet me we gotta witness another Bankai release first. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Haha see you all then.</div><div>[TL:DR; "The heart burns, even if the rain falls."

RIGHT?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> *looks at self* Oh well, I can be alone, don't mind me I don't have good grades. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> While that might not seem to be a problem with Uzaki-chan here, even with Sakaki just breathing down her neck to make her wake up, it still really did not work on her somehow as she thought time in college was the factor stopping her relationship with her senpai but the reality is Sakurai just needs a gamer girl to talk to and her life would have been over. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Cue Uzaki Yanagi haha, Hana-chan (as I will refer to from here on) has a younger sister surprise surprise lol, plays games a lot too so don't ask how I would fare against her in a console FPS haha she probably knows the strats, and is SUPER interested in this whatever relationship her <a href=https://jisho.org/search/oneesan target=_blank>onee-san</a> is having with this guy at school. Middle school level romance, but better. Haha give me a moment while I fetch some rice ie. order lunch. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Okay I'm back lmao then again, can't blame anyone else in the family (other than the mom lol she has problems) to be concerned about this Hana and her relationship with Sakurai, decides to poke real hard into her so often it makes the sister uncomfortable. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> From seeing her suddenly wanting to make some <a href=https://jisho.org/search/bentou target=_blank>bento</a> for... the whole family haha why has it come down to this it was only for the one guy, to thinking of getting up early to go outdoors which is unlikely for a gamer like her and I also mean Sakurai haha TO VISIT THE SISTER AT THE WORKPLACE?? Dude, you smart. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, remember when we talked about Hana-chan being middle schooler? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, instant paralysis for the sister working on a Sunday and boy did I laugh out hard on that, as Yanagi tries to get the attention of Sakurai just to know more about him, I must say maybe it's just on her character but great choice on doing all of this after the morning peak crowd lol that's me on weekends too I eat breakfast past nine <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, really got into conversation with this maybe future brother-in-law (just maybe) by talking about the stuff they like the most: video games. Yep, and that's why there's a resident gamer in the Uzaki family, and it's not the brother. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... I hope that's enough to be honest. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah Hana-chan here is feeling the pain we should stop bullying her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But damn, really didn't expect much of this development until it happens though. Hey, maybe the guys in the Uzaki family are this impression until we get into the stories of MILF and gamers, amirite fellas?? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Don't ask me why these genres but it works on Sakurai, so he wins. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Uzaki Hana, what did you say about timeline? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I gotta go to cook more rice, I gotta haha I really wonder what can be up next maybe get the brother involved from what was in the next episode title</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiju8lAPBtiuclNMTxomDMsJntF8DYWxDU4tLRFbP57eZI3IKI9GIziVMY1Kp1LK0RcPdZ1M32LWANoEiFCHpB4xGFstdBjnurA66KLxyos_EcJhVikEySD4HaXuvh1a4rh7P2FxjhYitriVRHhX7_cDFuFOaJeHxJcs7HSzM9z_3zAgAAkZj3J_YBf/s320/uzakichanS207_uzaki8.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Only in Anime can you have boomerang stuck into someone's huge rack-<br>(Haha or a round trip on Instagram and you'll find one)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1rZLRF61z9uBkSZfz03NJu2AjdK_fpd_kgXiOUemdtHnuq-7K2E1489N5_9QT2Fzh-gmEM3AMdtSJJHK6DYWbZ3FpBF6MsOOzVFSZyeolv1RyrcIxeeQ-aB2xi7JMeIprlYXiXTuQjJLnJH7R_x6FPXJHaSgR5c6YHsTHgW5m0bldf1Y2HErQHYkM/s1600/uzakichanS207_smirk.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I saw this and I already know this gonna be good episode hehe</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I'm glad you realized (it was me, Bingyue)" No shit bro who else uses sorcery to possess women? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>I mean, not even in *ahem* do we have such a jebait, people. We had to call in fifth wave feminism to have a winter king just because a God said so. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, in this new episode where maybe liberating my soul could be done by the one and only Jusetsu haha ah hey (#KoukyuuNoKarasu07), hey we finally got to see for ourselves <strike>Bingyue</strike> Jusetsu's true form. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> No really, who gives a shit about that weak f**k we have what technically is God's messenger here, <em>bro</em>. So, what I thought was revenge of the previous dynasty turned out to be not the case. I also assumed that Bingyue is some sorcerer who can live past his time and still do magic, but sadly, he's already dead and is possessing human bodies all this time around which will explain why Jiu-Jiu was holding something sharp to her neck. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Hey, it got Jusetsu mad alright. Remember what your predecessor mentioned about not forming relationships? This is attachment, I tell ya. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ignoring that, she did a great job despite knowing this guy is already dead, and would still listen to his request even if she wasn't blackmailed, still ended up helping him just because she respects her own job of... moderating souls in this world? Yeah, I think. Anyways, it has got to to with Bingyue's partner probably fiancé at this point, but hey, we know where she is right now, up on a willow tree as a ghost. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> *ahem* Did I mention this story was dark? Yeah, take note on that. As their engagement was in order, so was a change of dynasty. All of them were dead with reasons I don't want to explain, but the partner chose to hang herself to prevent ridicule, and also chose to keep the marriage gift ie. a comb, a secret so to not let this treasure be taken away by people of the new era. So, she buried it. Thank goodness. So that's a story done haha yeah this is it by the way I was expecting some backstabbing but turns out the only thing we stabbed this episode was a cursed beast haunting the emperor's bed. Yeah. About that, and that's why the golden chicken technically didn't stop Jusetsu and why she has to act on this alone, is because she found a familiar smell of a beast by the bed and couldn't help but notice also why the aide talked about souls of the emperor's loved ones coming in to protect said entity. It was a curse, set by you guessed it, that damn Dowager before she was beheaded to make sure the emperor was cursed beyond his life and forever even after she is gone. Damn. Women, amirite?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, just this woman, because not only did Jusetsu help to send that cursed beast away, she also helped the emperor's best buddy and his mother depart into the afterlife. Hey, what other benefactor will save you in this way, and is cute? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Last but not least, the new laws of the dynasty. I would expect the emperor had to explain the reasons behind these changes to his officials, but as the Consorts were busy having tea and their faces stuffed with buns lmao I was referring to just Jusetsu hehe <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kawaii target=_blank>kawaii</a>, he came in to deliver the good news at her place, mostly about how he changed laws to stop the policy of killing the previous dynasty Luan race, set up rules to do king level respect between the two kings and so that's why the emperor kneeled in front of her, and how he wants to be friends with her. Well the last one is just personal to be honest haha but damn if every generation was like this such that the previous two things will work in the empire's favour, that'll be nice. But we know that's not true, so we shall see how it goes then. Also, Jiu-Jiu was not a friend by the way, status not high enough. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> *ahem* Man, I really hope this is still the honeymoon period because apart from the kings not being able to date each other lmao, I would like to not think that this is a prelude to something bad to end the series. Hey, I don't know *ahem* something bad can still happen. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But damn, this is quite a story so far, ladies and gentlemen. If it hasn't satisfied your drama-filled mind yet, it has for me. Maybe viewing everything bad from the start might not be great, but what do I know. There is still chance for a rebellion... right? Yeah, just not between the kings, but everything can change I guess. Haha let's see how bad this gets moving on.</div><div>[TL:DR; The summer king is to protect the other from the adversities of physical rule, while the winter king is to protect the other from spiritual elements.
