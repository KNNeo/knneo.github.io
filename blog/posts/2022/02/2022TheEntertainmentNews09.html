It's a thing in Twitch where streamers allow viewers to submit their short clips or videos (on YouTube, mostly) and it is compiled and played back to back, so it's basically a bunch of trash and memes and good stuff depending on the audience who paid to submit them. Yes, it's paid, or else it's going to be 100% cr*p haha so yeah, that was fun to watch, great catch-up on the stuff I may have never known of because I'm just an Anime weeb who only watches a set amount of drama and/or listen to Japanese music which probably was a thing for the world a decade ago.<div><br></div><div>...</div><div><br></div><div>Oh well, what'cha gonna do haha ANYWAYS!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We got more shows to watch this week, and my weekend is running short thanks to that livestream. I also spent most of Saturday outside so you know next week for me at work is going to suck because I didn't stay at home enough lmao let's get to it then my hair's getting long haha</div><div><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan82><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Because of Eren Jeager, my house...!" Yeah old woman I know right just march them Titans somewhere else dude aren't you protecting the people on the island? Geez haha</div></blockquote>Well, looks like many are "giving their hearts" to the Eldian genocide cause, eh, Eren? Good for you bro, good for you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, in this new episode where we continue to witness the effects of The Rumbling (#AttackOnTitan82), oh yeah we can talk about Annie who just woke up after shielding herself from Titan goo for years which has melted from the event that has been killing thousands of people at this point. Hey, small sacrifice, as Eren would've said. So, let's jump right into the story, as Armin would getting the jump on Connie next episode or something. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Firstly, let's talk about Annie. She's alive, and according to her long story-telling to Hitch which I swear I remember that name but not remember anything lol, Annie was out for about four years, remembered a lot of things thanks to people talking in front of her, so she probably figured out how she was removed from that Titan goo. Armed with her hands in blood so she can transform anytime, she threatened Hitch to send her out of the island - and I can't believe I can say that especially considering we know Annie is pretty heartless and doesn't care of anything - to see her foster dad once again. Spoiler alert, he's already dead, following a protest of the Eldians stuck inside Marley camps with most of the military not knowing of that dream everyone else saw, likely got shot in the head while going against the country that locked them down. So yeah, sorry for that Annie your dad's an idiot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next, we talk about Floch before I forget his name and what a piece of sh*t he was. Everything he said to the Marley volunteers were kind of correct, just that in his case, we know he is just a wimp and he'll do all it takes to control everyone if he can so yeah Eren probably made his best and worst choice on trusting this a**hole, but hey, what can I say he used everyone anyways so this idiot is included. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, he shot someone as an example so who said this isn't dealing with humans again, and Yelena's group got locked up until they were willing to help... Floch with his cause because I don't think a collective term exists for this now lol. Jean is just shocked at all this because yeah who wouldn't, Mikasa is shocked at what to do now since she can't do anything with Eren, and Armin has enough of her shit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, considering he is the best brain in the gang and he's back to panicking, no wonder he rather think he's worse off as a main character and let Erwin live instead so he can make worse decisions than this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, we talk about Connie. Remember last time we saw him he left with... Falco I almost forgot his name lol (Please I can only member at most half a dozen people okay? And they aren't even Japanese names) because we know Falco has Titan powers inherited from the brother, and Connie can get his mother back by letting her eat... a... human? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, Falco knew close to nothing but to follow this soldier, but he has a hunch this guy isn't nice. Also hey, Connie, if you are a soldier, stop thinking of the people around you. You do for the cause, not save your family. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm good haha so yeah, Armin's determined to stop him from saving his mom, that's for sure. Gotta say though, how to deal with the Titan powers being around forever, I have no idea. Maybe bury them in secret so they can never be consumed by someone else ever again? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, and even in the preview, we see Pieck (umph) (haha) and the Commander (forgot his name again lmao oh yeah Magath) spotting Hange and Levi in the distance (they were blown away most likely), so I guess we will continue with that for now, this world on fire. So yeah, surprise surprise, our coolest hero isn't dead and yes Hange I don't mean you lmao cya guys for more story to the conclusion of this epic series that just refuses to end haha we are near the end trust me</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP3GBkjCXiJYsj-3bUYABsUPU1hJHyXjx8mhxFjJ2IlMGUkZnMex7-6-fMVS3DFZfenR-wOsJrT6m1Cd96qB4jDWFaxxd64iwC8pvLWyly_SbEypObrkO0sAqCqqnAlBV2oRqDG8QJ6OuWb6wCXQxiB8-ZWFY6xX7rQKUdbZo_trayLw/s320/attackontitan82_annie6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That's the "you got a great face" type of face when fighting<br>(Yeah young Annie vs her dad)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_VdhcvTgyElEyRD_5yxMrxfqPmPtXrz2vViOmYZGwC6SEiGaE_PiXrFKaAX09nLJLWlKQfo9eFVqeKJJO5l2pnMuMxCVXExYNfJdiy7eePYj_tsVXtn7Skg6U9xWKtuvbv34wBQOF8BYXakCk2JQX3FKsAA0ZNVY0WnTQBCCy9N54Aw/s320/attackontitan82_levi.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That's the "you got a great face" type of face when fighting<br>(Levi passing out lmao what happened though)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

"Killing people was something we were praised for" Well, not in this world it isn't haha isn't war terrible? <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span></div><div><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSanS308><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Hey Takagi-san, can we take a detour on our way home?" Hey, Nishikata be going on dates with the girl already, what can I say. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>I guess Nishikata is into outdoor dates, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we continue this path of romance with no end in sight or else how you do another season of this lmao (#TakagiSanS308), we actually are doing so, with a literal path. (Hehe how did I know that, future me you wrote that intro earlier-) So, the path of love. I won't spell it out for you so let's refer it as "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/yoi target=_blank>Yoi</a> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/koi target=_blank>Koi</a> Hill" or something haha, Takagi and Nishikata climb the... stairs to see the fantastic scenery up this hill. Yes, steps like these are normal in the suburbs, city freak, so listen up. So initially, Nishikata asked his girl out (haha) not because he could be dating her walking up the stairs, nor did he intend to write on that notepad of the person he likes because we know it's Takagi and it'll have been a great idea to let the girl write down hers as a showdown instead lmao, but no instead Nishikata walks the steps with her and spent a good amount of time talking to her because what else you gonna so on the way up lol even he jebaited himself so Takagi can learn more about him, and then asked how many steps they climbed instead of asking her out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Seriously bro. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Takagi won just because it's literally written on the place of interest, so as punishment Nishikata has to... walk up here again next time with her. Yeah, just walk up here a few more times to seal the deal, idiot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Dude, is this not more of a jebait or what? Haha I mean, Takagi-san you might have to think twice this partner of yours is not very smart. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Next up, and I can't believe I'm saying this, between whatever roles <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/6686/Aoi_Yuuki target=_blank>Yuuki Aoi</a> has ever voiced I've watched so far, nothing comes as close as just hearing her normal voice in a bittersweet romance scenario. Like seriously, you questioned yourself on that before? So, stairs again, but it's another couple. These two, probably more chance to date each other earlier. Hojou and... I don't remember the guy's name BUT THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The point is that, the girl knows all about this place so is already happy about waiting for the moment, and the guy didn't deliver. I wouldn't say he didn't considering only Nishikata doesn't know about this place lmao, but he... he didn't do it. Sad, I feel sad for her already, the character and the voice behind it haha ah hey. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Gotta say though, still sweeter than like, season two's ending of this series tbh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Someday guys, someday you two will be together. Next next up, in case you haven't realize they only hired one dude to do the background scene drawings this week lmao maybe I should check the credits later, it's Mano-chan's turn. With Nakai, of course. Problem is, we can clearly see how much the guy doesn't really care and we'll talk about why in a moment, versus the girl who is such a desperate slut- Anyways haha, Mano-chan is into this lovey-dovey stuff, so as boyfriend Nakai I suggest you play your part to make her happy. And so he did, for he has already climbed this hill before and wrote on that notepad too, just because. Aw... slap some more sugar on that relationship I can't even. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Mano-chan, you are very lucky <strike>to get laid</strike> to have a partner at your age for many to envy. Also Nakai-kun MVP he's the coolest in this series FYI. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I can already imagine in the future he's like oblivious to the girl's birthday and gives her a surprise <strike>at night</strike> in the evening or something. You know, celebrations. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And then, we have the lesbian subplot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You think the legend works in this case? I don't know. I just know I won't search hentai of it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, if you haven't guessed it, Sanae and Mina have no idea what this 415 thing is about besides Yukari-chan, because if you have not known of its spin-off novel series where she is the main character... I won't blame you it's a novel anyways. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyhow, not like Yukari has anyone to write it on anyways don't you dare write any of the dudes mentioned above (you can write like, Kimura or Takao or something haha) (or me, yeah, or me) (lol), so yeah, the girls are just for here to enjoy the scenery and a great workout, it seems. Oh come on, it's not sad, the legends just don't work on them. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> To wrap this one side shtick off for the episode, we talk about rental DVDs. Oh DVDs exist in Japan, by the way, just so you know. I know it's 2022 already where the rest of the world are burning them as in on the fire lol we be digital now dude, the main couple drop by the convenience store where they rent movies and stuff like it's the early 2000s. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> It's not really a showdown here because remember every episode has to have a wholesome moment at the end now? Haha so yeah, they recommended movies to each other. Apart from the spoilers revealed by Nishikata accidentally introducing his movie about aliens fighting humans but in an old Western duel lol who wrote that, and that "100% Unrequited Love" is getting a movie adaptation soon wow so much hype dude, we didn't get the "let's watch at my place" plot that we might have wanted even if these people are still in middle school lol. Well, turns out, Takagi may not have enough courage to do so, just like Nishikata. The dude may be a tsundere but Takagi... she be an embarrassed girl haha I mean, we dealing with an idiot and a thickhead so that is understandable. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I think you can understand how much I love this series just by looking at the write-up here lmao, and I don't even mind them throwing more of these stories at me. I just wonder what will conclude this season though, because nothing can quite top a summer festival theme, but maybe going to watch that movie on Christmas with that couple gift Nishikata wanted? I mean, that totally sounds like a thing your parents will let you do haha ah hey they got laid and I don't so they win lol cya guys then</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4Iyv14-jBQ7Iw9r1GObZgCelEg08w3l9j1M9osG6y7eR5iTzZnCrTPQmI5embOiyRXDgb4On0dlFEBKiMUxhbUb8w08oa46kxfqTsYdy-tmVM3UVKJLG7Dh5WCNCw2Q7D-4Ql8eiPOBFP_6C1P_sCigFMEQ8u1Hz_f_8rteiM2riM4Q/s320/takagisanS308_takagi1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The Girls of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san<br>[Main girl Takagi]</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJk-yde1V74fx9lq1-jXi1756kdXTk4jynX9tFdILR1t5n2RDFJOhjCijCm0GjOe-fqFEqpn5hXS0OMh3GQk9ISTFjpO9XkMuz1AyihPdLug1YfLuXWR8FLq8fi_mxUaBM_Aw0hZtbChJbqq3VDcKsigWvZIK42UDxP9yunYvvKNqM3w/s320/takagisanS308_houjou1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The Girls of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san<br>[Coolish yet shameful Houjou]</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSEE4ws1xDd1kA00VzyHfHD8QuRMbFSROC2u9zM3dYue6rOy9luRF0KjxR8MHwSKTbmaKCtTa_P9jRxlUH6Za12F-z7QmZfkU8EQvOaiBDvFeN8Wm3Q8CJtjYrgEH3sVljkcTLamC2IFwHnkp1PkJTvuujE1LqrPRc7_O4Wm8V_eRh0Q/s320/takagisanS308_mano2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The Girls of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san<br>[Desperate hopeless romantic Mano-chan]</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLnbKYgHp5ehUB5hAHcWdihYXHwhZkjTOVEgJ_65d4nfrJToVeQvNfncceWRfIII41HSTTVs3qas2_vCoVgd1rLkA8iTd08EDDfH6KkDPvasoF_eSWg50nmHtwdQ8TaUNDO6ZkLr9SqydyRiRzp-8ytM7Isr6q_X81b0PACSU4RkYYwQ/s320/takagisanS308_nishikata2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>And there's our resident rapist haha<br>(Ah hey Nishikata promise me you won't make such faces again)</table></div></div>P.S.

Because she has a tall build- Why do I have to explain all my jokes?) In this new episode where I welcome us into the world of cosplay because come on we barely touched any ground on this (#KiseKoi08), so let's see with this episode we can go much further. So firstly, about the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a>. No, this particular one did not tickle my fancy. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She is Inui Shinju, so different from the elder sister Sajina, and boy is her explanation of how Juju-san came about is totally wholesome I can't believe we have an episode worth of this. More on that later, but suffice it to say the sister Shinju took on the interest from the father in photography, but specifically to take photos of the cute stuff that is Sajina lol am I the lolicon here, but yeah, because the sister is always doing cosplay for herself, this aspiring photographer thought it'll be a waste to not put what she did for many to see online, and so she did. So basically, <b>she's</b> the manager. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But despite how much things have grown so much that her reputation to even rent a studio to do her next cosplay will be so much easier (and cheaper) if the word "Juju" was placed in front of her requests she doesn't even know, but yeah, I can understand both of their cases, so to speak. I mean, look at Kitagawa getting high from looking at more exclusive Juju-san cosplay photos. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe Shinju should join in the cosplay business too but she said no and I know we have the same shocked face as Gojou so WE KNOW SHE IS LYING!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, it's just a prospect, dear author, we know, we'll not think about this too deeply. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And as expected, the couple do not know of how professional cameras work because I know you don't too, and also how expensive they are. Well, study some engineering and one day you'll get it too but (haha) yeah the technology is never cheap especially the equipment used, so I guess they are not considering this at this point. Next up, the selection of studio for the shooting. Since the couple are going to be sharing the cost with Sajina here, they arranged to meet up to find the next best location to take photos apart from the yard which we start with... an abandoned hospital. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, great start, dear author, because we know this is totally not scary and there won't be the one person who won't freak out even walking into this chilly, dark place. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> While Sajina quivered (hell yeah) (I'm not into <a href=https://jisho.org/search/lolicon target=_blank>loli</a> haha ah) in her fears, we also learnt a lot about herself, about how her dream was being a magical girl (lol) as impractical as they were as a kid, could still come true being a cosplayer, which is why she tries her best to make it stay that way just because. I get it man, people do cosplay for all sorts of reasons, mostly for social media attention these days or you have these guys here I guess. Anyways, Gojou gets it too relating himself with <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hinaningyou target=_blank>hina dolls</a> and how he hasn't reached it quite yet thanks to these girls lol but hey, at least he gets to be encouraged to do it by hearing this little girl's story. We can do the tears without the handshakes though, you gonna let girl-school-only never-talked-to-guys virgin Juju-san faint. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I wouldn't have gone for her hands, but what do I know I don't date a gal. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, and I can't believe you can do this without bikini, it's the beach! Yeah, the exams are over, Kitagawa had the urge to go to the beach, so he dragged a mat and Gojou-kun with her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ironically, this is the signalling of the start of the summer vacations, and guess who they are going to spend it with. I mean, that's how you know this is a good relationship because one dude never leaves the house since he doesn't have to versus some outdoorsy girl who likes to go out, you can have so much fun you won't even get bored as long as you are together. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Some woman take me out please I'm just taking myself out at this point it's just <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Haha anyways, all in all, great episode I would say, we may have way too many quotes to talk about in one episode considering this series is chocked full of them in the first place, and I can't praise it myself any better. Maybe getting food stolen from a hawk and looking up the short skirt is fine after all lol those aren't reality guys you would be hit by the hawk first and skirts can't be that short... unless you're outside school but what do I know haha stay tuned for more Gojou-level discoveries of the outside world with best girl Kitagawa haha bye</div><div>[TL:DR; How you know Kitagawa Marin is a good girlfriend: She passes you half of the remaining burger AND the drink lol okay the latter doesn't matter though imo also indirect kiss so]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlQLXGqsLF4cesVRTN9Iy8MYYH3VrkiuAubpXdF8Iq7Gz2u4wVzaQgRVPaFaelI2Yq-79gBK8-aE6J5D05GhVaEd9_IETAKkwTtvSX7NpXi53CCXWv4I57JGcHMLVXrX6rTfqx7XlTCblrWxS8yU2H8LMnTy3GlIFiZbXC9o1nH6OwRg/s320/kisekoi08_cosplay2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>THEN<br>(Juju-san I knew you tried but technically you won Kitagawa's first attempt lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAetca9ekAR6_L8Q9x5U8d1PjJwtIBPu8xtthZW7wUx9siAM5I0dWWxcRVU_EDWgeEM7-kP86hYksHzC8iHlC_YTBOVc6RPGKUCkAL128AxfogKEF9fvm-FpFVmNrIGcrNeY_B8hGc5qc3_itF2W0AHeE_2pEhESJCm37YIMk2I__VBQ/s320/kisekoi08_jealous.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>NOW<br>(Haha jealous b*tch amirite??)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfBQ0z_gsYzT9c7YUVCtcFFdICDC5hoifUUzn4iS-uo6UuwpH4515MqyJiLcgLeGGtG-1DahKMTTBUcq3A96NyTUGiJktLoqox8B-_osmzg0jXpsrTvjzGt-mY3iILYUNaiApUb7x4R7k9zPPGjyN8VGPrZFgfSkUPWu0c2lKRFsNsMQ/s320/kisekoi08_money.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>NOW<br>(You know, overweighed by money lol you're not even Juju-san)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSSz0vn61IxuFd40USctwt9xY1BdjRYyr7tQjlh_Im8BbAwtVwvnpzKFezHJAuH2_pa3lTUh4LoNrwnPoeenzhf4RSm-s0hIrqHqYHy1oGN3LviHCovO9FeJv5yW6-WfTQqWJwRq5evLGhiJAeIPZtsfABNzVOt22O7MZTOzZn5s_oeg/s320/kisekoi08_photo2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>NOW<br>(HELL YEAH haha but seriously this will get those guys online high af)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

We had to listen to three full albums (and ones single lol) and they delivered. Well, some of them did. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, let's start from the top. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hitotsu/1608484082?l=en" target=_blank>Kouno Marika's 1st album</a></b> since her debut last year of the same period wasn't exactly great, not many songs will fit her high-pitched voice but that doesn't mean she is bad, just that the songs are heavily pop and rap-based, which only made me think the producers might be influenced by her idol group Earphones on this which doesn't really make of a great experience listening to it. I did give the more popular songs though including the topic song. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/blossom/1606702749?l=en" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new album</a></b> ever since her change in music label was also not exactly a game-changer, as with my past experiences giving only an average of 1-2 songs per album even the one with 25 songs (lol) haha but yeah, I did find some interesting things besides the topic song which can bring you back right into the 1980s lmao. But yeah, Ooki Reiji, didn't even give <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/miss-you/1606702749?i=1606702755&amp;l=en" target=_blank>the one song</a> you wrote too just because. Moving on, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sparkle/1607226607?l=en" target=_blank>miwa's new album</a></b> as of course expectedly good because besides giving the usual now in her image ever since her short hiatus, in recent years she has only been singing pop-heavy songs, but I also had a share of listening to more Acoustic and Rock based songs which is great because covering as much ground as possible is half the reason why she still stands strong as a Collection Artist in Klassic Note today. Even missing out on her latest single from last year, and I gave it another chance after if I recall, rejecting the music video on first impression. Last but not least, I took a day later to give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%81%8B%E3%83%8E%E8%A1%8C%E6%96%B9-special-edition/1609057445?l=en" target=_blank>Akase Akari's debut single</a></b> which ironically didn't appear on time but also, had a weird singing voice I can't describe it's not exactly like Marinka and it's not cute so the songs being subpar didn't make it any better so I just gave the one song.</div><br>It's Twitter News Time!! In this week's edition of "TNT" lmao I literally came up with this in three seconds lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/PHONOTONES/status/1496142563090259977?s=20&amp;t=cb3DDOsMAKpUSuDg-FIt8w" target=_blank>PHONO TONES' new song</a></b> is also <a href="https://twitter.com/PHONOTONES/status/1496143862741487624?s=20&amp;t=cb3DDOsMAKpUSuDg-FIt8w" target=_blank>an announcement for their upcoming album</a> coming in April so that is real hype considering their previous was back in 2015 wtf, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1495715194215215109?s=20&amp;t=cb3DDOsMAKpUSuDg-FIt8w" target=_blank>cinema staff's new music video</a></b> from their album from last year won't change my mind of giving the song anyways, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1495700408739991554?s=20&amp;t=cb3DDOsMAKpUSuDg-FIt8w" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new video on YouTube</a></b> is for her recent Blu-Ray release of her live last year and yes I did join in on the LINE LIVE soon after this video was premiered, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1495898412176523268?s=20&amp;t=cb3DDOsMAKpUSuDg-FIt8w" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single is releasing in April</a></b> following their album release in January,<b><a href="https://twitter.com/marika_staff/status/1496817229660246016?s=20&amp;t=1bchtXQNwA8AKxjv1yk5EQ" target=_blank> Kouno Marika's new live video on YouTube</a></b> is from her recent live promoting her 1st album before the release of the album so yeah and don't ask why there isn't a live band she hasn't had enough budget to do so lol (it's also 20 minutes long Jesus Christ what else they have to show for Limited Edition DVD?), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1497043698739253250?s=20&amp;t=1bchtXQNwA8AKxjv1yk5EQ" target=_blank>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new video</a></b> shows us a glimpse of the Limited Edition footage of their live from last year, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1497226731261861888?s=20&amp;t=1bchtXQNwA8AKxjv1yk5EQ" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song</a></b> for her upcoming album is... kinda weird but I would say I'm liking it though, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/horieyui_staff/status/1497247519985704973?s=20&amp;t=1bchtXQNwA8AKxjv1yk5EQ" target=_blank>Horie Yui's new song preview</a></b> (unless you go for her radio show which has a longer... preview lmao) likes to play with us on melody so we can not have a perfect song to remember by lol please don't do this to me, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/mol_74/status/1493918105898450944?s=20&amp;t=1bchtXQNwA8AKxjv1yk5EQ" target=_blank>mol-74's new music video</a></b> and its usual style gives me hope of their upcoming album out next week actually so I'll jump right into that to be frank, celebrating her debut since 2005 (OMFG) <b><a href="https://twitter.com/nbc_anime_music/status/1364048585675915266?s=20&amp;t=1bchtXQNwA8AKxjv1yk5EQ" target=_blank>Kawada Mami's music video collection is up on YouTube</a></b> and boy do I have classics to recommend and it's not all just Anime, and last but not least <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1497860096423985158?s=20&amp;t=1bchtXQNwA8AKxjv1yk5EQ" target=_blank>miwa's new live video on YouTube</a></b> is more recent than ever showing off her music performances from her recent live tour which ended earlier this week. Last but not least because <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1497919174319824897?s=20&amp;t=3_mg2f4TNyKUgu9hYRhzBw" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's new single</a></b> will be for Anime "RikeKoi" season two, no surprises there. I mean, how can you be cuter than that, Ten-chan? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><br><br>So for next week, finally and finally, we are giving <b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> which I really hope besides her later than expected entrance in as Collection Artist (compared to her fellow TrySail members), we have <b>SHE's new single</b> and <b>ORESKABAND's new album</b> for quite a while I really hope it will be good we have heard the past couple of songs and they aren't bad, and from the above news paragraph we are also giving <b>mol-74's new album</b> which is probably their first out of indie times so these are stuff they came up with being in major for the past few years, so let's hope we have as much to give or even more compared to the previous releases since I've only given the one single last year? Yeah, we can do more mol-74 is uniquely nice to listen to, to be frank. I know many people won't be buying on it but Anime will keep them going haha major label power!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, next week is also quite a week for releases LET'S GO!!! lol<br><br><br><br><br> Oh yeah, forgot to mention it, but happy birthday today to let's see... Takahashi Rie aka Rieri because why wouldn't you want a lively girlfriend like her, Tachibana Rika-sama but we shall not talk too much about her since she's married, amongst a whole list of voice actresses who have their special day on this... special day somehow don't ask me why. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, no news about Rieri's fanclub renewal which I think I'll summarize it, being a member is buying a physical item last year in April when it started and whenever you buy it thereafter will expire the membership by end March so... now is definitely not the time to join, so I'm seeing when the next round of this is. Hey, I regretted that I missed a year of it, what can I say. Should've just written my name on your membership card or something. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Cya guys next time, and until next time... man February just came and left, but I can tell you for sure, the next month coming aka March 2022 is going to be so crazy, I may have to quit my job to receive packages lmao just joking remember my birthday present? The actual one? Haha yeah, it's coming. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Until next week.<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S.
