<div>Man, if you thought I haven't done anything bad this year, I'm reviewing TWO SINGLES from last year- Is this even legal? Haha I guess it isn't if it's all female vocalists that's all I give nowadays haha (Not true I give guys too they are just not in reviews somehow lol)</div><div><br></div><div>Hey, new year, new releases to talk about! Well, not exactly new, but we did go back for nostalgia trips with the recent full albums and best album(s) releases, so this is what I got out from all of that peak period from two weeks ago, I suppose. Still, a really good time to talk about Ryokuoushoku Shakai and Amamiya Sora again, and it's time I gave more recognition... half a year to two years later after things were released lmao</div><div><br></div><div>Just a note: This year onwards I'm not going to quantify ratings, so I'll just talk about what was normally in the brackets, of how adequate (In general since when was the last time I gave 5 stars off the bat) the songs were to be in my music library. Without further ado!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div id=TenVIPER><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq music"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Amamiya Sora - VIPER [Single]</div></blockquote><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=497 data-original-width=500 height=318 src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/10/SMCL-604.jpg width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=496 data-original-width=500 height=317 src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/12/SMCL-606.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table></div><div>(Black and white theme? This release has a serious lack of Ten-chan's favourite blue colour. Thanks for the close-up on the Regular Edition though, much appreciated)</div><div><br></div><div>Origin: This was a single from 2019, before the world was on fire and long before I knew Amamiya Sora will be releasing a best album to start this year. I've reviewed the single she started her solo music career with back in 2016 and many more along the years, we have been through three albums so far, it has been 5 years already and about time to release not one, but two best albums to celebrate the occasion. (One would argue one would be enough, since BLUE is her favourite colour so why was RED even there) I ended up giving one song from each album, and it happens that one of them returned from when it did not appear in the subsequent full album. Let's talk about what made me make the late decision to pick this up.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) VIPER</div><div>From first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"No that's not it, it's not like this</div><div style=text-align:center>Just hit me with more beauty</div><div style=text-align:center>Show me how you yearn (me) romantically BABY"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>If this song didn't bring you back half a century into the past, you aren't as into these feels as the guys who made this song, I tell you. The melody and style feels strangely retro but alluring in perspective, and you would not be wrong in thinking Ten-chan can handle such a style with much ease ever since they figured this out with their 4th single back in 2017. Ever since, they have been producing such songs for her in order to emphasize on her raw appeal, but also, because she can sing these as powerful as typical powerful songs that have dominated the Anime industry. Lyrics wise, they describe a weird yet romantic way of entrancing you into love, and I couldn't be more happier with this shy vocalist having to rehearse such words into my ears. This is just pure fanservice in style, in a nutshell. The music video only makes this song's style even more old yet romantic, for better or worse.</div><div>Rating: Enticingly Average</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Merry-go-round</div><div>From first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"Merry-go-round (that) never sleeps</div><div style=text-align:center>Crazily dancing within the cogwheel</div><div style=text-align:center>What overflows and falls down isn't tears</div><div style=text-align:center>Pranks on a whim</div><div style=text-align:center>Dance along with me</div><div style=text-align:center>No one knows when will be the ending"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>And as if you don't need enough allure, Ten-chan takes you on a ride upon a merry-go-round until you're sick with love you can't even think straight. But jokes aside, and ignoring the song title, this is her trying to get all the feels soft yet very, very tempting, and I can't believe they have made this. Maybe that is so which made me hesitate to give this song back then, but now that I find that appeal, I think I can live with the long bridge for this melody. The lyrics describe a whimsical evening out playing relating to a spinning merry-go-round, confusing yet still exciting, until we do not know if we are playing with Ten-chan or is it vice versa, but that is how they get you. It took me a while to get around this though, but I guess I found the ending by giving this lovely yet vicious combination.</div><div>Rating: Confusingly Below Average</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: This is still a nice single to listen to. If you haven't fully experienced the beauty and especially allure of Amamiya Sora, you're welcome to pick up this release to have a touch of it for yourselves. For fans though, this is just another treat, and I hope all of us have had their fill for there will never be an end to this for my dear, dear appealing princess. And that is why turning 180 degrees around powerful songs is always for the better, and this has proven that point.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>OKAY IDOLISM OVER LET'S GO MAINSTREAM BOYS!! lol sorry Ten-chan but I gotta</div><div id=RyokuShakaLITMUS><br><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq music"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Ryokuoushoku Shakai - LITMUS [Single]</div></blockquote><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=710 data-original-width=800 height=284 src=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70007000/70007781/images/202108021401550.jpg width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=800 data-original-width=800 height=320 src=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70007000/70007781/images/202108021401551.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table><br></div><div>(If you can't recognize from the cover, that is most undoubtedly vocalist Nagata Haruko and her beautiful face)</div><div><br></div><div>Origin: Wow where should I even start, and this is literally what long time fans should be proud of. Though I would argue, when I knew of them in 2017 when they were still indie, Ryokuoushoku Shakai a.k.a. RyokuShaka (a combination of the words, if you notice, of the "green yellow society") were still young and I mean it when I say the bassist was 19 back then, and they hit me with the one song from their 2nd mini-album. Since then, I've been following them and their generic pop style has not disappointed. The gains in popularity that many have witnessed also brought them into mainstream as they later turned into major label literally a year after I knew of them, and have been dishing out masterpieces ever since. This release in itself is a great exhibition of what was of them and how going major only made them better as they show how they can go from emotional to happy to consoling with their music.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) LITMUS</div><div>From first chorus:</div><div style=text-align:center></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"How dare you</div><div style=text-align:center>How much do (you) think (I) have thought of you</div><div style=text-align:center>(It's) Litmus paper just holding over (to you)</div><div style=text-align:center>Nevertheless, I still</div><div style=text-align:center>Stayed by your side"</div></blockquote><div style=text-align:center></div><div>Everyone has a secret, they say. Much is hinted about what the lyrics meant in such a mellow yet emotional tune, and I think they tell a strong story of hesitation with still a strong desire for love. That is what this song had to be when I first heard of it, apart from of course being a drama theme song, this melody is as expressive as it is also kind of sad in a sense, and that is the level of obvious yet complicated emotion RyokuShaka likes to create in their songs, this is a good example of it. It's this level of professional writing coupled with an excellent tune that will leave a good impression, in my opinion.</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xpP0dmoy8s title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Professionally Above Average</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Are You Ready</div><div>From first chorus:</div><div style=text-align:center></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"I chose you</div><div style=text-align:center>I wanted you</div><div style=text-align:center>I loved this world that has not even started</div><div style=text-align:center>(We) can reach (it)</div><div style=text-align:center>Whatever the future holds with you alongside (me)"</div></blockquote><div style=text-align:center></div><div>Are you ready? Because if this song didn't immediately get you with their lively and catchy introduction, I can't suggest anything better than this. This song will immediately get anyone with the mood to listen to this, and take on a journey to what joyful RyokuShaka has to offer. It has lyrics full of hope and desire, it has a lovely melody which got stuck in my brain for months especially the intro because it's so hard to forget to be honest, and the duo-like background chorus only made it the topping on this delicious cake. You do not really need anything else besides this song... and them talking about being with a certain someone, but let's not think too much into that if you don't have one. It's still a good one though, they got me.</div><div style=text-align:center><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tuf7boOx_SE title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div><div>Rating: Excitingly Above Average</div><div><br></div><div>(3) Korekara no Koto, Sorekara no Koto [From Now On, From Then On]</div><div>From the first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"Then again, thinking about (it) fine or not, I guess?</div><div style=text-align:center>Lamenting about the past feels so stupid I just realized</div><div style=text-align:center>From now on, from here on</div><div style=text-align:center>The things (I did) with you, the things with you"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>I think it's just me who did not give this song initially mainly because despite the differences in the tunes and lyrics, the style of this band is rather standard, so I ended up not giving this due to it having a weaker melody with a longer verse and chorus. Coming in from a project who serves to write a song dedicated to one of their fans for their youth, it did not bring in a keen impression for me when I watched the video. Months later without the video though, I can hear more clearly the emotions on the melody and style once again, and have learnt to appreciate this song more. The lyrics and song written by band image and vocalist Nagata Haruko did make this quite a tease to listen to though, and as much as it had its imperfections, it did convey a sense of hope and honest feelings with the power of people around you to go through life. The song is also catchy similar to the previous track, and I must say it would be a good song if not being stacked against the other two more easy-listening songs.</div><div>Rating: Specially Above Average</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: I still question myself at this point on how I did not give this single sooner. Considering I took them in thinking they are all good songs but from different points in time, I do not know if the lack of mood even just six months ago may have veered my decision to give this the get go. Maybe so, but now that it has all come together, I recall and rejoice on one of the bands I've seen grown from indie to major and from here on, it will only be better. I could not recommend more this pop band of the new generation, as they will throw you more brilliant songs than you can ever desire for. Take my word for it and give them a listen.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5JXA-HGMv9tw-laz4OFrHEKcYy3Do9sWpz2YwOCle2KCUSRQQbvBYST70ibVtCjWL49_vjdKj6ftteMAuo1xv5pmM2YOb6G9as9BSv7ieSl-LvEMnuZFlFdx7GHlmKJnmwycIM7mrCuwbl6hbzi62AsGCC2OoCBYdCAmQFp8F6J-YHA/s320/PXL_20220215_123347397.jpg width=320></div><div><br></div><div>Okay I double checked again from the official website, and yes, they didn't put the B-side of Ten-chan's single in the 3rd album released the year after.

Yep, in case you thought this didn't come with a special gift, oh yeah they do. This is also precisely why I had to buy from a separate online store even though technically they are under the same corporate umbrella so thanks Sony Music Japan for burning my shipping money lol. What the special gift was though, now that I see it myself I think I truly regret it already lol, was a special sticker of one of the members. From the image... it's vocalist Nagata Haruko right? Or does it look like peppe-san? I have no way to compare and they look similar haha I assume it's just Haruko-chan though I googled it it's just all her in these special gifts lol</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkYOHTKUby1pWnguv6vsmbgb-kvzLXh2ydOasi_j8ToLTpQtIADXYc0DO2ud3vFAYMAnrkTRywATlIVK0YGZDl0guoCTBFTjeaKvuwNQydAN9I6kJpEXkGZJnEJ34qE9SeY_GyI8g8SIq5VKdh7iyXnVkNNHrIbSb9AurPEeWvHdvk_A/s320/PXL_20220215_124534397.jpg width=320></div><div><br></div>What is also included though, and I think I did hear from this long before, was an excerpt of one of the band member's secrets inside the booklet of the release. I got one of the dudes so welp haha but you get the idea, it's just a way to relate to the topic song of the release, as mentioned in the review above. A nice touch, I would say it's a good idea to let us learn a little more about them.<div><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDxbDSJp1bdzowQtz4za4XfIQAQ0GVAcMhGruHbsfWvtmKjiA7RKyoETPRR6aTW1UW0pjVi6D_TB1PBqFM3x-zzYkNHsvgju6Fn1hCnhiXwo2sO7IfeqcFedbPYUwG374WtBHvsal8MwgL1L2ZIk-929nF6gEQNEQ8IhdhinJ4PQq7TQ/s320/PXL_20220215_124749723.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>LOL dude you wanted to confess to a girl in your first year in elementary school?
