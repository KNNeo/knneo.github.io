It's going to take a toll sometime, and I tell myself to not go along with procrastination, so here we are. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> The next paragraph will cover the details, but suffice it to say if you didn't get what this means it's adequately explained in <a href=../../2017/12/the-klassic-note-searching-stars.html>Part 1</a> of this short series where I explore the artists I may have ignored or not, and find out how they are today. Spoilers: Many have disbanded due to lack of popularity (and sales, of course).<br><br>I'll try to cover as many as I can, excluding the artists whom I've given in 2017. The list shall follow the one from Hall of Fame (if you don't know that's a thing yet go to the <a href=https://klassicnote.strikingly.com/ target=_blank>Official Website</a>), and shall be done in the following 5W1H format: [unless stated otherwise, in square brackets]<br><ul><li><b>Who</b> are they, in English/Romaji [in Japanese]<li><b>What</b> was their best impression thus far/back then [One Hit Wonder - only impression]<li><b>When</b> I started, and with what song<li><b>Where</b> did it get lost, if I did [Active Artist - constantly giving songs]<li><b>Why</b> I will still care [One Hit Wonder - don't care; Disbanded - care, but gone before I can]<li><b>How</b> are they doing now: The good, the bad, and whatever applies to them as of 2017</ul>[*Information accurate as of 2017.12.16]<br><br><br>sphere<br><ul><li>Voice actress idol group focusing on Anime songs (which has become a trend today)<li>It's hard to pick because Collection Artist in Klassic Note and they have been consistently good<li>Started in 2009, with "Future Stream" opening theme song for Anime "Hatsukoi Limited."<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care because... the songs, maybe? The unison isn't particularly unique, but the songs always get me, and that's a good thing.<li>There are going to be on hiatus starting next year to "prepare for their 10th anniversary" in 2019 apparently, but in 2017 they have released their 5th album and another single to transit into hiatus</ul>Flat Three<br><ul><li>Jazz duo which started in 2004 with three members<li>It's the only song I gave too<li>Started in 2009, with "Everyday Life feat. Misa Sugiyama", on their major debut album<li>I never really started, actually<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>Their last official Tweet online was in 2011, their official website is not obsolete... you get the meaning</ul>Kalafina<br><ul><li>Anime-based vocal group consisting of three members covering bass, alto and soprano singing<li>Their best impression must be the beginning where they sang for Anime "Kara no Kyoukai", and also between 2010-2011 period too<li>Started in 2009 with "Lacrimosa", ending theme song for Anime "Kuroshitsuji"<li>[Active Artist?]<li>I still care because of their unique formation, and it's all because of the one composer who has been behind them all this while, Kajiura Yuki-sensei. With the right songs (so long as it's not Anime song) they never fail to amaze me with the diversity and power of vocals.<li>They have been consistently releasing new songs, considering they are Anime artists. However, I've not been giving a lot of songs in the past few years, much to disappointment. They released two singles and two live video compilations in 2017.</ul>marble<br><ul><li>Anime pop duo which also focuses on writing "organic pop" songs<li>Their best impression has got to be the ending theme for Anime "Hidamari Sketch" called "Ryuusei Record"<li>Started in 2009 with "Hatsukoi limited" from Anime of the same title<li>I stopped because they have only been singing Anime songs? And after that their original releases aren't that interesting for me to keep up with anyway.<li>I don't really care as their style came to me as simple if not for the beautification that is Anime songs, but other than that they didn't seem to catch me with simple melodies, despite that being an easy criteria in Klassic Note<li>They have disbanded as of 2014 after their 4th album in 2013, and have thus gone their own ways since then</ul>OGRE YOU ASSHOLE<br><ul><li>Rock band focusing on rather niche genres, playing on alternative and psychedelic rock<li>Their best impression was also the first song I gave them<li>Started in 2009 with "Pinhole", as heard from "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION 2009"<li>I stopped mainly because of their weird style, and it somehow did not get me at all, despite desperation of trying to find new melodies and styles, unfortunately<li>I will still care if they would write more normal songs back in their early days which I have given quite a couple of releases from, but from 2011 after they have changed styles and label company they focused on a rather deterring music style, which made me back off<li>They are still fairly active in the industry, and I've given them an album review in 2016 with two songs in the list. That was also their latest original release. In 2017 they released a remix single and a live album.</ul>Primary<br><ul><li>Anime indie artist group focusing in yuiko, not to be confused with Korean singer-songwriter<li>Her best impression is from 2014 with single "fragile garden"<li>Started in 2009 with her 2nd album song "Fix"<li>I kind of ignored her for some time because I felt she was singing Anime songs like many other artists, and her simple melodies with limited flaws seemed to have deterred me from giving any more songs after 2009<li>I still care for the music created by backed up composer Meis Clauson and sung by the unique vocalist yuiko. The combination focusing on simplicity and making indie compositions sound great is a rarity in Klassic Note<li>She is still fairly active in Anime conventions, releasing mini-albums typically each year to supply new songs to doujinshi fans. She also released her best album which covers the songs she sang from 2005 to 2013, and that's pretty long for an indie artist</ul>SCANDAL<br><ul><li>Four-piece rock band which has gained international fame over the past decade<li>Their best impression to turn me over was like from a single in 2010 "Taiyou to Kimi ga Egaku STORY"<li>Started in 2009 with Anime "BLEACH" opening theme song "Shoujo S"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care because ever since 2014 they have transited to a self-composing band, not relying on other composers to write the songs for them but passing the job to all members, mainly focused on MAMI the guitarist<li>They are very active in the industry, conducting lives all over the world (including the country I live in) and releasing new singles regularly. In 2017 they released another best album and a digital single, which I did not give, surprisingly.</ul>Nakagawa Shoko<br><ul><li>Solo artist focusing on pop and Anime songs sometimes<li>Her best impression was also the first song I gave her<li>Started in 2009 with "Kirei.a.la.Mode"<li>I kind of stopped because in regular Anime fashion, she may be too generic besides her unique voice.<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>She is still fairly active, but less of music instead focusing on drama and production on the back-end. Her latest original album was in 2014 and she collaborated multiple times with Anime, notably in Klassic Note 2015 with Denpagumi Inc. with single "PUNCH LINE"</ul>Tomatsu Haruka<br><ul><li>Voice actress, Anime idol and soloÂ music artist<li>Her best impression is likely from Anime "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun" where she acts as main girl and sings opening theme song "Q&amp;A Recital!"<li>Started in 2009 with Anime "Kannagi" opening theme song "motto Hade ni Ne!"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care because as her unique voice as voice actress has gained her experience in singing, and with great songs it really brings out her character. Outside of Anime, she performs well too with music given to her, so that is a plus.<li>She is still active ever since her best albums in 2016, and in 2017 she released a single for Anime "PriPri Chii-chan" ending theme song</ul>Asai Kenichi<br><ul><li>Rock solo artist, song producer<li>His best impression is also likely the next impression he gave after I delved into him a bit, called "Bad Strawberries"<li>Started in 2009 with Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "Mad Surfer"<li>I kind of took a step back not because of his laid back rock style, but more of I can't find good melodies inside his lists. Also, his English is terrible in the songs he sings.<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>He is still fairly active as artist and producer, but transitioned from solo to combined with a backup band I assume, releasing new songs from 2016 with THE INTERCHANGE KILLS. They have released a new album in 2017</ul>Toyosaki Aki<br><ul><li>Voice actress, solo music artist focusing on soothing tunes<li>Her best impression is likely the first song too, I guess. Other than that, from 2009 "SHUN PU" is a close second. And then everything else right behind haha<li>Started in 2009 with single "love your life"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care because I liked her unique voice as voice actress, and coupled with soothing songs written by mostly infamous composers, she is having a time of her life in music, and so am I. I mean, her only music release which was not on the shelf is her 2nd single. That's it.<li>She is fairly active in the industry. In 2017 she released one single and a best album which I both reviewed</ul>Tsuji Shion<br><ul><li>Singer-songwriter who focuses on generic pop songs<li>Her best impression has got to be from her 2009 single "Hoshii Mono"<li>Started in 2009 with Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "Sky chord ~Otona ni Naru Kimi e~"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care because she doesn't have widespread popularity, and her own composition style is favoured in Klassic Note, seeing as how I have came back to review her first album in 2010 the second time in 2012 which places it on the shelf<li>She is still active as a music artist, even though she releases songs less often than most artists out there. Her latest release was in 2016 where she released her 2nd album</ul>PEâ€™Z<br><ul><li>Jazz band, focusing on instrumental pieces mainly<li>Their best impression was from their 2010 release "1.2.MAX"<li>Started in 2010 with album "1.2.MAX", before that knew them from collaboration group "pe'zmoku"<li>I somehow did not faithfully follow them despite liking their tunes, but I guess it's up to me then, to not favour their style I guess<li>[Disbanded]<li>They have disbanded after their album in 2013, and have split into H ZETTRIO led by H ZETT M (also known as the band's keyboardist Hiizumi Masayuki) ever since their official disbandment in 2015 after their 15th anniversary</ul>angela<br><ul><li>Anime pop duo consisting of atsuko as vocals and KATSU as guitarist<li>Their best impression was also the first song I gave them<li>Started in 2010 with Anime "Seitokai Yakuindomo" ending theme song "Aoi Haru"<li>Since they were Anime-related their songs have to be of some standard, which at many a times not what I wanted as I remember them better for their wacky, happy and lively tunes<li>I still care because of Anime. That's pretty much it I can't give any other reason<li>They are still active in the Anime industry, writing songs for other groups and singing songs for their own group too. In 2017 they released a single for Anime "Aho Girl" and are planning to release an album by the end of the year. (OMG it's next week??)</ul>ClariS<br><ul><li>Anime pop duo born out of the Internet platform Niconico focusing on mainly Anime songs<li>Their best impression is still likely their first song. Then again there are many great tunes down the long road since they are Collection Artist in Klassic Note<li>Started in 2010 with Anime "Oreimo" opening theme song "irony"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care (despite all the change in recent years, see below) because of production. Since the Anime songs that they sing aren't written by them and are by a range of spectacular composers, we still get to hear great tunes with any singing duo combination, I would say<li>Since original member Alice departure into further education (and never came back) in 2014, it has been replaced with Karen and along with Clara (thus the original name of the duo) continued to sing more songs for Anime. They revealed their real identity many years after going anonymous in 2017, releasing a full album and two singles from Anime "Eromanga-sensei" and "Monogatari" series respectively.</ul>miwa<br><ul><li>Singer-songwriter popular in mainstream pop music in Japan<li>Her best impression till now is probably still from 2012 single "Hikari e"<li>Started in 2010 with single "Little girl"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care because I wanted to hear more from her. Sadly with her transition of music style she sings a lot more beat-based tunes now compared to the past her which focused on melodic tunes<li>She is a very active artist in the music industry. In 2017 she released her 5th album which I reviewed and two singles which I did not review because of the reasons I mentioned earlier</ul>SPYAIR<br><ul><li>Four-piece rock band mainly doing alternative and mainstream punk rock<li>Their best impression is probably still from their 2009 single titled "Just Like This"<li>Started in 2010 with single "Last Moment", also Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song<li>I kind of ignored them for some years because of their style, their melodies tend to be unappealing over time as it feels like they are singing different melodies with the exact same style. This has since changed over the year which brought attention back on them.<li>I still care because they still sound unique, they can come up with good emotional tunes, and their style is powerful and strong especially in consistency, unlike many bands<li>They are still active because I reviewed their singles over the past couple of years. In 2017 they released two singles and an album which I've reviewed all and gave positive feedback in Klassic Note</ul>Kotobuki Minako<br><ul><li>Voice actress, idol and solo music artist, maybe lyricist?<li>Her best impressions are mainly on the journey to her first album, from "Liliac" in her debut single to 2nd single "Startline" to first album topic song "STRIDE"<li>Started in 2010 with single "Shiny+"<li>I kind of relaxed on her because of compositions. As I always emphasise, the songs written (not from her) determine how good she can sound, and in these few years it has not been promising.<li>I still care because I want her usual rock style music back. As much as I want it, it always comes back disappointing. That doesn't mean I don't want more, because Mina-chan still sounds great with music<li>She is less active than many idol artists out there, to be honest. Her 3rd album is schedule to release early next year, after two singles from 2016 which I did not care much about</ul><br><br>=======LIGHTNING ROUND!!=======<br>T.M.Revolution<br><ul><li>Musician, solo singer-songwriter, producer, among many other roles<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>He is doing well in solo and in collaborations with others. You guys probably know of his collaboration with Mizuki Nana in 2013. His latest singles were dated back in 2016 and has also actively been writing songs for others</ul>Diggy-MO'<br><ul><li>Singer, MC, composer for pop and hip-hop music<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>In 2017 he released an original album, and since 2010 has been fairly active in music production and performance after changing record labels in 2014</ul>The GazettE<br><ul><li>Visual kei rock band consisting of five members<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>Their latest single and album are dated back in 2016 and 2015 respectively, and they have been active in live performance ever since</ul>universe<br><ul><li>Five-piece rock band<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>They have announced permanent hiatus in 2016 after mini-albums dated back in 2011-2012</ul>Kimura Kaela<br><ul><li>Solo singer, model<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>She is fairly active in the music industry. Her latest solo album was dated back in 2016. She has also been actively collaborating to create groups to sing songs with credit to the entertainment industry</ul>Matsushita Yuuya<br><ul><li>J-Pop, R&amp;B singer<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>He's active in the industry because I see his name often after giving the one song in 2010. He has since then continued a couple of years before stopping his solo activity in 2014 and forming a four-man group named "X4"</ul>Tamura Yukari<br><ul><li>Long time Anime solo artist, voice actress<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>She is fairly active as a senior member in the voice acting and Anime music industry, and has not been releasing many songs in hopes of letting newer generation take place. She has transitioned to another persona by the name of "Kagurazaka Yuka" after a live video release in 2013, and has since changed label and produced more songs under the new persona. Her previous name is still used, but less often and for Anime purposes, most notably in collaboration with rapper motsu in 2010</ul>=====END OF LIGHTNING ROUND=====<br><br><br>Aimer<br><ul><li>Solo artist, singer-songwriter for pop songs and Anime<li>Her best impression is likely from single "Akanesasu"<li>Started in 2011 with "Re:pray" as Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care because of the unique style given to her by many Anime composers mainly, and that she expresses them in a different way compared to many others which makes her special in Anime theme song performance<li>She is active in the music industry. In 2017 she releases her first duo best album compilation after four singles from 2016 and one after that, and is also releasing yet another single in early 2018.</ul>ALTIMA<br><ul><li>Anime synth pop trio created as a collaboration with rapper motsu, Kurosaki Maon and fripSide composer Sat<li>Best impression is still likely the first song I gave<li>From 2011, with ending theme song "I'll believe" for Anime "Shakugan no Shana III"<li>I didn't give much attention after their first album because most of the styles are not melodic, and aren't as good as their Anime credited tunes<li>[Disbanded]<li>They announced their disbandment in yearly Anime event Anisama in 2016 on their 5th year anniversary, and before that have not released many songs after their first album in 2012</ul>fumika<br><ul><li>Pop singer, sometimes lyricist<li>Best impression are most of the emotional songs she sings, which is pretty much every song<li>From 2011, with Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "Aoi Tori"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I still care because she's one of a kind. Her strong singing voice, the music written for her with great impact and emotion... everything fits her identity so well<li>Ever since her departure from major label in ~2013, she started her solo career once again, releasing two albums under the transition already. In 2017 she released two singles both of which I have reviewed, with the latest dated in late November. She's slated to release another single in 2018.</ul>LAMA<br><ul><li>Four-piece group focusing on electronic and pop music<li>Their best impression is likely from their 2011 single "Cupid"<li>Started in 2011 with Anime "UN-GO" ending theme song "Fantasy"<li>I didn't give much attention after this even though they did release an album and I did listen to it I think but after that they have gone quiet<li>[Disbanded]<li>After their latest album dated back in 2012, the group have then focused on their solo activities, mostly doing their own stuff but as far as their Twitter accounts show one of them is from band "agraph" so you can check that out, the other two are doing DJ and composition, and the other runs a fashion line?</ul>LITTLE CREATURES<br><ul><li>Three-piece band who write alternative music based on pop and rock styles<li>Their best impression is also the only impression<li>Started in 2011 with "The Sand Cage"<li>Gone quiet before I could inquire further<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>This one is a little interesting. They have been attending lives irregularly since their album release in 2011 which is also their 20th anniversary (of which I reviewed their tribute album) and since then built up rapport with the fans, likely leading up a new song released in 2015, nearly 5 years since their last release, and a full album in 2016.</ul>NICO Touches The Walls<br><ul><li>Four-piece rock band which dabbles in alternative and post rock styles<li>Their best impression is also likely the first song given to them<li>Started in 2011 with "Tenchi Gaeshi"<li>I was rather reluctant in giving their songs because despite the punch they give in their songs their melodies typically aren't quite likable for me, to say the least<li>I care because these guys can make good songs, whether it's emotional or powerful, and will continue to do so as long as they can keep it up<li>NICO is fairly active in the industry, as seen from yearly live events and rock festivals. In 2017, they released their live video performance from their album in 2016 and has recently in December 2017 released an E.P.</ul>School Food Punishment<br><ul><li>Four-member rock band focused on mainly electronic rock and sometimes pop rock<li>Their best impression is also likely the first song that was given<li>Started in 2011 with Anime "C" ending theme song "RPG"<li>[Disbanded]<li>I care because I liked their style, and slowly as I direct into giving more electronic songs, I'm even relieving myself of giving sub-par melodies due to how well the songs are presented<li>In 2012 they announced their disbandment following vocalist Uchimura Yumi's leaving of the group. As far as I know composer of the group Hideaki moved on to write more songs for Anime and idol artists, and Yumi apparently got affiliated to another band named "la la larks" from 2012, focusing on producing Anime songs and releasing new songs from 2014 even till today. Masayuki moved on to form siraph which produces dance and electronic songs from 2016 with vocalist Annabel, if some of you find her name familiar.</ul>UNLIMITS<br><ul><li>Four-piece rock band focusing on generic rock styles<li>Their best impression is likely still their first song in Klassic Note<li>Started in 2011 with Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "Haruka Kanata"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I care because I like their generic rock style, and they never surprise to release new songs which I can sink into, especially considering everyone today sings generic rock music<li>They have been inactively releasing new albums, but steadily, while performing lives everywhere in Japan, to say the least. Their latest album is dated 2016 called "U"</ul><br><br>=======LIGHTNING ROUND!=======<br>ROOKiEZ is PUNK'D<br><ul><li>Three piece rock band focusing on pop rock and alternative rock with heavy tunes<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>They are still fairly active today. 2016 marks their 10th anniversary and its lives and before that they released two singles in 2015.</ul>ViViD<br><ul><li>Five piece pop rock band focusing on hard rock<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>They have been fairly active until their announcement on disbandment in 2015. Their last album is dated in early 2014.</ul>Tokumaru Shugo<br><ul><li>Singer-songwriter mostly doing pop and rock songs<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>I've only heard him through "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION" so I won't say I've followed him much since then. As a veteran in the industry he is still writing songs for other artists as well as releasing his own songs once in a while. His latest album is dated 2016 and released from the same label company OGRE YOU ASSHOLES resides today.</ul>Sasaki Sayaka<br><ul><li>Anime song artist, singer<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>She has since changed her style quite a bit after 2011, leading to more powerful tunes and whatever Anime throws at her apparently. Her latest album is released in 2017.</ul>Isobe Masafumi<br><ul><li>Singer, guitarist, sometimes songwriter<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>Same here I've not heard him since "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION" and he has not released new songs since 2012</ul><div>=====END OF LIGHTNING ROUND=====</div><div><br></div><br>Natural High<br><ul><li>Two piece jazz pop group<li>Their best impression is likely from the same release as the first song, from Anime "Bartender" called "Hajimari no Hito"<li>Started in 2011 with Anime "Bartender" theme songs "Bartender/Hajimari no Hito"<li>[Disbanded]<li>I cared because I liked their music style, soft and still jazzy sometimes, making it the perfect kind of music to thrive, much to disappointment though<li>They disbanded in 2008, and yes I reviewed their released only after their disbandment which makes it even sadder how such a music group can be so unpopular. They have gone quiet since.</ul>negoto<br><ul><li>Four-piece pop group focusing on electronic pop and dance pop sometimes<li>Their best impression is from a 2012 single also with an Anime tie-in called "sharp #"<li>Started in 2011 with "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION" included song "Sukitooru Shodou"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I care because their style is still a bit unusual, despite being unique in the industry, which makes them best for making whatever type of music they want since they will always stand out in the crowd<li>2017 marks their 10th anniversary as this is the only year too for them to release two full albums within a year and a single with movie tie-in which is on the shelf</ul>Hyadain<br><ul><li>Singer-songwriter, vocalist in a persona sometimes with a female counterpart "Hyadaruko"<li>His best impression is likely from 2013 single "Warai Kamisama ga Orite Kita"<li>Started in 2011 with Anime "Nichijou" opening theme song "Hyadain no Kakakata Kataomoi-C"<li>It sort of faded away as soon as it started since Hyadain was just part of the artist's persona (will be explained below) to incorporate duo singing which was rather popular in recent decades, and since that has not came out in recent years, I just gave up on listening to his solo tunes<li>I care because the duo thing is really good, and his compositions made sure to distribute the effort such that the chorus and individual parts are memorable and as attention-grabbing as possible<li>Hyadain, better known as Maeyamada Kenichi, is an Anime composer for theme songs and for other artists. Plenty of unique styles in Anime songs are likely written by him. His persona as Hyadain kind of died of around 2014 where he focused on composition but before that released a couple of singles featuring only himself in the songs and also one with rock band Base Ball Bear</ul>Kawano Marina<br><ul><li>Anime artist, singer, sometimes lyricist and songwriter<li>Her best impression is likely still her first song<li>Started in 2011 with Anime "A Channel" opening theme song "Morning Arch"<li>It faded away mostly due to her inactivity in the music industry and leaving major label after her first album back in 2013<li>I kind of care, but not really, since inactivity in Klassic Note just means I won't be able to give more songs anyway, which heavily depends on who's writing the songs for you, considering she doesn't do much of it herself<li>After her major debut and album release in 2013, she moved on to the baseball industry to be an entertainer as she has vested interest in the sport. In 2017 released a limited edition single which was also written in support for baseball in general</ul>AZUMA HITOMI<br><ul><li>Singer-songwriter focusing on dance pop tunes<li>Her best impression was from single "Kira Kira"<li>Started in 2011 with Anime "Fractale" opening theme song "Harinezumi"<li>[Inactive Artist - She didn't release new ones so it got lost]<li>I cared back then because I wanted to hear more melodies from her, considering she's a pretty good composer back then<li>Today she does plenty of DJ rock as far as I know, releases songs outside of major label and Anime most notably one mini-album in 2014, collaborates with other artists in shows and programs mainly, is involved in a band "Hello,Wendy!", and is now doing a feedback program or sorts with Niitsu Yui (YUI from RYTHEM)</ul>Choucho<br><ul><li>Anime singer, sometimes lyricist herself<li>Her best impression has got to be the first song given to her<li>Started in 2012 with Anime "Hyouka" opening theme song "Yasashisa no Riyuu"<li>It kind of got lost once you know she's an Anime artist and this heavily relies on composers giving her good songs typically<li>I don't care that much because as an Anime artist... (see above point)<li>She is still fairly active in the Anime music industry. I've given her another single from Anime "Glasslip" in 2014 (man that show sucks lol) and as of 2017 has released three singles and is slated to release a new album early 2018</ul>Dr.DOWNER<br><ul><li>Four piece rock band focusing on quick tempo and generic rock<li>Their best impression was from the first song given<li>Started in 2012 with "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION" included song "Rainbow"<li>They have been rather inactive after 2012 so I didn't follow them since<li>I cared because I like the style I hear, and I've given a couple of songs from their album back in 2013<li>They have been relatively quiet these few years after their shift toward a three-piece band. In 2014 they released an EP and in 2016 they released a new song as digital single</ul>QUATTRO<br><ul><li>Five piece rock band focused on alternative rock and post modern styles<li>Their best impression was from a mini-album in 2012 titled "Loyal Isolation"<li>Started in 2012 with "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION" included song "Hodoketa Kutsuhimo"<li>I wanted to care, but they didn't produce more<li>I cared because I liked what I hear, to be very honest, and after listening to their releases in 2012 most memorably end of year mini-album "Capital", I wanted to hear more<li>If you try to find them every year online, you'll not be able to find much results, so I'll help you out. They have been inactive ever since 2012, and their last known live performance and single release was in 2014 (according to their Facebook page) which is pretty much it. They announced their disbandment in 2015.</ul>sunday morning bell<br><ul><li>Five piece pop rock band<li>Their best impression is likely from their album topic song "WAGON"<li>Started in 2012 with "electric" which can be found on Audioleaf.com<li>[Disbanded]<li>I cared because I wanted to hear more, despite their indie style and kind of off-beat tunes, they still sounded great together as an indie band back then<li>Today, they have came back to release new songs and are prepared to release a new album in 2018</ul>YUKI<br><ul><li>Singer-songwriter<li>Her best impression is probably still from a single in 2012 titled "Play Ball"<li>Started in 2012 with Anime "Sakamichi no Apollon" opening theme song "Sakamichi no Melody"<li>I kind of closed up on her after 2012 for some time because I don't really like her singing voice, and many a times she presents me with really weird melodies, to which I cannot comprehend but only give up<li>I cared recently because I think she has potential going back to sing simple, palatable melodies because that's what Klassic Note is also about<li>She is active in the industry, celebrating her 15th anniversary recently. In 2017 she released if I'm not wrong, 2 singles and an original album, with tie-in to Anime "Sangatsu no Lion"</ul>Taketatsu Ayana<br><ul><li>Voice actress, idol and Anime singer<li>Her best impression is probably her most popular song describing her meat-eating fave, "Rice To Meat You"<li>Started in 2012 with debut single "Sinfonia! Sinfonia!!"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I care because... well half of it is for the idol purposes, but just like all other voice actor-based singers they all have great singing voices, so why not? Besides, I only give when the melody is good.<li>She just released her best album in 2017, soon after two singles and an original album in 2016. She is also poised for another single release in 2018 which will be her second tie-in (third overall) with Anime "Dagashi Kashi"</ul>Hanazawa Kana<br><ul><li>Voice actress, idol and Anime singer focused on retro pop styles, sometimes lyricist<li>Her latest and best impression was from 2016 single "Zarazara" written by Hata Motohiro<li>Started in 2012 with debut single "Hoshizora Destination"<li>[Active Artist]<li>I care because I anticipate songs written by others for her, other than the regular Aniplex (which is the music label she is under) producer Kitagawa Katsutoshi<li>In 2017 she released an original album and is preparing for another single in 2018 written by one of Ikimonogakari's composers Mizuno Yoshiki</ul><br>=======LIGHTNING ROUND!!=======<br>Hata Motohiro<br><ul><li>Singer-songwriter<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>It was close back then when I was trying to give Anime Movie "Kotonoha no Niwa" theme song, but that slipped by. That was in 2013, soon after I gave the only song in 2012. Since these, he has been fairly active in releasing new songs almost every year (his latest single is dated 2017, latest album 2015), and has also been actively writing songs for others. (Hanazawa Kana's 2016 single "Zarazara")</ul>Kugimiya Rie<br><ul><li>Voice actress, one time idol singer<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>Well, it was the only one that she got to perform with this mini-album back in 2012, so that's pretty much it because there aren't any comebacks since then</ul>AiRI<br><ul><li>Anime singer<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>She is still singing new songs for Anime, to no surprise. However, it's not as active as all the others. Her latest album is dated July 2014 and her latest single October 2016</ul>Kodama Saori<br><ul><li>Anime singer, songwriter and producer<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>It's been ten years since her last solo single, so doing it for Anime "Hyouka" seems to be an exception. Since 2002 though she has been actively doing music production for a variety of artists, mostly lyricist if I'm not wrong</ul>Piko<br><ul><li>Anime singer who is actually male, in case you think he's female<li>[One Hit Wonder]<li>He has slightly changed his image after releasing his latest single back in 2015, and is ready for a comeback, though I cannot see what is it about. According to his official Twitter (because his website is under maintenance I assume) he released a digital single very recently in December 2017, which likely means he'll come back in the following year.</ul>=====END OF LIGHTNING ROUND=====<br><br><br><br>This is it guys. Stay tuned for Part 3 <strike>next</strike>Â later this week as I try to keep up with the pace. Yes, I'll make sure to release it on time by the end of the week, I promise. Which means I need to get going earlier instead of doing it in the weekend only. Oh well, there goes my final year project lol.
