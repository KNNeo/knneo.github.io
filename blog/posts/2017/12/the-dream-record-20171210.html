Hey. This is what happens if you take afternoon naps haha<br><br>Okay, I'll be quick on this one. To be honest, I thought of whether to do this one especially from that nap just now, and too much was happening. It's also one of those eureka moments I'd rather keep to use it on something (<span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span> APoL) but I think sharing it is more fun. Besides, there's references, so I can openly talk about it. Also, I don't want to put the notes I just took in Entertainment News. (Remember I write these down immediately after waking up? Not this one) So yeah, let's get started.<br><br><br>(As usual brackets represent my comments)<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq>"Story goes that there's this detective called 'Marstin' - derived from "Mars" in the name "Martin", is helping to solve an illegitimate child case involving a rich person's kid who might have biological parents who have came to seek Marstin for assistance. He agreed to help but the situation is as follows: The kid is known by the parents from a news broadcast of the kid involved in a serious accident, and is currently residing in a private doctor who sets shop on the middle of the town square. Setting is 19th century Europe for reference. However the place only allows male visitors for some reason - from doctors to workers to guards - and only so permission is only allowed in a case by case basis. The brainstorming appears in sight to reveal the couple mashed in together after a couple of iterations of disguise to reveal two guys instead of a male and female.</blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq>"If that's the case we can go in as a gay couple!" (sorry, everyone)Â </blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq>A couple of guys with crooked backs stand at the entrance of the shop in the middle of the night, dressed in untidy black suits standing in front of the door with a couple of guards. They request assistance to enter to visit the kid as they are distant relatives or something. The guard tells them to wait, walks into the large empty room onto behind a wall on the right - which can be totally seen from the outside despite the lack of lighting indoors besides where the guard is - and converses with supposedly the victim. He stops his words, looks back at the couple and shakes his head. The couple leave in sadness.Â </blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq>They then come back dressed as paramedics wheeling an injured person lying on his back on a stretcher. The guard tells them to leave but one of the explains, "Can't you see this person is (insert intestine disease which I cannot remember the name of) gravely ill? We just need to see the doctor! The rain is pouring outside and he needs assistance immediately!" The guards see what seems to be a ripped stomach and the guy moaning in pain, as if he is about to faint. The doctor appears behind the entrance and shouts, "Oh dear we need to help this guy! Get everyone here to help this person into the emergency room!" The guards heed the command and carry the patient in whilst chasing the couple away.Â </blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq>Inside the room, the patient wakes up to reveal that it is indeed Marstin the detective in disguise. "Thank goodness the parents acted their part well; I can never carry a real patient myself", he thought to himself. (I will explain this later) He gets out of the bed and hides with his back behind the bed facing away from the only door with a small window in it. He sees the large window to the left of him to notice an empty, dark alleyway with a light source on the near end, barely lighting half of the alley. He looks back in the door to notice the doctor entering the room.Â </blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq>"I need to do something to this guy."Â </blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq>The doctor immediately turns into a stack of paper which flies around in the room. Marstin quickly summons a bunch of strings stretched across the drawer on right end to the ceiling on the other end, similar to a clothesline. The paper then moves swiftly to be slotted messily between the lines. He then looks at his hand ready to do another summon but notices it is not working. "Oh I'm using too much magic! Too much magic..." He talks to himself while tapping on the desk beside the bed he was hiding behind. "Maybe I should just tie the doctor up instead, but how...?" Suddenly, he hears a knock on the door!"</blockquote><br><br>Yeah, this is it. (Audience: Aw, we were enjoying this!) Haha me too. Before references though, let me clarify a couple of things not mentioned to not affect story flow. Everything in dashes which include detail count towards the dream and is not part of me making this story complete. That is how complete the story is btw. Also, the detective mentioned his plan because I didn't know where to slot this in. (Get it? Haha I meant the paper lol) So the summary is as follows: The first couple who appeared at the door is actually not the couple, but Marstin creating doubles of the couple to appear at the door. There's no way to prove it because my brain didn't come up with a way to prove they are real. The second time then is the real couple carrying Marstin disguised as the father who has a serious illness - which is not shown here again but is represented in looks which I cannot describe here. The doctor then calls for the patient to be brought in which is easy since the right person sneaked in. Lastly, Marstin is a hint to be a magician disguised as a detective to solve problems for the common people, even though the name suggests otherwise.<br><br>I know, right? This is so mystery movie worthy. Okay, maybe not the gay part but I only said it, and no sex scenes are included anyway, so... #samesexquality<br><br>Okay, references. The setting was clearly from the <abbr title="Search 'Kuroshitsuji london'">19th century-based manga Kuroshitsuji</abbr> which I read (the shop was at a T-junction looked in from the left corner), after that I guess it's influenced by video games especially the dark setting in the shop so it looks like a sci-fi movie with a <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1N7wSjOVxMU&t=2011s" target=_blank>GTA V hospital horror setting</a> during Halloween (the Adversary Mode is Slasher btw), for example. Marstin "the detective" image is thanks to <a href=https://twitter.com/seigura/status/938973941460324352 target=_blank>this image</a> hehe (that's voice actress Hidaka Rina with a hair change btw), and the name is thought up as soon as the ending happens, and feels like one of those <strike>Disney</strike>Â <abbr title="Search 'That's all folks'">Looney Tunes ending cartoon punch lines</abbr> in the 60s (YouTube videos, don't remember which one) with that wacky name. Interesting, huh? How all these can come together.<br><br><br><br>The brain is such a wonderful thing. It brings in all the stuff you can recall and puts it in any random setting and let all the stuff clash onto each other. That's why I like dreams. That's why I can remember them. Well, not for long, but still. Things like this tend to stay, and I like that. Also, don't let me put copyright on this thing because this idea is MINE!! OKAY, MINE!!
