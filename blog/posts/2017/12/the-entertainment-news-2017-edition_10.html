It's has been quite a week, but actually it's just me procrastinating most of the time, but yeah, I did get to kick start on the stuff I want to do this holiday season, so we shall see how long I can last lol I know I say that all the time as if I don't trust myself<br><br>On a side note, Ten-chan (Amamiya Sora) looks great when lying down. You should have seen my desktop wallpaper hehe<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=JustBecause09><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Just Because!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Someone please tell me Morikawa changed hairstyle because of Souma! Please! Otherwise there'll be no point to this!! lol</div></blockquote>(*This was technically first but I watched it two days late lol) The new episode (#JustBecause09) of course, must complicate things to a new level. Remember man, that now Eita is trying to go to the college (university) Natsume is applying for before, and Natsume is trying to get into the school Eita was already accepted into. Haha, the troubles of romance lol. Anyways, let's talk about Morikawa before we jump into that. Blowing everyone's mind at school, the shorter-haired Morikawa definitely grabbed the attention of the class for good, and Souma's attention may just be a little underwhelming. Well, he did explain later that he doesn't want to get in the hype to stress her out any further, but you know, it could have been done earlier. Komiya is avoiding Eita after mentioning about confession last episode, and Natsume... let's say she is intending to face her emotions. To say the least, like Eita, she wants to chance upon him in college and maybe go out together or something, I don't know. It all comes down to this last few months already. With entrance exams still getting in the way, and Valentines just around the corner, I could not help but think this show can go one way or another. Man, you don't know how much I want a happy ending out of this.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTfWvbNavnpX2HtsEhL6qyMlI13xu8coi94ybzGeG_JK2UTQQKUKZ6IMr9A7lcGHo8OCPJqsQiG2Q4M8h8JwTmNldke1CWpoCesRX4ipaxvmwZXLdewTg6QTyCzA683_oqCky6_GZyn9Dc/s320/justbecause09_natsume.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is the most honest reflection I've seen thus far, so I'll use this instead.<br>Natsume looking at herself really says things, especially with chocolate right beside her lol</table>P.S. Going by the looks of Eita's phone I can guarantee it's a HTC haha *adjusts glasses*<br>P.P.S. Wait, the ringtone on Natsume's phone is dog bark? lol On the other hand I kind of not appreciate her subtlety in talking to others, for example to Souma and to her sister. I mean, the sister kind of knows already, but why so she may not know. Maybe it's just me but I talk to my sister all the time. She don't talk her heart out to her sibling? I don't know.<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=HousekiNoKuni10><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Houseki no Kuni</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>NO DON'T DO IT DIA YOU CAN'T FIGHT THAT THING!! No seriously, don't. (Edit: I was proven wrong. Very wrong.)</div></blockquote>Wow this new episode (#HousekiNoKuni10) is too much for me to comprehend already haha. After Bort's confrontation to Phos seeing her potential in combat, but hey that's not really much of a problem until you notice we're going to leave Dia out on this one. She's fine with it I guess (recall Episode 2) but what's more important is that how much it matters when something new from the moon appears. Since Sensei is sleeping it'll be hard to wake him up at any point (recall Episode 4), so Bort and Phos thought of taking it on while everyone "holds their position" (which may mean otherwise to some) and they fight off the bad guy. No seriously, WTF is that thing?? With no time to be amazed or shocked, it quickly chased them to the building, in which that moon thing caught on to Dia and she... had to fight it off. Hey, it's been some time already but hell yeah Dia for MVP. Problem is, she's in pieces. And mutation is not going to make the moon thing go away, as also shown from the next episode preview. Sounds like bad news, but let's see if Sensei will make it by the end of this season to resolve this. No really, I personally think that getting gem people taken away should not be a conclusion to this series. Please don't.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhALr1R7w0v8jjkIyAFtx4SDkftRn4A-4jGXW77TE48KBn7Zsd0VyLK4pvlt0FlPaH-urQaxfHECSmncs43SkIb9GaMGHwK4N5icMDt_uW1ASzUfTLQsTf9n6dRYWU_S6kvf6kOk8mo2BpX/s320/housekinokuni10_dia.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This episode in a nutshell.<br>I'm too freaked out to show that beast in the thumbnail so here's Dia hehe</table>P.S. I shall once again praise on the animation for using adequate blur with fog inside the building to make the 3DCG blend even well with the 2D animation. I'm still impressed with the quality of animation in this show.<br>P.P.S. The other thumbnail I thought of was the jellyfish part lol I forgot Phos can talk to animals haha the voting is amazing<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BlendS10><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Blend S</span></div></blockquote>Well that was an interesting episode. The new episode (#BlendS10) talks about not Maika? You bet. Kaho-san has problems with her studying because she's playing games all day, and Mafuyu decides to be the grown-up (also genius) to help her out. Of course we'll reach the happy ending, and of course she'll miss the times, and all is well, yes? We also got a lesson in makeup class (I mean, look at that) thanks to Mafuyu who probably will look like a ghost without makeup, but seriously, makeup cannot change your face shape. Just a reminder, Akizuki. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Other than that, Mafuyu seems to have problems finding a partner who isn't into loli (because of the role she acts in the cafe), and suddenly Kaho-san likes to drink black coffee. All is normal in this cafe, yes? Also, I see a Kaho-san special coming my way, so I'll be looking forward to that. It feels awkward though, but not as awkward as Akizuki having to praise girls in this workplace lol<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCBTYb_E75z8pAYRoBcNE-IzDhkNemVFShhdAuFuPBQPwYUjelsKnVyobDQ60AhcL2rVkTdSZWFw1j6JbITzvt53y5Uvqa_-dgw084YC4csqIY2e7nQS2nhkvI7oSFv5L7FJLb4JuX7gAB/s320/blends10_mafuyu.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When everyone around you is crazy about sh*t you don't care about lol</table>P.S. "He was totally out of frame" We know she's not only mocking on Mafuyu but also the widescreen resolution of the camera, right? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Eh, no?<br>P.P.S. Keeping it simple huh, Mafuyu? I like that too lol. Also, Hideri can't go without makeup, just so you all know haha<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=3Lion31><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Sangatsu no Lion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>You know what's good about school? It doesn't last longer than the rest of your life. On the other hand, 3D2N will still suck for one who doesn't have friends. Hmm, I wonder how I survived such an ordeal considering I don't have friends too lol</div></blockquote>I'll say it again if Kiriyama didn't make it clear - "It's okay to hang in there. It's going to be over soon." The new episode (#3Lion31) talks about Hina-chan and her school trip?? Oops. Yep, they're bringing the bullying aftermath to the test. Of course, Kiriyama is there to help her out, and I must say it's anything better than what his saviour has done to him, to say the least. The Anime also did a good job to extend that mood and make sure it hits us at the right time, which I admire. Because if it's done by me I'll never write the story this way but make a probably more sarcastic Kiriyama like "Find you!" or something lol. Anyways, it's yet another wonderful episode, and as I mentioned above, Hina-chan, school is nothing but another bullying ground in society, and doesn't last. So just forget it and move on we've got better things to think about. For example, Kiriyama winning the Tournament. Well, he showed the opponent. Well, more like, Nikaidou showed him. His best friend showed him the way, so that his own temper doesn't get in the way of winning. Hey, that guy may have bullied (I'm overusing this word already) the one who cannot last due to his illness, but he's not going to bully a child prodigy who is in the pink of health hehe. No really, Kiriyama showed his opponent, so that's quite a good conclusion to this chapter at least.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYHd85yWmtCzOzCojiXOFqCbCPhLQlFdXubq9HOg174bah9NO6df3bjlmLqcmY6Sh8aPy9sXZIktWUcpRtKYmLOyBox3SNhvuvPW1NC4TlXMV4sjXcnT6knTutrHiO8c6xOmJmDv9kWuM2/s320/sangatsinolion31_hina.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The best face I've seen in this show.<br>You're great, Hina-chan.<br>(And I'm not normally into middle school girls too lol)</table>P.S. Okay I'm saying it here - This show could have been done in a less dark manner. No really, it's sad to watch. It's not Attack on Titan depressing, but it's sad. Real sad. Well, it's a world around Kiriyama after all so I won't say much<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>漫画</b></span> <span class=head-title>Dagashi Kashi</span></div></blockquote>The new chapters (Omake, 93) are... Is no one going to comment on the Sayashi landing on the Kokonotsu scene?? (spoilers) Well I'll do it haha. Okay before that, the story concludes on the big storm arc with the dagashi shop sign dropping on the ground. The sweet this time around (besides the omake which is literally talking about Anime since this is when the first season came around when Volume 5 was published) involves stickers which were on the sign and the building, which makes it fun for kids to paste it anywhere they want. Well, so long as it's not my room we're fine haha. Okay, that scene. I think an image speaks a thousand words, so here. Now you can't unsee like I do. But seriously, Kokonotsu's reaction is underwhelming. Turns out he really doesn't like flat-che *gets punched in the face*<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=480 data-original-width=389 height=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnxIjdM98H1s6niY0ysRJ0jRRJl_TFKFGGiNf22n8SsIpcFKwakSQVQA5KiNiIxqQYfNPeIQxH39lc6oroWvfb789TFqqbluQpWNB-d4ewJ_cc9MaC0Acq64wsmo5jcwRAinw_fuaQobcO/s320/img00008qHY.png width=257><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I know.
