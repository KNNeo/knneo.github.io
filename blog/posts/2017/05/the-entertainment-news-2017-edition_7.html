Anyways, another week has passed (four-day work weeks are great), and there's going to be another one ahead, so... three cheers for end of internship? Yahoo!~<br><br>But really, I just want everything to end soon. Summer holidays, I mean. You don't want to know why.<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AliceToZouroku05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Alice to Zouroku</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>I wished this was the perfect ending. I wished this show had only this many episodes. <strike>I was wrong.</strike>Â (sorry that was for next week lol) Then again, this can continue, right?</div></blockquote>This new episode (#AliceToZouroku05) concludes the long fight between (I wouldn't call it long anyway) the research facility and the police department, of course from last week the touching scene of Sana-chan calling Zouroku but then also, the arrival of Ichijou, an agent for the good side of the police force who is also an ability user. I'll leave the history of her powers and the fights thereafter for you to watch, but suffice it to say she overpowered Minnie C enough to stop her (which is losing of energy), and thus the full on operation of taking down the opposing force started. All is peace and quiet in the Kashimura family it seems with the initiation of a new granddaughter (I'm talking for Zouroku haha), and Naito-san (that old acquaintance who is also in the police) wants some action, so I guess... We're getting more, right? I felt like I missed something that isn't mentioned, but something's wrong, right? I hope they have something left to write after this episode; I don't want this to be a slice-of-life anime from here on. Actually, I WANT this to be a slice-of-life show, as I mentioned at the start. Chances are, we'll be revealed more ability users soon, I guess? But for now, Ichijou kicks a** in all, Sana-chan is not matured enough (in age and in power) to use anything in full force yet, and Zouroku is a happy man flying in the sky. Alice to Zouroku, everyone. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> #happyending<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcsQkT52hyVaQHfZ5ou0ubB4HSsCSmIMLMN3jUgzrtdVGF0nTibZVwSSlSYdp6bqaY5-N9DSCetk-h_2MU55W2aHPd9Vmmq5EtxSryJjzbRgQpV4ldhbjecrMRS3DIiBUquRhyphenhyphenIVtLzmS5/s320/alicezouroku05_shock.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me (left) and my BFF when someone tells us to get married already lol</table>P.S. This episode of Alice to Zouroku is brought to you by... Snickers! That delicious chocolate bar with various nutritional grains to ensure you stay strong and ready to use your magical powers after eating... a whole luggage bag of it?? Oh, and can we please have the omake of this episode be Sana-chan eating up the bars? "Oh this tastes real good" or something like that? Please? #ad<br>P.P.S. MVP Sanae-chan, for crying better than Sana-chan last episode and being cuter than Sana-chan who is being cute haha #actcute (Sorry Aki-chan, can't help but)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TsukiGaKirei05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Tsuki ga Kirei</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Damn watching this show is like having one of those popsicles with the sticks that say you win or lose and you thought you win but you're a loser haha. Don't get the joke? Try Guugle-ing (lol) "popsicle stick win lose", I guess? (Sorry ahead of time for not finding any relevant results though haha)</div></blockquote>This new episode (#TsukiGaKirei05) brings us our eventual relationship jump, I would say. Chinatsu may be MVP this episode (haha), but she is also in the pivot of the main couple's relationship, for better or for worse. For now, it's the latter. The couple meet, Chinatsu is there. The couple meet again, and she tells Akanecchi she likes the guy she is going out with in cram school. Now what? Will this make their relationship turn bad? I mean, it's hard to come together, and it's even easier to break apart. I'm constantly watching this episode coming up with tsukkomi (go find that out yourself) to their cringing moments and I think I've done enough of them. Goodness gracious if something's going to burst out all of a sudden next episode because this is going to be terrible in any direction possible? Why not inquire why Chinatsu and him are in the library? Why not feel for her and ask her of what she wants to do on dates? Why not hold her hand and assure her that you'll be by her side? Why not share Chinatsu's opinion that someone is interfering with your relationship? Questions you have to ask, but they don't, plus the action more than words between the two... this is going to be good drama for what's going to happen up next hehe I can't wait<br>(Edit: That Akane face when Kotarou was with Chinatsu in the library... I mean, I'm not even mad and she's like "don't tell me your excuse was 'I sent messages to two LINE accounts' or something" haha) (Also, THAT should've been the motivation for clearing up misunderstandings of Chinatsu's entry to their relationship) (Also also, Kotarou screwed it up soooooo hard on his explanation haha)<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHbs6WfvMImRPnivzTeqAKxDEDrbR_143W8_4B2FWhHQqqkRGi90xJvNK3SwKtOlXxzTgO5Sf9v-Dt7cjcBrWiqhfBQo-uiIZ_kKScNVvrpo5ycI3Kr_W3TXfbhrx5xK8tH2qgrrhTCeQw/s320/tsukigakirei05_yahoo.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Little do you know this website is run by famous voice actress Horie Yui lol<br>(Pun here is "Yaho!" is one of her single titles? I don't know haha)</table>P.S. Is Hira-kun like a ghost? He disappears without hearing a reply from Akanecchi (so this is what a leader does, huh) and is totally not feeling the empathy on others. Then again, this show has many people who do not understand any of the main couple (besides Kotarou's friend who runs that library), so this is okay I guess.<br>P.P.S. Yeah relationships problems in a summary on the short stories, I guess. From making choices for your girl to parents not liking potentially delinquents as potential family, there's everything to look out for in this show. Nice job, production. I always have a good laugh<br>(<a href=https://randomc.net/2017/05/04/tsuki-ga-kirei-05/comment-page-1/#comment-2268146 target=_blank>My comment in RC</a>, because I can't stop talking about it)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=EromangaSensei05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Eromanga-sensei</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Hmm, this week definitely brings some plot progression. I like it actually, this show is showing good promise in that, and it's not as forced as... someone showing her panties? Ugh, can't unsee... (Warning: You may become a paedophile after this series)</div></blockquote>This new episode (#EromangaSensei05) continues on the fantastic yet unbelievable trust between the siblings. Furthermore, we are assured that Masamune likes his stepsister and Sagiri... let's just say she likes him back. It's mutual, but they want to work, so putting that aside, they are both in the search for inspiration and assistance to create their big project. Elf-sensei is in quite a pinch herself, Sagiri is super distracted about loli girls right now, and Masamune's friend at the bookstore may just be Eromanga-sensei's next model lol. Damn, this show balances out everything good. Throw in Megumin and her lack of shame for doing everything to get Sagiri as her friend... that one I guess we'll have to wait for next episode or something, but this is really turning out to be that typical Anime that you'll totally enjoy. Also, shoutout to Shana-chan and Taiga-chan for (not) their cameo appearance in years, and I don't think that's all done by the infamous Kugimiya Rie because... *looks at credits* my guess is they just got the voice for Tomoe to do these. I may be wrong though haha<br>Edit: Kido Ibuki as Megumin is probably what you wanted in life as an otaku. Well, at least, in here... *points at show* lol<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFg84jOXweiXfSaSc1qPvOJJLRU52fcmFfbXrvJiURWz0CV-6fP4xIulE0am9SKD2TTla1ihXkPwm2dRtD7o2xbKQ7nshHGx6Q4PBtv5GeyiKC_p3o5-VmC-iYKftYGGfeBlft4N6cqbnB/s320/eromanga-sensei05_mask.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>"Have you started wearing a bra already??"<br>That's getting back at you Elf-sensei haha<br>(But seriously, <strike>has</strike> hasn't she? lol)</table>P.S. Who the f*** put that random editor running just to pass the story time? Seriously...<br>P.P.S. Also, this show is serious in making you look at naked girls and their panties for goodness sake. (Because if you re-watched that bath scene of Megumin you're officially a hentai I assure you) Also also, Sagiri, if you need references of panties go watch adult videos. Plenty of them all over the place. I speak from experience lol<br>(So many references... I think I'm not going to list them all but in case you missed them just watch it again! #freepromo)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan31><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Oh damn, not recap intro again... This in TV show terms means they have lack of content to put on that few minutes before the opening haha</div></blockquote>This new episode (#AttackOnTitan31) is real. Yep, just in case you can't wait for the next episode already (I know, for the action), then let me tell you here then. We have traitors in our group. I rather not say who they are, but Annie didn't die in vain. (Remember the Anime four years ago?) That is to say, but then these guys are done with their objectives, and they'd rather "go home", according to one of them. Mikasa is fast on the draw, unfortunately not fast enough to stop the two of them from transforming into Titans. And that's where it probably all started, if you could recall in the very start of this series. But hey, I'm not going to talk about much, for what is ahead is actually a lot more exciting, isn't it? This episode is focusing on (may I quote a bit of Reiner) a bunch of idiots thinking logically about what happened around here even though they're probably all going to die on this wall lol. Okay, I'm not being very optimistic and I'm being a real a-hole right now, but I can't wait to see what happens. Considering it's those Colossal Titans, I'm not going to be positive about this.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinve7mJvGFVrGgLjWJWBCWf97JVLxNYN97v0eyREAJR1EpynEa87SW9W5GDq8LyjVsXqgNU1FLAM3UecxsWOc59-OT-iHvn3LAQK0PMPlKMH6oMwY0ofoUo_84P2oXOwNbkLiF43-qRqhY/s320/%255BHorribleSubs%255D+Shingeki+no+Kyojin+S2+-+31v2+%255B720p%255D.mkv_snapshot_19.51_%255B2017.05.07_11.43.39%255D.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Real cool, brings the tensions up to max this season,<br>but damn, Reiner when you're like this you're scary.</table>P.S. Let's talk a little about the situation mentioned in the story. The traitors mentioned about them Titans wanting to eradicate all of humanity (haha back at them lol) and that there is no need for it now. Does that mean (or should I assume) that their job was to gauge how powerful humanity is in fighting against them? A good example would be that monkey face of a Titan from the last few episodes (sorry don't know whose human was it from) finding out the soldiers' gear and taking it back for investigations. So is that what it is? To prove a superior race? To run a world that is just nothing but Titans? Or to prove that if it takes a f*** ton of humans to kill one Titan then they have lots more?? I don't know man, but this not overpopulation thing back to like, the dinosaur age where the largest beings rule the world is kind of weird, I guess. Well, don't think too much then; the show better make it clear in this season, to say the least.<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Kuroshitsuji</span></div></blockquote>Holy sh*t what did I just see? The new chapters (126, 127) (sorry for totally forgetting about it haha) continue on Bravat and his scheme being revealed, so let's talk about that first. Ciel calls on the parliament to be stable considering many officials just sent their blood to that one guy Bravat is keeping alive, and proceedings continue as they try to find out what Elizabeth is influenced by. I suspect it may not be as simple as we think. On other things, someone is after the life of Prince Souma apparently, and his butler Agni, being all so loyal and fulfilling his duty, sacrificed his life from the supposed killer. I don't want to guess who the killer is (maybe <strike>one of the P4</strike> Bravat himself?), but yeah, it was a sad scene to even watch. Thanks Yana-chan-sensei for the draws; this was one gory ending. Ignoring intentions behind all this (which we no doubt will find out soon), Souma talking about staying here and Agni and his duties seem rather relevant and is tying quite a few things together, I would say. Here's saluting to Agni for his boldness in defending his master at all costs (you should've seen his back, which I will not post here), and may he rest in peace. Because for one, this situation is REALLY getting out of hand. I'm pissed off, for once. WHO THE F*** DID IT??? Argh, should've missed another month to read them all haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=310 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5Rf2_vGi5UzpDqY36wpT0VAbJJOnIfpOi47RTfRI7l0BE2uX6X1AnCs0_Dd5Scuj9WysHdg1N09o652Mh_2RqcBThGgEg55ywR6OoBg-1MWq5KRnZpLErqowpXDf8bpIBpwiSMN70Qvg0/s320/kuroshitsuji127_009.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Well at least we got to see the true power of Agni'sÂ <strike>bandaged</strike> concealed arm<br>#badass</table><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Dagashi Kashi</span></div></blockquote>The new chapter (57) talks about glucose it seems. I guess it's just another ramune, but the application of this product may be overboard considering it literally revived the father from a hangover lol. Interesting part here is Kokonotsu's decision to talk to Hotaru about... taking over the shop? Uh oh, will this series be over? I guess not yet, but then it's worth a thought. Not because of summer festival I suppose, but suffice it to say he enjoyed himself? Hey, that isn't shown in the Anime haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=156 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfHO9F57KUCFGjpqR0S7qJ2lNLtLTyAFUMG9xLt9DqwMInB3t0NfpE4gAcd_KtEnljtna0cGQAUDHrhJl0WYpu-UoRySDWSBjaps21egk9vF0IU-QJJdy2P1kihQPnvtt-H7zWORHqV22b/s320/dagashikashi57_you.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Between this and Hotaru shoving it down his throat (lol) I chose this haha</table>On other things, I wished I had enough mobile data to read manga at work. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay I don't, which explains why I never continue reading those I wanted to. Maybe I should, for the weeks that I have nothing else to do? We'll see. On other things, remember "Boku Tame"?? (Boku ga Boku de Aru Tame ni) Goddamn someone needs to translate that. I can only get "Miyuki (secondary character) is very cute" on the latest chapter online. Okay, I also know that tall girls can get cute Miyuki-san (<span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span> Aki-chan <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span>), so that's that haha. I don't think I want to write that down here though. Not for now, at least.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week has been quiet, unless you're talking about that journey I took to find indie artists and their new songs to listen. Feel free to help yourself and explore the new artists who are trying to aim for a spot on the big festival stage with <a href=https://rojack.jp/ target=_blank>ROJACK</a>, and I think I may not be going to Audioleaf next time since... they upgraded their website. (I need to learn HTML soon haha) On other things, I did give a listen to <b>Hata Motohiro's new single</b> to little success, and I told myself I will listen to <b>Aimer's best albums</b> someday. So I may, just... not today.<br><br>Talking about next week - in which Wednesday is also a public holiday where I live - I'll be reviewing hopefully a couple of albums including <b>Sambomaster</b> and <b>Komatsu Mikako</b>. Problem here recently is that, if you didn't hear, <b>Nyaa is closed</b>. Yes, that popular torrent site for all things Anime and also one of the music sources that I know of. Not even down, not attacked, just closed. The owner has chosen to close it. So that's going to be a future problem though, which no doubt will stop me from getting new songs from this month onwards. Haiz, goddamn whatever legal realisation is happening because I still need the leeching, I guess. You may be rich to own iTunes, but I don't. Apple Music is not even giving me quite enough anyway.<br><br><br>Talking about next week, (yes this is the end), I also want to play games. And since I can't wait until then, I've decided to stop here. So... yeah. Cya guys then, and until next time... sometimes you wish the manga you read become anime. So far... there isn't a GE Good Ending anime, and Tonari no Kashiwagi-san only got a read aloud animated manga series, (BTW what happened to the scans for last volume? I want to know the end) so... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content Â© 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
