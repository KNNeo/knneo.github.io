Honestly saying, because it's two weeks to the end of a lot of things (Hint: It's my internship), and it's also been two weeks since I got nothing on Apple Music. Really felt like being cheated of my money now, but then again it's a coincidence how all the new songs aren't available in there anyway.<br><br><span class=emoji title=üò©>*sigh*</span> Hopefully two weeks later isn't like this. That's the highlight week of the month btw<br><br><br> (FYI <b>Alice to Zouroku</b> takes a break for the second arc next week, which is like, tonight. So...)<br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TsukiGaKirei06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span>¬†<span class=head-title>Tsuki ga Kirei</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>No, you MOST DEFINITELY HAVE TO BETRAY YOUR FRIEND!! Go tell your guy now that she wants to confess to him! lol</div></blockquote>This new episode (#TsukiGaKirei06) may be a little less exciting than usual (or it's just me), but there is development. A lot of it. We know of the results of Akane's track meet (Spoiler: She failed) and Koratou's outcome of being a literature guy (Spoiler: He didn't cut it), but it's more than that. Akane may be distracted from having her friend Chinatsu in the way of their relationship, and Kotarou may have chosen his career path. But I see more books and it looks like there's more Dazai, so I guess he rejected the offer of being a light novelist after all. Good thing is they are encouraging each other up (unlike that jerk Hira haha) and making things suck a little less. Also worth mentioning are parenting in this episode, where Akane's parents are bossy yet give their kids the freedom to do their best even during their final school year compared to Kotarou's. Okay, just the mother. "But seriously, mom, I got sh*tted on enough already today" was probably what he thought haha. The show always paid good attention to not let too many thoughts and words get in the way, and they displayed the actions enough for you to infer. So how? What's next? Will Kotarou say no? Because he better be, for Chinatsu - who is going to confess to him in the near future - is going to do her best on it. And I'm wondering if he can resist. But hey, I'm not worried about it because I'm not him haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhipBP71DYEJnppQ1xEXLXjlVq0Tg8m31UpcraRDIz0clu5LtDcRvRYQxv8bRIdT3EIaUgHziKianJ4FZvd6xS0zUTA3ChC9wRXmbxNosD3ZfEO70-_yevaxPavVLtIvQ4TUSkneJrhIgce/s320/tsukigakirei06_sisters.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>That is Akane's "you betrayed me hard" sister face lol</table>P.S. Lol the short stories. Having Miu-chan as your girlfriend must be a pain in the neck. Or your arm. Or your brain. Or your observational skills. No seriously, deal with it. That's practically every other girl on the street right now. Yes, including those foreigners too haha<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=EromangaSensei06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span>¬†<span class=head-title>Eromanga-sensei</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>So Megumin you want to like what Sagiri-chan likes? You should start looking at yourself HAHAHA GOT HER</div></blockquote>Okay, the episode (#EromangaSensei06). Yeah, it got adult rated REAL QUICK when they started inviting Megumin into Sagiri's room for some reason. In exchange for a chance to be friends, Megumin has accepted to be... I guess, ridiculed? (I mean, you made a middle school girl cry you idiot) Hey, I'm not going to talk about it here, but suffice it to say they blindfolded her and tied her up lol. Onto the second part because I rather let you watch to find out, Masamune has troubles publishing his next work in collaboration with Eromanga-sensei. He may get held up, and as in consequence lose his life with his sister right now (which in honesty isn't really that great I mean he has to take care of the sister while focusing on getting work done; remember the past few episodes?). Fortunately, his manager did set him up to publish his book in a competition, and if he wins it will get his book out faster. Problem is, there is competition. Not just ordinary competition. It's from that author who has been affected hard by Masamune's same writing style (doing a heck a lot better than him though) and has been sh*t on by Elf-sensei at the door. So yeah, Senju Muramasa, ladies and gentlemen. She has been hit hard, and she will hit people hard. Well, in novel writing, at least. I mean, come on. For Masamune being called names of being a pass-off to her, you know she's going to be pissed off for being mocked on the same issue. I guess you can't put revenge aside right now. We've got a love story to beat. Then again, Muramasa-san, if you can beat sibling love you'll be THE best author ever and we can end this series lol. We shall see.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOT7FHUABjA5VakG_a_nCYuFeCkzlQJ8ovzHyr_IsiG3K7v7_oGF4wm15APpsPbMCGbhml_0886zT6L3VfBIVZ9kfmK7GOHW1Ox2LHnaEfXA9JT58WK5S1uwZPINadpV8pVGIhahAYE4a0/s320/eromangasensei06_megumin.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Little does she know she's going to get violated HARD haha<br>Well hope she learns her lesson lol</table>P.S. MVP Megumin for being violated as a girl. Hey, I'm not into little girls, and I won't say much of the ridicule she's been through (because I'm not a perv and I don't know any other short girls voiced by Kido Ibuki HAHAHA #Ë∂Ö„Ç®„É≠„ÅÑ). Poor Sagiri, didn't get to see her face when doing so (I mean, she's a fashionable b*tch lol)f. Still, it's probably better off knocking her out before doing this haha<br>P.P.S. The hardsub here is because some online source dropped it. And it maybe because of the first half of the episode lol<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan32><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span>¬†<span class=head-title>Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>As I said, last draw. Last draw, people. Cannot be totally Eren's win anyway haha</div></blockquote>This new episode (#AttackOnTitan32) is as epic as the preview last episode shows. Ignoring Eren's belief in anything of Reiner, let's talk about that important flashback about close combat. In the middle insert image (if you ever read those) the show talked about close combat as a human tied to titan form too, so yeah, Eren tried to use that to his advantage. He's doing pretty well, Reiner's screaming for help (sort of), but yeah, his buddy comes to save him. Hey, I won't know what happens until next week, but seeing they still have the time to talk about what happens to Eren, reminiscing about the past and doing long-drawn drama which is pretty much the only thing I hate about this show, then so be it. I'm not that bothered after all. I'll take the action and fighting this episode and go away happy. That's good enough haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKWhoOFN1_RqgWXItHfAEheLp6PoRCU3oArB1zsSygE3jBmN3VvFLOkhIPJRQYTgiQE7r2sw9nN1skcVeFP_Cyv6F78ASNeM05LsIRyRNhMilGZxW3lAvyG66iUeylfsqQ1QMdXZCf4dVt/s320/attackontitan32_punch.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This episode in a nutshell. #geteffedEren<br>Makes you wonder why the Colossal Titan took a while to join this fight.</table>P.S.

Unlike all art clubs who won't have problems, we have a guy on top of a girl. Haha yeah, we continue from last chapter where Uchimaki lands on Usami. Don't worry; he didn't even twitch. On other things, Imari-chan is here for Necronomicon (did I get that right? *double checks* YES! haha) once again, and turns out this book might just exist in the library. Ignoring the Chairman who is still sleeping, Imari-chan gets the others to join in the treasure hunt. What happens next? Your guess is as good as mine. If it's nothing, that is.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVFsSU0sAPdme1dfh4HKL5ZH7pp1r4Z8-oIU9hso7IaIhx3MejuBilbulP1LMLXAGxrHo4zA4m5Xc_VOW2bhJLltyismo0qoo_-8jvz5KkxriwCF8IfPPddl7LHR9Ps0__8e0EZ3DtmTaZ/s320/img000007.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=199><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If I were cute I'll be as dumb as Colette-chan haha<br>But I'm not, so I fake fall like Imari-chan lol</table><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>Êº´Áîª</b></span>¬†<span class=head-title>Dagashi Kashi</span></div></blockquote>The new chapter (58) talks about horror stories. Yeah, in a sweet. How convenient. But hey, if it beats a children's' horror story series (<span class=emoji title=üòâ>*wink*</span> Goosebumps <span class=emoji title=üòâ>*wink*</span>) then why not? On other things, I don't remember this being in the Anime, and Sayashi is one scared girl.

Honestly saying up till now it's not been impressive. I mean, I prefer last year's mini-album. <b>Komatsu Mikako's new album</b> is also out this week, but thus far there's only the one music video which I think it's okay (I did criticise heavily of Q-MHz composition when I reviewed her latest single last year) and everything else... let's say I have no idea lol. <b>Sambomaster's new album</b> is also out this week following their new single last month which I also did not have a listen to, but hey, I can just take one song. <b>Sid's new single</b> too...<br><br>I know. It's hard to talk about reviews when there's practically nothing to talk about because I didn't get a listen to them. I took the time then to go review <b>Aimer's best albums</b> and I must say:<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en> After hearing her best albums recently I've got to say... this one is still her best.<br><br>Listening to Aimer - Chouchou Musubi</div>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/863563443952951300 target=_blank>May 14, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset=utf-8 src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><br>On the other hand, I might just give her latest song. It's not bad anyway.<br><br>Next week presents us... nothing. Okay, maybe <b>cinema staff's new album</b>, which might also not appear. So yeah, I might just run out of juice by two weeks from now. I really need to go give those indie artists a listen. Have you? Some of them are pretty good, though it was harder to find them compared to last year lol. cinema staff though, is not (likely) going to disappoint. I can feel it.<br><br><br>This is it then. Sorry for the lack of content in Klassic Note, but I can't bear to spend a lot of money to buy songs and then trash them, and if I don't trash them means I'll be like those kind-hearted fellows who "share" them with the Internet, which is by the way illegal btw. Cya guys then, and until next time... I hope to hear some of them. Come on, Mikakoshi's album would be good for starters. I know the other two are harder. Please, Internet? I can't go on not giving new songs at this rate... <span class=emoji title=üò¢>*sob*</span><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text ¬© 2017 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
