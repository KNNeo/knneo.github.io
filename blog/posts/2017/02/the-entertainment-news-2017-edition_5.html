I got scammed hard until I got stomachache. Haha don't worry they got nothing to do with each other. I'm glad I had a great rest on Saturday lol. On other things, tomorrow's work day again. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> I guess I'll be over it. It's only a month since I started.<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=ACCA04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>I like how he goes to some places and he's thought of being overly enthusiastic and on some places he's thought of being complacent. Ah, it's hard being Jean.</div></blockquote>This new episode (#ACCA04) talks about another of the 13 districts of Dowa, the most secluded of them, the most independent of them, the most lagging behind - Suitsu District. It talks mostly about how backwards in technology and life it is with the others after it gained independence off the royal rule, and thus has never been improving, ie. it has been stuck as it is a century ago. With it comes a whole level of political rule (led by royals wanting to preserve the place while commoners cannot do much but live life), a different level of rebellion (even the ACCA officers and royal militants want to help change the place up) and a whole different level of empathy. I mean, look at it. As much as it looks great as an antique vase, it's still antique. And nothing old and alive will remain vibrant. Nothing wrong about closing one eye about it, but somehow Jean got into a coup for no reason. And hey, if it's a topic of conversation, it will be.<br>This show is great. I like how it expresses the nation well while still focusing on the main story. I mean, Jean's no bad guy. He doesn't even look like one. Look at him. He only cares for smoke haha<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhFeblcpae40E5-rMyFBh-Dj03kgduE3hUv916260ECzTBbL2wWIOFWhfPHUA_dZFpuXLL13_nVBegOL0G7t974_agoqQmnOaYzCcsNSw1NS3i69RmhsOM54ebjYlMIO6YtEaVVYY1XceJ/s320/acca04_phone.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>A perfect summary of Suitsu District in one image.<br>Remember the romaji text on everything?

She doesn't even give two f**ks about the guy who's fondling her!<br>Is it just me? Or is it just Akane's ****** loose?<br>(Hint: It's got to to with the brain lol)</table>And yes, just like Hanabi who probably already noticed it anyways, Akane is a bitch. (I'll be using this word here so please forgive me haha) And a good one. I mean, besides the fact that she has more experience (as in, bed experience) than her younger counterpart who still has feelings for the one brother who confessed to her (poor guy he got dragged in this innocent fellow), there's no much difference. They sleep with men totally displaying their physically expendable gender status as women (I mean, this is eastern culture by the way), they take advantage of people around who love them or are lost in love, and they do it without remorse or regret. (Kudos to Hanabi's other conscious) Question here is more like how disposable love can be seen in this case, I guess, and how much it takes to show that in this show. Yeah. I'll call it here. I'M DONE AFTER THIS EPISODE (#KuzuNoHonkai04). Not even the drama, the philosophies about love, or even Tomacchan (as Ecchan) and Aki-chan (as Akane) combined acting. No, I've gotten quite enough. Those sex scenes and lesbian love are quite enough for me.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEdRWvQiw_d5YPyDukVDLowk50j-85yLypN1cQS1SUFlYNnzWRBVlAcpObQtK3kA2iYRDnmX2eqGYokUTf07qTxcHEBEZVG_fGdUvW1pI1FNAENdrrdUgSLvUFXyRP_PV0gJMlO0iP110k/s320/kuzunohonkai04_down.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I mean, do show like To Love-Ru also do this?<br>Or is this show too much for my eyes to watch?<br>I don't know man...<br>(Yes notice the hand down there dumbass)</table>This draws me in parallel to the other (rare but quite often) romance Anime shows I watch before, and I thought of Toradora!, and please don't tell me it's totally different. The thoughts of infatuation and love perception here between people are legit similar, just without much deception, and even so there is to some extent. Still, I just want to point out that the show I recalled here does romance a lot easier than Kuzu no Honkai. The Anime production here can cover so much matured themes if they have to, and thus will reduce the impression it will have on many, including me. I'm not saying this to defend myself (come on, I've watched porn) but this is not acceptable just visually to watch a show that talks about romance and convincingly persuades you to enjoy every scene. Yes, including those manga-like split image scenes that they saved time drawing.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=181 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRJDQHr4hx9Yk0xSL5lzdk7Q_XZ0Y4Mryvitrzb55-7Jzp-RVrMwIsI-zsZ8BzHABVBjJM0uROYM5kE1C0z3HZpWD92Ygb5MsCx4bD6bowN9iZTUK6c-eauYYIuGF7kv9jZikpw2m5bUZs/s320/toradora7_intro.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If we have to talk about scum in this Anime then it has got to be her, yes?<br><span style=font-size:12.8px>And you're right, I didn't use the screencap for the last episode.</span></table>In conclusion, I can't watch a show that gets my knob up. Period. If you jerk off to this I apologise for stopping the gratification you get for watching this show.<br>P.S. "You do this with Awaya (Mugi) too, right?" Hanabi, you got BOOMED! Ecchan totally got her on that one.<br>P.P.S. Meanwhile, I'll be watching Random Curiosity do the full report and if I miss my boner then maybe I'll go back. But no. I'm no scum. *laughs hard*<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=3Lion16><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Sangatsu no Lion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Really, if Kiriyama feels bad for being helped by others, consider feeling bad for helping others then, nice guy.</div></blockquote>Damn I like the moods they create in this show. So much better than the previous one haha. Anyways, this latest episode (#3Lion16) talks about that final match of Shimada and Gotou, and if you didn't know, the latter lost. On the other hand, Kiriyama seems to have things in his life sorted out. And it's all thanks to help from others. His teacher is totally right about finding people to rely on when necessary considering he's a total loner living alone right now haha. This also draws parallel to how much Kiriyama feels bad about receiving help from others, even though he hasn't paid the Kawamoto sisters back in any way yet. Then again, in life, there isn't a thing about balance of favours here and there. There must be some kind of undying dedication on one side to consider relationships precious and genuine. So he shouldn't feel too bad about it considering the situation he is in now. On other things, he joined the workshop Shimada is in, and is totally learning about stuff here and there. Kiriyama is growing, slowly but surely. And that makes of a good ending, yes? Next episode though... I know, I hear the word "Kyouka" and I want to beat someone up. Preferably a woman. Haha just joking.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg2DJL4qpX9O-WAtHcDz56clkX0pQ3oLIyI79Dgacauw2uKCfNpOQZL_N8wgNv64DLZ7L6Ao2k_0IVUHzLfCvxzrFO33K3HsWb05Sc4pyY5b_nSal2WU8SRx8wrPtZspeyUTeS5x4EaL3yh/s320/sangatsunolion16_workshop.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Can't ask for a better timing than this.<br>No wonder Shimada can laugh so hard after a tiring match.</table><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Tonari no Kashiwagi-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Haha I guess after that switch of a father meeting back then I don't think this will make me any more satisfied watching Kazu and Sayaka get together and all.</div></blockquote>This new chapter (79) talks some about the main couple too. Hey, if Anime and Manga are anything to live by, they'd hope their exams are over soon so we could really watch some REAL couple action. On other things, the other couple are wanting each other so bad, Kazu should just considering joining a girls' school already lol. Otherwise, you'd be glad to know we're heading to a big, greenish field of joy, and we can't stop the smiles from frowning. Damn, I wished I had a life like that haha<br>P.S.

Okay, I should start by the fact that I didn't have enough time to go through anything this week, so I shall be conservative in my reviews for this week then. <b>negoto's new album</b> was sort of interesting, but following their own new steps to making beats than making songs really makes me miss the old them where they just sing rock tunes. I maybe asking too much, but still. <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES and their new album</b> follow closely on the landslide of reviews, and I must say I'm not unexpectedly disappointed. Listening through this album really feels like listening to the same thing a dozen times. Exceptions do apply though, for there are emotional songs that I think I want to give to compete with the likes of many male artists from last year <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span>wink* haha. <b>sphere's new album</b> is next on the list, and this one wasn't that good either. Topic songs are forgivable, but for giving my review on the train I don't even remember anything from the new songs, which is rather bad. I guess I'll be giving some obligatory songs then. (Now that I noticed again I really missed Aki-chan haha) There's also <b>YUKI's new single </b>which I somehow forgot to mention last week which is also released this week, and I must say I almost did give a bad good single to be on my shelf. Thankfully after repeated reviews I've confirmed she will not be on my shelf again (sorry YUKI-san) but thanks for the new anime theme song. Really makes me miss that single I gave you years ago.<br><br>On other things, I hope you have read my Twitter haha. I somehow haven't gave an artist I took a listen to on that indie site that is Audioleaf, I've given reshuffled (as in label company) <b>Tokyo Karan Koron their latest song</b>, and I've been spending a lot of yesterday listening to that aspiring vocaloid composer turned mainstream artist who also wrote one of the anime theme songs... <b><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenshi_Yonezu target=_blank>Yonezu Kenshi</a></b>. His latest album from two years ago came to my attention as many of <a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/08yakari target=_blank>his songs on YouTube</a> are enticing to hear, albeit not good enough to keep. I'll be giving my points next week then. Too much to give this week liao haha. Allow me to clear them first. Really, I noticed I give songs haphazardly these days. I need to listen to them more. Like a representative, yeah?<br><br><br>This is it then. My stomach feels so bad I need to take a trip to the toilet again. Until next time... take care of yourselves, people. The world is in chaos and I can't afford to get MC from my internship haha. Not that they are related anyway. I'm better off ranting here than posting on social media. Talking about posting on social media... careful of PayPal scams, yes?
