And the next month is going to be hell. Assignments, exams... more than enough to distract me from the fact that I have a final year project ongoing as we speak and I'm not doing any of it.<br><br>Man, student life is tough. Especially this last stretch. Let's talk about happy things, shall we?<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=JustBecause04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Just Because!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Love is all about care and concern, it seems. If you can sit down and don't give a **** then... it's over before it started. Speaking from personal experience haha</div></blockquote>This episode (#JustBecause04) if you don't mind me spoiling it, teaches us that one shouldn't just say sorry and walk away. Again, speaking from personal experience. Although my experience isn't as not-so-dramatic as these guys (it's worse haha), it's still worth mentioning. Souma finally confesses to Morikawa, with a... rather expected response. First things first, you have to assume that a lot of things happened within the three years Eita has left the group of middle schoolers when he was one too, and that is the basis of this show. They just cannot say the main point because once they say it, they just have to settle it because it's too obvious. Same thing here. The episode introduces us to a potential love triangle, with Natsume filling up the gap for being the one that likes Souma all this time. Add on Eita who probably also is in this making it a love rectangle (it's a thing now), things could not have been more complicated as we progress through this series. Drama pace is still at an all time low, plot points still felt a little off, and the story isn't well told in terms of overall situation, but hey, you get the meaning. Which explains why the title is such a case. I don't think I mentioned it this way before, but you should get it by now. It's complicated, it feels realistic (which is why it'll likely appeal to the Japanese audience than everyone else), and it's tiring to watch. But then, this may be what life at this point is, as the animation producers try to convey. I like its unique style though, but just as I mentioned last week, it can suffer from undesirable results because revealing the truth can either be great or be terrible. It's a risk to take, but I'll take it again. I want to see where this goes. Hey, we still got a love triangle. It's just... the other side of the rectangle broke off first instead of this side. You know what I mean.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBVQPg1ZIExySXqdgcL-QtccNvOfYAkAB3Xt9YgzsQTsbVYW3qWg0N79scdOjy42o5IqEngMnw0W2YihbME6sIjbRAF6k4fzhdpzZSya2b4cJj8bDgvuzgPFGLR3cfWccXpipin4tLSqgY/s320/justbecause04_dog.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I SWEAR this is everyone's reaction of this Anime haha<br>(Also, with respect to the show, the dog knows; The face shows it all)</table>P.S. Sorry for not mentioning Komiya, but Eita was right because she is weird. I think we know of the feel when someone has a favour to ask and starts poking on your weakness only to let you pay back a favour which is what they intended? Yeah, dirty methods in action, but I'm not the target so I don't care. On the other hand, it kind of worked on Eita, so whatever haha<br>P.P.S. Oh and if you think it's not obvious enough of that "it's none of your business" quote to be a thing in any romance Anime, you've not watched enough. Then again, Eita reacted, so this is forgivable. Try something new next time, producers. This one is too overly used. It's obvious this could've gone another way (which I would not suggest because I respect the show)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BlendS04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Blend S</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>I think the new character this week could be classified as a "Queen of Drama". Haha, no particular reference here; I just think she's very aligned with the Anime production haha</div></blockquote>Wow, this episode (#BlendS04) more than just took last episode and brought it up to another level, but let's talk about the new character first. She is Hanazono Folder, she's a doujinshi artist (if you don't know what that is she draws for a living, under indie works which typically portray current mainstream works; think cover songs but for manga), she's playing a(n) (elder) sister character (not talking about Mafuyu from here on) if you don't know what that is by now, and she's Amano Miu, that girl who left HER WORK in the shop the last time. Yes, it's all her. I'm glad it's voiced by someone I'm familiar with (the main girl from "Subete ga F ni Naru", Natsume from "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun"), and she does this role well. That, and the 2D character herself. Miu is totally right about lacking of a huge rack playing a sister role (even though I think it's unnecessary, but you can pad it if you want hehe), but then not like Kaho-san is doing it haha. Even so, the new addition brings life into the cafe once again. Well, not until everyone noticed how much they want more of Maika. Uh, I mean, her sadist character. So there goes her training. It works though, but considering this is a food joint throwing food will be against the rules and be a total waste of restaurant resources so yeah. Her usual unintentional sadistic (as mentioned by Dino) work ethic would suffice haha. I mean, why would you need more? She's <strike>dumb</strike> smart enough to come up with her own sadistic plays lol<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7vk8xJy_a4Fyf3Oe5zU-rVwOLpj77aFCAoxquhKWcAL91FTpUgLbU8ZLBXRiRcbja1A_GOZEHhYoop2nvY6sHfX6J_Fhk-Gj8bAY7wtTHYu8y-3Qu4qQKODXBlnzrSc7kzdGwkoUoTQ66/s320/blends04_agreement.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>From left to right: Any ally, USA, and USA state media lol</table>P.S. I feel like they may have touched on too much on talking about doujinshi production, like disagreements (unlike the image above lol) between manager and artist that we shouldn't know. On the other hand, it has spawned a lot on Miu's enthusiasm for writing everything she sees (include me in on this one haha), and classifying the drama in this show to be of inspiration material. As expected, Miu-chan is the "Queen of Drama". Haha no particular reference, I swear.<br>P.P.S. I know it's bad time to pick on Manga Time Kirara now (is this sponsored??) because <a href=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-10-16/manga-time-kirara-miracle-magazine-reveals-destinations-for-serialized-manga/.122771 target=_blank>they recently closed one of their magazines and are shifting some works into other publications</a>, but yeah, I thought Miu was the author of Blend S lol<br>(Oh one more thing. Remember the survey in the episode? I don't agree with the imouto one haha)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=HousekiNoKuni04><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Houseki no Kuni</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"HEY, MY DIAMOND!" &lt;= All fan reactions to seeing Dia (Damn you snail king; you did it haha) Okay, also BOOBS! Didn't expect to see any of them in this show haha</div></blockquote>And yet another episode arrives (#HousekiNoKuni04) and we talk about... betrayals?? Okay, not that first. We talk about history. Now we have a very good idea of what is of the past and present of this world. Ignoring what Kongo-sensei has dreamed about (considering he's the only human left probably), the legend that the snail king (I don't want to remember the name so this will do haha) (even though now I've seen the true form I'll consider again hehe) mentioned should give us a good idea of how this world now came about. In short, it was... 2000 years (according to Rutile) after humans have "met with disaster", I would say, and much in-fighting has caused them to cease to exist, but only to exist in three varied forms - people of the sea, the gem people, and last but not least, and moon people. Representing the flesh, bone and soul of their previous evolution, they have came into conflict of... being human again? Hey, sounds like a viable story, author, and I think I'm going to like it. And if this is the fact you cannot accept then please stop watching this show now because it's going to be a lot of these from now on. Totally expected (probably) the double cross of the series with the snail king, and yes, Phos would be a good trade for someone's release. Man, the moon people just want everything. Personally won't want snail shells though, but whatever. All in all, the conflict is just beginning, and if the moon people can be satisfied (or not) with Phos and no one else cares (but Dia) then maybe it's okay? Hey, I'm not fanning for any drama, but it's starting. On a side note, I appreciate the story-telling and the slow pace of this episode, because if this was mentioned too quickly there'll be no meaning to it anymore. I'm liking this show already, to be honest.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRa8pA9sZZpF0biB6-umGcYKz4nwFU9c3HXWoVQuF0a3UbllAVrJ1yGwezFYsSfC9xa9rPq2NfElfHZMNX3gx77fy4hrzX6aKGvlt4QUBgyPz4GJKEeeIDHdoNcR-lCgVYOnB2-q5Gasax/s320/housekinokuni04_phos.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When you have assignments to do and the exams are coming lol</table>P.S.

Once again, thanks Kongo-sensei for being straightforward in his dealings with Cinnabar and her duties. Then again, is this it? Well, next episode may see her return, so I'll look forward to that.<br>(And sorry for last week. You know what I mean.

You don't need Kiriyama's recollection or even me to tell you how much we have learnt from learning it ourselves, at our own interest and pace. This blog is proof for me, to say the least.</div></blockquote>The new episode (#3Lion25) besides featuring Yonezu Kenshi (yes, the guy who sang first season's 2nd ending song) as the end card graphic if you didn't notice, also features a stereotypical episode of this series, something we should remember when watching this show. Okay, happy things first. The grandfather is the best, and I'm glad to welcome back the Kawamoto sisters, two episodes after the second season started haha. Hey, seems like business is going well for the improvised sweets on the family shop, so that's good news. Then we have Nikaidou "irritating as hell" Harunobu, <strike>which</strike> who will constantly remind us of Kiriyama's silence (supposedly) to be taken as arrogance and the friend speaking out loud in ignorance will only make things worse. Hey, welcome to society, ladies and gentlemen. Last but not least, Kiriyama's flashback. I'll not mention much as to experience for yourself (by watching the show) will be better, but it reminds us of the fate that he has to bear losing his parents, moving into a shougi family which was frowned upon, and being discriminated as a kid. Hey, as a grown-up it's understandable for such things, but as a kid where one just wants to be with others, to feel love and to feel a sense of belonging, Kiriyama's childhood literally became a nightmare. Thanks, Kiriyama's family who died in an accident. On the other hand, that sliver of happiness of remembering the ladybug was great, but yeah, that was pretty much it. To understand how Kiriyama became to be referred to as a robot is not tough, as he has to drown his sadness in something, and that, is shougi. Hey people ask how you become good at this sometimes, and I tell them "a discriminating childhood, a**hole friends, and a whole lot of determination to make yourself happy", that's it. *laughs at everyone mocking at Kiriyama*<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOimZVWha5w-8u3pcqvnDQng08mPam0eVKNwk0v36PQx3HMjjvS9WzZxR0BTjKJbKYoejqvArCJDZOjqF7RMVuGPPfr0qmN1ddUfo0eHzG_0kxXO5LBYsRvVxTOfxuBk4z7C5EY8ZQHE5D/s320/sangatsunolion25_sisters.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I just want you to take a moment to take this all in.<br><br>...<br><br><br>...<br><br>AAAAAAAAAAAHHH THEY'RE BACK!!! lol</table>P.S. Oh dear granddad you're right; Momo IS the best grandchild you have. MVP this episode? Maybe not. After seeing Hina's injury at the end, I'm going to say her. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Is it bad to just be always giving concern and never getting any love back in return? Thanks Kiriyama for the concern, and I'm sorry for your past haha (Such is life, people. Live with it.)<br>P.P.S. I wonder what Hina-chan is worried about.

Sure, but then again the stress is there I guess. Making Kokonotsu take over the store is going to be tough, and he can't do that forever anyways (he's totally resisting temptations though) (okay maybe not Hotaru haha), so yeah, that is that.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=268 data-original-width=450 height=190 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEig1lecY52X4ApgEgGX-hI7jda7HfOHcdLmHe-1xiLdkW2VPBDpEbMofmtb7paMmkgu-Gc7adWlyq9BhbLMuK_hdgQxH4-mlJ_fgFhLX6AsKKu_dDc8uqt3JUT-7qFMN0T8NR1BkoXBfpFf/s320/img000006.png style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>When you notice your dad is more childish than you lol</table><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>I don't know how much to write here, honestly.<br><br>Sometimes there's a lot of songs, and sometimes, there are weeks like that. Well, <b>Porno Graffitti's new album</b> should be appearing and I'm supposed to give chance to <b>Touyama Nao's first album</b> after her wonderful single for that anime two seasons ago, but yeah, none of them are available yet. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Maybe buying songs will be the solution someday. Next week brings us a couple of Anime releases (I know because I've been updating my stuff over the weekend which is why I know) including <b>yanaginagi's new single</b>(s) featuring the Anime "Just Because!" opening theme song (I'm not giving the other one) and... this is pretty much it I guess. I'll update as I go. Now I just want to get my hands on new songs so I can give them and done with it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Haha the stress is getting to me.<br><br>More news approaches as Mizuno, the guy who writes the lively songs (mostly) in Ikimonogakari, will be writing a song for our dear <b>Hanazawa Kana</b>-chan on her new single which is likely next year, <b>fumika and Goose house confirmed their new singles</b> to appear next month, and <b>Ayachi's new best album song</b>... I'm not pledging allegiance to the fan club. Not with this song. Meanwhile, I'm obsessed with the Anime "Blend.S" opening theme song for some reason (hehe), and I'm giving the latest song from last year for <b>Kiriku to Majou</b>, which I swear I did hear and did not give last year. Oh well, never too late to give songs, I always say. I also took the time to take a listen to <b>the album from "a flood of circle"</b> but can't seem to give their rock style. I guess I'll just take the topic song only, I guess. Also, today I listened to <b>SWANKY DANK's new album</b>, and... I guess I'm not in the mood for punk rock now. Sorry, guys.<br><br><br><br>This is it then. Cya guys next week, and until then... it'll take some time to do 16v2, and 17 is in progress. Yeah, that's how much I want to distract myself from school stuff. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> I wish this year will be over so I can start lining up the songs in ranking. Yeah, this year's Top 20 is going to be tough too, I guess. I haven't thought of who would be in it though so I better start thinking now.<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2017 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
