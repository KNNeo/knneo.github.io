Yeah. I've not been finding new songs, to say the least. But at least there's Anime to spend the weekend on. But besides that, that's pretty much it. Next week will definitely be better, I would say.<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AliceToZouroku03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Alice to Zouroku</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Wow what a surprise. No action. No, not no action. No surprise. Of what people who are called to be. And Sana-chan is a good exception to that, which might just make me watch this show after all.</div></blockquote>This new episode (#AliceToZouroku03) introduces another ability user (because I'm sick of talking about Alice), and just to clarify what I meant above, as with last week I expected action. Like, a fight or something. Turns out we don't have to watch any of that. The research facility hired a professional to deal with it. With superb power and swift action. Well, if magic is involved you can change the location of the toilet which shouldn't be too surprising, but what's more surprising is that obvious leak at the end of the episode (as with all cliffhanger episodes), which obviously hints on the widow ability user being manipulated by people of the research facility after all. Hmm... not surprising already? I won't want to watch this part of the show though. The dark, gloomy, evil or even inhumane side of the story. But hey, I may just stay around. If you see me talk about this next week means I've probably gotten used to the theme songs which are not going to release until next month, so...<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsheTKmOU6n97yV0OPVaW8uUqWn5sk0VnglOpV0UZkiGAc9jIh4urWHZu_PcvGg5sl2SbpqwXhxqE5jacMfr-Bzu3d_vtv-Ltoq15GcHRmumEPBrlgyIO-ruQ_BMrP25q0RoVGIIkOVWyV/s320/alicezouroku03_carlsjr.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Uh... thanks to Carl's Jr. for sponsoring this episode haha<br>Really, how much money did this show get from the fast food chain??</table>P.S. Little did I notice how wonderful the animation is, because it's done by J.C Staff, pretty much the animation studio who brought you all things cute. An example includes Toradora!, as far as I can remember.<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TsukiGaKirei03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Tsuki ga Kirei</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Thank goodness Akane-chan doesn't know literature, right?? Haha, I mean, do you know the title of this show is also a love confession statement? She doesn't know lol</div></blockquote>This new episode (#TsukiGaKirei03) I don't know if it brought anyone closer, but hey, I think something's happening. After a long episode of talking about everyone in exams, Akane-chan beating her own record in runs and Kotarou spending a day at the festival rehearsals apparently, they finally met. Hey, it is no coincidence when some girl comes by to see if you're still there, really. In turn, or so I think, Kotarou gives both of them a chance and asks her out so that damn Hira-kun will never get a chance haha. Okay, I'm trying to be nice and all, but the focus here is most definitely not on the insert song which is a cover song by the wonderful seiyuu who brought you the theme songs, but on the last two minutes at the end. Really, cringing so much even without the asking to go out line. I mean, you can just message and ask, and get rejected. Just like me. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span> Okay, enough of me, but who knows what will happen next. Right??? There's THE SCHOOL TRIP after all MUAHAHAHAHAHA<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgszHgd94PWn6oJACmD7Oh0euphSIsfoV0S8ObAffTG8MjbrC6APIyizptJLNfv8rM8Ws0z_tsVuNDNliEmmBQUVKCXF5ZWmcjS29_WoatN3bDWvAXUj0av4e0A1lMvLEK_7CVN8JB3LPNz/s320/tsukigakirei03_LINE.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't feel like talking about why there's curved screen edges on this "iPhone", okay?<br>I just don't want to spoil the plot (process) after this image haha</table>P.S. MVP Chinatsu? Nah, MVP LINE for kindly sponsoring the conversations between the couple. Couldn't have made this show happen without you. Okay, they aren't using it enough in the second half of the episode, but still. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Then again, I wished I had a phone back then so I can message the heck out of her. Then again I think Kotarou may have made (better) decisions that I would otherwise not (be able to) anyway. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span><br>More:<br>~ Thanks Hira-kun for NOT spoiling Akane's run if he has anything he wants to say to her. You can haveÂ <strike>Chinatsu</strike>Â <strike>Aoi</strike>Â one of her friends if you want haha<br>~ Good life advice on that random book you flipped in the library, Kotarou. Good advice.<br>~ Damn all the messaging it's great to be young #messagelife Not compared to actually talking to each other though #reallife Then again both make me cringe so much this is by far the best romance show I've watched #cringelife<br>~ No really, there's a third person around. He spotted you guys going to a corner. I guess that's the focus for the next episode, really. I hope not, these two are trying so hard to get together already.<br>~ Kotarou is being a d*ck for not replying back to Chinatsu though. Oh what, you only like Akanecchi? *laughs hard*<br>(<a href=https://randomc.net/2017/04/20/tsuki-ga-kirei-03/comment-page-1/#comment-2266521 target=_blank>My comment at RC</a>)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=EromangaSensei03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Eromanga-sensei</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Wow what an episode. This show has so far amazed me with every episode, and I hope it continues to, because... anything erotic is great! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>This new episode (#EromangaSensei03) talks more about Yamada Elf-sensei which we have been hinted last week, and turns out, she's the new neighbour. Hey, not that surprising after you noticed some class representative brought the whole class out to get one student back to school (lol), but who can resist a naked girl playing piano replacing the image of a rumoured ghost? (Okay, thanks for reading the summary cya next week lol) Anyways, Masamune thought this might be a good time to be interested and invested with his time on an idolised author and challenger Elf-sensei but then notices she doesn't do anything at all. I mean, I get the point why inspiration takes a wider form when you only write when there's something good on your head, but Masamune's way of work is also much desired by others, in that you write until something good comes out. Not to mention continuously writing and getting inspiration helps in honing your writing skills and boost creative thinking as a whole. Hey, that's why I don't get kids haha. Then again, someone's a genius for hitting the top ranks this young (and buying a landed property with the profits lol), and someone's sister is definitely interested in what's happening next door (even though the person in question between the two is literally her), so I can't wait to see what's going to happen when Elf-sensei really starts writing something. Hey, hopefully it'll be a masterpiece. But if it's female lead taking over all her clothes within a second then no thanks. I'll read Masamune's works instead MUAHAHAHA (Suck it, Yamada-sensei) (no really don't; I'm not into schoolgirls or even little girls in general lol)<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjE4ricvZluMXKc_qw6_KBYl2WWi62vwN830ly54gwcuk0pgbqCDQw53rloQElWnDBMgrz98EeV2ugWxfsmHbh74cd9ntnChr4h4YqOANXYE32L_vF_B20dPtZA03GXeb9g3aKwR4Bxcbiw/s320/eromangasensei03_masamune.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I wish I have this much motivation if my sister told me to do something.<br>Then again I don't have a little sister, so... *thumbs up and winks*</table>P.S. MVP Sagiri because she still wins in this show's harem level on her brother's scale haha<br>P.P.S. The pace of this episode is a lot more different though, even if it's still as exaggerated as ever. But still, if this is the general pace of the show I guess I am okay. Oreimo was kind of like this too, so I guess it's fine. It's really your standard Anime cliches and storyline, so it can't be bad.<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan29><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Hey guess what? We have a Titan amongst us. Really, if it's surprising to you you haven't been paying attention in the past few episodes. You should've gotten a hint along the way.</div></blockquote>The new episode (#AttackOnTitan29) talks about more of the fighting the guys are struggling on the tower, then again it was all well planned and it's just a one-way route to Hell, but hey, there is one last draw. Somehow, Ymir, one of the recruits, also had Titan power. I guess we'll know more of that next week along with the promise between Ymir and Cristia (I'm trying not to read from the episode their names lol). Also, shoutout to the other guys who have been working hard especially Reiner who just got Best Human Award for being the bravest to spot the Titan in the tower, fend him off and get rid of it out of the tower itself. Hey, I can only give awards. They're all going to &lt;insert hideous phrase here> anyway? I don't know. There might be still hope.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRe_A0-mJ6yLmQK7vVV0nqmi1sAUbcDTdE7FMhoXdI2tjP_1q6-0gV5JT3e_h0KK0jcdUsSkRnrKB4T-MfPjFSK-H4LDqWQSvoR_lh9G6bvyg188P31-ICPQKWAOxp1NQTqYoFgkciUH1x/s320/attackontitan29_titan.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Best shot of the episode.<br>And that's how you get someone out of your home lol</table>P.S. From the preview Ymir's Titan form is small. Really small compared to the bigger ones that were gotten rid off by the ones that died. I know. What a sacrifice, actually. Good job, warriors. You'll be remembered. Well, as much as this season goes, I guess.<br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>MANGA</span></div></blockquote>I'll settle those next week. Don't have much time this week because I played too much on that one game haha. Then again, mobile games today can be addictive, but PC games are still the thing. I wished I had more time to play though; Transport Fever is a game that requires time to pass. Just like a mobile game! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><br>Yah, so... no. Not this week.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week is quiet week in Klassic Note. Nonetheless, I celebrated with a journey back in time as usual every other day, not and including "Hashimoto Eriko Appreciation Day" (no seriously, it's fake), and if I remember next year I'll probably do it again haha. I've walked out of Japanese music to listen to an artist or two who don't sing Japanese, like the one below. But hey, hard to find such artists these days. Ah, singer-songwriters are the best.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en> If you recall being interviewed by a reporter from where I live, Charlotte Campell, you've got yourself a listener.<a href=https://t.co/zoachr5sGX target=_blank>https://t.co/zoachr5sGX</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/854671638989684737 target=_blank>April 19, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset=utf-8 src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><br>(*Oops screwed up the spelling; sorry Campbell; didn't mean to.)<br>Next week brings us quite a couple of releases which I will be looking forward to (hopefully also in Apple Music) unlike some few who haven't appeared till date. <b>ClariS' new single</b> will remind you one heck of a music video and hopefully some better songs will be in it so I can finally give them a single? We shall see. <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new single</b> also appears next week, and honestly saying, still the best performing artist this season; I can feel it.<br><br>Seriously, I need to go find new songs. I'm going to be bored soon if I don't, and I'm not referring to my life haha. Besides, the yearly (kind of) <a href=https://rojack.jp/ target=_blank>indie artist awards</a>Â (in terms of performance opportunities) are round the corner. Time to vote, if I can find anything decent out there this year.<br><br><br>This is it then. Can't wait to go back to play more because I've got commitments to hold. But that's life, right? Sometimes you got to commit. To four Anime, new songs every week, new manga every once in a while, and seasonal music video reviews starting next week probably. Cya guys next time then, and until next time... I may just think of reshuffling this news thing so I can don't write in a full list as if I'm a lazy guy who can't organise his post contents. Then again, this doesn't feel like a magazine, doesn't it? Hmm, I'll think about it.
