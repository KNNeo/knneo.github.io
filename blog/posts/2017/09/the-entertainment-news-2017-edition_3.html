Man, public holidays sure pass by fast lol goodbye Friday. Anyways, let's get to it. I may still have some time to play a new game if I finish this. Well, I'll talk about it later if I remember. It's called "Universim".<br><br><br> (*Viewing sequence not changed but I just want something else in the thumbnail haha)<br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TsurezureChildren09><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Tsurezure Children</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Wow. Just wow. If I keep getting amazed every episode for an Anime does that mean that this show has done it? Or I just like confession scenes? Hmm...</div></blockquote>The new episode (#TsurezureChildren09) brings us more of the love we know and... love. The MVP couple (haha TAKANO MVP!!!) comes with an obligatory swimming class, and this one... I must say Takano you are VERY rejecting of yourself. I mean, Sugawara canNOT be looking at the fence, okay? I'm glad he <em>did</em> say it though, which is what I said from episode 1. Reminds me of that something from Anime "WORKING!!" somehow. You know, saying it in a cool manner, but this is good enough hehe. Kamine is still worried about choking on her first kiss somehow, and this Gouda thinks that it's enough. Hmm, a stereotypical example of men not understanding women? Hey, understanding is a pillar in maintaining a relationship, if this show hasn't taught you enough. Talking about misunderstandings, the Takase couple also suffers the same problems after that awkward confession email. "Where is the hug from behind scene?" ("Senpai!!" *insert Katori image here*) It's what I would like to say, but nah, they can be friends. But I know, it's not enough. We can't only be friends on this show haha. Last but not least, we get to see how Minagawa can be serious, which is never. The production also kindly brought in one of their spare curtains to mindf**k us as much as Furuya is at this point. I mean, just reject the heck out of her and that's it. If she cared she will then say it. Or never. Oh well, I don't know romance too, I guess.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfZOJnsk2KHuAg_4_QWT9fencMkXQTEwOiwQNYOjhuNiVLM7Q4x78l6ilGVkCcg0A_B6cFX33yyOGdgOeY8rea-PkC9Ah4FFtf9wyq8mjJ4xMWqQYNiMoz6WADP4YUlZwO7gnP1iGSKEuI/s320/tsurezurechildren09_look.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is pretty much me (right) when I stare at girls (left) I like back then.<br>They don't look back at me though haha Sugawara you lucky guy</table>P.S. If I'm Kamine (which is never; not even in drama) you bet I'll be pulling Gouda's head down to mine as I lie on his lap. Now <em>that</em> will be a salvaging kiss. Let <em>him</em> choke on it haha<br>P.P.S. I like how I get to think on Sugawara's point of view because I know I hinted to many about liking them but them girls don't react. Maybe that's why. Hmm...<br>(Edit: At the intro I'm like "Those who have fever" Wait don't you have fever, Takano? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span>)<br>(Edit edit because I can haha: Is it just me or the animation quality dropped? With respect to previous episodes. I mean, Sugawara technically is not running properly, you know haha)<br>[<a href=https://randomc.net/2017/08/30/tsurezure-children-09/comment-page-1/#comment-2295586 target=_blank>My comment on RC</a>]<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AhoGirl09><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Aho Girl</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>I like how this show remind me that tears are a woman's greatest weapon. Can't win a fight? Just cry. It's that easy haha poor Akkun</div></blockquote>The new episode (#AhoGirl09) is... I don't know to appreciate this idiot or stomp on her more because she is definitely winning over the otaku audience with this week's stories. First, she thanks us by making the Prez let others fondle her (of course not you idiot <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span>) and then sing the opening theme song (if you have been skipping it and not listened to angela's latest single) perfectly changing the lyrics along the way... man, comedy level maxed out liao this show haha. On the other side, I pity Akkun who cannot win any girl in a conflict (I meant what I wrote in the intro), the Prez who can reject every guy who confesses to her but cannot reject this idiot's reasoning lol, and drunk Sayaka. Drunk Sayaka is the best. Cannot second that liao. MVP this episode. Even I feel bad now. Then again, there is flat chest fetish, so she shouldn't feel too bad about that. Now let me confess my love and get rejected by you Sayaka so I can fondle your chest HAHAHA (man, that setup; I'm impressed by myself lol)<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=499 data-original-width=888 height=179 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5FzF4U90DwbhcHrqBC7zAXDzzMzMeJYmcRNsEo5LdWa2Nt_yI7vdQv2NlLWh2bt3Rjj1xeDVxIbwu-ldp30s_Rq6xsyuZXGU-A5p9y6OmvoJxU5pL6KX_zH3icjY6i2Mdpza3qu3LTtnA/s320/1uz7qe.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Spread the word, everyone.

Then again, cannot imagine people who never play games and can get hooked to clearing a game overnight. I know I won't, but this can be an easy exception. I guess that's what the author thought of to do in this scene. Good job, author. You're not an idiot <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span> after all haha<br>P.P.S. Now if Sumipe would let me- <strike>*gets leg choke slammed by Sumipe*</strike> Or so I wish hahaha<br>[<a href=https://randomc.net/2017/08/30/aho-girl-09/comment-page-1/#comment-2295590 target=_blank>My comment on RC</a>]<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Gamers08><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Gamers!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Someone just give me like the full video of the five characters playing the board game PLEASE! I'll be laughing all the way I assure you haha</div></blockquote>And I thought last episode was good enough already. The new episode (#Gamers08) introduces a new character?? Is it too late for this now? But then, it's no surprise (thanks to Twitter) that it's someone related, and in this case, it's Hoshinomori Chiaki's sister, Konoha. For this girl, she, like her own sister, is also a gamer. But, only being a serious girl is just an image for her dirty hobby. I mean REAL dirty. Well, she likes eroge. Kind of putting it in the same level as a certain sister from Anime "Eromanga-sensei", but for Konoha this extends to judging everyone around her too, which can be very creepy. What's more important is she knowing of Amano's thoughts on games, and what that might do to contribute to his and Chiaki's relationship in the future I have no idea. For now, the guys just hang out and play a romance game (which is probably the best and worst decision ever, Uehara) whilst trying to clear some misunderstandings. Well, not until Chiaki noticed the truth that Uehara has known of since like, 5 episodes ago haha. Hey, all these characters here aren't good at communication, so this will only make things worse for Tendou and Amano himself. So... this can go anywhere, seriously, and I really wonder how this series is going to end. Chiaki is freaking out already, that innocent girl <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGH5RD5luZZjiIyoCFwCQpNRdMIDfegtYyK71H-ztrMKuZ8HJCVH1lsw5XS77SW0z82LDB6NfSI8ooyxX17knJqVgE69cc6wneEp2hNg7kG3vTtj8DQw2g9nDpx_YWRhWtZzJoiCxXg6Ia/s320/gamers08_konoha.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Haha this girl's look is just wrong no matter how much I explain it</table>P.S. Am I the only one who can TOTALLY predict when Uehara is going to give his "haha I got them" face?? RIGHT?? I'm just laughing throughout every time he does a normal face and that pops out haha poor voice actor who voices his chap<br>P.P.S. I never really mentioned what Konoha may have in terms of knowing Tendou for whatever reason because I don't believe it'll drop in just yet. Well, her sister is quite literally the best avenue for this (considering this show NEVER does direct communication unless there's Uehara) so we can but hope it'll give us an answer someday.<br>(Edit: To summarise the board game gameplay, I only remember Aguri and Amano banging it hard on the bed they have to keep replacing it hahahahaha this show is just wrong)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=InariKonKon01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha.</span></div></blockquote>Well <a href=https://ddnavi.com/interview/397237/a/ target=_blank>recently</a> I was mesmerised by Oozora Naomi (Audience: "Recently"??) (Oh shut up) so I went to find out her other roles in Anime, namely her first major role got me interested, but barely. The first episode (#InariKonKon01) of this 2014 Anime (in Anime years it's old already lol) feels like every other supernatural power story featuring school romance and gaining godly powers which she shouldn't have, but it has a twist - all the characters are in an accent. Yeah. "Oosaka-ben", they call it. Which is also what Naomi-chan is good at apparently (well the others are okay too tbh), and she herself is from Osaka anyway, which kind of makes her shine in this particular role. But yeah it feels too detached from the traditional approach (I mean the god is playing gal games lol) and maybe a little too much comedy. Then again I expected it to be an action show, so whatever. When you <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/20457/Inari_Konkon_Koi_Iroha target=_blank>read the synopsis</a> you'll know. Also, I don't want to give any of the theme songs, so no thanks, this show. I'll search for something else.<br>P.S. Just one thumbnail to remember <strike>Iroha</strike> Inari-chan by, yes?<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsa8OSKKWIQQ2s7UvH4BW9OqFbfNBcfT-7oTJ-hGjQn9s4RveDDBTZhXnGVjxiflMTQ7qy4_JOy08WFHj01dsqYBmQBWIgL6UKHvpAr6RZ93cp9XBO1-HjFXvZMKmH0Vj2bWa3CBprpPou/s320/inarikonkon1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you like the looks of this girl and the magic that's coming out of it this is for you<br>(*This image does not feature the main girl but does feature her totally unclothed lol)</table><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq manga"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>MANGA</span></div></blockquote>After a long streak, it appears we don't have any (newly released I've read before because I had the time to) new chapters this week. Hmm, time to start reading the others I've wanted to read. I did start on Acchi Kocchi earlier this year, just... I didn't have the time to read all of them. We'll see.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>Â <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week, as mentioned last week, is a week for a couple of important releases. And as such, if you hadn't noticed (or maybe you didn't I didn't Tweet anything anyway haha) <u>I'll be doing a couple of reviews next week</u>. Yeah. I wished it's this week. Next week is hell for me. Okay, the singles. <a href=https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/d1/4b/78/d14b78f4-d521-c8d3-c69c-6b36ba954ee0/source/268x0w.jpg target=_blank><b>negoto's new single</b></a> is not disappointing at all, and as such, I made the decision to order it the moment I finished on the review the first time I heard it from Apple Music Japan. <a href=https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/3a/79/be/3a79be18-dfee-dff2-c5be-912da1104cc8/source/268x0w.jpg target=_blank><b>Natsukawa Shiina's 2nd single</b></a> is also in the list now, and I cannot resist giving the single despite the topic song being rather unsatisfactory. More on those two later, and let's not forget <a href=https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/2e/60/a3/2e60a386-e911-da69-6fcd-abfec0c2eeb8/source/268x0w.jpg target=_blank><b>SPYAIR's new single</b></a> in view of their new album which will release soon. I think it's okay, but as I said, they are the kind of bands without fresh styles (refer to Aqua Timez) and without fresh melodies (on the same style), it'll get boring easy. That's me on the B-side. Think LuckLife if you need more examples of bands who cannot reach out to other instruments for some reason. Hey, I'm not complaining. I like their styles. Yoru no Honki Dance and LILI LIMIT are good evidence I haven't gotten sick of them. But you know, it's not unique enough, the new songs.<br><br>Next week brings us... hmm that Anime "Gamers!" ending theme which idol group name I don't remember (ok <b>Luce Twinkle Wink</b> I'm sorry), and <b>Porno Graffitti's new single</b> in about a year. I've heard on their latest YouTube Live broadcast (yeah there's such a thing apparently, started from April this year) on their new song "Montage" and it's not that great. Well, when the single comes (if ever) I'll give a listen. They've gotten momentum over the past few years, and I want to hear more. On other things, the new season of <b>Anime "Sangatsu no Lion" announced its theme songs</b>, and I don't know who Brian the Sun is haha. They sound... I hope the Anime will change my impression of them. Fingers crossed. YUKI, I don't have to worry. I'm prepared to be amazed by her.<br><br>Oh, just to end this, I've watched the live video of <a href=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/adm_image/common/artist_image/70005000/70005303/jacket_image/161720__220_220_0.jpg target=_blank><b>Tomatsu Haruka's latest live performance</b></a> from her best album, and what a journey. Listening to all the songs including "Asu Iro no Himawari" - the best song that suits her in my opinion - Â it brings back a lot of memories. Man, I know I didn't give her the best albums, and I did skip a song or two on this video, but hey, I still liked her. Her singing of songs, of course.<br><br><br>This is it then. Back to the game I'm playing just now I guess. It feels like an unfinished product (yep it is, and it's free for now) (for real), and it's quite a basic civilisation builder with incremental development. I've been in for 60 in game years and... I've got my first death. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span> Haha I'm fine. I just wished incineration wasn't my first choice because I researched that instead of a cemetery first lol. Cya guys next time then, and until next time... my final year project is killing me, and I'm trying to finish 16v2. I assure you I'm working on it. I noticed I had to fix more stuff than expected.
