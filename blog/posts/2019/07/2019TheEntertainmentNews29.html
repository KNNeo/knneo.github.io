Getting tired and sleeping for the weekend? Well, that' my life now lol<br><br> Anyways, change of plans for this week's Entertainment News. Since I'll be picking up that JK Anime (lol review below, last week's episode btw) here's the following arrangement: There will be an Anime Extra with Takagi and the latest episode of JoshiMuda instead of Takagi here so I can catch up with the other Anime too, and from here on I'll start Entertainment News with last week's Takagi so I don't have to do the extra border thing haha I hope someone noticed it<br><br> Why? Because... it's easier. Because I can sleep on weekdays too. Haha let's move on I'm sad I can't even watch long YouTube gameplay videos now I used to do that all the time too<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AraOto03><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I thought it'll be fine once we get into high school..." Izumi, if Kazusa got laid already then she'll forget about you, bro. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>Sonezaki, you can just... buy them online, you know? Fashion magazines. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, the new episode (#AraOto03). Hmm... I don't know how to describe it. Well, there was progression, to say the least. Firstly, they got an advisor, the Literature Club. It took them some effort asking all the teachers in the school which basically hates them and some of the teachers be like "I want work life balance" and just chose not to help the girls out. Oh well, you win, old man. Guess we gotta go for new teachers then haha. Probably someone young and handsome and IT EXISTS!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Well, he was blackmailed into this though so... thanks Hongo-senpai somehow you saved the club lol. I wouldn't admit that that is the reality here, but in the Anime at least it seems like everyone knows a little about those things. <em>You know the word.</em> Like Yamagishi-sensei here who actually chats with girls online. *looks at him* You know, and Hongo just happens to be talking with him online, that's all. They decide to meet up and... yeah. That's kinda awkward. And that's why you don't chat online with strangers things can be deceiving and it almost always turns out bad. Moving on, there's Kazusa's new discovery. I mean, if his mother telling you to go to his room to take something other than porno, you know the girl is going to take the <strike>DVD</strike> Blu-Ray too haha. ("It's a Sony" lol sorry for the Anime "Kannagi" reference that no one will get) And that's why you watch porno online haha. (Damn, who am I teaching here? Haha) Okay anyways (I may have revealed plenty of my experience, so... allow me to shake your brain off them) Kazusa thought it was wise to bring it back home and let Izumi not be able to find it in his room... And yeah, the girl felt bad and decided to return it, how kind. Somehow she realised that Izumi is still the same all those years, (So wait, she watched it??) (Alone??) (Whilst groping herself?? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span>) (Yeah probably not she is "too pure pure girl") (okay I promise last Kannagi reference haha) and trying to watch adult content that doesn't pollute (not transportation joke here) his current interest for trains (Aren't buses the same? A <a href=https://jisho.org/search/chikan target=_blank>chikan</a> is still a chikan, man) (ok maybe Kazusa doesn't know lol) but as Izumi mentioned the likely reality is that he doesn't think of girls like this in real life even if he jerks off to fiction. Also #RealityCheck, by the way. So yeah, popular guy who jerks off to porno probably won't get laid to any extent, unless... well landing on top of someone is so cliche as a romance plot, and considering this show is sick in itself I'm not going to think too much. Kazusa too, is trying to maybe ask her parents about... not "esuibatsu", so well at least she knows child birth is going to suck lol. Lastly, also due to Izumi's confrontation of the girl who took a video of him being confessed to not Kazusa. (Hey, it's gotta happen someday but seeing Episode 2 I highly doubt so tbh) So Sugawara is nailing it so far, questioning how Izumi thinks otherwise because... girls think about that word too. I would like to argue that she is right so far down the road, but yeah she probably learnt it as a kid from others so probably no practical experience like the other four. Still, not that I know of it (like, really), but if that is the case, isn't all these perfectly normal for high school students? Even the jerk off part too. It's more on this series too to focus on the effects of talking such touchy topics that will make it stand out in the future. And seeing how Sonezaki is so distracted by the fact that someone thinks she looks (potentially) like a model? Man we gonna have good stories to tell in future episodes. The <strike>masturbation</strike> cute girls hooked me in lol, now for the probably sad stories to hit me good. "Please, do it softly. I know it's a lot of pain but..." Haha okay let's stop here<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9vWiMTCaVribb06f8yICaVFlbQyh-ILdTbWr-q9y4Z1UKlLDgInTGEtCJgXndafXvpC5OJfAkmSD5wmLy9NqAuWVqGmPoLde21rEqTtJG1IRKjixxJW-TpNpdAEMAevy2lRUFszqPSQs/s320/araoto03_kazusa2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Don't worry Kazusa I also got Episode 1 flashbacks and I'm a straight male lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5j4H7pwfVQlviA5rMWoDs8YPF3vYYQXZjUjPaXL-rcTdkfSdfo9Oue85WK6Lpdy2DZYwPG5yaw4EkVclKKNP_vnp-W67Md85MXpLpslPqtxB9YC43HlehHtq-F02Xf2MKCxlBjYzRlzE/s320/araoto03_izumi2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>TFW someone took away your secret stash lmao<br> (Again, keep it safe even if your mom never steps into your room which I highly doubt so)</table></div></div>P.S.

"Girls think about it too" #mindblown haha no but really? Either this or Hongo-senpai's online chat is correct. It's one or the other haha (all not true we're not even in that realm)<br> [Here's a GIF because I looked at Hongo looking down at herself and I'm like "Where have I seen an Anime done this before" and I think that was a porno lmao okay I think DomeKano had it too what is wrong with all these shows]<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEix9Srgwn1CW51LzWkdwKxLmmSf4l4KV_ow5eOamhEkRCwq6tX_5u7QWlSuS1ctQ5d90qvd9r2kAjF2VKoblhkBWs1F2z1ZvNGF8Tu0upGUUmxMj7Vae-1ea2lA5ueSTYLmdEIkjZZVVso/s320/araoto03_escaping_short.gif style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when my superior doesn't have any more things for me anymore lol</table><br><blockquote class=tr_bqanime id=JoshiMuda02><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Joshikousei no Mudazukai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Hey, can I say something amazing right now?" NO. *watches on* Okay I have the most critical of replies lmao</div></blockquote>Why am I back? Well besides finding a replacement for that magic screw-up Anime (lol not true btw), I still think this Anime has potential. Yes, over the same exact style but with boys years ago, that Anime. Yes, it's because of popular <a href=https://jisho.org/search/joshi target=_blank>joshi</a> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/seiyuu target=_blank>seiyuu</a>, ladies and gentlemen. No really, the one guy in the YouTube comments for the opening theme is so correct "The Wasteful Days of Popular Voice Actresses" <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> There are SO MANY JOKES in every episode, I gotta quote ALL of them?? And then I realised I do this all the time on other shows too haha so here's not the latest episode (#JoshiMuda02). In this one, we talk mostly about the life of Akane, the otaku girl. The one that has to come up with tsukkomi because the other one doesn't have to or probably won't (why), and the one who has the most potential to be normal. I mean, look at that girl who keeps thinking about the Dark Soul lmao. Anyways, she'll get her time, so let's talk manga. You guys know I have a fair knowledge about the world of manga. Okay just joking, but yeah, this girl is going to be MVP every episode, just a heads-up. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> She looks the most normal, thinks about her aspiration to be a manga artist in the future, and is still (maybe) (somewhat actively) practising on it. Someday, girl, you will make it. Meanwhile, she troubles on her drawing skills as pointed out by her other friend Robo (because if passed to that idiot...) and probably also conveyance of expression in her stories. Yeah, probably obstacles you need to overcome to be a good artist, but hey, everyone has that stage. Not the knees-locking part though that one I think she needs to take some drawing lessons lol. Other than that, she thinks quite seriously in her dreams, somewhat motivated by that idiot to continue I guess. Wait, is that it? I've finished talking about her? Okay, personal opinion time. WHAT I THINK... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In general, Tomacchan as this girl is awesome. Tomboyish or whatever, this voice is it. Having to be a sadist (in speech), to be serious most of the time, and literally a crazy fanatic at <a href=https://jisho.org/search/BL target=_blank>BL</a> (man, this) too... she nails everything straight on. As expected from a veteran lmao. To add on, Akane is really cute. Arguably better than Loli. There, I said it. Well mainly because I'm not a loli, and then again it's probably because she's the perfect definition of a JK: innocent, has a dream, has friends who can shit on each other (mine don't, for a start), likes dudes (on dudes), and is still a real girl in heart. Pure I don't know, but a maiden she is. For that, I would stay just to watch already tbh. To conclude, sorry for the Anime production to have to animate whatever Akane drew as a kid lol, and I'm glad I stayed to watch this particular episode. Next episode... the Dark Soul might be upon us. Although I think it might just be the teacher chasing after <strike>high school girls</strike> future college girls and trying to fix them before it's too late. Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Cya guys next week<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgaqxvBc7xbcHHCf1nUfTAKYqqWQCCvlYkWdWRHJEF9pD_f6_S2U2hQYJwJY3uoDWs_9YqW6SXA8XC2giglZGm3AmIqAQGp5zucYiH1MJ4XkvaloMQmE43yHR8-Iq0kKjgiRaOusj55Xhc/s320/jyoshimuda02_sleep.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>AKANE-CHAN FEVER!! lol<br> (Even when she sleeps she's so cute hehe)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgftVOhD5YM63tah_rwSIwAdDeUiJkfqIpVaaaYA0CRQ1zagJf1uQG6hW6aST7DSpOrV5DpBN9dO_QQngNzDYWY0lazZl4DaQ7YKAfSuohoGnv9RM_TNaj20PzBqLyc27M-HEB08-ZqWzI/s320/jyoshimuda02_corner.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>AKANE-CHAN FEVER!! lol<br> (WTF is she reflecting in a corner? lmao)</table></div></div>P.S.

I am really hesitant to give it, to be honest. So yeah, it'll stay for another week. Also released this week was Iwasaki Ai's new digital single which is... very different from her usual music style, so I guess that's fresh. I also gave <b>SIX LOUNGE's new releae</b> on like, the one topic song since it didn't get any better, and yeah listening for the 2nd time I still gave up on <b>KANA-BOON's new single</b>. Oh well, guess I need to take a break from those guys then.<br><br> And thanks to me giving that Anime above which is all the hype right now for me lol I'll probably listen to the <b>theme song single for Anime "JoshiMuda"</b>. That... should be it. Okay maybe the releases from this week too.<br><br> On other news, <b>Natsukawa Shiina's new album finally surfaced on Apple Music</b> (Japan), <b>YUKI's music library is in Apple Music</b> (Japan) for some reason but still doesn't include her latest releases from at least within the past 12 months. If <b>yucat's new single</b> will appear on streaming next week I may just give it a listen, and I've give a listen to a couple of music videos recenrly from <b>Friends</b> and <b>MaRuRi to Ryuga</b> if you still remember them. Eh... considering the former is not doing their own usual style due to singing for a drama tie-in and the latter not sounding any better not looking at the video... I'll see if I can give it as they release in the following months.<br><br><br><br><br> That's it, man. I got bored of writing here already which should explain why I can keep my promises to write weekly additional posts besides this one since now weekly just reminds me of the fact that I have to go back to work again and I could compensate for some sleep. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> Why has it become like this though? But good news, the company is considering flexible working hours so... 4 day work week? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Well coming to work an hour later every day is already a good start for me I could use a more consistent morning run haha. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... I'm not going to promise new posts until I have the mood and evergy to do them, and I know my OT schedule for next week. Ok bye<br><br> P.S. I may implement the new behaviour for the new thumbnails here soon because fixing all from the old site is a pain so I guess I"m starting afresh. Estimated time of implementation not confirmed maybe after the Anime Extra next week<br><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
