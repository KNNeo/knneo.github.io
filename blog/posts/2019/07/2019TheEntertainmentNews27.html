Okay nvm, I'll create a new home page so this doesn't happen anyways, so whatever.<br><br> Hey, welcome back. Again, if you noticed any changes, please do tell. I removed some stuff from the sidebar (desktop view), and added a search bar, for starters. I'll continue working on things, and in case you need an introduction, just hit the previous post. Maybe I should add that in as a floating button... Okay let's start with the new season of Anime!<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TejinaSenpai01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Tejina Senpai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>[Extracted from the <a href=https://www.boj.or.jp/en/note_tfjgs/note/security/gizo0410a.htm/ target=_blank>Bank of Japan website</a>] *A person who counterfeits or alters a coin other than a gold or silver coin shall be punished with light penal servitude or with heavy imprisonment of not less than two years and not more than five years. (lol)</div></blockquote>I like how this series is aware of it's own pervertedness lol "bondage" and the guy be like haha. In this... magical series of a first episode (#TejinaSenpai01) haha you would wonder why on Earth would I watch a fantasy Anime but fear not, it's just a girl trying to do magic. This senpai is in a Magic Club all by herself, trying to find new members to join. She's got everything on her (literally), even the guts to use the PA system without permission, but she... she can't do magic. Clearly the irony would make a great premise to watch the series I would argue, but they had to throw in the most Anime thing for this every time she fails at any magic - <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> stuff. If magic isn't your thing but porno is (lol), then this is a show for everyone haha. That poor guy, who thought he could get a life out of slipping into any club and laze off, now has to suffer with this... marvel of a senpai, losing financially and emotionally in many grounds, just not sexaually. That one, I think he gets a lot even though it doesn't show on his face. Arousal, I mean. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> But hey, makes you wonder what'll happen to him by the end of the season lol. As mentioned in the preview, the only thing I was most worried about isn't that much of a stretch, considering panties (Anime "Nagasarete Airantou" classic btw) and poured milk(?) all over her is the biggest (not talking about her rack) thing that would happen unless you consider pigeon porn lol, but otherwise... yeah it isn't too hard (not talking about boner) to get into it to be honest. Bigger issue is, the jokes are on the weaker side since (1) we know Tejina-senpai always fails and (2) if it fails differently than expected it's always ecchi-related. There, saved you half an hour watching this magic trick unveil. All in all, I would say the premise of just a senpai who fails at magic in her club and desperately finding someone to save her is... I'll do it, personally. I'll even find someone to teach you. Just stop showing your underwear and tease me with words like "bondage" lmao. The theme songs are quite the disappointment so maybe we'll give this the three-episode rule WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT A FAT DUDE?? WE ALREADY GOT ONE SHE'S IN THE BOX haha I'm so sorry<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTwypk2jElHGDby8CYvLe7GF5fUWYztdZi9ELvWlTzgqPe1Bu4EOo4ueSpokoOBkLSflM10g2oI5IVX9oIl9mhvxFKi6OOGpKTjEctnq8I9XuLSRqxx-xWooxCk_thy7LVZ1f0vW6K5xU/s320/tejinasenpai01_puke1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[From left to right] My reaction to the series in general</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9lJZ7unRJkGGusuKrt7l0wASyATbPvBabVVernZz_BIivTowzE_Y7_zSZEkYyLUE2YUdG3483o6diX662_0CNarn07772pHnsKYzEiPpIcEFBqNQC2sLnOQ_Q2Tq-K31Pl8ocHoiUqbo/s320/tejinasenpai01_wtf.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>[From right to left] My reaction to the series in general</table></div></div>P.S. Personal opinion only I swear, but after watching Anime so many years I only find ecchi content in Anime distracting. Also, makes of a bad story unless it's staple in which case will get boring real quick. Period. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AraOto01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>*hears intro book read* Wow.. *applauses loudly alone in room*</div></blockquote>"<a href=https://bungostraydogs.fandom.com/wiki/Osamu_Dazai_and_the_Dark_Era target=_blank>Dark times</a>"? What are you, Stray Dogs? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In this... rather bizzare premise of a series episode one (#AraOto01) we talk about... okay ignoring the word that should not be mentioned lest the girls so berserk again (because I'm saving it) (the juice, I mean) (haha), it's hard to not talk about it, really. <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sex target=_blank>Sex</a>, I mean. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I know we all take it for a joke, but for the Literature Club of girls I guess not. You know, in one of these clubs you read through books and share your perspectives with each other, bonding through books and understand the worldview better. Just yeah, someone thought erotic books would be a great genre to explore, and look how far we have come. (Again, I don't mean that haha) So yeah, it just so happens to the five members of the group, talking about some author's new work about a person writing a bucket list with an impending death. (<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/36098/Kimi_no_Suizou_wo_Tabetai target=_blank>"Pancreas"</a>, by the way, and <a href="../../search?q=%23kimisui">I reviewed it before</a>) There are plenty of things to do even alone before you die, but you know, the one Sugawara chose to talk about the most relatable thing at this time surrounded by students who are constantly getting laid and creating quite a horrid environment in school... it's... <em>you know the word.</em> With this premise comes with a couple of reactions I would hope to see progress real soon since this already started out as quite a disaster. Firstly, we have <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/11661/Tomoyo_Kurosawa target=_blank>Kurosawa Tomoyo</a>- oh, it's called Kazusa? I swear those two saying "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/tomo target=_blank>tomo</a> yo" is a reference to the voice actress lol (Audience: She isn't even the girl anyway!!) (Oh really? Oops) Anyways, the cute girl with the short bob. She has a childhood friend. (I was really thinking of how much Kazusa would have a wonderful shoujo manga ending with the guy too until I heard "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/otouto target=_blank>otouto</a>" and I'm like "oh well it's not happening"Â haha it can still happen though)Â Too bad that one guy is constantly surrounded by women who, obviously for some damn reason, hate the normal as heck girl to the core due to jealousy. I mean, make friends with her and you'll get to the guy in no time, idiots. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, there's that, and... shockingly, she found out that the guy probably likes the act. <em>You know the word.</em> <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Man, the worst thing you could do is to forget that you are masturbating in your room watching porn and forgot to plan out your escape route (This blog is going to get a mature rating landing page soon btw) so that your childhood friend wouldn't accidentally see it lol. So yeah, that happened. Really, didn't expect that, but yeah, count that as my first in an Anime. Not mine though, just so you wonder. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Really, there is so much to laugh to, but now looking back at this... it's really wrong, even for Anime standards. But yeah, they gotta prove it, but I didn't expect to make it so blatant even with the childhood flashback haha. What she's gonna do about it, I absolutely have no idea. Then, we have best girl Mo-chin (What's her name? Oh it's <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/116803/Momoko_Futo target=_blank>Momoko</a>) (Nope, Anime "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/38295/Joshikausei target=_blank>Joshikausei</a>" is already over) (Also Asakura Momo, that be your new nickname now hehe) who is as cute as Kazusa maybe cuter lol, and probably will act as the most pure among the five. Don't ask me why she's there, but apparently she does, so we shall see what happens going forward or how long she can stay clean on this lol. Moving on, we have Sugawara. Probably known in school as an ice cold princess, she is rather desperate into the topic considering she said it first. <em>You know the word.</em> <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Don't ask what triggered her, maybe the books, but yeah she started it all, and it likely stems out from her looking at her surroundings and wondering if the literature is true because most of them probably didn't even do it before, yes? I mean, probably relevant assumption there, those authors probably never done it before and jerked off to porno lol (I'm sorry Kazusa-chan) but yeah, I guess it's important to experience it yourself, so that's that. And then there's club leader (I assume) Kirika, a leader in herself, and at this age, is totally against the act. <em>You know the word.</em> Even at high school, girl? Sure, keeping it pure, man. Probably would only get that one guy interested who praised your chastity (man, you don't even notice that was a praise lol) but yeah, your hatred is not going to go away. Combating against the environment, she tries to stand up for herself only to notice she might be in the minority with the others in the club, and don't even get me started on how dull the school and the sky looks haha. Lastly, the only one who is the embodiment of the literature club lol, it's Hitoba. Taking all the experience she can about that thing (<em>You know the word</em>) (haha) without actually doing it, she goes through all lengths to learn what it means to write a novel? Hell yeah, she's an amateur author in the making. She's also an amateur in getting laid considering she's already in those kinds of social network where I don't, but hey what do I know - the Internet can be a scary place. Each with a different direction to take, you'd believe this would make great circumstances to even start watching this series. But as it was concluded, "I don't want sex to take over my life". I'll take you word for it, Kazusa. For this one quote from you, I'll watch a couple more episodes. The theme songs I'll approve anyways (don't notice the potentially awesome ending theme by the way haha MOCHO~) so at this point it's just up to me to see if I can take anything worse from what I just saw this first episode. I doubt it'll go worse, but I'm not holding my breath. Anime like "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34934/Koi_to_Uso target=_blank>Koi to Uso</a>" exist, so I'm going to think like so for this series also. Anime, don't disappoint me just because you got DMM pictures as backing I know of their portfolio I don't want to keep associating shows like "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37982/Domestic_na_Kanojo target=_blank>DomeKano</a>" with them but look at this sh*tshow haha I'll give a couple a try (And I DO NOT mean going down on them okay?

Then again, I can't figure out that first one already lol</div></blockquote>"Damn you Takagi-san!" Hey, feel at home yet? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In this much anticipated of a sequel intorduction episode (#TakagiSanS201), we learn that he just needs to doubt himself just a little longer and he can go miles without getting duped, uh I mean, teased. Also, if you see a certain blonde hair girl in the background with ponytails and get some unnecessary hype, you're not alone. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, recap. If you missed this series 2 years ago, I will tell you, it hasn't lost its touch. And this time around, it seems like it's up to something, like Takagi-san. We start off with a simple example of how this series goes: Takagi-san starts something up, Nishikata tries not to get distracted, but still ends up losing to whatever Takagi-san has up her sleeve. It's like magic, just that it's not because you know the trick, it's just that you got a PhD in Physics and Engineering haha. So yeah, with Nishikata still building up his body (hell yeah, for Takagi) and forgetting to put in his textbook in his bag, he ends up having to ask around for one but... too bad Takagi-san already realises he's not going to get any as there's only one class having English that day and it's them. So suck it up, Nishikata has to share it with her (lucky you I can't even do that with PDF lecture notes now) and... they play vertical writing in an English lesson? Sure man, keeping the Japanese writing spirit alive. And of course, Nishikata didn't "win" in the end since there is no trick. Which is also kind of sad Takagi-san because this idiot will never know you like him because you always make it as a tease. Maybe we don't know if it's true too. Maybe we're the ones getting teased. Uh oh. Is this some inception? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Then, there's hypnotism. Two people were specifically affected by this techincally, so let's talk about Nishikata and <strike>Mina-chan</strike> Takagi-san. Nishikata wants to play this super hard trick on someone, and Takagi wants to play hypnotism. Seriously? If you need some reality check, it will only work with a skilled practitioner, under controlled conditions, and on a hypnotically weak target with very specific requirements, as tested by hypnotists. (Thanks, MythBusters) So yeah, all the planets did NOT line up for sure, but Takagi can play along with it. It was all fun for the guy until he decides to tell her to dig her nose. Once again, if you need a reminder, that is also one of the things Takagi doesn't like to do in front of people (making ugly faces was in the first season), so yeah, she kinda got her, but she was not in it since she got him back as she's faking the hypnotism anyways. So yeah, watch again if you don't get it haha. And yes, I mentioned Mina-chan also got caught by the hypnotism, and turns out her life in the house is real busy. No wonder you sleep and wake up so early. But I see we have similar interests in sleeping long hours lol I just sleep because I can and I don't have a busy schedule like you, unfortunately. Lastly, Nishikata decides to challenge Takagi to a game of stone skipping by the river. I'm not going to talk about how the guy lost (yes he did) (technically), but about how much of a gentleman he is so much so that he deserves Takagi's affection. I think we can see it many times this episode. From love letters (lol) to Nishikata kind enough to not let himself see her ugly face (I mean, why not?) (Haha okay for the sanity of this series...), and also, he accidentally pushing her into the river only to save her even though he... didn't want to hold her hand. Because you know, lovey-dovey stuff. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I would say "just kill me already" with this one episode, but with many more episodes to come I see a trend in this particular season, and I want to see development happen. Basically I want last episode to be them holding hands and dating. Is that too hard to ask? Oh, asking for that means I lost?

And then the moment he scoots over his table he immediately gets scolded by the teacher haha yeah right the teacher wouldn't save him lol<br> P.P.S. Best part about this series once again, is that we get to see real life Takagi-san ie. Takahashi Rie who voices the girl, get teased and THAT'S AWESOME haha I need those livestreams<br> [Because you get to see everything fly over on the fansub stream taken from live TV, did I just see a smartphone game for this Anime?? Hohoho time to get teased by Takagi-san I guess]</div><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hmm... okay I did get to hear a lot this week despite my busy work schedule, so let's tak about them, I guess. Still going on that nostalgia break though because I could use a burnout from work and music is my company now unless you think I can watch Anime at work lmao. As mentioned last week, <b>Earphones' new single</b> is... okay, and yet again they put the rap thing on the B-side to I'm savnig my money on this one haha. I thought of giving <b>AyumiKurikaMaki's new mini-album</b> a listen and really am into some of the songs this time around... only to notice that it was pre-released and the official date is next week. Ugh, I hate these things. But hey, I'll still give it, whatever. I also spent some time listening to <b>Kiriku to Majou's 1st album</b>, and... I think I can't get into it, because mostly for me on them I only like to give tunes with a unique tempo and feel, and most of them don't fit the bill. And then there's the melody. So yeah, just considering this one song and it may not even get in the list, to be honest. Lastly, thanks to some live video performance, I'm giving another of <b>Base Ball Bear</b>'s songs a chance, namely one from their 2011 single. Totally not influenced by Aki-chan or Kazusa form the above Anime or whatsoever. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (The song title was "short hair", by the way)<br><br> Next week brings Klassic Note two releases which I may or may not be interested in. <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> will test her seduction abilities once again (haha) so I'll see if I'm giving her or the songs, and <b>Horie Yui's new album</b> is... I refrained form hearing all the teaser videos besides the topic song as mentioned last week, so I hope this will be good. The latter might be on Apple Music though, so I'll look forward to that at least.<br><br> Besides anticipating Natsukawa Shiina's 1st album appearing on Apple Music which I realised is only out the week after next (and of course <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1137699752999440384?s=20" target=_blank>thanks amatsuuni for liking my Tweet</a> I don't know how you understood to like it but still), I can't see <b>Porno Graffitti's music video preview</b> on YouTube for some reason (yes even with VPN enabled), voice actress <b>Kitou Akari announced her solo artist debut</b> releasing a single in October (to me I only know her from a couple of shows and she sang the theme song for Anime "Blend.S"), and yes I liked a Twet to remind myself that <b>AyumiKurikaMaki's new mini-album officially releases next week</b>. Oh well haha<br><br><br><br><br> I told myself to hype up the restart of this blog by posting something every weekend for the rest of the month, but... I'm sorry. I noticed I have too many things to do (and fix) and I just had to sleep so I won't burn out for the next work week. But fret not, I have plans to do so, so I will make sure it happens. Meanwhile, what do you think of the slight changes? I personally dig the search bar it's much earned perfection right there haha. Perhaps refraining from using Javascript was a mistake these few years lol. Cya guys then, and until next time... Not talking about Anime, but I feel so empty now. Maybe it's playing too many mobile games and grinding that made me numb. I should sleep more haha remember to come back for Takgi-san tomorrow btw you lose if you don't lol<br><br> P.S. I like how this particular Sunday night is making me like Rieri (Takahashi Rie) so much because <a href="https://twitter.com/tejina_senpai/status/1147792369133248512?s=20" target=_blank>she just got spooked from a magic trick</a> and she almost screwed up <a href=https://ch.nicovideo.jp/nanitsuku target=_blank>her cooking livestream</a>Â  at the end too (first half is free to view btw, no region restrictions) AND Takagi-san airs tonight. Man, must be great being so popular haha<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
