Turns out it's those left in stock new phones that probably deterioriated and wasn't meant to last already. I hate you, local seller. Too bad no warranty so I can't come for you. Ebay is my new friend now I could buy three of the refurbished ones now at the price I bought it last December. Dammit. What a waste of money. Then again, I wasted a lot of money this week which will be shown in the following weeks, so stay tuned for those, I guess. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><br>And as promised, action show first because Senko-san doesn't fight anything but Nakano's desires lol<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BungouStrayDogs34><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Bungo Stray Dogs Season 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Your brother won't die, I promise." You still wanna die, kid? You won't be with your brother then. (Is this how talking to suicide bombers work? lol)</div></blockquote>Can I call this arc "Fyodor playing a Dazai"? Okay, in the new episode (#BungouStrayDogs34) of "Fyodor playing a Dazai" lol, Dazai is still hospitalised but no one wants to kill him so whatever (yes he wants to die so we're doing him a benefit by killing him anyways), and... everyone is thinking of ways to you know, kill the other Boss. Story first, I guess. All of them were in the hospital where Fukuzawa is, and Tanizaki became the bait. With his illusion Ability, he sent everyone else off so the hospital won't be torn up into pieces with all the fighting, and relayed a message that Ranpo-san will solve the mystery of who is behind it instead of fighting head-on as Fyodor suggested. But all was a fluke as even Fyodor took care of mystery solving genius by placing a fake lead to the criminal who might be behind the Ability of the poison administered to the two leaders. Man, this bad guy is real bad haha he also capped the time on this so you can't do this forever too. With a wild goose chase filled with Russians (lol whatever), little kids and plenty of <strike>gunfire</strike> sadness coming out of Kunikida (Fyodor you sick fuck) (on the other hand Kunikida don't let that get in your way when kids die in this series it's never your fault lol), and the Detective Agency still didn't get to find out who the real culprit is. Then, with not much time left keeping Mori-san or even Tanizaki alive, the illusionist plans his escape. (He's not a magician I assure you) Well, that was quite successful to say the least, but not if he has to also kill Mori as a secondary objective and not need to be protected by Kyouka when he almost got ripped apart by Kouyou (hey I remember her name now). So yeah, back to square one I guess. Funny how no one is dead yet "I expect some mass killing" lol Fyodor you won't say that. Fyodor did mention last episode that don't even try to find the culprit behind the virus though, so I guess he did plan all this in advance should any of them even try their luck at solving a fake puzzle. Lastly, Fyodor's motive as mentioned by Atsushi. I mean, it is pretty obvious he wants something to happen in the city of Yokohama, and probably wants to take over this place in which I don't know for what, but man, is he using every trick up his sleeve to churn up the perfect plan. I would like to believe The Guild's Louise is behind this (you know, "she plans then I steal"), but it's unlikely and Dazai did say he's as smart as him (lol show off) so yeah, we might just be dealing with a scheming bastard. They say teaming up is strength but in this case, pretty much everyone is overwhelmed by this one guy. What will happen next? Your guess is as good as mine. Interesting how it hasn't become a killing spree because writing those is hard huh, Kafuka-sensei? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> To end this, Fukuzawa mentioned in Anne's Room (where he is safe from assault because of the Ability) (thanks Lucy haha we know you love the weretiger lmao) that his life is nothing and the two groups should not fight under any circumstances. I would believe he is right, but then how? I mean, he could just bite his tongue and that'll be it. Mori survives, the Agency gets a new leader maybe, and Fyodor can do nothing but watch. If it were that easy, ladies and gentlemen, we wouldn't have this many episodes to talk about them haha. We're not even close to the truth yet, so I wonder how mysterious Fyodor <strike>can be</strike> is tbh<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDjRmyrNC1fT_03G-MXuHP-VcB8FcDHCIgBALl0WgImniIZR7b3MsKBJDkFeaqrzrqtfwY8BsQI6CYGsoNT6GSqcWJQTU8I6WJ5_ARk4AAA6lUbR4kcu0E3ZAvD5rcoo7a-T6YiNYPnVE2/s320/straydogs34_kunikida.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The bombing is too violent so here's Kunikida's reaction to all this</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvDguNJFeQSikIvPY1vc4UP94F2lC2CoYGv-Wz8dDz9Vv7WwbP4S_WYS5x_LysQsoRHOnMSM-AOvr1OtfOjkGspuwr0_kHA8mEDdahA3LEgLW0r-fmpLzWOQTNPo_x2ZXehAzqNzHhlA4y/s320/straydogs34_tanizaki2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Man, you did real well this episode, bro.

And then Tanizaki is going to take a scalpel and slit Mori Ougai's throat- Wait, did Dazai tell him about this or am I having deja vu here? oh it's not happening? haha<br>P.P.S. MVP Gin because we <em>know</em> she's cool even without talking lmao "I can feel the bloodlust" oh Kouyou we talking about Tanizaki? haha NOT MY SISTER!! &lt;=Tanizaki<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SenkoSan09><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I'll help" "What did you just say?" haha Senko-san that burn on ShiroÂ </div></blockquote>Again, this show talks about Gratin and they have half-an-hour episodes. Man, the luxuries of airtimes lol. In this new episode (#SenkoSan09) we talk about Senko-san learning new stuff. It teaches us that so long as you have the basic skills, learning new stuff related to it will be easy if you're as smart as Senko-san lol. Firstly, how to make Western food. You know, I swear Nakano has never had cheese in a while thanks to Senko-san's wonderful Japanese cooking. Not that it's a bad thing, but Japanese cooking hardly uses any cheese (not true today but centuries ago probably), so Nakano is missing it somehow. She wants to cook it, but she has no one to ask on, so surprisingly Enouji knows how to do it. Well, it's not tough so I guess you can do it at home... but she's lazy to feed Shiro is the point haha. So yeah, cooking lessons, everyone. Not you, Shiro. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Apart from the slip-ups including showing off that scared blue flame in front of a mortal (lmao), Senko-san still did it pretty well. See? What happens when you got talent and learn new things haha. I mean, I can't cook for sh*t but at least I don't put sugar on my cup noodles lol. And then, we have a haircut session. Yeah, right in your apartment. Not unusual because I did that as a kid too at my mom's friend's place, but yeah, they do better than the ones in the malls but not compared to the real good Malay barbers if you know where I live. Those times were gone and rare now, as people rather do quick cuts than go for more detailed process like what Senko-san did to Nakano. Not the reconnecting part by the way the mortals can't do that lol. Well then again I don't know why people look at me and cut my hair so I still look like a dork, so I guess I also need some help from Senko-san but now I'm worried I'll end up in a samurai hairstyle lmao is that the video game way of testing our haircuts? Haha sure looks like it. All in all, happiness episode every episode, so this is no exception. Now I want some Gratin mom can we have that? Oh we don't have an oven <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIhxd1bPH8OXhHoJcz-cwuYJP4mQ9qtdF3aQ01AKYuuSDGCMCCeOShcN6tAHrkB-3gHw73tIPI8SCYyLQ2cyC8afKIrr8r2f_IVwUIA82F0rsEIJmg-XzwNg3PwizBVAzkHWgCwdLjFjBS/s320/senkosan09_shiro2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is actually kinda cute haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibCbHVUHcDRObwugnlq0r4S1DYaqYIT826uBtLAwUovpJjg6d0vVvTcJO0rIJ4mFxSgs4N780N4Obe-w08RhW1txI63bbLIVvjeDqCGJ7xB5WnxtXSSQjTxyhAkFqFOez0GSDMIa4O9SZC/s320/senkosan09_nakano5.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Not Anime reference? lol</table></div></div>P.S. "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/reiwa target=_blank>Reiwa</a> ni Osusume" Man, even the TV shows in Anime are updated for the new era lol<br>P.P.S. Just so you guys realise during the Gratin cooking session, Shiro-san ONLY boiled the macaroni. That's it. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (#NoSkillRequired)<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AoChan10><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Please submit the events you want to do next week" SEX!! Oh, it's sports festival? Sex is a sport! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote>This... might be the most emotional episode we'll get for this series. In this new episode (#AoChan10) we get a dad episode. I swear it's not all bad, but this will explain the father's existence in Ao-chan's life thus far. Totally reminds me of another Anime which I'll explain later, but let's talk about what happened. Kijima got asked to go for the cheering party for the sports festival, so it kind of motivated Ao-chan to sign up for the festival since she can get cheered upon by the.. guy... she... that one guy. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I don't know why too but it gets her happy for some reason, so whatever haha. Problem is, the father wants to attend. You know, father cheering on daughter kind of thing. Very normal behaviour to be hoenst, until you realise this dad does everything but good for the image of her own daughter, and that's not really a plus for him and the girl. So yeah, they kind of quarreled whch led them to isolating each other like how a normal quarrel might end up (Yabe-san is <em>so</em> happy at the father's work progress lately lmao), and... Ao-chan feels bad about it already. Consulted by Kijima to do good, she decides to apologise to the father... and he's in school already. Uh oh. Will that spell trouble? Spoiler alert, it's a yes (haha), but you know, he has always been there for her, even if it means ruining her image in school and possibly make her want to live alone to preserve the image she desires, but hey, now that everyone in school knows you're a G-cup... to be honest outside of Anime? G isn't that big. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (Don't quote me on this I only watch porn and masturbate haha) All in all, the dad was here, she cheered her on in the best way he can (aside from the last lap lol), and I feel that with the flashback and us being reminded about the importance of family support, it's no wonder this will (most likely) be the most emotional episode we will ever get. Well, if next week's episode of Ao-chan getting pounded will make you cry because you worry of her virginity you are forgiven lmao. To end this, I would like to take reference to a similar theme related to this episode of an Anime titled "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei", a show released in 2012 talking about a guy's university life ruined whichever direction he decides to take, and it's all because of someone he knew at school. He's a friend, he's mostly the one that'll make him regret his decisions, and he can't stop him from appearing in his life because they are friends. That's fate, just like you and your parents, ladies and gentlemen. Never forget. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span><br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFrhn0NIMWHCNAxQODTSTfSsiZd_kp-4k2irav-Lvgg4zm277cqtymRWI-m7orf9BeSqoa3CN-AuP82fE6wyUmcmDnRgL-W_D8CnkVMljZuLF4OT036Orqy50O7fJLW6MtsaKYo4LxCPJg/s320/aochan10_jump.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You know you found the right man if he can make you jump lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjXu6UBKvlVg2F11Bc69w05d6GbC_F5gjqXJrwpdguXaBAdQfAN9OJXN3Q4gxT8SclpntL_0I4L8ZmYeIjGilcfe3JgWX1XUOUs1exrfVBDgXu4LmpyfdG5EmxZvLe1o6LhOK5OW19Lt9k/s320/aochan10_dad6.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>*laughs non-stop for 10mins*</table></div></div>P.S. "I won't hand out novels or anything this time" yeah right with your work covering all entertainment genres it's hard to imagine you won't come up with something lol<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Joshikausei10><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Joshikausei</span></div></blockquote>Wow, how many shows this week want to make me cry? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span> In this new episode (#Joshikausei10) hey as expected from last week, we get a flashback episode for Shibumi, the other girl who dons a pair of glasses. From middle school, she has been quite a disciplinarian, as we can see from her being (I assume) class chairperson and you know, hating people around her and stuff. Hey, that's what happens when you get lonely and not be loved, okay? Not our fault lol. Anyways, she intelligently proposes the removal of accessories in school (which is quite an outstanding feature to identify between Anime characters so HOW DARE YOU lmao) which obviously, gets the disapproval of many, including those who might want to confront her especially seeing her in one too. So yeah, she felt the burn after getting literally bullied in class (it's still a thing in Japan, mind you) and getting her only accessory which is a hair clip given to her by (I assume since no dialogue) (you could've just said obaa-chan and I'll know lol) her grandparents for her birthday, and... it got ripped off her head and trampled on the ground. The latter was an accident. Still, she was left alone with despair until Momoko saw it all and decide to help her piece it up all together. Using I guess the pins on her own accessory which strings the beads together, she was able to piece Shibumi's hairclip up to her usual shape. And that is how to get a friend haha. Okay, that aside, but yeah, based on a true story maybe I would assume. Still, didn't change Shibumi's mind about removing accessories but technically you can chain all your hairpins up and it'll count as one. I don't know who has that many but I know Imari-chan from Anime "WORKING!!" will have a lot to do that lmao<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKsObSoZDqwXZlaDX0lCyQpJMUpt5Nct1PBnHLkK37LbesOEASIUSih-VyQSpDrOjlfqeBTTXTjpAA6MGFdk9DI7-BLZ76O51css_XRtg7npznsTu0DYaLtKw2MKx0jnH-Oz0TICN8YfYT/s320/joshikausei10_momoko1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is so cute I can't even</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYKjJIf4rhTq2kxbQgqyhodn9bgSkJ9s5PjSPXu3MvVoppR_gG6MvC1LLZdvvqIvjXqqn3mn4spWQpN32pVnpQm92XJe0F4kiOeYPJcejzjizil9L5QgV3QCitOq4_62H-fxjjuARbJhqC/s320/joshikausei10_notice1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is called "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9B%E3%83%AB%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC target=_blank>Kihoruda</a> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tsukenai target=_blank>Tsukenai</a>"</table></div></div>P.S.

In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan56) in case you just got spoiled about last episode already, Armin is awake. Yes, he or she or whatever is alive, and unscathed. Well, recollection won't be a strong point for Armin here since no one wants to remember that, but yeah, they did tell about what happened. You know, saving us trouble to show him last 2 episodes haha. Anyways, the episode's pace got slower as many recollections appear and Levi, Hange, Erena and Mikasa head to the basement of Eren's house to discover the secret the father has been holding back from him the whole time. It's quite a build-up of suspense so much that I want to beat the Anime production up lol, but it ended with a simple statement: There is humanity outside of these walls. Thanks, dad. That's all I needed to hear. So yeah, turns out the people here are backwards in technology already, and thank goodness this isn't the end right here. We got a quick insight into next week's episode and what would be Eren father's past as he left his own walls of what looks like West Germany? Hitler, is that you?? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, he did that all to bring his sister I believe to see the airship land, and... it probably was qute a journey trying to even leave the borders. So yeah, I guess we're on that now. Well, it's still despair probably, but hey, we can forget about Erwin once in a while. Haha sadded still I guess. And I'm glad I don't have to wait for Season 4 to know the truth. We'll see how many episodes this can bring us then. And as I would have said to end this, FINALLY some plot progression haha<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikeVRigwxG7OPZo0TRW0kMb2efOrKSatBs8aIvL6eIVLn46gijX5LXPxJ56PJ0Bl8Th2fFFP6dxRZgQy7D-S87zYDWq2zsvgHzOrFASE3W17PxDJ0qwr5xn3YBSKDwZ55JySe6g9zYjlx5/s320/attackontitan56_hug.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Aw... truly an emotional moment tbh</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgx-dAnpDTsPczs0xo4-6e67CrntVk6sGM1LpY9liI-MbSwEhP9rwopf6wNMeP2b-3xI1SwOFiN8Z5AIWTAkoKIDf697_L75XaDDHN23Ra3vSxhIjcxFvCVS71ZcsgYokF1GSqVF7Cj6ra2/s320/attackontitan56_armin2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I would look like if you spoiled ANYTHING from the past few episodes to me before I watched them</table></div></div>P.S. "Why... did you pick me?" Well Armin, just watch last week's episode, okay? We don't have time for flashbacks haha<br>P.P.S. Hit me if you will (please don't), but kid Mikasa is the cutest in this series. Prove me wrong haha</div><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week is... well I'll talk about what I have heard so far. <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new album</b> is pretty good maybe, but then again I gave all the topic songs and only like, one of the new songs, so... I wouldn't say it's a sounding success. Still, three new songs ain't bad in Klassic Note for an album. I just heard <b>amatsuuni's major debut single</b> before writing here and... man, I have to give this? That's what happens when you hear only the chorus, guys. It gets real misleading real fast. Since it didn't come on time I will talk about it next week. (Okay my bad it was on Apple Music haha) (That's... how much I don't want to give it lol) I also caught up with <b>Spira Spica's new single</b> and <b>Niitsu Yui's new mini-album</b> from last week so that's good.<br><br>Next week mainly brings us the one <b>Yuuki Aoi's new album</b> which I don't even know how to start giving after hearing that music video of a topic song, but hey, I'll try, Columbia Japan. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> And this also means I should go find songs to listen too then. Man, it's getting real dry here without any new releases, honestly.<br><br>In the news on Twitter, <b>some of Horie Yui's music videos are on YouTube</b>Â ie. open to the public (mostly the recent Anime theme songs only though so that sucks), <b>Primary's yuiko is planning on YouTube livestreaming</b> somehow (which probably won't show her face) (she don't look too bad though thus far, covering it up ClariS style) (besides, you guys know I don't judge singers by their face), and I'm spending some time designing what seems to be the <b>new Ultimate Collection album cover art</b>. Inspired by some "I'm the xxx guy" T-shirts, I guess.<br><br><br><br><br>That's it for the week, I guess. Still doing plenty of work outside of work (Preparing database for Klassic Note? That's what I do every day) (Inspired by work I guess haha) and plenty of preparations on the blog and more importantly, spending of money on stuff I want and stuff I need. Hey, the latter could be avoided if not for that phone. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜©>*sigh*</span> So yeah, I'll submit my financial report here in the following weeks (lol) so be sure to stay tuned for it whenever it arrives. Hints? It includes a second auction trip <a href=../../2016/06/the-auction-house-journey.html>since 2016</a> (no joke, I told myself not to do it already but still), a manga series with an ending I can only know ASAP by buying Japanese originals (yep), and... something to make my music listening at home not suck. No really, the current speakers are crackling already. I can afford to prepare for the end of year shopping spree where I intend to upgrade my PC, you know. Okay, enough talk. Cya guys next week, and until then... probably not this week, but who knows? Well, I hope my phone comes in soon this backup one I have (5X btw) is just half as fast as the one I had haha bye<br><br>P.S. It may not be awesome but I may have to give amatsuuni's new single since the B-side is good haha soon<br><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text Â© 2019 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
