Shouldn't have promised one post a day for my super long weekend haha heads up btw I'm skipping tomorrow's since I'm going to be out<br><br> So blah blah blah Happy National Day Singapore but that's not the point!! Well, it's a good, long break after that break I had in which I lied down in bed all week (why does that sound like it's a good thing) (talking about my fever btw) so... why not finish some of the stuff I set out to do in this blog? So yeah, I did that, and also now that I'm (somehow) done let's talk about entertainment this week.<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TakagiSanS205><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Dandy is completely tease-proof!" Well going from his name I doubt so but haha</div></blockquote>Well that was quite a fail isn't it? I think I mentioned this many times for Nishikata to not care thus will not be teased, but turns out he needs to watch stuff other than local drama haha. In this new episode (#TakagiSanS205) apparently there is other drama in drama besides 100% Kataomoi, it seems. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay now I want an episode on Dandy lmao. Firstly, the drama in drama. Nishikata thought he could pull it off by mimicking another drama character only to notice Takagi-san's place also has national cable and can probably watch the same show as him anyways. That aside, they played their drama roles real well for some reason but of course, pertaining to the topic of being embarrassed, and Nishikata should just stop with that already, learning from drama lol. Anyways, still pretty entertaining just like the previous reference on this though, so yeah, Nishikata I think we have deduced it's not you who is dumb it's Takagi that is smart haha. Next up, it's someone's birthday. I doubt Takagi has planned to give him a birthday present with this much of precision, because unless she knows that her boy will go out to the streets alone on his day so much so to bump into her, I think she might already be planning to give something to him like, on another day in school. Outside of school, of course, not until Nishikata gets called for some random committee meeting by Yukari-chan haha. Anyways, Nishikata thinks that getting his birthday cake alone is embarrassing (I mean, WHY?? MOM YOU B*TCH haha) (By the way I have NEVER taken my own birthday cake on my birthday. Well, alone, I mean.) so telling Takagi-san about it is near impossible. I would argue though it'll just end if you say it so, and then blame it on your mom. Which he wouldn't because that's what Takagi likes about him being kind so... (Haha hit me Takagi) So they go to the cake shop, Takagi supposedly has an order ready to give to Nishikata at such short notice? Again, that's why I think it's planned but not on his day (refer to where I mentioned her agenda earlier) so Nishikata's appearance just made her plan easier to execute. Aw... So lucky you Nishikata, getting a birthday gift from a girl and being so <strike>smug</strike> happy about it haha <a href=https://jisho.org/search/urayamashii target=_blank>URAYAMASHII</a> lol. Lastly, it's the sneeze. I mean, if you didn't know that sneezes are rumoured to also mean that someone is talking or spreading rumours about you you need to watch more Anime haha. (#NotAd lol) Everyone is sneezing which I just assume it's the flu season but hey, it can happen anytime there's bad air quality so... Anyways, Takagi talks about rumours spreading about the both of them going out (they are) (HAHA GOTCHA TAKAGI &lt;= Not Nishikata), Yukari-chan thinks some dude is talking about her lol, Mano-chan thinks Nakai-kun is not concerned about her enough (poor girl) (poor dude haha you insensitive fu-) but hey good follow-up bro, and Honjou-san thinks... nothing. I can't figure her out. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> You know who else we can't figure out? (#TakagiSanMe) Haha okay moving on, the fat dude shouldn't have sneezed lmao, and Takagi... her sneeze is the cutest haha. See, Nishikata? It's not hard to compliment someone once in a while. Too bad bro, gotta train that embarrassment so you can get laid someday you know what I'm sayin'? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> If sentimental didn't give you enough words to express yourself every episode this season, I'm sure you will by the end of this because this show is so sweet hehe<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=900 data-original-width=1600 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhH_CQEEe-nbtMhLqZEiYrR3vetboq9zPlD7jYIn47nE5ty8E2zw6wosjVoT0qVraCZk2_YF1trDknQaAmejJounR4LVRqskUP4dHZL4RypcHMAqF4hdrtDhnpMlwuPgsjRZ1ugloGDgpM/s320/takagisanS2_05_eyecatch2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>You thought your reaction to this was like Yukari-chan until...</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=900 data-original-width=1600 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifkiSuvZg5UNg8sJDGySNSd1wcBEesD-SL3IYKJclGT8E1LZo9177_cIS1Z4SAKNKlU0bqRf-oJGZl2jRaEmH_hALmLsOb44Wnt1d-_x1P7JceoQHPvAPEjJtJroS3-BAGDNopTSEsuRU/s320/takagisanS2_05_present.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>...You noticed this was sweeter than the cake shop haha kyun kyun</table></div></div>P.S.

I really don't want to know, Hongo-san. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, in this new episode (#AraOto06) I have a good hunch everything will turn out great but then they will get shit on by the school because their works will sound like they are still virgins lmao. Well that is not quite going to happen yet, so let's talk about field trips! Yay! How did that happen though considering the Club's credibility in school? Let's talk about it. Firstly, since she's technically topic girl for the episode, Kazusa. She is really stuck. From her getting stuck in love maybe with Izumi forever from here on, she is also kind of faced with the pressure of other girls interacting with him, say Sugawara. Why doesn't that other one provoke her enough though? I don't know. But hey, apparently if it's between friends it's always worse. Also, Kazusa just doesn't have enough confidence in herself. And Sugarwara here too is going to try her best to provoke the heck out of her, which to be honest might not be a good thing. Not that Evil Kazusa matters lol, but it's more like it'll make matters worse considering Kazusa thinks too much, and as a female too? I mean, I think too much but I'm a male so it's not going to be more than a female. Well, literature taught me that so don't quote on me lol, but suffice it to say things might not go too well for Kazusa if all you're doing is poking the already thin layer of balloon waiting for it to burst. Not going to talk about oppai<a href=https://jisho.org/search/oppai target=_blank></a> in the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ofuro target=_blank>ofuro</a> here so moving on~ <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (Nope, not going there) Talking about not going to anywhere erotic, Hongo-san has a hard time keeping her novel works up. I would argue that she has a really shitty person for a manager, but she can't really choose it, and the one novelist before her did do worse, but that guy is better than nothing, I guess. Also, relevant to the topic too, let's just ditch all the stuff we have about "esuibatsu" and talking about youth stuff like for the school festival. So I hope for her sake that she has ditched her thong for a normal underwear (please don't not wear anything lol it's cold out there in Japan) and moved on to... I don't know, learn more things from the teacher? She did blackmail him again on the field trip location though so that's great. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Then, let's talk about Sonezaki. Haha, what? I can't talk about her and Amagi going out together until this series ends? Really Sonezaki-san? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, I understand her perspective, this virgin (lol), but Amagi seems to be taking a more proactive approach here BUT! Here's a big but here, that he is also discouraged by this not-so-open relationship, it seems. If Amagi is also that weak to that extent then I guess that sucks, because Sonezaki is even weaker in that aspect. She is scared, she doesn't like their relatioship to be open, so Amagi is kind of stuck in that situation where he has to decide to parade his relationship and potentially get it ruined or otherwise. He... may have chosen neither so that might be a problem haha. On the other hand, Sonezaki is (sort of) coming up with a way to make them be able to <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha target=_blank>ichaicha</a> in public or in school to say the least, so kudos for her making the effort. Then, we shift our focus back to the field trip with specifically <strike>Mocho</strike> Mo-chin and Sugawara (lol sorry). Since Sugawara is taking things into her own hands (which I discourage, once again also because) Mo-chin just feels like she has to do something to not let her best friend suffer so much and sort of, I guess, clear her mind of such competition so she doesn't feel that stressed anymore, I would argue. But yeah, you know what happened above, so also as a beginner Mo-chin then is struggling to even appease Kazusa and not let her think too much into this, but yeah, it's a balloon waiting to explode, so if it's me I'll start finding somewhere to hide instead of hold on to the end of it lol. Still, really makes you think how Sugawara intends this to end, because if it will ever end I suspect it'll not be as happy as we might think. Potential cliffhanger for the series, everyone. It's kind of everywhere now like that female teacher's butt (lol what's with the SFX), so let's see where it takes us next week. I want this to be good. It has potential to instantly create 5 couples, but as of now it's breaking apart. All of them. I'm getting worried too like Kazusa? I'll try not to think about it. *looks at length of review* Haha I'll try.<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOwXrNC4xukQvkN_k5sHYdiqvVB_qPYX_rPpH4TYQNaz2UKivmuYYpBrpmUOfVvWl55AINpkm0bdS3yBE7gP2HcxeLmFIZGxGBeWA58fFLHGQWT0I5BaGKCgalCTXlcJgH6bldK4mbJF8/s320/araoto06_couple1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>TFW a JK is thinking about you</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcSYtnpz9IlQIDuM-N4gdsggO6ALjlFwy2wgHRm6bAAvsn0FBFNvVTrFf2UIfgUXU7O6CizgJ9AV6nf4b-OiGjaUv_l5LeuKToo1d6Roc3_cIi6aNNEUyxiKNP7b7ZYjmmyVcqCPji0VU/s320/araoto06_couple2.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>TFW a JK wants to "esuibatsu" on you lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Uh Tanaka, I think that is just you because you'll be fine even if you get spooked lol</div></blockquote>Wtf I don't even know what dish Tanaka is talking about and that girl just jumps out and talks about torture? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I'm not going to step into the nether regions but if I have to... this new episode (#JoshiMuda06) might be it. Nah just joking that girl can't take a big di- OKAY MOVING ON haha we have a new girl this week. We may have a couple more according to the opening theme animation so I guess hold tight! Anyways, the girl is nicknamed <a href=https://jisho.org/search/majo target=_blank>Majo</a> by Tanaka and as you can imagine, she likes supernatural stuff. Well, more than just that, but violence? Hey, don't you EVER say video games promote violence because look at this girl. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Thanks to her lovely younger sister (like seriously, <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/banzai target=_blank>banzai</a>) (Mmmmm Nan-chan!! lol) she finally gets some friends. Well, more importantly, she gets to go to school. Well Tanaka can take anyone so yeah, she'll be your friend, whatever. Haha and so she appears, Kujou. (From here Kujou will refer to the elder sister in the same class) Surprisingly freaking the shit out of Yamamoto, but on that I think we should just leave her alone. You know, just like how she knows to leave Kujou alone lol. So other than that, the girl of the week tries her best to be friends and converse with others, only to realise there are hardly anyone she can get along with. With Robo's advice (thanks Aki-chan it was something to remember for me tbh) Kujou tries her best to go along with people who she can understand and vice versa, while trying to cover her own passion of stuff probably no one will be interested in. Well, that death prediction game is one thing haha (What, you guys never <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTUu9D6XaTzBaILN7Abs38dysVHJ0TufD8G6ldn16AyZXYcCACnok-zQ22o63SDRjCH2AvkfvRxAuoqH_boKmPnbgbGXJks5GW5xkQNwc8YTz37X7TYnpc_yakSe8vnzHO-mEpFsDu4xg/s320/asobiasobase06_voodoo.jpg target=_blank>poked a stuffed doll full of needles</a> before? Me neither), but other than that somehow the only one she can get along with in terms of opinion might just be Loli. Yeah, that kid. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Somehow their opinions of a romance movie is totally off, and considering they still think differently outside of the box, it might be hard for them to truly get along, but hey, one friend at a time, yes? (Loli freaked out watching a horror movie lmao what does she watch anyways) (maybe <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34799/PriPri_Chii-chan target=_blank>PriPri Chii-chan</a> is more her thing lmao) Also, MVP the younger sister this episode for practically teaching her the ways of school (well nearly), so she can at least stay in school for a couple of days without freaking even Tanaka out in school. Will Tanaka be freaked out though? Or get beaten to death by the blunt side of a desk or chair first? One way to find out haha. To end this, I feel like I'm a bit like Kujou, just... not the blood part I'm scared of needles lmao. Because it is hard to make friends based on what you like which is pretty much everyone's starter for conversations, and then you're the one that says "J-Pop" and EVERYONE just walks away from you so... too bad lor. I can never say those stuff to others. That's how it works then, but there's the Internet too today so I wonder how Kujou will be coping with that though. Problem is she might have that age gate to even talk about those stuff in like forums but hey, what's stopping her? All in all, a real good episode covering everything slice-of-life I know I wouldn't be able to talk about them all, but hey, there's always next time. Maybe next time... someone will finally understand <strike>Kujou's jar wall</strike> <strike>Yamamoto's seriousness</strike>Â <strike>Majime's speed thoughts</strike> me. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜¢>*sob*</span><br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAPkL_HjgrnQoajOfY5d6iBVnHlUcIVMtPx878vF2Vejgf8W-24KSPl80e1d5tqvOkuOtlxU_cU5vXj3rJZSBkMUCtoTKnOeo59tj-9mrGgCshUgjshVHmqA7qry40UlMj9l9VAvxdZXw/s320/jyoshimuda06_kujou3.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Forgetting about her interests she doesn't look half bad honestly rather cute tbh</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD9WSGnIpsM3cjQBrRUJ-0kKQapDxfUUnOrAWHEyvUfUWzjs81WsoXtT6SIG-i-YSlUOXQWExXwJWErcmx4uNxvwqjC9GwVPYbT3cxghku0tbqhgEL8ypycDAL8C9fxUOc1L3yZBIch6E/s320/jyoshimuda06_kujou4.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I wish this was her handing me a love letter instead of asking me to play a death prediction game</table></div></div>P.S.

"Falling to death" I dream of that a lot, honestly *shocked face* gg me]<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well just like last week, I didn't make the effort (well last week I wasn't in good condition) to listen to more songs, but hey, one is enough. This week was <b>CHiCO with HoneyWorks new single</b> and... thank goodness the B-side wasn't good haha. I know, just scared of reviewing stuff already. Then again, maybe because I heard of the cover by (guess what) Hatsune Miku and MAN is it terrible haha. CHiCO-chan your voice is SO much better. The topic song itself was good though, and kudos to HoneyWorks for not screwing it up. Definitely on top of the list for Anime theme songs this year. Next week brings us <b>Aimer's new single</b> which no doubt I will need to try to find a way to listen to it on release date because she doesn't like Apple Music lol I blame on the music label<br><br> News this week: I taught you guys <a href=../../2019/08/how-to-read-tweet-i-liked-for-dummies.html><b>how to recognise Tweets I liked</b></a> so to rejoice (mostly) with me on the latest news, <b>SCANDAL released a new song</b> which isn't all bad, and they did a <b>YouTube Live</b> promoting that new song. Yeah, not much this week to be honest Comiket this weekend is way more active than my Twitter feed which doesn't say much tbh<br><br><br><br><br> Hmm... I feel empty now. Don't know why, maybe it's me spending too much time typing all weekend, or maybe it's me mesmerised by the recent purchase that is the Google Daydream View VR headset. Well, I waited a week to play with it since it came in literally the next day I went to see the doctor and I swear looking into the headset I'll be sure to get a worse headache lol. Anyways, maybe it's more because of me having to go back to that dreaded place by the time I post the next issue of this, and that makes me sad. I hate countdowns. Cya guys next time then, and hopefully by then... Futon-chan you want to let me buy your photobook already? My wallet is ready. Yep, that international shipping wallet too haha stay tuned next week to see if I get to buy it then<br><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
