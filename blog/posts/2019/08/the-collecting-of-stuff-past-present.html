Haha forgive me please I'm a nerd I can't even please send help<br><br> If you think this isn't the pinnacle of me making myself happy as I'm typing this... please leave before I beat you into a pulp haha welcome welcome!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><br> Eh basically this is just a post to talk about something I have done incessantly over the years as a kid and towards today albeit rather inconsistently... it's collecting items. They need not be free, they need not be relevant today or tomorrow, but I'd like to talk about them. About what it means to collect and what I have done in the past, now and possibly what I might do in the future. I mean, especially the past stuff, right? Okay maybe not I'm worried now haha<br><br><br><br><br> COLLECTING STICKERS<br><ul><li>What and How They Came To Be</ul>Well it wasn't a hobby of mine until I noticed this was the cheapest stuff my mom could buy for me and make me happy lol okay this was nearly 2 decades ago already, please. Stickers were dirt cheap back then, and they are really nice especially some of them which are made of good quality, but other than that since I know of no tastes anything will be appealing as a kid, isn't it? Nonetheless, some of them are real nice, and I have them all kept nicely inside a sticker album that I have kept all these years.<br><ul><li>How Much They Costed</ul>Most of them are SGD1 in a bundle so I swear they aren't as expensive as the ones below haha we'll get to those don't you worry<br><br> Some of the nicer ones though I know are a tad bit more expensive, but those are also (I'm sure) the ones with way better quality and I'll still like them today. (That was a lie haha)<br><ul><li>How It Usually Happened</ul><div>Well usually it's me and my mom (thanks mom) going out and then we pass by a sticker shop or those places where there'll be a bunch of these in like, street shops and stuff (it was the '90s) and at some point it became my mom asking me if I would want something and that smile on my face must be the only thing that kept me collecting all these stuff.</div><div><br></div><div>Eventually I stopped mostly because I've moved on to higher stakes (lol) but also because they don't sell them anymore at these prices either they got expensive or those stalls or shops get closed down because they got "cleaned up" by local authority since they weren't recognised establishments. Oh well, there goes my childhood.</div><div><ul><li>Evidence</ul></div><div>Since I still have the sticker album... here it is in all its glory haha >w&lt;</div><table align=center cellpadding=0

It sort of worked for a couple of years though, and it was until I graduated that I noticed collecting these lacked meaning and I did not put in more effort to maintain my grades (RIP Higher Chinese lol), and I think I did tell my mom that too.

But when I started (illegally) (okay can't mention that liao I'll only say this once) (so yeah don't ask about price I don't even pay for the PC and electric bills lol) in pace with the game's release they don't have all these. Collecting wasn't even a skill, and all the items aren't fully identified and dictated completely. But even then, I was OBSESSED with collecting everything. That, and mastering all the skills in the game but that is for another story.<br><ul><li>How It Usually Happened</ul>In terms of collecting stuff, because I made my old man (yep) rich (well he was after mastering all those skills) (never cheated in this save btw besides aging which technically isn't considered cheating haha), he was also able to maintain a basement which houses all the treasures from the journeys in various expansion packs and all the ores and ingots and gems and so on that were collected over time.

They come with the CDs for review. You need more? Because of a certain phenomenon called pre-ordering, one is able to get a free gift, a photo, a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/buromaido target=_blank>bromide</a> as Japan calls it, and they are as rare as you can think because limited stock for so called First Press release. So, they eventually appear on auction sites like <a href=https://buyee.jp/yahoo/auction target=_blank>this</a> today and you should consider if those I've collected are worth anything. But to me, they are worth my effort to go through all lengths to get the CDs from places where I shouldn't go, because normally you would need to <a href=https://www.tenso.com/ target=_blank>forward that shipment</a> which allows one to receive from an online shop to a local (Japan) address and many other complications which will increase the risk of them being delivered to here instead of an international shop like <a href=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/ target=_blank>this</a> or <a href=https://www.hmv.co.jp/en/ target=_blank>this</a>. (Well HMV wasn't until 2 years later since CDJapan in 2012 so...) So around end of 2013 I took my first effort to buy 2 singles on pre-order from Animate Online Shop, and got them shipped to here. It was my happiest day ever since buying my first batch of CDs haha</div><div><br></div><div>But it was only recently that I had that desperation to get more than I can get my hands on without buying the original products, and that's where those auction sites come in. The rest should be history because I talked about them twice, in "The Auction House Journey" and "The Auction House Journey Part Deux". Feel free to read those in detail yourself. In summary, it was a huge waste of money just to make me happy haha</div><div><ul><li>How Much They Cost</ul><div>You don't want to know. You really don't want to know... They are free. As I mentioned before- Oh. You want to know how many more other ones I bought through that auction site above? You've come to the right place.</div></div><div><br></div><div>So since those ones I got for free couldn't be measured financially, I'll talk about the various times I went to the auction site and precisely calculate for all of you guys (outside of those posts) how much they costed.</div><div><br></div><div class=omake><div>THE AUCTION HOUSE JOURNEY</div>(*All calculations below include two A4 clear folders)<br><br> 9 Bids + Service Fee: 450 yen (SGD 5.99) + 450 yen (SGD 5.99) + 400 yen (SGD 5.33) + 400 yen (SGD 5.33) + 400 yen (SGD 5.33) + 400 yen (SGD 5.33) + 400 yen (SGD 5.33) + 360 yen (SGD 4.80) + 450 yen (SGD 6.02) = 3710 yen (SGD 43.46)<br><br> Package Consolidation + Shipping Fee: 6,230 yen (SGD 85.77) [Including M/elody single]<br><br> Total: <b>9940 yen (SGD 129.23)</b></div><br>That is... a lot of money burnt.

And I did a lot of that with Toyosaki Aki and her singles, to be honest. It was only on two specific occasions (which I still do today) that I specifically bought bromides to keep them, and they are (1) Komatsu Mikako because she's the only one who will still sell her live performance goods online becuase she has <a href=https://mikakoshi.shop/ target=_blank>her own online store</a> and (2) Tachibana Haru aka <a href=https://twitter.com/hu_ton_ target=_blank>Futon-chan</a> because she also has <a href=https://stad.booth.pm/ target=_blank>an online store</a> in which she sells her stuff sold on comiket (ok now I wished I did that other post first so I don't have to explain who she is, so Twitter profile for reference)</div><div><br></div><div>For the auction house ones <strike>I just felt like giving them a shitload of money so</strike> the reasons behind going on a spending spree are on the posts themselves haha</div><div><ul><li>Evidence</ul><div>Before this, the photos were kept in a detachable photo album which soon I noticed will damage the products so I switched to a photo album recently, way better.

Of the one woman I've boiled many years of feelings on. That, is called a photobook. I have withheld myself from buying any of these because they aren't cheap, and the online community has been kind to provide previews on these, but other than that... I guess it just happened.

So yeah, considering the women I knew of today (goddamn now I really wish I did that post yesterday) I set a list of requirements on who and how then I could get new photobooks to do a review on. "She must be younger than me" and "I must have known her for years" are probably the current standing ones so I haven't violated any of them just yet, but who knows?
