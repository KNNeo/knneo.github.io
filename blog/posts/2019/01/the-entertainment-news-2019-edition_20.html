I assure you. And I thought of watching the shows below at some point in the trip. I really did. It did not happen because I was too tired all the time lol<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=DomeKano02><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span class=head-title>Domestic na Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"What are you going to do about that?" I mean, the step sibling thing or the sex? BOOM GOT HIM</div></blockquote>So that means if I just sat there long enough I'll get kissed? Then why the rush? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay on the super dramatic cliffhanger that left us literally hanging, in this new episode (#DomeKano02) we got a new transfer student? Really?? In the most stereotypical twist to any Anime storyline, Rui joins the school Natsuo is in because it's nearby their common accomodation. That's it. And... she kind of got some friends thanks to him too, so... yeah, forget about the sex, yes? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (Seriously, I thought there was going to be a second round in the bathroom but that was Natsuo's imagination lol) More importantly, we got some more insight into Hina-nee's affairs, namely whatever is going on with her boyfriend. I mean, if it's not obvious enough to you, it's not going well. And yes, we are likely going to reach the point of Natsuo being the substitute real soon (I'm not saying that it's impossible), but for now Hina-nee is keeping it mum. Whether that is good news or not, I'll leave you to think about it. Suffice it to say, it has to reach a conclusion at some point, which we will see soon I guess. All in all, Hina-nee sucks at cooking (how you gonna be good waifu?), Rui may become best girl by the end of this season lol (I mean, you saw how great she looks from above? lol) (I never thought I'll say this, but for once I wanna sex an Anime character haha), and we kind of have enough premise for this to be a harem. Hey, we need more accidents in this series so that we can get to the level of relationship between Natsuo with Rui that is of her to the sister too hehe WHAT, I CAN'T BE IN THE SAME BATHROOM WITH ANY OF THE TWO?? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span><br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2CjV0kG7yQckZ4mXO-fXvCWntLOUad3wRCmRliizDzgITmzohJQbAmYHnZybI163Ly23G_-QYF4gTLHOldBZIHWT4Qr8xpYmleQemSMk36aHMMvDvCijApJzN9EQMHxZKXk1hBj-596pZ/s320/domekano02_rui1.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is the most suspecting face you're gonna see Rui in this series lol<br>(If Diomedia is doing one every episode I'll do this every episode I promise)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh31u8i8Eq0-xOZGNjBLesXAPelpnzg8SzLWy6uCQpQZIcHsuAlz0stdf87M7Ym5ryamRiPEFUu4LEnvCqjtcqmClNMmz1XtxcenwkYsanfKaq2C76fpf9IUZnnL_HIJZq_QephFIOGAPwV/s320/domekano02_smile.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I didn't catch the conversation, I'm not interested in it AND I don't want to reveal myself to others</table></div></div>P.S. "If I cause more trouble again, I'm sorry" Natsuo be like "I'll be in your hands" haha (Edit: I WAS RIGHT LMAO I LOVE THIS SERIES)<br>P.P.S. I know it's only me, but man is it irritating that Hina-nee keeps reminding me of <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/28/Yui_Horie target=_blank>Horie Yui</a> instead of her actual voice actress <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Yoko_Hikasa target=_blank>Hikasa Youko</a>. I mean, their nicknames are close, but still.<br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KaguyaSama02><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span class=head-title>Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"This past half year was wasted because he wasn't using LINE" This past half year was wasted because he's a fucking pu-</div></blockquote>"I'll change my profile picture in three minutes" Wow I didn't believe this would have much impact as fast as me cooking a cup of instant noodles but man, Shirogane, you just blew my mind haha. In the new episode (#KaguyaSama02) of this narrator-heavy series (I know, I'm forgiving it and you should too it's for comedic effect anyways), Chika-chan continues to remind all of us - especially the two of them - how fast time flies when you don't do anything about it. It being that confession. Or well, driving a confession out of each other, but still. We start of the episode strong with Miyuki getting a smartphone? Just remind me again but WHAT YEAR IS IT?? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Again, another wonderful scheme from Kaguya-sama to make sure he gets it, but again it's the problem about how they can get each other's number, or <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ãƒ¡ãƒ¼ãƒ«ã‚¢ãƒ‰ãƒ¬ã‚¹ target=_blank>mail address</a> as they call it in Japan. I know, it's hard, right? I mean, as fellow club members it's as easy as opening a WhatsApp group (ask the kids today so see if I'm right), but for these two it HAS to be tough. Well, mainly because someone hasn't changed her phone yet lol. Then, there's the summer trip plan. I know this is supposed to be the work of the Anime production itself and not thought out by the 2D characters themselves (lol breaking the fourth wall here, me), but yeah we're stuck between going to the mountains or the beach. I'll skip my argument for the mountains because someone's so weak he can't swim AND he's scared of bugs (I mean, I'm more worried about bears lol), and instead go to the argument of having a potential beach episode in the future. I know about what a rich girl can stack onto that poor guy to make sure he has no way to escape that choice as she can get everything covered (lol the manual) (you're reaching a very high creepiness level, Kaguya-san). Yeah, it's going to be the beach after all. I mean, beach as in b**ch because Kaguya forgot the wildcard. The joker from the opening animation. The only other female in the student council who has a larger rack than she has. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Yes, you know who I'm talking about. So yeah, and suddenly their decsions changed. Like, copying each other's reasons changed. It got changed even more when they noticed just how Chika-chan is interested in the paranormal. Like really, what do you normally do outside of school? I feel like it's that one <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/7/Orihime_Inoue target=_blank>Inoue Orihime</a> but not on food and worse haha. (Can we get a Chika-chan focused episode, please?) (And no we don't need a beach episode for that haha) Lastly, there's the love advice. As much as Shirogane Miyuki can't keep his ego up as much as his appearance of being experienced in the love field (#Genius #<a href=https://jisho.org/search/baka target=_blank>Baka</a> btw), this guy literally lied through a session of someone asking him about a confession. Yeah, that situation to which he hasn't done it at all yet. (Deja vu, anyone?) (Just another reminder half a year has passed and NOTHING has happened to those two btw) As much as Shirogane is totally mistaken about love antics and observations (Kaguya was most likely right about that Kashiwagi girl on that guy) (Kashiwagi MVP this episode btw <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/152051/Nagisa_Kashiwagi target=_blank>real cute girl there</a> haha) (yes, voiced by Mocho), he was somewhat honest in front of others even though we all know someone was eavesdropping behind his back. About that, Shirogane you didn't notice Kaguya behind the door quick enough. I'll take that as a confession two episodes in, guys. We did it. It's over. Kaguya is happy now with that one kabedon. Just the one. We're never going to get another one as close as this. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (How can he not hear her scream though? Or was that for our ears only? Haha thanks anyway) All in all, still funny, please cut down on the narrator stuff unless where necessary (The "Umi versus Yama" bit was pretty good, I'll give you that, but otherwise the intro was really long), and I really need more Kaguya-sama moments. I feel that she (Koga Aoi specifically hehe) can make me like her more before I accidentally make a Chika-chan GIF every episode btw ONE GIF COMING RIGHT UP lmao<br><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnMsuzSI_qyD4G5UHz2HFJ2adFVa3L0uV-F2ZRNAISgjVhIXNqvv0HljW6sRwFq0J_Ygqqro3a1deapSlMUd9RX4Ux9lErCJTkBTnLWPrzhIWqL3cDFv4_L90Jy1eB5F3xqlYJhn2gHsKE/s320/kaguyasama02_mountains.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I know we're getting the beach episode, so... can we have a mountain one too? hehe</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKhSzwnGl2EKeKRD6rNorr_Levb7UotxgD9XYbcx5Eu-lDeotomiwqvkefftQ9wSPupgnlFwSZeDdOZkFmSzZZnTHNjy8iAb0BubP2EbOp0vxZIQHhC63UUzzYOaEP7rl3KJ50-HUIQwW7/s1600/kaguyasama02_confused.gif style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Didn't expect to see confusion to be perfected, but here we are. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></table></div></div>P.S. REALLY?? THIS IS GOING TO BE THE F**KING INTRO EVERY WEEK??? Ugh Aniplex you disgust me (Edit: DID I DOWNLOAD THE WRONG EPISODE??? Oh I didn't so wtf)<br>P.P.S. I would like to emphasise to you, Kaguya-sama, that you can just collude with Chika-chan and you'll get everything. Bento, phone number, a confession... everything.<br>["You want to be my what?" &lt;= Me when someone talks love using astronomy lol]<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>I'm going to be really quick here since I didn't spend much time listening to songs over the weekend. There's <b>that theme song for some local drama</b> (which is in Chinese) that I'm interested in which will get into the list once I can find out which album it belongs to or not lol, I finally got to review <b>yanaginagi's best album</b> and I ended up keeping the one who almost got accepted because I thought the song was weak in general. I'll probably give it maybe haha. <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> is a major disappointment as I literally took it to compare with her previous single back in 2017, and it's far cry. So yeah, next time Ten-chan; it's not your fault, by the way.<br><br>Next week brings us that cat music video song which is <b>the mini-album from Fuchigami Mai</b> which will also be my first release reviewing from her and hopefully I'll get something out of it besides that cat song maybe, and <b>Minase Inori's new single</b> which for once doesn't sound as bad as her past three singles and beyond lol. Ugh, I really need more mainstream artists to give me new songs. Nope, I'm not looking at you THE ORAL CIGARETTES you already disappointed me with that Anime tie-up.<br><br>On Twitter which I'll leave you to click the links from my profile page (actually I may just do that Moments thing and it'll be easier for you guys), <b>Hanazawa Kana's upcoming album next month has got like half of Sony Music Japan's artists writing for her</b> including Chatmonchy, we're getting <b>another single in March from KANA-BOON</b>, <b>Numakura Manami's 2nd album topic song</b> from the preview isn't all that bad, I suddenly jumped into <b>vivid undress</b> a couple of days ago which reminds me to listen to their new mini-album which should appear next week (oops should've listed it above) and I still can't stop listening to that Anime Kaguya-sama opening theme song. The ending song wasn't that great, by the way. But halca-san, I may just give you this time around. Second time's the charm, they say.<br><br><br><br><br>Okay I've rope burn on two of my fingers and typing now is quite a pain so I'll wrap up for now. Cya guys next week and I promise I'll write more next time. Until then... don't travel. It's boring as heck and you can't do the things you like mostly. I mean, even sleeping until I can skip hotel breakfast? I JUST WANNA SLEEP!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> *yawn* Have a good night I had a good one though hehe the resort's only 4-star and it's Batam so not that good tbh<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
