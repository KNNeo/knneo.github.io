But then again what's the difference I'm on work leave for the whole of next week YEAH haha I just can't wait Akarin you lovely girl<br><br> So yeah, welcome. Breaking all traditions this year that is seasonal reviews, we are due with another review. This time, if you don't know her it's fine she's new, but I guess we should get to know her more from here on following her singer debut, this Kitou Akari girl. Well, at least I should. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Let's see what's she's got!<br><br> Also, trying out something new to fit similar themes here, so...<br><br><br><br><div id=AkarinSwingingHeart><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq music"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Kitou Akari - Swinging Heart [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy class=mfp-img src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/15/26/PCCG-1833.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-height:969px width=200 height=200><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy class=mfp-img src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/15/27/PCCG-1834.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-height:969px width=196 height=200><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy class=mfp-img src=https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/15/28/PCCG-1835.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-height:969px width=200 height=200><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Anime Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table>(I totally dig the close enough close-ups, by the way, and the Anime version don't look too bad either so yeah, quality covers here)<br><br> Origin: This girl might need an introduction. She is Kitou Akari, probably still new as an Anime voice actresses, has starred in many leading and non-leading roles which I know a couple of including "Blend.S" and "Tsurezure Children", and has been chosen by Anime music label PONY CANYON to be the next star on her singer debut. Her unique voice in itself might already stand out as a singer here, and in her first single it has been shown probably in many ways than other, but not all of them yet. We shall see, Akarin, but for starters this ain't too bad. And as a short-time fan which joined recently on the bandwagon that is her and everything that exploded including having her personal Twitter account, this is just the beginning of everything lovely and beyond, I would believe.<br><br> (1) Swinging Heart<br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> "Swinging Heart; Relaxingly, (my) heart is wavering</div><div style=text-align:center>Colorful wishes, (they) flow out (of me)</div><div style=text-align:center>(I'm) sure to make it happen, it's a promise?</div><div style=text-align:center>Always, believe in me"</div></blockquote>This song packs a punch, for starters. To make an impression and literally put the Anime theme song to shame instead of putting it in the spotlight (we shall discuss on that later), the music label chose to put in a song to remember. I guess talking about her maiden voyage as a singer would be an easy focus, and this song properly conveys the emotions with accordance to the title, as she feels nervous yet excited to embark on this journey she will never forget. And it wants our support. You got it, girl. Apart from that, the melody isn't a problem until you hit the typical bridge part because why make it short when you can make it irritatingly long, but the vibe of the song in general will make it an impression to remember, if that was the intention.<br> Rating: 4 stars (Lovingly Average)<br><br> (2)<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=783 data-original-width=1600 height=156 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDFHqDMRmiVck0oy5MaC7pCtroQ1sJHXpP4GyScVFR0x1WwwSWYA-sBQ5kzH9FRBkBIZi5bOFDyQdqDr-BJzWqpR_wgoMmxMFSMCr70mjrAeLRT1MkKBdOxASeb3VxCMiiM26A1KjYByg/s320/IMG_20191026_192010.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I felt so, so proud of yuiko-san when I saw that name up there</table>In contrast, as placed in less attention compared to the first song, this one is surprisingly good as an Anime theme song, even as an ending theme. It also shows a difference in mood compared to the first, giving a more mellow feel and sentimentalism as felt from the lyrics, which is written in part by yuiko, a familiar figure which is a singer herself under doujin group Primary. Talking about looking ahead into the future and looking back at the times, this adds on to the journey feel that is present in the songs thus far, and how we should embrace them and move forward. It's not touching enough, but it can touch hearts. I'm sure it will for you too. Don't feel too sad thinking about it, yes? The melody around the bridge part isn't good anyways.<br> Rating: 4 stars (Anime-level Average)<br><br> (3) Always Going My Way<br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Always going my way</div><div style=text-align:center>Decided rules of which (I will) overcome</div><div style=text-align:center>Always going my love</div><div style=text-align:center>(It's that) 'Love' engine going all out</div><div style=text-align:center>Hey (we) still, still, still, still don't know</div><div style=text-align:center>For the sake of meeting (my) perfect self, (I will) push forward!"</div></blockquote>So, this must be the one to seal the deal, and it's not hard to tell why. Being the hype song of this release, it's firstly presented differently from the first song, which probably has a more emotional side if you hear the lyrics, but this one is all out cheerful. The lyrics explode of confidence in liking stuff, and pushing in feminism to a whole new level, which is totally applicable, I would assume. If this isn't the next song to be singing with the audience in a live, nothing will come close. This song screams of love, a great melody and plenty of cute shouting which is always a good thing. It's the ultimate idolism song until we get another, to be honest. You have no idea how much I love this song hehe<br> Rating: 4 stars (Overhyped Above Average)<br><br> Conclusion: Her effort in singing is easily represented in this first single from Kitou Akari, and if her voice can't convince you to like all three songs, nothing will. For idols and alike, I normally give credit to those who have unique and lovely voices, and I think she has them all. The songs from the right music label is just icing on the cake. And that, I would love to recommend you all to give it a listen, especially the last song, in my opinion.<br><br> -Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br><br> THE PACKAGE<br> Here's a walkthrough of my hype despite receiving it a date later and not paying top bucks to make it come here faster:<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1200 data-original-width=1600 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9OHH2Y0-plcFqFt2IZbWHjylyK4tbV8o_O8YerFJ1c-hD3ejH4CFNK8WGbAD1XMe3Ib1DV7kCWsCjBRiBj5imizTLIDNNVq9HzfoXWb8e55Cjbw7gNqmYFfzmP7pBSnn5X6bcqjqAhrU/s320/IMG_20191026_103824.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>It came in a red box?

PONY CANYON's official Anime store Canime (Canyon + Anime = Canime, get it?) and that's how I got this super large bromide? It's 2L size, by the way. If you need an estimate, that's larger than a postcard, and is similar to the ones I bought from another voice actresses' official store some years ago haha. Anyways, let's take a look on what's inside!<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1200 data-original-width=1600 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfsZ0LiXcE29NqLNYfZzrvhba83Gb-cM2SvjYMcyfRHwI8oX_Hd9Bwx22o7AicaMikmFtJ09tp7U09MzKWh-gQXPG0nG52Ixe25hQTrJO03k2XszM-LqsZHFYf2CWLwHdRi9EVZMcA3r0/s320/IMG_20191026_191548.jpg width=320></div>Inside is nothing but Akarin, which is great. The binder didn't have art behind it, but that's fine. It's seemingly normal for a Regular Edition good, but hey, I'm not complaining. They went for some retro styling of the text apparently (GTA Vice City, is that you? lol) (the lyrics inside the booklet is fine though) (says of haphazard production tbh) and... I don't want to comment on how great she looks in this outfit hehe<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1200 data-original-width=1600 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi98-Yi1JQJ5BgKWJyoctpkQf9g61HKuejGxUnPjKCe4oLzUMYQA9-BnKWe_teTSECbZupnfqlILn4KUgSKh-0RBNvCNjAlGd6nAT8Ip1lw8j6v0RVuM4j0HwEt6PuIDSj3uMbt8WVn5P8/s320/IMG_20191026_191437.jpg width=320></div>In terms of special gifts, there are a heck ton of them all around, but I came to <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjVvNTg-7WxklIKNB5UexPgkWzfQZzs0phUMunoh-5zQqerGzEuAmiP1LfXorycilQNVNQmv_xV6DhuwB2p15u8aa24b5ULZFjrkmgpgWwVFRpIaowau0ic4-_eMGt8fFJNg-339TlHvE/s320/img_special_canime.jpg target=_blank>this large bromide</a> (yes I know of the size already) because I know I can't get <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgraOdOfGwm1BtxSGOQalepX6Kuq4f9S3ctYOMUrNqUg5NvZpf3kd1iKaspPg3TkICGR_-H5-m7I57VKA1AavNKuB3Jbchhn3p2z2YVGmD0NhRQZptxbfOjWfrYxlR41o_cqRXAkgE3IBg/s320/img_special_gamers_nagoya.jpg target=_blank>this one</a> (why you only exclusive to that one Gamers physical store in Nagoya) (that armpit though) and <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9UHallyYtNmjVbeVACeSdasGcKI9GwdePUcCuDOVnOF559aUJ7_DjSV-ZgLJvsG7_hMAP_lACNVi2TTLzFhKSgGaqGZNumGNDhMrgBcw9sfQBzf7z9vMrNm8kSjjyDOGibgZAo8e9Tes/s320/img_special_sofmap.jpg target=_blank>this one</a> (screw you Sofmap) so I took the 3rd best option. No portrait phone wallpaper to complete this week, I guess. I'll need to find another woman lol sorry Akarin you ran out lmao<br><br><br><br><br> Haha I guess this is it then. Since I'm not really compiling these anymore considering the pathetic amount that meet the requirements every year, I'm treating this less seriously, and I hope with a little of my fanboy leaking out somewhere (or everywhere lol) it'll convince you <strike>how good this single is</strike> how much I like this girl now haha. Cya guys next time then, probably tomorrow, and until then... I have much to do and quite a lot on Klassic Note which probably won't get us another review (sphere's new single why) but hey, it's still important, nonetheless. It's the song awards, if you need a hint haha she'll be in it I can promise that hehe bye<br><br> P.S.<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYFhS14ceBC5oevp158rpi8N8iW7xbD2Q8btw0H7RxARQiARqE4gF8F_WWfqlzvzpfS_pGZ72nRaHLfRm2YLcJYR1fGm0PM0Z1hoyfLjcdWy7YNe86RZCLMk0AtBjm-xxgr6PGXmn7RcI/s320/IMG_20191026_203641.jpg width=240 height=320 data-original-width=1200 data-original-height=1600></div>When I stared at the booklet while singing along this image really looks like her boobs are saggy-<br><br> P.P.S.
