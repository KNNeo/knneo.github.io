<div class="page-header"></div>
<p>Hey, everyone, and Happy Holiday today! Well for those who do not have a holiday today, that’s… not my problem. Oops.<p>Well I thought I might just feel like it to talk about the distinctive differences between the star ratings I always mention in my Tweets (if anyone goes there) and also Klassic Note Reviews throughout the year. Here’s a breakdown:<p>(*All ratings here is with respect to this year, ie. the year 2014. Everything before that is not dependent on this list.)<p>THREE STARS<br>Probably inexistent anymore, I normally only give three star ratings if <strong>I noticed later in the year that the song is not attractive to me anymore. </strong>Rarely the case, but typically this may apply to songs selected at the start of the year. I do not give examples for this rating of songs this year because I’ve not yet bad enough to do it, but I have a feeling.<p>Oh and for those that did not make the list, I typically make a list of songs recorded which I call them as “2.99-star songs”, in which they are not good enough to stay in the list, or even get accepted by me. It typically comes across with familiar artists which I intend to review but get out of it in disappointment. A very good example of this (without listing more) is Tomacchan’s single in July. The reason I gave was “out of melody”. Hmm. Really, I have her two more chances throughout the year and it still didn’t get out of this list.<p>FOUR STARS<br>Typically the rating for most of the songs in my list throughout Klassic Note, like, ever since it started, <strong>songs with four stars are the first ratings given to songs which I think I like in my list.</strong> Generally speaking due to the differences in the ranks, like how they rank GPAs in universities, I have those “second upper” kind of ratings, where some are obviously fancied by me compared to others, but <strong>they generally are not good of an impression enough to be given a five star rating.</strong> Examples? I guess I don’t even need to. Some may also have climbed from three stars to four stars sometimes in previous years for some rare cases, if not normally will stay throughout the year.<p>FIVE STARS<br>Songs who get a five star rating have changed in criteria over the years, but for recent years<strong> it has always been given due to the outstanding first impression they give.</strong> Of course there is the idea of <strong>songs managed to ‘climb up the ranks’</strong> and later in the year be given the rating, especially with recent years where first impression songs are getting rare. The most recent one, and yes with the day of this post, is the first nano.RIPE song I hear, also the ending song of Anime “Glasslip”. The impression lasted ever since I heard it from like June till now, so I decided it should be given its due recognition. For this year, the only one I gave based on first impression (music video in this case) is miwa’s song at the start of the year “Faith”, mostly due to the situation I’m in at that time too. But just to keep up with ratings with previous years, I typically level up some songs at the end of the year to give credit to some <strong>songs who lasted in impression throughout the year</strong>, devoid of the first impression that it should be based on.<p> <p>All in all, especially with the first five years, <strong>there seem to show a trend</strong> in how I give my ratings, but <strong>recent years have shown otherwise</strong>, mostly due to the fact that <strong>my song impressions have changed, me thinking of melodies that I want but don’t hear, and not bring impressed by familiar melodies and typical music styles.</strong> But it is compensated every year with these ‘regulations’ I attempt to go every year. Hopefully I don’t have to do that, my mood gets better and I'll have a better mood to give more songs that don’t suck.<p>Wow.<p>I said it.<p>Finally.<p>Seriously, people in Japan. I  know you guys can create better songs than what I hear now.<p>[P.S.: Recent activity? Wait till next month and I’ll… probably not tell you all about it. On the other hand, the package is moving.]<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
