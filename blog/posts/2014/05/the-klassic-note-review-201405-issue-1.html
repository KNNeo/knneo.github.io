Ever since listening to her debut single from Anime ‚ÄúBLEACH‚Äù, I‚Äôve been following her on her new songs, with a breakthrough in 2012, where she sings the three-parter duo songs followed by her album, which created an impression, at least for me. Since her shift out of Sony Music Japan, she has been actively singing original and cover songs too, with this being an original production. Without cover songs. Her previous two songs are not the case. <br><br>(1) Endless Road<br>This song is about love, and more than that. It‚Äôs about happiness and bliss. Besides, the topic is about marriage anyway, shown in the PV. Nice song though, like I‚Äôve not been hearing a good song from fumika in a while. Lyrics are also written in topic, with four seasons and reminiscing the past, making the songs more impressionable. Overall, this is a nice song, and it fully represents fumika‚Äôs style. And since she‚Äôs out of Sony Music Japan, a super-copyrighted label, means you can watch the PV on YouTube! My eyes tear up the first time I watched and sang to this. <span class=emoji title=üò¢>*sob*</span><br><div style=text-align:center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 height=189 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fLX_A80dMVw width=336></iframe></div><div style=clear:both;width:448px>If you tear up halfway through the song, so did I‚Ä¶</div><br>Rating: 4 stars (Solid Average) <br><br>(2) A~Yokatta<br>Don‚Äôt mind the looks of the song title, but the song itself is full of hype, and a feel of thankfulness is felt after receiving bliss and enjoying the happiness. I like this song too, as is concludes the single really well. Which really makes this single so complete. Makes me feel like I‚Äôve reached another stage of my life, though not marriage, haha. <br>Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br><br>Verdict: Overall, it‚Äôs a good single. It‚Äôs complete, as I mentioned above in the two songs in it. And I‚Äôve already placed an order, which‚Ä¶ is not here yet. I‚Äôll show fumika-san on Twitter when I got the copy. It‚Äôs the best proof that I do support artists I listen.<br>[P.S.: With ‚ÄúEndless Road‚Äù the song I also got fumika-san to follow me on Twitter. OMG.]<br><br><span class=head-title>ALSO!</span><br><span class=head-title><br></span><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=sphereTashikaMirai><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>sphere ‚Äì Kasuka na Hisoka na Tashika na Mirai [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy src="https://www.gamers.co.jp/resize_image.php?image=04281330_535dd96954e42.jpg" style=-webkit-user-select:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=200 height=200><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy src="https://www.gamers.co.jp/resize_image.php?image=04281331_535dd9ab52640.jpg" tyle="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width=200 height=200><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy src="https://www.gamers.co.jp/resize_image.php?image=04281332_535dd9daed032.jpg" style=-webkit-user-select:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=200 height=200><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Anime Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table>(I know about the title being in <a href=https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/LASM-4168 target=_blank>another format</a>, but I shall stick to the consensus. Very typical covers though, and Nanana-chan seems to have twisted her arm‚Ä¶)<br><br>Origin: If you guys need me to introduce this voice actor idol group, then you‚Äôre insulting my unique taste in their works. Again they have tied up with another Anime ‚ÄúRyuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin‚Äù which I do watch (not a bad show), impending for their upcoming FOURTH album after celebrating their 5th anniversary after debut. Again, this single is not a disappointment, and I‚Äôve already prepared to press the order button when I finished listening to this release.<br><br>(1) Kasuka na Hisoka na Tashika na Mirai [(A) Faint, Scretive, Certain Future]<br>What‚Äôs almost awesome is from when I heard the Anime preview and radio previews before that, and overall the song lands in the typical Anison format, which is fine by my case. I personally favour a shorter song (as shorter song makes lesser mistakes and variations), but this is fine as it is. A very nice song to listen to, especially the chorus.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Anison-typical Average)<br><br>(2) synchronicity<br>I only knew of the title of the song and heard the preview of the song from Aki-chan‚Äôs radio show just three days ago, and I heard the full song yesterday already. With the song title‚Äôs creativity aligned with mine (refer to APoL cards for details LOL), this song is also creativity presented, in a wacky and somehow naughty way (with a slight dere theme?), typical of their songs. And I particularly liked the chorus, and again, this song turned out better than the A-side above. It‚Äôs not the first time this has happened, so I shall no dwell upon it. Personally like this song more than the Anison, and primarily the reason why I would bother to go Sony Music Shop to get the special gift AGAIN.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br><br>Verdict: If it‚Äôs not good it wouldn‚Äôt even make it here. This is another good single from sphere. And I like it. PV-wise‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt seen it yet, so‚Ä¶ But overall it‚Äôs good, and Klassic Note is about listening, so I guess the video is not important?<br><br>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br><br>That‚Äôs all, folks. Until the next time‚Ä¶ if I get the two singles within next week then I‚Äôll talk about it again? Meanwhile I‚Äôll moan about the dreadful reality that I don‚Äôt live in Japan‚Ä¶<br><br><div style=text-align:center>ADVERTISEMENT</div><div style=text-align:center>Follow @KlassicNote on Twitter! ‚Äì <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish title=https://twitter.com/aozakish>https://twitter.com/aozakish</a></div><div style=text-align:center>Listen to dozens of music videos on Youtube! ‚Äì KlassicNote@YouTube</div><div style=text-align:center>END OF ADVERTISEMENT</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote"><span class="material-icons small-icons">music_note</span>The Klassic Note</a><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheReview"><span class="material-icons small-icons">edit_note</span>The Review</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text ¬© 2014 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
