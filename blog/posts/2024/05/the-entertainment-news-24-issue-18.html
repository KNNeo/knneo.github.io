Also a plus is me spending the weekend fixing up the blog again, this time adding in 2017 entertainment news to the sitemap (not in Blogger), so yeah, in case you missed <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34934/Koi_to_Uso target=_blank>Anime "Koi to Uso"</a> or <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/32949/Kuzu_no_Honkai target=_blank>"Kuzu no Honkai"</a> lmao yes I rejected the heck out of those, you can still view them. I'm just doing this for <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/145199/Lotta_Otus target=_blank>Lotta-chan</a> hehe alright <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/145200/Mauve target=_blank>Mauve</a> is the other reason LMAO all <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/33337/ACCA__13-ku_Kansatsu-ka target=_blank>Anime "ACCA"</a> goodness worth looking back again tbh</div><div><br></div><div>Well, we are at 2024 now so what else is new besides new episodes of Anime!! This left ear though... <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki05><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"We've gone to ready-to-heat rice packs to using a rice cooker" Yeah this is like saying we've gone from dating to f**king-</div></blockquote><div>Dude, if hot food grows on trees in Heaven, maybe I should just go there now- In this new episode of heavenliness I should stop getting envious about because if I were there I wouldn't be watching this to say the least (#TenshiTsuki05), hey maybe they have Anime in Heaven. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah in Heaven, Shintarou will have a larger harem than <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/183520/Rentarou_Aijou target=_blank>Rentarou from Anime "Hyakkano"</a> in season one question mark?? Haha say it ain't so because we aren't even started with this bunch! Because in Tsumugi's umpteen solo meetings to herself and I swear she is going to have that FBI room with all the lines and pins on the walls soon if she doesn't figure out how to deal with whatever her classmate Shintarou is going through now. Specifically on how she wants to be in it. Right and center. Just, you know, she thinks she is too normal compared to this lot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But we know a lot of things about her to not think so, so yeah, she is not <em>completely</em> normal. She is also what we refer too as *voice sample <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/16498/Takako_Kimura target=_blank>Takako from Anime "Kannagi"</a>* too-pure-pure-girl. Okay get that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yandere target=_blank>yandere</a> bit of hers out of the way, we should talk more about Tsutsumi Tsumugi here!! She... man, she's a girl. Thanks to The Sims video game series, we like to call these people hopeless romantic, where what they want is never aligned to what they would do. Kind of like how I want to get laid but I'm here watching Anime like a weeb. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha, she is trying so hard to devise a plan that she will not execute lol, not until her mom gives her an opportunity: A voucher to the nearby cake shop. Yay, she says, pissing off her younger brother at the same time, but problem is how does she approach this? She can NOT tell that childhood dork of hers because he will not help, and if it's me I'll definitely just text him on this and NOT include Shunichi just because you know, 2000yen ain't enough for the 3 of us. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> But turns out it's the opposite, because not did she not say anything to her boi the whole school day, she had to wait for Shunichi to give her the dab on Shintarou for SOMETHING to even happen. Of course, you aren't here to realize these three going out we want what is essentially a date hehe, so we got rid of the guy just because. Now THIS is Heaven. Hell yeah let's go our human counterpart gets her first dab, so happy for her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Despite all the challenges she faced including a trip to the library, I'm pretty sure she enjoyed herself more than my middle school life when I was still contemplating how to make any girl mine. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> So yeah, she wins. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then we have Noel-chan. I mean, she really is adorable when she doesn't speak lol shout out to the guys at the park, and it's fun to hang out with her eating snacks at the convenience store, but if you would NOT keep that plastic as a memento and drop the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>isekai</a> Anime talk, we can hang out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, I don't even watch on streaming services HAHA ah hey. All in all... have you ever hung out with your opposite gender friend and sucked on something together- Wait wait, redo. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, we wished this series is just this episode alone. But no, this is a freaking harem series and we are NOT letting the only guy off easily so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But serious talk though, this is the slice-of-life romance you wish you will see more instead of what was the same thing I assume but cloaked in genres I don't care about. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah, those were cringe or I'm just old, but heck, to whoever thinks I'll choose Noel-chan over Tsumugi... I would argue the former is considerably more childish-acting for her age and it's probably due to her opening up to her very first friend(?), but the latter is more to pity and I always adore hopeless romantics like... myself... so yeah, I'll choose to like normal human instead thanks, I am bad with cold stuff. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> And looks like WOAH I AM GOING TO JAIL lol but yeah, we have a new character introduction situation here again so- And that's why we stick to humans, even the cold ones haha see you then.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghrwBcTq4kdnvqWiYh1-zkKt_lBFbSoR3CQ0v1ItHs_cU_JPbw8H8ERNQqsHuRxW0P61wv2pvNToTxaZHz5TAAzMS77hKHeU4W3xCNEa2VVc4AGAtvQkxJUnrky6y_aQ_ehWrxSDCZJTZe5g23-wzCZgDGQwJObEHWMoggSG1L4GZjxlW-o649wJwJ1w4/s320/tenshitsuki05_couple6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you stare hard enough you can see an Anime second season LMAO GOTTEM</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSIdSZUAXk52d-PiwkT9-4RPEVFsrMrS8HcRNLOhYLGWhm62NleOUbQgJtZwPXpU9Rxq-lsACV_BPLx6XQIoSvQPXj6EAxbSlUBmjzz9zgmL86RO7_TBOa4fvMcIxcMGzoNe6KcyDA4FPVpcNwOju6CB079Nds4deGWQrBE7dFPRwipq07JbsFNnHJcvc/s320/tenshitsuki05_drawing.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you stare hard enough you can see a terribly drawn Shintarou lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQlsw7_pTcM-tXuIAtN8Uf70k2zgKoJc5DqJ7UY0PBw6NzUzl2gMPPZJDZYIvhXcMUlQNNNW_T4xMe7r1lXBwrNo-994NDJAHFfF6AG07i8YveVEoS3LY7llEle0hwjbMV5z8f8R4tUKvmRskxDHeFGugsJxuaKbW7B8oC_TwpoQXBAAvxrHcmRyiOkrg/s320/tenshitsuki05_noel9.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you stare hard enough you can see... *dab*</table></div></div><div>P.S.

THAT WAS A JOKE?? BRUH haha</div></blockquote><div>I mean, yeah, Alice is used to it already despite this being not her mother. They say there are always two jokers in a pack so... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Get it? A pack of poker cards? Oh well, whatever. At least in this new episode though we are not joking around so take this as the last joke I'll say for this (#ShinigamiBocchan28), because damn, this is lore time. Because apart from the surprise appearance of Liz the grandmother (haha yeah) and his husband Victor which, in case you have no idea who that is go back and watch season 2 we stormed his place years ago to talk to him, we also now know the story of Victor... and Sade. WHAT??? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, if it's just an affair thing then it's not too surprising. But what isn't? *giggle* So, story goes that, Sade got powerful enough to be the leader of the Underworld, and made a contract with Victor who at that time is likely at his worst stage of his life right now. He lost his wife when he was in what looks like his 40s after she left their only son behind, and many more left as he was seen looking over the one grave alone. I would assume this is when Sade thought to use her powers to form a contract and take some of his meaningless(?) life away in exchange of something he would want to do... even in the afterlife: To travel with his wife Liz. Oh, so he's the first? Uh... yikes? But damn, what would he do if he decided not to do it? That wouldn't mean much to an all-powerful mage, but more importantly, Sade took interest in him after so haphazardly agreeing to the terms. I mean, there isn't much to talk about he has lost the love of his life so not like Sade would replace him HAHAHAHAHA ah hey, and not like anyone else will make him happy... again... so yeah, whatever it takes, dude. So Victor signed it MOTHERF**KER DID NOT EVEN READ THE T&amp;C!!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This is how they get'cha. This is how. Yeah thanks, Zuckerberg. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But well, there are a lot of conditions for that travel package lol for example unlike the ones we have in real life you can't travel to the same place twice and that's why they were seen in the old mansion they thought no one was here but long story anyways Victor go watch season 1 would ya haha, but more importantly, the condition is that Sade would be involved in your life. Literally. Not like, satellite be around you and curse your grandson kind of involved lol. Not like, think that Victor has been cheating on his wife AND Sade herself by hanging out with Sharon kind of involved. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, Sade DOES NOT forgive harems in this world of hers. Yeah, monogamy or singles only, lowly humans. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But as in, as Sade said in his deathbed which has been reduced 20 years (and goddamn he still lived till he saw gray hair?), she wanted to be with him. Romantically, I assume. If you want the s*x you should've said decades earlier. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And Liz was right in adding in that jealousy of Sade (I'm not making the song title joke) turned into hatred, this dumb woman, and fired against anyone having the right to love. I know right, literally my bro if he was evil. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But now that we know the truth, this pill is going to be WAY harder to swallow. Because Bocchan here might be right as I conclude this long lore drop, that the only way to save Sade is to let her realize what love is... when she is alive. Yep, Nico might be real pissed at where this is going, but all in all I think this is a good enough lore to make us ponder why Bocchan wants to talk to Sade instead. It's like having to help someone's love life to fix their depression. Especially someone with so much power when she was alive. Yeah. Now what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I have no idea, dude. I'm still taking this in. From the grandparents to what Sade has revealed maybe a fraction of herself to us, to even the decision change which is what I most expect out of this episode now that I've got it... It's vexing, you know. Maybe ask me again next week we got a dance party to attend! <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "Even dead, he still seems to be having fun."

He's just a great host at a bar. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> In this new episode where we be travellin' (#Bartender05), we are going to a distillery! Man, if this isn't the biggest cover of an emotional episode ever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, if you haven't seen it coming, you should've. So, let's not talk about why this distillery is at Yamazaki because who cares haha, let's talk about Chen. He... I don't know how new he is to the bartender industry. But heck, he's from Bar K where that snob Kuzuhara is from so he can't be all bad. Just that he is. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It didn't take long for the other girls who joined us don't ask me why Miwa-san is here too she is not a bartender but *umph* haha, they know this guy is not talking much, and that's a problem. Is it though? Sasakura thought this trip will bring him some social interaction with other bartenders to broaden his knowledge, but heck, the only thing that needs broadening is his lips because HE IS NOT SPEAKING TO US, DUDE! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay let's not make fun of him it's like making fun of myself <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, so let's talk about why he looks so uneasy just being here. So, flashback 12 years ago apparently where he was in a business trip with his dad <strike><a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/1086/Sousuke_Aizen target=_blank>Aizen Sousuke</a></strike> oh wait sorry (<a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/137/Show_Hayami target=_blank>Hayami Show</a> why are you even here, of all reasons? Haha), and had to stay in an inn in Yamazaki. Chen (the son) met this girl Chitose who was the daughter of the establishment, and just like him, had other plans on what they wanted to be other than what their parents dictated, to take over the place. I know it's hard to find a successor nowadays, but if you have kids just to have them take over your business? Maybe you should have more kids to have more options. Like, a dozen more at least. Because they don't and begrudgingly this isn't even the age where people only have the one kid, these sole descendants are obviously bounded by their parents to succeed in what they have. Of course, unlike the parents, Chen if you can believe it wants to be a bartender and he did it eventually, and Chitose here wants to be a dancer since we saw her rehearsing. But do you know Chitose, that you can live, both lives at once- Who are we lying to, I can barely live one life now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So the two of them over time made a decision: To skip off their duties for a day and go to the local festival if they have each a winning ice cream stick. (This is a Japan thing, each stick comes with "win" or "lose" and the former means you get another free stick) (Thank you <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/31636/Dagashi_Kashi target=_blank>Anime "Dagashi Kashi"</a> hehe) AND THEY DID GO TO THE FESTIVAL- Oh and yeah in case your realized something's wrong, they did not, at any time, promise to meet each other again. Welp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And that's what Chen is precisely here for. He obeyed his dad's orders instead, and skipped the meet-up. Whether the return of an amulet and a short letter at the end of their trip means anything... Well, turns out with some quick research, it's an amulet symbolizing true love. Huh. Problem. Girl's gone now. *yikes* Haha hey she's still alive, relax. We just don't know where she might be. Maybe she found true love without us. *yikes* Chen, just everyone else with me, you are NOT to be pitied. I'm sorry, bro. Just like the 3 Yamazaki rivers, time is unforgiving, even the whiskey you drank went down faster than your feelings for the girl would ever. All in all... I always bring back this question about parenting and such, but yeah, when your kid has realized or found something, do you tell them even guide them to understand what it is, or just shove their hopes and dreams away only to teach them to behave? This... is a thing I think of a lot. Because sometimes, it's not because of us that we are lost. Oh heck, it's over now, so what can we do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Those who can are those who were free in the first place. Maybe this episode just like every other growing-up series, will teach parents a lesson- They are not watching. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> CUT OFF THAT FAMILY LINE WOULD YA?? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> You're welcome, my dear parents. <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> RANT OVER!!</div><div>[Tl:DR; "Since his mentor is Mister Perfect, does his discipline have to be Mister Robot?"

Or how he survived the fire. Well, they don't have to hehe, since in this new episode (#KuroshitsujiSchool04), we have upped our ranks in Weston College for you guys to not be able to ask questions about his background! <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> No really, Ciel just walked around the school asking people for stuff even from other schools and they answer, and it's because he just got a flower on his suit. Hell yeah, we like a promotion. Because damn, getting a rise in ranks on these school ground is ROUGH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not only did Ciel had to try out such a plot to dethrone a Prefect's drudge in order to have access to the gazebo, even he appeared there as a regular now... it was hard to talk. Well, not that he had to talk the only thing people knew about him were Elizabeth and whether they were BANGING lol interestingly they don't so conversation's over, just like how Ciel tried to carry one with Prefect Violet. This guy... eccentric might be too small a word to describe him. In spite of carrying a somewhat weak conversation in the gazebo and instituting a somewhat invisible presence to the extent that his drudge stands out more than him when they were talking about the yearly cricket event in school, he still was able to monitor Greenhill's pose for his artwork while drawing with a black chalk... a maze?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This is already enough to make Ciel crack but not in like why he's in this college because not even his brother-in-law got anything out of him lmao, but yeah Violet is weird. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ciel did mention Derrick our dear victim (so far) in this incident we were ordered to investigate, and looks like the P4 are more worried about how people knew about this guy (and possibly many others) compared to everyone else in the garden. And so far, all their answers have been, in response to Derrick's transfer to the Purple House, that it's all the headmaster's decision. Yep. CLEARLY someone is hiding something. I mean, look at Violet-senpai here looking around like he thinks Sebastian-sensei and Ciel-kun are trying to dig out something like this is some Conan detective Anime series- Oops. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, not really, there isn't just ONE truth in case you wonder <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> (NO STOP DANCING THAT IS AFTER THE CRICKET MATCH AT NIGHT) (haha), which the first of them is that, as we all know, that Derrick must be in the Purple House. But we aren't that patient to dress up as Derrick's (female, even) relatives to visit him when the cricket match is over in a few months lmao, so the other option is to sneak in. Uh, get rid of the followers first, would ya? *ahem* Okay, moving on. I legit thought like every other Anime there will be a secret passage we can crawl into or something, but since Ciel read the school rules so well now, we know we can get the students out (all of them) just by setting the place on fire. *taps brain* Yeah, gotta find inspiration in those school rules to create these loopholes. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, exciting episode though a bit dull since it's a lot of talking and yes Violet's drawings did help with the humour lol, and we shall see if Derrick is even in there. Spoiler alert... if the P4 were that worried, good chances he isn't in a place where he would run out in a fire. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Let's see where this Red House trail will take us, yeah?

This is girls love Anime we don't like dudes here. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But what if Himari-chan, I told you that some guy in the future will make you understand and fall in love- In this new episode where an all-girls high school love is real lol (#SasaKoi04), I mean come on, we need something spicy here, don't tell me it's just 12 episodes of Yori trying to woo Himari-chan. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah, at least let me see <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20240322/19/toyosakiaki-blog/64/16/j/o0410060015416162964.jpg target=_blank>Aki-chan</a> here break before I reject this series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Which is also what I thought throughout the episode because again, if you haven't seen how the Anime has been giving much hints to you so far, you should have noticed. I don't know how to tell you where to look, as it's as subtle as their friendship has been so far, because despite all the drama that has been going on right now, Yori will go into a band just for her girl (this is kinda <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> to say haha normally I use "her boi" lmao) even if it's with people she know all too well about, her classmates in school. I mean, it isn't weird, they have known each other for now, we know that because that vocalist left *oof* haha we shall put that aside first, and just as the other two are openly in love with each other don't ask what level they are in probably around the level of Kohara Konomi and Koga Aoi lmao voice actresses joke, we already know that <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20240314/20/toyosakiaki-blog/ce/81/j/o0468060015413020104.jpg target=_blank>Aki-chan</a> here (I might stop doing this, running out of sources lol) is dearly in love with Yori who doesn't really mind since I assume they have been friends for a long time to have such rapport and not mind each other's confessions or whatever. Not the same as Himari-chan here, is the thing. And despite Himari being interested in Yori-senpai's singing and hopefully herself at some point, in searching for something to do after school because she just lost her rooftop time to a music studio for band practice lmao, she took interest in two things that the latter would be of concern. She got into the cooking research club (lol is it those in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37171/Asobi_Asobase target=_blank>Anime "Asobi Asobase"</a> where you burn the yearly club budget) meeting new girl Momoko-senpai (hey yo though) who is willing to teach her how to cook since well, from what I learnt with disbanding clubs is that, if we find ANYONE of just a teeny bit of interest in the club we YANK them in like they owe us money. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or convince them until they find a reason to join. And surprise, if you didn't notice that this is a good way to get Yori-senpai filled with joy after her band rehearsals. I saw that from a like, a mile away, but yeah, all according to <a href=https://jisho.org/search/keikaku target=_blank>keikaku</a> again I guess. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Like really, would Yori-senpai NOT like some handmade cooking?? On the contrary, if Yori will think that Himari-chan might neglect her and show much affection to others because of this, then perhaps she will understand what her understanding of love is and how far this will go, isn't it? Yeah, we have been on that since the previous episode. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> What surprised me and anticipated me most though, is the stop time we were given between Himari and <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20240307/15/toyosakiaki-blog/83/13/j/o0450060015410170782.jpg target=_blank>Aki-chan</a>, and IN CASE you didn't realize why even Miki-chan (who is looking especially adorable today haha oi) wondered why she didn't bring the cooking from the club straight to Yori, is that this drama is meant to happen. SURELY WE ARE COOKING haha not that though we did the pound cakes already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, now that a certain someone has fanned the flames that I have always wanted to see (not talking about cooking lol), I would like to say yes, this. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Because damn, this is going to create a lot of incoming heartbreak. Remember, apart from the... friendships we have going on here lol let's not say romantically even though we know, we also have these formal relationships where <a href=https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20240216/18/toyosakiaki-blog/64/fc/j/o0470060015402272831.jpg target=_blank>Aki-chan</a> is now Yori's fellow band member in school, and Himari-chan is Yori's plaything. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No no, as in, she plays songs for her on the days she isn't practicing in a band. That kind. Those are strikingly different between the "love" we are seeing so far, and I can't wait to see how the layers crumble. I am already giving up on the aspect on seeing more music from this so welp this isn't the next <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On target=_blank>Anime "K-ON!" series</a> you might as well watch other offerings this season, but heck, to whichever ship I'm hopping between, we shall see it unfold! My legs are ready HAHA and the problem is it cycles around so Himari will just tell the sister?? Ah, I love me some intense drama lol</div><div>[TL:DR; Let me set this here like the prophet I am hehe, but yeah Himari-chan, you may not know of love but this Mizuguchi Aki here is not going to give you the time to learn of that HAHAHAHA this series has evil but we knew of that already]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2V9J51IHkFIo1Uec7tBPC98I0dqrzJm8gBHvF-5iQEXPG-2f2Mn4v9cvrs4iib5hxtQdCdBtMxaets4sniohkkY7JTkeW5Cy0JkfqScO66YuhDSgDR2EoKF3AJdWx3J1Ilc1LO9LgTVtDUbBfhQHejbn6vfTqOvn21V5U40nXOzks7S5YviXuM9yVZcs/s320/sasakoi04_phone.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Oh heck I do this too, just tapping on the lock screen of my phone even if it turns down?</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvo41pgOxqP9cjYsvq-fuFNpVJ5xMmDnhripO9YMQ1tAwaumL22yVMY6QNcjRKp4Iu54Kgrh1RWGR61oxsQN8qxj0H3NjeMJLim8dWZwzVM48RQvh7Ua4p9LCojWrP4FKvQz2u1njI6BlNH9kdukJ6dI-nlOYw8ISEisucIUyPTSMDGSwhWr3Ixhkwdiw/s320/sasakoi04_poster.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Shout out to that other <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/51817/Watashi_no_Yuri_wa_Oshigoto_desu target=_blank>girls love Anime from last year</a> I didn't watch</table></div></div><div>P.S.

That isn't important up till now until you notice I was considering going to their Singapore live in July and not seeing the whole band... won't be bothering me anyways since I am only here for the girls specifically the vocalist. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Just joking, I might just not go. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha, <b><a href=https://x.com/oral_official/status/1785645202839089402 target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new live video</a></b> is a great recent classic you should take a listen this was released digitally and got me spot-on. <b><a href=https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1785985659989291412 target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new music video</a></b> will make you question what you have done to her to make her look like a love creep and please creep on to me for the rest of your life thanks in advance? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> There is apparently <b><a href=https://x.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1786002195391152569 target=_blank>an acoustic video between members of three different bands namely SHE'S, Omoinotake and ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION</a></b> (and that is the vocalist, the vocalist, and drummer respectively) but sadly is on a SHE'S song I didn't give so... welp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href=https://x.com/no_buses_band/status/1786317989014655410 target=_blank>No Buses is teasing the production of their next album</a></b> in the weirdest way possible, by asking fans to support vocalist solo music career <a href=https://x.com/cwondo_/status/1786306261551902910 target=_blank>Cwondo's new bandcamp album</a>(?) so that Kondo-san the vocalist can concentrate in making the next masterpiece. Haha nice try dude, but I'll take a listen to this at work, it isn't mainstream release anyways and there's as many songs as I have fingers and toes. I think I heard of <b><a href=https://x.com/sid_staff/status/1786334895171866831 target=_blank>Mao's new album new song preview</a></b> somewhere before, <b><a href=https://x.com/otohaofficial/status/1781276558612926729 target=_blank>Otoha's new single will release on end May</a></b> likely coinciding with SID's new single in many points ie. they will all be limited edition releases but <span class=emoji title=🤞>*fingers crossed*</span> they will be on music streaming services also, and <b><a href=https://x.com/3_phantasia/status/1786410092147167590 target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song</a></b> is uh... is a fusion of a lot of stuff, I will say that. Their single is weeks away so I will judge by then.</div><div><br></div><div>For next week, besides trying to give more Anime theme songs which I will continue to try for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifRNu3_lGBI" target=_blank>Anime "Bartender" opening theme</a> and <a href=https://x.com/bartender_anime/status/1786689839032860897 target=_blank>that new insert song</a> I heard this week, or else I will really move on to <b>ClariS new single</b> and <b>Sound Orion's new single</b> which both are from Anime theme songs but ACTUALLY have physical release and not digitally released at like, an hour before the first episode airs lol. I like to think only idol groups now have the budget to release physical now just because they can do events and stuff. I don't know man, I am really resisting the digital convenience bubble of a trend for some reason.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Reading back briefly as I update the posts back in 2017, I realized how short I write those Anime reviews, to be frank. Not enough screenshots lol I know, but heck, at least I wasn't yapping about every single part of the plot so you as a fellow viewer (yes, me) can still watch it yourself. Maybe I should go back to writing that way. General opinions about the episode, not how long I write them, the latter cannot be fixed I CAN WRITE WHATEVER I WANT haha shout out to Fanfictions series too. Hey, that's why I maintain a blog that isn't about my job profession, right? Blogging about programming must be BORING lmao even though I read those. Written by experts, mind you. I'm not one of them. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys next week then, I <em>really</em> need to rest my neck this tinnitus is not helping lol, and until next time... Hey, if I am <em>really</em> bored right now I know I can think of the new Fanfiction season. Don't think I will have that time considering I don't even have long lunch breaks now haha UGH I should start planning for other obligations too soon STOP WHINING ALREADY ME lmao <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Man, should I even pay to watch the (now over) Koko-chan radio show event from today? I got a week to watch the archive so I might catch up on them next weekend because I'm NOT going to have time to watch on weekdays- Heck, I may not even have my weekdays depending on how it goes lol so we shall see. Mikakoshi and Koga-chan as guests though...!! I'm already sold haha what is Koko-chan even</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
