<div>Man, I didn't actually plan for this to be written the next day of whatever music video I watched last night, but with whatever that I saw on it that is more than just creepy lol, maybe writing this story afterwards is better than whatever is imprinted at the back of my brain. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Yes, I am talking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPtfcPi70Gs" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new music video</a> which kind of makes sense at this point for the song title, but damn if you need to freak out about Mocho loving you some way... Uh, maybe this one I'm ending the season with will cheer you up! Haha my impression of her is this, not going to let whatever that got me last night scar me forever lmao</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Asakura Momo in a orange sweater hugging on to an off-colour orange thin pole smiling back with a train in the background" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=359 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl367801.jpg title="Asakura Momo" width=140></div></div><blockquote><div><i>I have a feeling my stepsister Shiina and her friends do not like me. She has been treating me coldly recently, Sora rejected me in high school and it's not like I recovered from that. And then there is Asakura Momo. Even travelling on a empty train with her, she chose to sit away from me even though there is a seat right beside me.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>As we walked out of the destination stop, Asakura-san noticed I was down and asked if I was alright. I talked about how I felt, and that my actions may have upset them including her, but she stated that she loves me for who I am. I doubted on how much she loved me only to see her stop at her footsteps. She then called my name and I turned back to see her hugging on to the pole at the station platform.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em><abbr title=これくらい好き！>"I love you this much!"</abbr></em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>The horn for the train to signal its departure got into my heart but not as much as Asakura-san smiling adorably in front of me. Even if I wasn't loved by all of them, at least I know it is so for this train buddy of mine.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I love you this much too, Momo. I'll prove to you how much I love you if I have you to hug instead of a pole because proving my point using that pole is CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>So yeah, with this story, I guess I have officially declared that our relationship is technically two-fold. The train buddy thing is rather obvious but not until I tell you because we live near each other compared to the others and that's why we travel quite often even if it's to meet the other two, and just like every woman in my fictional story... she has a crush on me. Very openly even, and she knows everything including how I have a super jealous girlfriend now (hehe ah hey), but in terms of affection, she is like none other. Especially towards fictional me, if you will, I don't know why. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>I will likely continue with the new season in 2 months to celebrate the 1st anniversary of this series, or if I need more time to plan for that I <em>might</em> have other ideas up my noggin' so <em>maybe</em> we will get to that first instead. But yeah, if I were to do season 4 it WILL be summer-themed, oh boy. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, remember that Moeshi's photobook will be released in the time I'll be working on this series? I know right, we CAN'T just do Moeshi every week for 2 months straight MUAHAHAHA ah hey</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
