<div>We're still moving on strong so far and not like my health condition is any indication, but hey, maybe this will heal me up...? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Sorry for saying that this is the story I'm most excited for the week after what we did with Ten-chan for last month (hehe) but yeah, it just got me more hyped the more I think about it. In fiction, yes, this is still not real life. This will also introduce us to a new character in the most stereotypical way possible and that's why I watch livestream duos and such, as your friend's friend. You will get what I mean in a moment. LET'S GO HIDE!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Ueda Reina in a white dress hiding behind white curtains putting her hands against the white window" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=359 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg720696.jpg title="Ueda Reina" width=140></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>After Takahashi Rie called me on her day off to tell me to pass her some documents at her place, I left the office early and walked to where she lived. Upon arrival, I was greeted by Takahashi-san in a t-shirt and shorts. She convinced me to stay for a cup of tea, so I stepped in.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>We sat down and had some chit-chat about work and how our colleagues were doing without Mediator Takahashi around. She then said she wanted to use the bathroom and closed the door. I looked around the single bedroom apartment in silence and noticed the closed curtains. I sneaked out of my seat and moved silently to the curtains, covering them behind me. That was when I looked around and saw to my left, a lady in a white dress blending in with the white curtains and white window frames. She was also slim enough to not stick out, I did not see any bulge from where I sat. I smiled at her and put a finger to my lips as she stared back at me.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>This must be the weirdest first encounter I have with a woman.</em></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>As you have noticed from the story, Ueshama's friendly relationship with me is purely coincidental (hehe), as she is also a friend to Rieri. Well, using the word "friend" might be too formal we know these two got the hanky-panky going on. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Yeah, one of them had to go for a toilet break too after she answered the door so damn what on Earth was happening between these two? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> Let's just say someone should've left before I dropped by already but didn't? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> No doubt I will get interested in her... I'll put forth her shyness in my fiction, and maybe shift my attention away from Rieri just like what I did with Ueshama when I knew of her though the other all those years ago. Yeah, what if I told you I can love your friend more than you can? Haha <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/187873/Himari_Kino target=_blank>Himari-chan from Anime "SasaKoi"</a> will know. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Maybe I should've written that Rieri knew of this hiding behind the curtain trick and tried to hug Ueshama but instead she got me MUAHAHAHAHA yeah and with room wear I can't describe in detail or else it'll get this site flagged?? I am so good at storytelling I can't even. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. If you haven't heard of Ueda Reina, I like to refer to her as "the other Kana-chan" but I think Kana-chan isn't as soft and as pure as her. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Listen to <a href=https://www.joqr.co.jp/qr/program/himi2/ target=_blank>her radio show every Thursday night</a>Â (in Japan time) and you'll get what I mean.</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
