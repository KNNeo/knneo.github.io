Yeah, both events so I will watch some in the morning before the noon event haha this is so unprecedented I can't even.</div><div><br></div><div>If you aren't keen on all of this, at least catch up on the bromide photo stack I just got recently with the new package, and tell me all that is not enough because I wish I could sync with one of the later ones which will also have way more. Well, at least you and I know what's coming up in next month's package it's MOESHI PHOTOBOOK LETS GO-</div><div><br></div><div>So yeah, let's Anime and music!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki07><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Mari-chan is my aunt" Damn, we are on the age where people I know are voice acting aunts now, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Yeah I have been spoiled so hey, Kayanon, fancy seeing you in Anime again. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But seriously I have been spoiled we just saw her on another Anime last week!! Blessed. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we have more new characters to show in this harem life of Tokumitsu Shintarou lol (#TenshiTsuki07), no this one is not it this one is just the aunt, and unlike <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/183520/Rentarou_Aijou target=_blank>Rentarou from Anime "Hyakkano"</a> we do NOT welcome older women into our harem haha GOTTEM lol I mean I don't really mind on my harem if I have one though so... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright jokes over we will slap more of them cute girls in our terrible manga instead says the author haha, let's talk about Shintarou's aunt. Mari-chan? Mari-chan here... she's very emotional. Maybe the most emotional I have seen her in Anime for <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/10765/Ai_Kayano target=_blank>Kayano Ai</a> to be frank, or maybe it's just that I have never watched an episode of Anime "KonoSuba". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also partly because she was just relieved of her duties as a manga author, and if you have not seen enough of them in Anime before, not everyone is going to look as cool a the one in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40716/Kakushigoto target=_blank>Anime "Kakushigoto"</a> where he can live off his most popular series till the day he retires and still be able to take care of his daughter at the same time lmao Anime joke, because this one like all else is just hyped up on caffeine, rushing for the edits before the deadline, and has to look more nerd than me so they have glasses. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Everything else is on the table though, so thank you Anime for getting us someone this thicc and she is still 28 lmao, putting Towa-chan into the equation so we can talk about romance antics as well as make her sad and single again lol we didn't mean to, and celebrate her birthday with a cake bought by herself that same evening. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Yeah, don't ever grow up, Shintarou. You can't do the stuff you do nowadays no more, getting into cute little girls and living the life of being alone without people breathing down your neck. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, too real or too Anime depending on who you ask, and boy, we had a few times where we almost revealed that Towa-chan isn't just a classmate who is dropping by his place for an internal meeting. What meeting were they having though? We will never know. No s*x here though, Mari-chan, don't worry about that. Just... can I have it with you though?? HAHAHAHA alright that wasn't very funny. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And we even got her editor an appearance because as much as life is fun to escape from one's troubles even investing in private property when you are famous lol and that's how this series came about haha thank you dear aunt for the balcony, we have to go back to reality afterwards just so we can live to see another day. F**king kids don't understand sh*t nowadays. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah also, understanding this harem is not necessary, most of us are just playing video games alone after all. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> All in all, shout out to Squeenix for making all of this possible haha (it's Square Enix, original and Anime series producer studio), I'm so happy I got another episode of Kayanon appearances in Anime even though I did not ask for it, and heck yeah Mari-chan better not come back, we have a harem to deal with. Speaking of which, and if the epilogue isn't obvious enough apart from whatever the heck of lore Lilishka was talking about lol she is a full on nerd alright, she is <strike>likely</strike> also a vampire. Yep, in case you wonder why Tsumugi was supposed to be the normal human in this harem... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, stay tuned I guess- You think her friend which will be the last of the characters introduced to Shintarou's harem is also not human? I hope not Tsumugi looks like she needs a human friend LMAO this series is just too dumb I can't even</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibAEkAnIgox1BLCoV4TiP2xs6pGifEnYMiAlauK0VYZTlsH7Aw2u40VmoEpDiD260xHDpURWdu65ICYVuAfWI9fIyBcLJZDgkUUe7W8AIqgBFC3WDvbw4WxqSWG-ZXgfgW3iktgWwO4HH1X1-Bblub17lsGDxaUVsWXMay8el_cF_P2-tkupyPxiYQlrM/s320/tenshitsuki07_cake2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me celebrating every birthday lol I AM OLD</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPJk8OYzmqpR7gjE_dA0Ore7yepOVGnmbF2bkzmEDWViGW7lrSsTAVZA4W7sKz0k9ncbUEIpPvlFi2Vr69bf80ZuNgisGAc1v3-3Ns3Xill9d6qbFRLDPMKdnINmUNxF-lNflW7wsvV8rv2O5rB2J8Ry_7LZ4PJMWqDM7gns9eNaDXn_NUy3GiBsPa1rc/s320/tenshitsuki07_sniff.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Sorry ladies, this b*tch got to him first haha</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I don't want to see you dancing with a girl I don't know" Then why not you be the one? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div></blockquote><div>Yeah I think a friendly reminder to Gerbera over here that, your son Bocchan(?) is still the same son you knew of all those years ago, just with a curse. I know right, drawing parallels with Sharon's daughter. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> In this new episode where we continue with the dance party heck yeah (#ShinigamiBocchan30), we conclude on the best time we have so far! No longer are we dealing with weird songs on that Christmas episode we had on the first season haha also that bath song lol wtf was that anyways, but we are rounding up a lot of stuff we have left untouched so far. And touched I am, so let's talk about it. Firstly, can we just talk about the Walter and Daleth thing? The production level on just doing this is just... Hey, you know that April Fool's Day joke that they made about making a movie featuring Walter and Daleth's love life directed by Viola-chan? That was not a joke I just want it now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, even I'm clapping in the middle of the episode and I swear the Japanese audience are clapping during the commercials at this halfway point. *applauds* Just fantastic, I want this to be a musical. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also man, just Walter being an absolute CHAD in this episode is so annoying I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, goose bumps, anyone? But seriously though, that was well orchestrated especially after Walter went to the roof to confront Daleth, and her asking for a kiss lmao kawaii haha ah, to just transitioning to this wild musical number I don't even know how it sounded this good just on them, but damn, you got me Anime, you got me good. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Then, there's the performance on the dance hall. I mean, I would still like to talk about Walter and Daleth dancing and the guy intentionally skipping 2s on his beats lmao, or even just the mother looking at them probably knowing that the one woman dancing with his son is the next evil witch on the planet lol, but hey, we don't have time for that. We should talk about Bocchan in his armour suit and Viola just playing the violin as her name suggests. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yeah, Viola-chan is basically me having stage fright as a kid and boy did I run away from that real good, because unlike her, I don't have someone to back me up and is close to me to give me courage, to start me off, so I have the strength to power the dance floor and making this a fantastic night to behold. Heck, all the above would not even happen if the music did not kick off. Not like they have a digital amp nearby ready or whatever that gramophone was behind the hallway was in British sitcom "Allo! Allo!" lol I promise this will be the most obscure reference I'll make, but yeah, thank goodness. Last but not least, I think looking at the mom's perspective on all this is really complimenting Sharon's appearance to remind her that all her kids have grown up, and perhaps someday, even as a noble, she had to accept all the things incoming, though she is still warning Bocchan about his choice of partner. I mean, the only way we can get happiness for all is to burn the house down?? Haha that's an <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji target=_blank>Anime "Kuroshitsuji"</a> reference but that one ended in revenge so maybe not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... well, didn't expect this series to make me weep. Twice. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Yep, you read that right, once for the talk with the mom, and on the carriage back home. You know what? I was actually reminded of Anime series which will take a turn for the worst even though we know that's going to come at some point. It's the emotions, I guess, regardless of context and I'm sure those <a href=https://jisho.org/search/isekai target=_blank>isekai</a> Anime also possess, that makes us remember what we are, how much we have stopped, and how we should move forward. So moving forward though we know that much at least, we are a week into going back to the past and getting Sade to... to what? That's what we don't know, and that is what is likely the drop. I mean, we can't bring Victor back to apologize lmao I mean I guess we can, we can't really change her mind about cursing people that's how much power she got back then, then what else can we do? I have no idea and I hope you don't too but if you read the source material just STFU haha, and we shall see where this goes. I'm still really surprised they have this much time to deliberate on stuff despite likely having to deal with a long fight with the final boss if all doesn't go well. </div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgNscBtrD4fch2eV-KJBm-llXC36-zu86DVs6fBQwUFkIv53E9EiiAvdkKGtD4Ul84TaiVlNN1v-3qhu3tiuZGizqLiFJd9kcPRDFI-vPwd7IvLsEzr0WhP5jwoWDal7svlEPWi0wA15HsCj77QwnLD56V9ZwdIABVNYsS141y4WcjSOM_qB5_D7oxNPQ/s320/shinigamibocchan30_daleth6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Someday I wish I could offer a hand or someone could offer their hand to save them</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBCutZJMAws9voBfJ3sHNBqpL4tWEKVSnKyuHT9OefTcXSZwwD7H16xm5ChGn_rb6Hmej3gOuhy_s8d1SN6kr1cWlJNRj3QcWVIRe1a5f2G3wRcGQ83nf0n0n0P9dgJN8H0ulkAJY0feMfhM7728fnvWhakIS83S0aj4yVBUk_Zza0uabyguIiX22ES_E/s320/shinigamibocchan30_eyes.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me with performance anxiety as a kid ngl</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbWZEEB9ezU7MoiIzMczBsA_213HMmuBX0YmRCSJCuJIvegRocZ18LdzUpyHgyonShSdz5K4114bsaRk4mdXonKmZJUa_R8-IWJr27cFXcfUYDiSYN19fEJoiHTjR7Tk3FmrdKn4bbiOh1tyWxW7_avUnLiOBzGNO1Y1xRbe8X1Z3O5pif9_ezkWSLpZo/s320/shinigamibocchan30_viola1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I imagine Minase Inori locking me up at her place looks like hehe ah hey</table></div></div><div>P.S.

"If you tried to con me and sell me pots of water or something, I'd buy the whole lot." She's talking about the streamer bathwater!! Even though if Walter sells his this will be a first or the males lmao</div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Bartender07><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Bartender: Kami no Glass</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>”In five star hotels, guests who stay in suites receive a welcome drink, champagne, fruits, and a flower bouquet" Okay what's the flower for though? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Wow, I'm just a peasant after all, I don't go to five star hotels, what of it? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where everything the hotel does is to refer to Sasakura Ryuu for advice instead of hiring him lol *taps brain* (#Bartender07), lucky for him because instead Chen is asking to work in Eden Hall? Bro, you should've seen the face on that guy who stood at the bar side with Sasakura previous episode. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But hey, we are dealing with a real bartender now, so why though? Oh, they fired him. *yikes* Well, not really surprising considering no one can learn from Mister Perfect, and I really mean NO ONE (lol) can be as perfect as him anyways, Kuzuhara already dunked on the next perfect bartender which is our main guy anyways. Alright, not dunking on that old man already, we have another old man to deal with. Welp, you know who he is, he's the very reason Chen is going back home (to Singapore haha yeah), he's the very reason he will not be accepted to do whatever he wants, and he will take over the business. He is none other than <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/1086/Sousuke_Aizen target=_blank>Aizen Sousuke</a>- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Thanks for <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach target=_blank>Anime "BLEACH"</a> joke, me) Then again, do we even know his name though? Yeah, it's Chen's dad. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Come on, let me make this joke at least once. He had to quit his job as a bartender likely not on his own accord, but because the dad did it. <em>Thanks, dad.</em> Anyways, the impending fate is falling upon him to go back home and in essence leave Japan, so he thinks that he should at least try to convince his dad with a drink just like how Sasakura has done with his customers so far. Well... in summary as I shall not go through this journey because as touching and as sad as it is the second time despite him failing the first time because he forgot who he was dealing with lol, it did not pan out the way he wants anyways. Then again in retrospect, if you are the dad, what would you do? I guess, maybe find a worthy successor somewhere else? Yeah, if it's a business, not like trusting family members will help all the time, just look at those family business all over the world that have fallen. Still, in spite of trying to make him remember all the bad stuff he has been panting on anyways, from the family trip to Japan where they lost Chen's brother and the dad's eldest son, to how Chen was even brought to Japan to learn of customer service for the sake of going back to help his dad's business out... Yeah, he has always been listening to his dad anyways, what else is new. If that trip to the refinery has really shook his mind, then I would argue he won't even make that mistake on the first time his dad landed on Eden Hall. So yeah, not giving too much high hopes on this guy though, just... wishing him luck, I mean, I'm the same way so Chen do what you can, not what you must, bro. Which then lies to what Sasakura was hinting to him at the end, whether to go his way or follow his dad's way. I mean, I'm not going to imagine like, the mafia coming after him if he doesn't, but hey, let's just say he still has a chance. He's still free after all. Just gotta decide what to do for yourself.

If so haha you have come to the right episode (#KuroshitsujiSchool06) lol because Ciel's dad just did something dumb. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And if you thought that was dumb, think again. In this recollection of a story that you think Ciel knows? Haha I doubt so, but hey, that's why we are taking a trip down memory lane where the Blue House won the school's cricket tournament. Just a quick one, we have an upcoming one to talk about. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So story goes that Victor Phantomhive was the Prefect of the Blue House all those years ago haha yeah, and he was quite a lazy guy, I would say. Not only did he instruct the Green House Prefect at the time to do his work for him lol deja vu Cole Maurice anyone? He also just is not suitable for the position as Prefect, not behaving as such and showing a lot less professionalism compared to the others. Well, compared to Midford at that time. Still, Victor suggested the upcoming (at that time) cricket tournament as a way to appease him with the loser listening to an order from the other, and guess what, Blue House won. Ironically Victor's order is to literally tell Midford to excuse himself as Green House Prefect and be his drudge? I mean, you can keep your position you're already his German Shephard all this time we just wanted to formalize it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Jokes aside haha this flashback is itself a joke, let's talk about what the strategy of Blue House is under Ciel's suggestion. Well, for starters, they have to play two matches out of the 4 houses, in this case Red House and Green House respectively because the latter has already been determined as long as Greenhill is on the helm. Sorry, Cheslock, considering Elizabeth's brother can copy your technique just by looking, I don't think Purple House stood a chance. Yeah, also Violet doesn't give a- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, about Red House. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> It's rather unfortunate that they aren't in a suitable condition to continue the batting considering that they are probably having elephants running out of their rears lol, still am able to make it look beautiful on the field like Harcourt did haha, which is rather respectable in my opinion. I wouldn't call it porno but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> MOVING ON lol we then found out that Ciel played it dirty, literally, by swapping out their pie with laxatives, which I would assume they did not tell the Blue House people, so yeah, *taps brain* intelligence is finding loopholes without breaking the games' rules, yes? We can let them rest it was a great sight to see anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Back to the finals though, and looks like the Blue House people have been training. Not for techniques in cricket or whatever they are just physically weak lol SAME, but in... eh, not really cheating, just being strategic is what Ciel and Sebastian would have wanted. They set up an orchestra undermining the Green House's taste for music, and then made sure the players swung their bats according to the beats. Rather clever I would say, but yeah, Elizabeth's brother got them good unlike Greenhill. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What are their next strategies though? Your guess is as good as mine. I just don't think getting to the headmaster who just appeared on the field is that simple, but let's find out together, yes? But heck, that was quite a tournament, don't' you think? Oh, my bet is on Blue House's win, of course. I already know. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Anyways, this will be interesting to see since intrusion of anything on the field might be hard anyways considering we aren't like, considering to snipe the headmaster or anything lol it's also the first time we saw him so, uh... maybe bad idea to just run to him? But who knows, again I forgot the source material so let's get to it next week. </div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4CpfijQM3B9Z2pRivzHhc_Dv5sWkofF2YgeLk8E21ebyfB0TdCRa88x-iDUFjaApNL7zw5rkCvQ7drfEq-O-sVPWbuZccjyfuB91ZGIeEqHRFltpLyflwb8BB5XlQe23QjOblKNF6ObbPeYB6LMARQmByuSN-mUTC9jM5WwrJP6-0Dbn-kj1KZvQS16k/s320/kuroshitsujischool06_blue2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I expect to see next episode but with Ciel on top</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUtxiO6QnjgETIDUgMJvmCfxH1UI5BjquCHSW_wf84xgBqh6ean4U4x7ZK3orP-NIAmEFHzTorJlAyTdGW9C_WkKvre1icjDVHP57sWDDejsAmRrO1OOyOI0HAuSQC_OXG5pHUQCWYAja26aOWhMSrHhl0_Q4_ZYlwrAy_iLjjEzvaFNz7zBOB7llhxcM/s320/kuroshitsujischool06_ache.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me dealing with diarrhoea the past few weeks because lactose intolerance be like</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXhwVMz1AXx1KsgHszNTJO8xb4ostqpiyTAep5zKokBmktP3wDDuLgM1kxsuAumKv2YpRkiQ7BNfjfIuGIgPgLZrHWJHFJF-3akkMZmhxKuf9PZFb3A635jwzVLm-7IrpiEWLlDnQshN2sIhisyVz2Wb_9ybPWaHJyHd2mNkNmpcp7zcKrM1VSGc0LeoQ/s320/kuroshitsujischool06_harcourt4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>*Not a porno, by the way</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha ah hey</div></blockquote><div>Oh yeah, some jealous friend Aki-chan told them to go on a date to find accessories. Don't think they are doing that though MUAHAHAHA in the new episode where we thought we won't get another date episode after the actual reply of the confession from Himari-chan (#SasaKoi06), I would like to thank the author and Anime production on behalf of myself, thank you. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Of course I meant that as a joke, because seriously you think this will be an issue, huh? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, let's talk about the date. This Yori-senpai... she is born into the wrong gender. Heck, I should be her instead. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, overall it was great. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not much, you can just watch the last time they went on a date for reference lol, but it's a lot more Himari-chan being cute (and 1x Yori-senpai showing them legs so nice I approve) when choosing them outfits so I think I'm happy too. <span class=emoji title=😊>*smiles*</span> Other than that though, maybe we should put our focus on two things this episode. Firstly, the live. Yes, I legit thought it was a school live but forgot they can just go to those <a href=https://jisho.org/search/raibuhausu target=_blank>live houses</a> to do that too, and yeah, Himari-chan and Miki-chan were invited. And as we recall on the point where Yori-senpai promised to Himari to impress her with her singing to show her what her love on her is about in order for her to give a proper reply, definitely practiced a lot and especially spent a lot of effort on the lyrics, I had to read through the whole sequence twice lol because subtitles by the way, to get a clearer idea of what she was trying to convey. Not much to be, but it's a lot to her. I mean, those feelings that Himari have as of now even just after watching the performance don't have to be what love is. This just has to last another 6 episodes or so anyways haha ah hey. This just has to last long enough for their relationship to last, these sweet few months before graduation, and then they find out how rough it is to get into long-distance relationships or Himari will be caught by a dude who loves her more, and then all of this will be over. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> We don't really know, so I will take the new status quo. Also, just seeing Aki-chan be sad to only stay as the No.1 friend instead of the last lover, huh. Welp, love sucks so what else is new. And then, there's the auditions. Not like it's a problem for SSGIRLS to join in auditions in order to join the overwhelming response on band performances on the upcoming school festival, but the stinger only comes by when we have betrayed vocalist Shiho in the same room as them. Awkward, for starters, and this is where we start fanning the flames. Since this is the first time Yori-senpai gets to know the fact that not only is she just a replacement, is that she isn't that great. Well, I think she's fine, and I think a generic audience will be accepting with SSGIRLS even without the singer on the credits LMAO fourth wall joke... but Shiho won't be. B*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... as I said to myself before, we may not need a kiss here lol we just did that already, but we need some bitch slaps. Yeah, multiple at some point, at this rate. Someone needs to wake up, whether it's the SSGIRLS or someone else, hopefully the latter. But hey, if that level of drama is getting more intense by the episode, I'm in. If you want to remind me that every other song isn't sung by the voice actress themselves... I think I should've stopped myself long before I started. I didn't, so I will stay around. What will be of the SSGIRLS though? Hmm I wonder, I doubt it's going to be smooth sailing, they aren't the next "Houkago Tea Time" lol that's an <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On target=_blank>Anime "K-ON!"</a> reference, but we have the power of love on our side, don't you think? Seriousness is boring, dude. Go get creativity wrecked by a major music label while earning millions of yen or something. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> More serious girls drama stuff, sweat and tears are incoming I would assume, so I hope you are ready. It's going to be a bumpy ride. Yeah, the animation too haha I don't know why the quality is dropping but</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGLOiIynh0xipFtUpf4OLkBIC2H-QrzLc-7bhyZDa1tesj0OAu12HdCN1y-EtvjiVMLMRijGxdd-sw0p0Hdd3hUQ_CF2Ag1WcgUbmSWi6KSa0XLwVw9XYWaY3ffIYeUktvHkKUsJxu4J5mTO4xVyOLN4bx53ilcf5JQUfH4hRNnuhtS9-2wph5Z_0i2O4/s320/sasakoi06_himari1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I know you and I can see that this outfit will look GREAT on Himari-chan...</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-voZvIHPWgcRUhTXo7kyAvlLFQ2kbVQLzUGHJrUt6Qm3YeRt4Eeg0lBGY6guwrL5p7_Gr9NIrI8xToQaE0pEMNrLx1LhDkq1rqozs7PFqgM5yrbACMSH74FhT384FcsZfCksokhqTjrOn6oXlJIv3BFw0NUnnekUmTI6hh_b_EPaE52wCeNN99veciok/s320/sasakoi06_outfits1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>... but we have this.<br>Good enough. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhW97s5zLO8yfcZOtKMTGCrN1zSin0CZBQEca1BQlzUd8bcQJBhJcnNNUCMb6oTEl_wOyJacWv2Ar_8SkTeQGHZ_Mjtq6jVMaQmi4bZnFkKYyZJDP1LlwbE4eOWYU_ZWna8cVyf3GmYFJ7o59RE07XYe4W8Kd7grdR3-eLDq-klU7b0h5BT3P24gJ_iolM/s320/sasakoi06_yahoo.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>We already know it sucks do we have to shit on it, dude??<br>(Haha get it?)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Okay reality drop, I did miss an hour of the evening event so heck, I've just watched it back so we are good! Haha as expected I did finish watching Anime beforehand but TOTALLY THOUGHT that it starts an hour later which was NOT respect to my local time. Well, gotta learn from my lesson by watching more live events from Japan! Hehe, this will be the year, I'll try.</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. If you want to know if I know any songs from the Rikachimalu singing event(s), I must say I have regretted missing that hour in the second event because I already know <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%89%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97/916163967?i=916163980&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>frederic's most popular song</a> (but never gave it lol) and <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%98%8E%E6%97%A5%E3%81%B8%E3%81%AE%E6%89%8B%E7%B4%99/896503363?i=896503389&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>Teshima Aoi's "Asu e no Tegami"</a> just in that hour alone. Yeah somehow kids don't know Teshima Aoi. How young are you?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Gotta look at Koko-chan's music recommendations more, dude. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
