And that's the problem. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The DOAXVV half anniversary gacha rolls are making it up for it though haha Monica-chan~!!!! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Oh well, we are not getting the breaks today also because it takes a lot of effort to do this and I don't know how to streamline this despite the anniversary of the blog coming soon and Blogger is breaking by the way it can't even do links properly now... So let's not think too much and talk more of Anime and music!!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki08><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"The ultimate being! The peak of all creation!" In Anime, that is always just an Anime girl LMAO</div></blockquote><div>No, not angels. Angels are nothing compared to these guys. We call them cosplayers. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>  In this new episode where the vampires are a thing apparently I'm not too sure either (#TenshiTsuki08), okay Tsumugi I think we are good we have fellow female humans on this planet, thank goodness. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, maybe we gotta properly define right now what on Earth is Lilishka or Kagami-san as people call her at school. She's a vampire. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, she is still one and looks like Shintarou's trend of getting such beings to him is not fading away, but unlike what we initially thought about her identity being faked by colour contacts and an eyepatch, it's just very possible that she doesn't want to be the vampire she is. Yes, we call these chuunibyou, and if the subtitles didn't do the translation well, it's more like some kid who thinks the world is whatever fantasy they live in. Faking an injured eye is just one of those traits. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, it's still a fantasy which way you think about it lol and I'm rather tired about that, so don't be too surprised if all I do is write vampire jokes from here on. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Still, from Lilishka's weird behaviour, she really feels as anti-social as Noel-chan in certain ways but I would argue this is inherently her own fault since it's a lot easier to conceal her vampire identity while still being social and not suck the blood of others as she has been doing so far. The licking of napes though... You don't want to know what happened to them with Towa-chan in the same room that night. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, no one questioned how the angel and the main guy are sleeping together in bliss in face of another unknown entity? If not for the evil mind of Tsumugi I wouldn't even think otherwise. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No like, really, does it even matter anymore? I wasn't even a bit surprised at.. well, everything this episode, but maybe we should've paid some attention to Shintarou being aloof to this vampire girl, that's for sure. Because I... I don't know how to describe this relationship. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You see, so far we have benefactor angel, classmate crush or whatever lol, friendly snow woman, then...? Yeah, you notice that? I mean, we were quite close to adding to the list as "vampire master" but uh... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well thank goodness we didn't, but yeah, Lilishka isn't exactly offering up anything so that she can do... whatever she likes to Shintarou, if that doesn't sound wrong enough. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... this is just another episode of <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/33988/Demi-chan_wa_Kataritai target=_blank>Anime "Demi-chan"</a>, isn't it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But this guy isn't even RIPPED!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No no, you guys don't get it. Shintarou is just overall being HOT. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No think about it, attracting the opposite so snow woman, so hot he emits a smell hard to resist... it's all in his nature to be the main guy. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> So yeah, weirder things can happen in this story, so I can't wait for our final character to appear soon, I legit thought we will see her this episode since we were at the club room as shown in the opening animation. Also, I wish all girls were vampires. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, I wish all girls were vampires who like my scent. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No, we can't do that? There isn't enough <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/144273/Hikari_Takanashi target=_blank>Takanashi Hikari</a> to go around? Dammit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Seeing from next episode's title though, I'm pretty sure this can get more awkward, so I can't wait for an orgy to happen at Shintarou's place- Not a porno, by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdFDhn756C4bFqznVKPTtyY6a28UYKMzCkgZntBf85Y3FX0tN6XGndcQWeLhTk0o4lg5ZgOrJnBqd7529hT25PC5GdI88cvtRyIqSiz7dquUOtvYY46-U8rU5roAS7i_HK-1x-lKCtkeJIoipIJT3KjHMf099lkktayUR2Lejz0QIVVUyFJbVDJogu8ow/s320/tenshitsuki08_vampire1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I was here for<br>(Gotta say, she is uber cute hehe)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUtkLXMc1OVLyGhptPMIKFXbKeFTfXTX3w0YkLZEuu3Glvc1cK6Luy2ppgTS2DFhw6DQWzytoPu-eMyPDvnTs_fp1Wact1_Ju3BVRL3yUrCGR-RyW3JUZWRuUz6kn7A2UStY87zscUxBrlxnX-A99pg0CZS7LE8vKh9UHDXB4CMQAhbt4mtiBpe0dMyPY/s320/tenshitsuki08_lick.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I got haha<br>(WOAH WOAH lol)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

In this new episode where we pick up the pieces (#ShinigamiBocchan31), there isn't much left to pick up just more honest talk, so let's cover them all. For starters, the preparations for the confrontation of Sade. Zain has been in training, and interestingly he need not join the guys to go back to the past just in case Sade decides to make use of Zain to time travel that'll be a new level of yikes, but still, not like Zain has no reason to be there and we will need a lot of help if all goes down badly, so the more the better. I like how Cuff talks about Viola-chan though supposedly having nothing to show for fight, and Nico-sensei looks like he has a task for her specifically too, so that'll be interesting to see. Worst thing is probably we don't know how many of them will be back life, even if any. And I'm not going to talk about the time-space effect this will have on current time, so MOVING ON!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> There's the talk about love. Surprisingly, Viola-chan still doesn't know who Alice is in love with, even though they just spend all day playing with each other in a field of pillows. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I'm glad she took the time to tell Viola though much to her surprise too, but it's no wonder why Alice has never wanted to, if you would recall previous episode where the mother warns of Bocchan marrying someone of lower social status... Zain, can you just teleport us to the future instead afterwards so they can get married where social status doesn't matter in marriage? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, might as well make full use of his powers, we won't be coming back though if that's the case. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Last but not least, we sort of know the general plan is so far. No bloodshed at first is the plan, but apart from what roles they will take and the idea of confronting Sade after knowing of her past with the grandfather... we don't know what is the plan of action. The actual action, I mean. Like, do we want to just tell Sade to undo their curses and we're done? CAN we just let her do that and we're done? I don't know if that's how it works, and even then Daleth still has incentive to side by her sister since she is still a liability till the end, so I really am not too sure what is the plan for the gang as they meet up a week later at Bocchan's place. All in all... damn, am I also worried of what will happen next. I know right, what is Inoue-sensei planning?? Now I'm also worried about the plot going forward. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> They are also not doing any plot twist to end this episode, so I'm really wondering now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Can I just watch the next episode tomorrow to find out? Haha I hate how I'm a week behind. Either way I'll stick to the schedule, I would say this is quite a peaceful episode once again. Not that it's a bad thing, but there is still much to deliberate, so I won't blame of them to convey that as much as possible. It's all out from here on, so let's see if talking to Sade will work first, I guess. I highly doubt so, but considering the circumstances that we <em>technically</em> can't kill Sade again? It might just work. See you then.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi51lZwfwg4IHxs1JKSVRKhEwyfF-VKwtd52tvT4_vESB6b_V1vaOU7shWSdv62366ZLSMDbNUOWmNNA48YR3xPIdxjStj2z7GcX0AUIgTZWjccGBwOpqDns-9IFlD0OOyS11ugU6jtJ8_T-9J58cIC9XUfR31dxwChiVQlAxYQYPayqUyax6pYDRq8Vu0/s320/shinigamibocchan31_couple1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>#NotMyIchiSensei<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh02YO2iyfTJSImFGO5VOP6fmQogFezShLcXrraMniap8R9FPRi5t0v0CXHAfyBVL9gBfN85r6EDiXINOCIt8vnpyfdA22FgXO_YcqwWbPO37dmzPLoKSpxk-Ly9fkSQIrtanI_9i7PSYIxlSf2f1ZUeUrWLa2M2gwCAWmtIWtoSFq3o5f9ZhrYehUcg9U/s320/shinigamibocchan31_cuff2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>#NotMyViolaChan<br>(Haha no really, you can NOT replace Viola-chan)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Boy, being a bartender is ROUGH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, let's talk about it, the cocktail awards. I feel like everyone inside the competition has something to talk about in their story, so let's talk about them. Firstly, Chen is in this. WHAT?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, it shouldn't be a surprise so far, we did see what decision he has made after what was with his dad and them giving him the middle finger to go back to take over the family business, so Chen is still trying to impress his dad differently. Not that it works on his end, I mean, he did screw up on the finals as we have seen him be the most confident among the others, but at least he still gets to be a bartender for now? I mean, if you work at your dad's hotel I'm pretty sure that's called an internship, just ask all the other Asian dramas. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, all's as well as it can be for Chen then, so let's move on to the winner, shall we? Haha spoiler alert but not surprisingly, only Yuri-san here is the only Okinawan but also the only one deserving of the win, old man Tanaka has taught her well, because not only did she show composure at her display of skills in front of the judges I would argue among them Kuzuhara was the only one who thought she sucked lmao gottem, she also made a refreshing drink to impress. Well, not that I know if it tastes great I haven't drank cocktail in my life lol, but hey, her bar's business is improving so I would hope that it has been well received so far. Last but not least, and that's why Sasakura made the decision to not let the Chairman decide on the other two mentioned above, we have Kawakami. Don't worry, her anxieties still ring well within me, and boy did I ever want to skip the finals with her on it so bad but I refrains to not much avail I did eventually hit it a couple of times anyways lmao I'm such a loser, she still did better than me anyways, knowing that her sensei Minami-san is behind her even if she isn't her best discipline. I mean, a dad is a dad, right, no matter how far you go? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And yes, I think the latter's origin story was the one which touched me the most. To be recognized, people, is such a hard thing, you ask Chen how far he has done just to do what he likes. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, it's quite a drag to just show off a cocktail award ceremony lmao, but hey, I know what I'm in for, and so far their stories have developed smoothly, so look who's left to be needed of convincing to move on from their bar and work for the Chairman's hotel MUAHAHAHA not yet apparently says the Chairman, because somehow, just somehow hinting us for weeks already since Episode 1, Sasakura here has some things left unattended. Maybe we will find out about that soon enough.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1yKoT1UBn-kJOgSPfrVfsIJOJAEvKz2qo4P5F8chEENVBxxlqveVJmIK_okl_FA2AA_aCSOQwJqVg8xW-vFUVSY2H6wIt2Cco6zSjs8NYoXTobA2exO1JeBwYzYLNtk79xjTJIE1ddsi_2wWETYTNVlseAajwK-2NSCvpy4xoWzx-uLrjupBXAUbscoI/s320/kaminoglass08_bartenders.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I only like one of them, and it's...</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8LxEMr6fs_DOzpNhwsYlQWfnF_aotTgwIu2X2KaJ3Hi4w2EOQ-Jujj2qmb3eHsBaqCLW7uYc_SKGaKsBHHMHdSSjc58t_Fn-8IQrtL_dNErO50T2xQltFq0wB9scQg9dGTXe1aVU19VwPTHfoB865d0KRn6a9FEFsaa8dMBPXdkuR4m38bgt9GNudnv8/s320/kaminoglass08_kawakami3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yaaa <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kawaii target=_blank>kawaiiiiiii</a><br>(I know Chen is hot but Kawakami is my type, dude?)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I'm pretty sure they can't be cheating all the time even though they technically are, so let's get those off the list first. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, bringing Lau and just female legs into battle is rather dirty, but I mean we are at a college where we are surrounded by the finest gentlemen, so SURELY just showing the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/namaashi target=_blank>bare legs</a> won't get them high- Greenhill where are you hitting the ball, dude? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also Maurice Cole you sh*tting-ass man-girl why are you even here and why haven't we expelled you yet? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So welp fun's over, but we got more. But as you can see the match progress to nearly a tie, the Blueys (lmao) did try different tactics as much as their IQ can take them, from playing defence to playing strategically at every time they can throw at the brainless (oops) Green House, it worked to some extent or else all of this would be over by now. Okay, ignore where Ciel failed to throw the ball twice in a row, that one was cheating. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Shout out to Greenhill defending the opponent all the way while also relentlessly playing their game though, this guy is the only chad around here so screw you Edward. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In Blue House's defence and also Greenhill's, they are still trying their best despite losing odds, and isn't that what sportsmanship is about? I mean, look at Violet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, not that there isn't unfair play in action, as we have seen time and again where surprises drop by from time to time, with weird shots and 200 IQ plays, it's always a surprise at every turn, which is what I think Green House isn't ready for to take on, thinking that they are done with their plans. Contingency planning, dude. Surely Bluewer knew of that having this many sisters- ANYWAYS haha where the f**k is the headmaster though? Haha I think apart from how the match played out, it's also still SO BIZARRE that despite Sebastian just chasing the presence of the headmaster around on the field, well not with his demon powers of course, still could not catch up with the dude, and even when he cheats (lol ah hey) all Sebastian caught was a decoy? Hmm... I don't remember what was the conclusion here but if you know of the series so far, this can *only* be the doings of the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a>, if I were to guess. <span class=emoji title=🤫>*sshh*</span> All in all though ignoring the phantom chase of a headmaster haha, what a great conclusion to the cricket tournament! I definitely did not recall this being so good as I read the source material so many years ago, but damn, I'm so glad they made it good. That's all it matters. I need more confidence that the adaptation of the series will go on, and I think this worked better than the follow-up vaccine I took a couple of days ago. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Seriously though haha, we know Ciel is faking everything just like how the headmaster is lmao got two of them with one ball by the way, but hey Blue House won spoiler alert if you read this far haha, the headmaster can't avoid us now, so let's see what he has to say about his phantom Schrödinger-like existence at the cricket match. Love the epic piano opening theme song during the match though, that is like, making me to hyped for the single release next week, I tell ya.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjrYkLAwLm7vrgu4ivXiEdpg6tFELC920mog03LKjbJUwarxPvpy_IhAm_dKwh1l4HVARdvumYAsSSdHVIa9sTeAPR_A_9gZeqEeQDTyXfCXFOwW6M_sFKYTsi360i6l4MrHuyDU9gDCjN-TwOWx-msIfg3wZ8JzfFacyhfBp7am_68sl_q_bviuQPevg/s320/kuroshitsujischool07_blue2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How you know this episode is awesome:<br>Hey Victor Phantomhive with the win I have been expecting you lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0n-bGYGhAIJmWGveSsTUTGtXTzRayq4U8mqNSpGt7T60CBrYFKC3fOEPx4spdRuGXfMbz2_0qhlECJEKPtQlDHt1PAUGlQnPR4jfA8JbGs28aheYNx3-6C6ZnDBbKLge1PIMIhiaGEDnHe7r9bUznUP-qD1BSVAGrNH7PPbuMqpR5Jg8dfpUq5plMYks/s320/kuroshitsujischool07_lady.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How you know this episode is awesome:<br>HELL YEAH haha NEVER have they drawn Ranmao this <a href=https://jisho.org/search/eroi target=_blank>eroi</a> tbh</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Like, I wouldn't watch another cricket match over this. <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span></div><div>[Since the cricket poses were so well drawn I'll showcase some of them here hehe you're welcome animation team I knew these will be good I just didn't know how good they will be]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPRJ7AncNacE2LQAtx2L6dFmq3dmByUtTmBPWvVXHqTVa53qy-YEb8q0kYrQD2nEuTyycYInr6U5m4CrvDLUqnv2P93vCsn5ePu4U3DFBSrExMfmsXl5yFYAWtOt3isKQEV0PxtUlwGbS87Tq0VCqiG382JatpnxvSvbYvM40Zx_ERfpXIJafKrqmmjpw/s320/kuroshitsujischool07_owl.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Trust me when I say Bluewer has NEVER looked this cool haha nice</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUiCLArapQ9aCWNRsSzrQ9-mVCCc5_anFj7woh7X3fkXPxYb2r3-Q2Y-z6OXB-bdQigHG2KcdMgls0hFsMfRt9Pdofg4ym9JF50DIiDX89DE8yrg0OmNuOe8Pkzi1iHPdSpzWbjQdT7n5vg-1av1NGX_awaHIfjNMTzNGGjc16PTrgbkM8gGT05WqflNQ/s320/kuroshitsujischool07_excalibur.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Really makes you wonder what they made the cricket bat out of lol</table></div></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=SasaKoi07><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Sasayaku You ni Koi wo Utau</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Shiho...

SAME</div></blockquote><div>No I don't want Mikakoshi to be my best friend only, it's too much sadness to bear. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or is it better if I said Aki-chan instead? Haha ah hey if this new episode wont' get us into a corner (#SasaKoi07), I'm pretty sure Shiho of the rival band also going for the auditions to sing at the school festival is. What a f**king b*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also trust me, I had to take tranquilizers before I watch this Anime ever since the confession went through. Still a heterosexual male, I tell ya. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But hey, what is not to like? Yori-senpai with the shame or Himari-chan with the cuteness? Yes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But seriously though, I don't think this will change much at this point as you can see it has become passing comments for everyone in the show from the SSGIRLS to Himari's bestie Miki-chan to even the girls in the Cooking Club (Wait, so Anzai Chika is flirting with Ueda Reina?? I'm taking notes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, this is so much of a joke of a lore for their voice behinds I can't even), they are just envious of the couple that has gone through so much just so we can ruin it down the road. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> How so though? I suppose that's what this episode is going to lead to us. But first, maybe some flashback with Aki-chan. As mentioned by her, Shiho wasn't a great band member to work with because for starters, she takes this band thing very seriously. Like, if I dunk on her she will kill me in the back alley seriously. *yikes* Haha but what seems like harmless insults even when Shiho joined SSGIRLS back then turned out to be the first b*tch slap we have seen so far in the series let's go Mizuguchi Aki thanks for setting the record lol, and I would argue it's not much justified as everyone in the band has their flaws, but hey, they had to make up for the lovey-dovey drama here so someone had to be the bad girl. Turns out, the problem is always with Shiho. Yori is right; If it's Shiho's problem she left the band, that's her problem. Not like she had a good reputation of being in a band anyways HAHA GOTTEM AGAIN. I mean, proving the point again was unnecessary, but I'm sure the consensus here is that SSGIRLS was okay, and the rival band Lo-Lorelei (yeah I had to check the name) was basically metal band DEATH DEVIL from the Anime "K-ON!" series which was lead by the club advisor to that Light Music Club. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright references over, but that just means it's cool. It's no love at first sight thing Himari won't suddenly fall in love with Shiho here. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... ask me about my gender preferences by the end of the season. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't think it will change, but between all the dating and rivalry, I'm very sure at the least, that the latter will be enough to offset what this genre of Anime was supposed to be. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, look at that b*tch Shiho. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> It's like she wants satisfaction for revenge or whatever. Which is why I'll look forward to the drama moving forward, as I kind of want to see Shiho be told that trying hard is her pitfall at some point, I really do. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know, I'm also evil, but you know, it is growing times and they are still in high school, so maybe lessons need to be learnt. I'm pretty sure also the band she is in now the members are also barely trying to get her personality and all. Like, even we have reached that stage where Aki-chan might just fall because what, Shiho knows to pick a stone between her and Yori's relationship so far... I'm pretty sure Shiho has some screw loose, no offense. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Like, right? I mean, we have dealt with evil roles here and there though I have been enjoying on the soft side of drama, but heck, I know what I'm in for, and maybe just like Shiho, I might start to bail once I realize what I might be in for. Jokes on me though, for this is already too late to do so, huh. So let me THROW away all the music references (haha I mean it though because only melodies hit me and these are <span class=emoji title=🤮>*pukes*</span>) because singing is not a thing for the voice actress here the one song from the rival band in the episode was also sung by an actual singer, and maybe we talk more about this drama and expression exacerbated by its music style differences next time.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3zQpNlgC_J45dMTqJ-qUCWJJ5vPuKyvhwW_yM2UHyRWncNiJ4VtGc8Zc57Yi7hhnU0dhEsnHrgWPKvxTC1lIFXtdlWDl1Pw51NnRuY8QSmKfHE7rbWAMcPj3_Ssh4VyJVJuyKgcEahbHf4ZICMuR7ir26v36iVH7ESbIHso_PuPoGMwWcZbm92O2BNNs/s320/sasakoi07_aki6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>THEN<br>(Holy sh*t your sis with black hair- Miki-chan I might just r*pe her by accident)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRRPIXse1MFok0CE4Juxp2lad_KRERHUNOZRzEAt_pgkePNBLSTgEVN-qCxyEdRY_3JXMtN8V86GCOUfmYQszwTnth9bgcssyLUfREoL2xxDBx6Co_PGep3kusOyzHBDiIXWgBInQVWJ5DFWFkGdxSN648-qiJAqizPCLQXcihGjGDdKLBgu0w6chkUjY/s320/sasakoi07_ssgirls1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>NOW<br>(Just being a bossy pants like the rest lmao)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Of course I know<b> <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%CF%86/1740710806?l=en-US" target=_blank>mol-74's new album</a></b> is harder to give given their niche pop style which can sound smooth or nonchalant if you listen it through and that's fine in my opinion... until I have to give them songs. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But my problem isn't with any of them because have you heard of <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/moon-shaped-single/1742920598?l=en-US" target=_blank>Homecomings' new song</a></b> released on Friday?? That was great though!! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, even then I have my reasons for holding back, but yeah, I think I am still stuck in the emo phase just like a year ago when I was giving Homecomings songs despite all the new songs this week. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I need to find more Homecomings releases I haven't listened to yet haha gg my music tastes</div><div><br></div><div>I know we don't like to talk about music news because you rather just scroll through your YouTube feed to see if the most popular song will hit you, but hear me out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> If you have not hard of Ikimonogakari's tribute album then maybe <b><a href=https://x.com/mizunoyoshiki/status/1794382529606393948 target=_blank>Kamishiraishi Mone's cover of Ikimonogakari's 2008 classic</a></b> should give you an idea for who she is if you have not heard of her in Anime yet. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> (Yes, she sang for Anime "Bartender" ending theme song this season FYI) <b><a href=https://x.com/lucklife_info/status/1793205660768948234 target=_blank>LUCK LIFE's new song will release next week</a></b> and you can listen to the preview a bit for the chorus and it isn't bad but that doesn't say much about their songs so I will listen to them in full when it's out. <b><a href=https://x.com/chillibeans_mc/status/1793615255068921981 target=_blank>Chilli Beans live digest from their Budokan performance last year</a></b> is such feels I feel like I should go listen to more of their songs even though I cleared their 1st album early this year. <b><a href=https://x.com/rythem_official/status/1793976601698504772 target=_blank>RYTHEM's new live video</a></b> is a classic that will get you more than me sadly to say, SPECIAL OTHERS ACOUTSIC's new monthly tune is alright but as I said this weakens the overall theme of the album without just a handful of title song since they are making every song a title song now, <b><a href=https://x.com/kaori_staff_/status/1794291062309302506 target=_blank>Ishihara Kaori's new music video</a></b> just released and it's for an Anime theme song out last season lol why so late they could've done this 4 months ago to impress, and <b><a href=https://x.com/scandal_band/status/1794394065691390099 target=_blank>SCANAL's new live video</a></b> is still their best song for the album earlier this year. <b><a href=https://x.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1792872975751917919 target=_blank>Aimer's new music video</a></b> is a song we know of so yes this is just a self cover, so don't ask me if I will care about her new EP releasing next month. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Jokes aside, I appreciate the amount of content online these days, so I will not complain on their activities this is still way more than... whoever artist I forgot and is not releasing songs for years already lol AND I AM STILL FOLLOWING THEM?? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Okay so next week's plan and damn I wish this was also a public holiday like last week lmao, but never mind that, we have some priorities to go through. As such, after I clear the Anime "Kuroshitsuji" singles which are <b>Otoha's new single</b> and <b>SID's new single</b> respectively (yes blame me, I wanted to review on physical release date) I will move on to <b>miwa's new album</b> first because Sangatsu no Phantasia's new single(?) is so confusing right now it might not even be a single I still don't know how scarce is that data online that this isn't even an EP I have no idea. If I can't get that by then, I will then tune into <b>SID vocalist Mao's new album</b> because why not, I can like more of SID-like songs. That retro feels dude, I know I have to more on in 2024 but it's hard when you have like, 17 years worth of Japanese songs in your brain.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Oh yeah, sorry for b*tching about my sad life on the intro and I TOTALLY FORGOT to wish Isobe Karin a very happy birthday today!!
