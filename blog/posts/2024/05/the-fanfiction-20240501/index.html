<div></div><div>Well, we're halfway through the week already, how are you guys doing? It's great for me because I AM FREE UNTIL NEXT WEEK!!! Living the true holiday spirit this year once again- That tinnitus on my left ear though... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>This time around, I'm featuring someone we know all too well about but I've hardly written about her, so let's do this story the same impression I have of her now! Then again I wonder if I'm that nice to help people out...</div><div><br></div><div>Fictional me, right? Then I guess I am haha <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Uesaka Sumire dressed in a white top with a dark blue jacket and yellow skirt, pouting and carrying a large plastic box with both hands" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=356 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl427150.jpg title="Uesaka Sumire" width=139></div><blockquote><i>I was an intern years ago at an IT company. Despite their positive reputation, the work hours are long, the office was short-staffed, and there was plenty of paperwork which was what I ended up doing all day.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>I recalled that it was Christmas Eve and everyone was already out of office. The only ones left were me with an crazy amount of work left, and Uesaka Sumire who from what I observe was in charge of every small thing in the office. The sun was setting and she was still seen moving things around after answering a delivery at the door. I went to the toilet before I got back to my seat again, only to walk into her near one of the desks. She had such a troubled look on her face struggling to hold on to a box full of documents, I took it from her hands and told her I will help her out. We finished moving the inventory before the sun went down.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I wanted to go home and continue work afterwards but Uesaka-senpai decided to thank me for my help, so I ended up having dinner with her.</i></div></blockquote><div><br><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>It looked like it was more heavy on her lol TALKING ABOUT HER RACK DUDE haha can we just not this is a pure story. I don't think there will be further parts of this because getting photos like this isn't easy despite her being the frequent cosplayer, but since it's a flashback I'll keep it as is, she is a senpai at my previous work establishment! Legit thought we won't meet again and not like I took her number and even then not like she cared to chat with me unless I did and that how it works with <em>all</em> women (lmao), so it was a surprise to see her in person at that party we did late last year. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> I'm pretty sure Sumipe didn't have this phase of work in her life, but what do I know? I only know about her banging body-</div><div><br></div><div>Though I think I will hate to say, but I think I just had a brain wave for a direct sequel SO!!! Next season I guess haha oh well we got 2 more stories to go so look forward to that!!</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. This story will conflict on my very first story about working in Japan for the first time so don't mind me, I didn't think I can create prequels in this lol should've watched Star Wars series</div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction"><span class="material-icons small-icons">category</span>The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text Â© 2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
