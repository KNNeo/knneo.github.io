<div></div><div>Well, we're halfway through the week already, how are you guys doing? It's great for me because I AM FREE UNTIL NEXT WEEK!!! Living the true holiday spirit this year once again- That tinnitus on my left ear though... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>This time around, I'm featuring someone we know all too well about but I've hardly written about her, so let's do this story the same impression I have of her now! Then again I wonder if I'm that nice to help people out...</div><div><br></div><div>Fictional me, right? Then I guess I am haha <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜‰>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Uesaka Sumire dressed in a white top with a dark blue jacket and yellow skirt, pouting and carrying a large plastic box with both hands" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=356 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl427150.jpg title="Uesaka Sumire" width=139></div><blockquote><i>I was an intern years ago at an IT company and despite their reputation, they are not what it seems. Work hours are long, the office was short-staffed, and there was plenty of paperwork which was what I ended up doing all day.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>I recalled it was Christmas Eve and everyone was already out of office. The only ones left was me with an overwhelming amount of work, and Uesaka Sumire who from what I see, is in charge of every small thing in the office. The sun was setting and she was still seen moving things around after answering a delivery at the door. I went to the toilet before I got back to my seat again, only to walk into her near one of the desks. She had such a troubled look on her face struggling to hold on to a box full of documents, I took it from her hands and told her I will help her out. We finished moving the inventory before the sun went down.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I wanted to go home immediately afterwards but Uesaka-senpai decided to thank me for my help, so I ended up having dinner with her.</i></div></blockquote><div><br><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>It looked like it was more heavy on her lol TALKING ABOUT HER RACK DUDE haha can we just not this is a pure story. I don't think there will be further parts of this because getting photos like this isn't easy despite her being the frequent cosplayer, but since it's a flashback I'll keep it as is, she is a senpai at my previous work establishment! Legit thought we won't meet again and not like I took her number and even then not like she cared to chat with me unless I did and that how it works with <em>all</em> women (lmao), so it was a surprise to see her in person at that party we did late last year. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> I'm pretty sure Sumipe didn't have this phase of work in her life, but what do I know? I only know about her banging body-</div><div><br></div><div>Though I think I will hate to say, but I think I just had a brain wave for a direct sequel SO!!! Next season I guess haha oh well we got 2 more stories to go so look forward to that!!</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. This story will conflict on my very first story about working in Japan for the first time so don't mind me, I didn't think I can create prequels in this lol should've watched Star Wars series</div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
