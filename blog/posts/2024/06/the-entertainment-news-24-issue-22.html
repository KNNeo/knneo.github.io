As much as I want to talk about new fanfiction, and as much as I want to review the next package already and how much I want confirm that I got a signed Moeshi photobook <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> AND as much as I am desperate to come up with a more rounded solution into moving OUT of Blogger? It's not happening, dudes, not the last one, but I do aim to make it much simpler like the one at GitHub and recently on Render. Not like the others are going to happen anytime soon too, so we shall see how it goes. I'm still moving to a new site though, that's for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>So, let's forget those right now and get in just on time for new music and Anime...? Hey, Anime "SasaKoi", you there? </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki09><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"It's so hot lately, I get sweaty just folding the laundry." DAMN TOWA-CHAN CAN I-</div></blockquote><div>What, no, no sweaty s*x what are you talking about this isn't a porno. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> In this new episode where the harem is complete lol thanks summer you did a great job (#TenshiTsuki09), let's talk about the new girl in town. Well, for starters, can I just say that shy Takao Kanon is the best thing Anime has ever given to us? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We just bumped on to her while being in the occult club room and yeah if you wonder why this is still a club in school which had a budget considering the skeleton is the club president lmao, we are introduced to the final member of the club. Yeah, as in this club will have to disband if they can't enough members by the end of the school year. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Cue Hisui-san as I would call her from here on I guess, for she is basically me as a female...? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I wouldn't say that but as for first impressions, she definitely bumped into Shintarou real bad, he's wondering if he did anything to her for her to be this shy and only communicate with the others. Like, if you see this guy hanging out with all the girls being so extroverted... you will want to stay away if not for your friend. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'm not into dudes, sorry. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking of the other though, they are ready to celebrate the end of the exam period - well Noel-chan is haha - and so as they go out to find a place to hang out, they chanced upon what is likely an early summer festival area? I'm not too sure but I'm sure there's overlap on festivals and their exam and summer holidays, so this is even better I suppose. Everything was well even Hisui-san is enjoying her time I guess just not with the dude unless you're into cucumbers HEY YO haha, until you realized what a flat out coincidence there is to ensure that Shintarou just forgot he ate some cucumbers and then went to save Lilishka who has wings from falling into a river infinitely deep. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Just Anime stuff don't worry about it. Ironically, Hisui-san went to save the dude which damn I thought we are getting some wet clothing action haha not a porno by the way, and I legit thought even until this far she was just afraid of guys- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So surprise, looks like Hisui here isn't a human also lmao I'm sorry Tsumugi-sama haha, and if you don't know what a (almost thought it's "Blue Archive" but it's) kappa really does in folklore... Don't find out. Please don't. Loch Ness would be less scary than one of these. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Not for Hisui though, for overall her being super nice to everyone would likely be her strong point to compensate for being shy and just... one with the water lmao, one can imagine that more of these girls appearing at this "occult" club here would make Noel-chan foam at the mouth on seeing fantasy appearing in front of her otaku eyes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... just which female in this harem isn't an actual human though? Oh hey, Tsumugi. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, well if you need an upside to all this, looks like we are not introducing more girls at this stage that isn't human lmao, so it'll be interesting to see the whole gang come together in some freak coincidence or when we get Shintarou out of the way and have some proper girls action <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but still it's a wild ride and the jokes still land to be honest it's interesting to remind myself too that Lilishka, excuse, me, Kagami-san here can fly so we can send Shintarou down the abyss. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I may not know what's the conclusion to this series the little angel did drop by already and she didn't pose much of a threat lmao, but at least next episode will be great looking at the title hehe WE STUDYING ON SHINTAROU'S HUMAN BODY OR WHAT <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5QlWPYGzRMcwHYz38m1IOce2mfXVLp_MIyMayVZgy-83SLdnrZhMGAwohxNESBV7awc7HxkaZs5acoxTgoSc1z488ln1byDIzDPaUfb8OxQZQdz9RvgGdOW_SaIBU-XRH-I03sEoFsl7X0HxWMGXO-g3MocHiTFGdd7itGVZC7oyNdLSjCbnBv-AqvZw/s320/tenshitsuki09_shell.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is probably triggering something awesome on someone out there.<br><span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJrnrg_IQZhVHz4hJ1hw7VfpkcmwDrHSmgLH7K7f9utLdTPpHe145zb-zhcoGrLdpQVEmFq2JR0GLPauLYTFScaDSkSr8HMy_IZvonILws4xCAdOHVOtGcz8V1cFaBcyn5KU0hRlO1xs1lPabx4LyLrqRx7zICPCNBiocQCFS5AKq197RvDI1_o6WYKL0/s320/tenshitsuki09_lilishka09.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Not this one.<br><span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVD7ljk5397cg9DS89evADDB34dWU7j1kuDZ6KElkLL1EES20y8Sa3I0DG1kFKZsdRmCXYiWQYvmZr-OjoSok8Mb3H7r2fM8VgGAkrGvUX_0it24ASx5DF0Y8KteKh1uSUYkni9gmsO95bL84U-nAOVyRUug7m-blN_1rlEc4ygpfYoV4qLZ62Gz4r9Pg/s320/tenshitsuki09_kappa1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Come on, we know that the No.1 Kappa can only go to <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/3225/Mei_Mei target=_blank>Mei Mei</a>'s buddy in Anime "Nagasarete Airantou" lmao</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Alright ladies what do you think we are here for</div></blockquote><div>I mean, if Cuff isn't the best representation of how much I don't care about this plan to confront Sade... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know, I just want to hug Alice-chan or something, dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where I suppose we are at the final stretch (#ShinigamiBocchan32), so get your a**es ready because Zain LOVES that stuff!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, before I recover from what I just saw so far haha thank goodness that was an illusion... let's talk about how far we have gotten. No longer are we dealing with the stuff we did the previous time we time travelled to the past. No more weak Zain and time magic that screws up everyone's location even Sade can point them out in a second. No more going in alone and unprepared just to almost get ambushed by Sade I would argue. Even for starters, we know the confrontation is between Zain and Sade just the two of them, mainly because Sade just wants to be stronger and seriously, I doubt she gives a damn about people talking about her love with Victor and/or just making people take up curses for the sake of doing so of course with the exclusion of Sharon and her daughter Alice. Still, I think we have come quite a long way away in terms of the plan Nico-sensei listed out, so let's see how much we have ticked down the list. Firstly, we somehow managed to stop Sade from going berserk. That isn't bad, and I think credit was given to the presence of Boccchan and Alice who both have some indirect link to Sade's past and of course from the grandfather, knew much about what her intentions and feelings are even back then, and we are at the point of stopping her just because Sade thinks cursing people is more fun without consent. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> But hey, whatever dude, at least we can prevent bloodshed this time around. But next up which is likely what is the cusp of this episode, is that Sade won't go along with us that easily, not without condition. Sounds about right, and it is ironic to bring her back to the present only for her to ruin ALL of our lives once again haha we can NOT ruin Rob and Viola-chan no way I want that love to happen- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways though, also Sade just wants the gang to go back, so she employs her sister Daleth to chase them away. The past her, yes, as present Daleth was aware of will likely happen. That still rather evil her who will listen to her sister's beck and call. That witch who felt no love but obligation to take over the underworld as she was told to. No longer will she know of what has happened to her in the future where - shout out to Walter trying to help and I also thought he will too - Daleth of the past was convinced of who she is as an evil witch, and you know, watch like, the second half of second season to see if the two Daleths (lol Walter relax) (as in two-fold because two of them and more than one of them FYI) will come to the same conclusion. *sees them cry* Looks like we have a consensus. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, this is getting me hyped for next episode no doubt, as we will see if it is even necessary to bring in Ichi and Nico into the fight. Well, I wouldn't say it's a fight no more, so let's not make things worse from here, eh, Sade? Though I have a feeling if she lost her only accomplice things might just turn for the worse. She is the lady underworld boss after all. But hey I don't know anything about this plot I'm just halfway through this rollercoaster ride at the peak of that loop haha I know right this is getting exciting I can't even MVP Flea-sensei btw I aspire to be him as a horse lmao</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4Kp2gWjvccZ6pKRTakLrP2jNrOzgnx92Fdlb4qFQjQXH_3XUCHbOy0jhHl65mVWFszAgwyVYDn-zXGpqgFmQaD6YrHn9x31hwCqnux-03ljGFGx5SH8n3hlUbBmQBlXoC-w8Fop-uHsTLZ7yQyTFEZ9m3t2Jci5_72GS9hE9xkO1W2Xzmf2i42SNWIuo/s320/shinigamibocchan32_movie3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Walter watching his brother getting bullied be like<br>(That's what sibling are for isn't it?)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiI4iG9oZFrz0tU2pP251xYwuSyABKAHPBnxALVJ4Cg11iLNdKU-Awr8_k2RrmaPqbNy05e62cggI1PxasSmBEIhwN7193AQSh3zRiwWDeaQQG-qjLrMWfR6NsOjsnl8l_DDGFAgxarOKVMBZjcKijFtOg9OEmzaGINz5YFwCnBo-gP3EcGZ-HaeZzcje0/s320/shinigamibocchan32_thumbs.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Accomplices of a murder after clearing up the dead body be like<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0ukPAQ8OxR26jwMo4VtiGduFta6tMVTv2r5IDXuqbzniLw_T3OdvwieJcSKnM6jbC7XYR5uUKQvPeEVIiIzHt7a5YCuQPYzoux1cHoM7PxcGMZfqqsuu7QgE2eBkQOvWDp9DwRCHQS8rqnYraK8FNbaO274ukofosxFaDxsTh23uHgFzeClHF3r-pJG4/s320/shinigamibocchan32_flea1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Can we just talk about how much of a chad Flea is in this episode though??<br>(Yeah this guy came out of Dragonball Z, I'm sure)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

God doesn't exist? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Wait wait, how did I get this deep in feels? Well, maybe it's time to talk about Sasakura's past, shall we? Story goes that somehow we ended up at a bar we never wanted to walk into, and it feels like a case of Sasakura trying to tell into his <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> Kitahara-san's head that he is treating this bartender thing all wrongly. What's wrong, you might ask? But seriously though, who is out there serving heavily alcoholic drinks to customers brought in even if it's under another customer's request, and just, you know, not understanding customer's needs at any point of time? Yeah, Kitahara's who. As he said it himself, this isn't that regular hospital who treats patients with a drink to remember. He's just that guy who takes order requests, lives with them for the sake of the people who patronize, and then it all ends. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well that all sounds dark already, to be frank, that's what life is about in general, but as we find out where Sasakura and Kitahara's master was after all those years... things really became dark for no other reason. So, if you aren't ready, let's talk about life. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See, Kitahara talks about reality at hand. He taught Sasakura the ways of being a bartender, to understand the customer so to not offend them and give them the best experience. But also, as the glass reflects back on every single one of them bartenders, they aren't remembered. They are only reminded of the drinks they make, see recent cocktail competition, and then when the fire is all over, it's done. Sad to think that's how that works, and I'm sure there's more to this story than what we knew so far haha looks like Kitahara is already hinting on Sasakura's past before he became bartender in Japan instead of France after he won that award... All that is to say is, Sasakura was hinted that bartenders' lives are not worth remembering. As much as it is meaningful to save troubled people who drop by for a consignment, it's also easily forgotten. I mean, not like I'm suggesting a crowdfunding campaign to save the master of some popular bartender even if Sasakura gets forced into being in the Chairman's hotel bar at some point in the future, but the sad reality as reflected through that glass... It's shining. Glaring, even. And that seems to be the problem. It's no longer a pitch to try to convince Sasakura to think about being a bartender somewhere else. It's no longer just Kitahara-san explaining to his dear <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kouhai target=_blank>kouhai</a> about such unjust going on a society where we are being nice and receive no reward. All in all, this might be a race to see who can convince Sasakura to think otherwise. As in, in case you didn't read what I see the moment I walked into your bar... Whether Sasakura would just stop being a bartender after all. Though if his ideal was broken in the first place as we will find out next episode, why would he still continue to struggle? We shall find out soon, I guess. Maybe Miwa-san consider convincing your grandpa to not be such a jerk after this flashback, yes? I am now actually convinced why the ending theme song is as such. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Life, dude.</div><div>[Oh I have been searching for the recipes when I do these thumbnails but totally forgot the official Twitter/X account is doing it too!!

All those things we have inherited from the pat is now just a mess in societal function, it's kinda gross to be honest. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay back to more gross stuff haha I know right this series is LITERALLY fuelled by revenge (#KuroshitsujiSchool08), do you really want me to talk about how Ciel essentially cheated Bluewer's final throw in the cricket tournament? Nah, maybe not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But we WILL talk about all the other stuff though, like celebrations and such, how the Blue House did not practice for rowing eights so they can present themselves as winners for the Queen. Yeah, and the midnight tea party, dude. All this closing ceremony thing is just flair now. The Queen be like where is my boy Derrick? What the f**k are you playing around here, Phantomhive? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, dear Queen, I ensure you this will ALL makes sense once we got to the Headmaster- Ah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, Sebastian didn't get him too so uh... What are we to do? I'm pretty sure you guys already know what was the plan and I don't mean the cricket finals, but yeah, Ciel eventually got invited to the midnight tea party that was all the buzz at the college. You know, you get a seat on the same table with the headmaster with the P4 and their drudges and have a splendid evening(?) talking about what a great tournament we have made I would argue historically even more exciting than the previous time the Sapphire Miracle happened haha ah hey- AH HEY DUDE are we forgetting something here?? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, in case you forgot why we are here for, so far we have chased a headmaster who has his clothes left, we won the cricket tournament so we can essentially have a one-on-one talk with the monarch of the college... All that is left is to, well, tell him the situation at hand. I mean, not like anyone thinks that *some* of the students went missing was a good call, but also not even a call at all not like Violet talked about them even though they are under his House haha yeah gottem dude, but also other students who have gone missing?? In response though, and yes if you have waited this long I apologize, the Queen would be pleased to see that Derrick is pretty much well and alive, and he got the invitation to the tea party too? What did he do to deserve such an honour? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... I think I am recalling on what happened, even if vaguely. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> As usual, I will still not reveal anything just in case I'm wrong too lmao that's what happens when you turn 30, but yeah, Derrick being "alive" is somewhat tied to the actual events happening behind the scenes. Not going to explain too much but yeah, Derrick Arden is very much alive and well. At the expense of others, though. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> We will talk about more of them as this arc closes in the truth soon, so hang around for another cup of tea, won't ya?

OF COURSE they are not going to drop on us what's wrong just yet remember someone needs a slap in present day <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> We are not doing that yet though, so let's talk about what else happened in this episode. Well firstly, the (SS)GIRLS got into the school festival with the auditions! Heck yeah, Himari-chan almost gave Yori-senpai a good time lmao I'm glad it's just a good pat on the head hehe, but yeah, so did the Shiho gang I suppose haha, but that's not the problem. Problem was Shiho. Like, REALLY problematic, this kid. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As much as she doesn't want to admit anything else even by just dunking on her past and seeing her past flourish potentially better than she did, it's also as much concern to everyone else than to her that you know, we perhaps don't have to end up being this harsh. Yeah, no one was strong enough to confront the tiger. That cute little thing who could've been just a neighbourhood cat for all we know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, I don't write the character development in this series, but thanks for the shout out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Even so, it's rather obvious that Shiho is just not being nice at all, and we come to the best part of the episode... haha hey me you need a vaccine against Mizugushi Miki LOL alright come back here, me. And I think with the flashback we just heard her talk about to Himari as she just so happened to drop by Shiho's part time gig which damn if she shuts her mouth up she will win in image lmao, we somehow knew more and less of what Shiho is as a person. Nothingness, is the topic so far, as we are introduced to her previous rival haha yes those exist, it's Kyou-chan. Not like Kyouka or today or whatever, just... you don't get Japanese it's fine. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, the two met just because someone threw a teddy bear up a tree lol no prizes for guessing who needs that childish thing lmao GOTTEM, but what got Shiho though, is that there are people without even trying are doing better than her effort could ever bring her. Hey, not like she thought that effort isn't the only thing that is in art and musical instruments, and not like she gave up on music either she is just BENT on showing the people around her what's up and I'm surprised why you haven't taught your parents a lesson yet lol I know right... She instead continued on her journey of being clite. I <em>really</em> hope you see the problem now.  I'm not going to explain much more so you get the idea. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> All in all... well, at least we know Shiho's backstory now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, I knew to give less sh*t than Shiho gave about her life. Yeah, and she bloody thinks she is better at it than me- I don't f**king care dude she needs to relax. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Whatever it is though, bear in mind that's how being childish works that's how it has always been no one told her that I guess, and the way to deal with kids, in case you wonder, is to teach them a lesson. Hey, what do you know, Aki-chan has prepared the materials for it! Haha see you then I guess oh about that. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Eh, looks like <a href=https://www.sasakoi-anime.com/news/index01110000.html target=_blank>we will have 2 weeks of recap due to production delays</a> (OOF) (THIS IS A THING??) (lmao hey <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/51815/Kubo-san_wa_Mob_wo_Yurusanai target=_blank>Anime "Kubo-san"</a> what's up) and that'll be another 2 episodes which will likely wrap this mess up and... we don't know after that. Yeah, the math does not add up, the episodes. So uh... maybe this is just as bad of a mess as I thought it was after all? Haha say it ain't so, people. Can't be worse than <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/23079/Glasslip target=_blank>Anime "Glasslip"</a> which finished airing without a skip haha GOTTEM</div><div>[TL:DR; "But I knew I had to do something.

I wasn't impressed by the title song but more on one of the other songs, and the emotional ones did not hit me. Yeah, hard to beat <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%9C%88%E3%81%8C%E7%B6%BA%E9%BA%97%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%81%AD/1712607080?i=1712607084&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>that song back in November last year</a> which I really liked it so much it got on my Top 20 ranks.

But yeah, feels kinda dated even if the melodies aren't carrying them imo.</div><div><br></div><div>On news this week then, we gotta talk about future stuff, or probably it's happening now by the time I list them out. <b><a href=https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1795017105747698157 target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new live video</a></b> is of a song that started me off of this band, but damn are they not the same even singing this song today. <a href=https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1795410650921058349 target=_blank><b>miwa's new live music video</b></a>(?) is from the new album released this week and I didn't fancy it though, so... uh maybe you'll like it?

And okay the rest of them are new songs set to release soon so I'll list them out as fast as I can because goddamn they are so many. <b><a href=https://x.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1795409685887009221 target=_blank>SHE'S new song</a></b> will release in two weeks, <b><a href=https://x.com/The_Floor_/status/1796119379945332771 target=_blank>The Floor's new song</a></b> is also releasing in two weeks what a coincidence lol, <b><a href=https://x.com/Finlands12/status/1796157108632621374 target=_blank>FINLANDS' new song</a></b> is releasing... in a month haha gotcha, and <b><a href=https://x.com/shionnu10/status/1796478342457430491 target=_blank>Tsuji Shion's new song</a></b> which is her new song in a couple of years already is releasing in 2 weeks too. So as you can see, I might be really busy changing moods the following week. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And yes, <a href=https://x.com/sasakoi_anime/status/1796874344053785045 target=_blank><b>Anime "SasaKoi" new song</b></a> which I mentioned last week's episode is good, thanks for asking. I go for melody though, so no thanks. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Full albums based on the band releasing next month though, if you want to know more. <b><a href=https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1797240039623332225 target=_blank>Kroi's new album song(?) preview</a></b> is indicator that they are starting on the preview period before their release is out end of this month. Can't be weirder than the preview itself lol I already know from their previous album so it's fine. And oh boy take a look at this: <b><a href=https://x.com/inoriminase/status/1797259663970541931 target=_blank>Minase Inori announced a new half album set to release end August</a></b>- Yep, you didn't see that wrongly. Mini-albums are officially dead now. Yeah, what you going to do about <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/faith-crisis-pt-1/1711376306?l=en-US" target=_blank>Part.1, Middle Kids</a>? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, the not album? Eh... I've not been giving her songs the past year so uh... hopefully this turns it around! Being very optimistic here tbh.</div><div><br></div><div>There isn't much next week I guess I will deal with <b>Aimer's quadruple A-side single</b> (lol this is not a joke) before we move on to the slew of new songs releasing the following week and those prospective ones which will shadow drop release next week too. You know, in case I took a fancy into one of them again- Look, impressions are rough when it's your 17th year listening to Japanese music, okay? We gotta keep giving second chance.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Welcome to the four-part series where I talk about the future of this blog over here for the rest of the month- Nope, NOPE. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'll put that on that obligatory post next month in case you are keen, but I think I will have a different philosophy of doing blog posts from here on. Well, not for this weekly post I suppose, I still like to write about Anime and music alike as much as it's routine chores to do this every week I'm pretty sure I was blessed to not have any appointments on Sundays so I can do something way more meaningless than being a bartender haha ah. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> So yeah, moving on haha, I am finally done dealing with the processing of that stack of bromide photos I showed you guys a couple of weeks ago... but just the Ibuki-chan stack (get it?) so at least that will be running as my phone wallpapers for the month. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay maybe not, Ayachi has to cover the final week, maybe slip in some Koko-chan and Mocho in there too. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright alright fun time is over I gotta wrap up before I sleep late and then get myself some coffee tomorrow lmao, and until next time... I wish I didn't have to pay to blog whatever I want. While still being happy? Haha NO WAY DUDE</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. TIME TO SELF HOST MY BLOG- Yeah right lol</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
