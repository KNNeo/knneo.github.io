Thanks though, this is so great apart from the fact that I got it signed, I wonder why I keep thinking of <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/238861/Noeru_Izumi target=_blank>Noel-chan</a> from Anime "Tenshi Tsuki" and her underwear all this time.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Moving on, offloading <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> my load <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> and instead transferring that energy to talk about Anime and music this week! Oh boy, do we have more things going on than ever before- I thought this was a quiet week for music? YUKI-san disagrees. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki11><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"We are Hisui-sama's personal maids, and we come from a long line of elite <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kappa target=_blank>kappa</a> who have served heirs of the Tsurumi clan for generations." Eh... I have questions. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Like, is there ever a time where it's too late for any Anime series to feature a beach episode? Okay, don't include action series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we finally got the harem special episode we wanted lol (#TenshiTsuki11), I feel like we are at the last few episode of season one of Anime "ToniKawa", very reminiscent. Oh sh*t this will have another season and OVA?? I'm taking notes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, do you REALLY want to know what happened this episode? DO YOU REALLY????? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Five question marks just because) But yeah, maybe we talk about as many as we can without getting flagged. Yeah, and then post thumbnails to get me flagged. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yoshi target=_blank>Yes</a>, let's do that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Firstly, about kappas. They are rich. They have maids. It's just the smallest of them abodes. Hisui-chan here... is rich. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright her family is but let's not trauma dump here, for since why not Lilishka suggested a school club training camp without much of a budget per se seeing as how she is so lazy to even prepare for anything for this event she invited everyone into, she basically just relied on the rich family to provide for... everything it seems. Just, not the sumo platform, no thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Thank goodness that is not the focus of the episode or else I will just shove my <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shirikodama target=_blank>shirikodama</a> into myself (lmao whatever that may mean), and kappas happen to just like water so we have a beach nearby. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> And OH BOY if you thought Towa-chan is the only one excited to never have seen a beach before, I'm just excited that the maids didn't realize Shintarou is a male. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What, do you need me to explain how stacked everyone is as in Noel and Towa haha ah hey, and how all of them look great on swimsuits? Yes, including Lilishka who did show it off to Shintarou when the sun sets, and even if it's just a bloomer, at least it's something. Better than Shintarou who basically just borrowed a pair of pants and can't go into the water since you know, there wasn't any male swimsuits prepared. Yeah, Lilishka, how is Shintarou going to enjoy his harem like this, you lazy- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> but SURELY he can join in on the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/onsen target=_blank>hot springs</a>- Hey, Noel-chan, it's doable? If you live in somewhere called the Hinata Inn, shout out to "Love Hina". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Apart from Noel-chan chilling the hot springs thinking that nothing great is also real in this world haha SAME, and Hisui-chan just talking to Shintarou in the hot springs alone together haha ah hey, it just looks like a great fanservice episode where I don't have to think too much about what the kappa maids are saying. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Please, these girls are FAR CRY from many rich family maids in Anime. Yeah, that one who smells the lady they serve haha <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/32927/Sayaka_Dejima target=_blank>Dejima-san</a> from <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/8675/Seitokai_Yakuindomo target=_blank>Anime "Seitokai Yakuindomo"</a> you need to back off from here right now. All in all... I already forgot about Noel-chan's panties. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay Lilishka also forgot that there was an importantly activity she reminded all of us during the morning but had such a great time they were all tired and CAN WE NOT GO TO SHINTAROU'S ROOM TO SUCK HIM OFF- All in all lmao, a great episode of course if you can't see the jokes coming. Still, we are near the end, summer's gotta end eventually <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, so I wonder what's going to wrap this series up. Shintarou sleeping with the girls all tied up like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/32925/Naruko_Yokoshima target=_blank>Yokoshima-sensei</a> from Anime "Seitokai Yakuindomo" so that we can feel his presence as a friend? We can but hope. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/dosukoi target=_blank>DOSUKOI</a> DOSUKOI haha see you then.</div><div>[TL:DR; "I think everyone only came because (Shintarou) you did."

Yeah Sade, Daleth didn't betray you she just fell in love with a human. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Wow, sounds like Sade is going through a power struggle ever since her childhood. Bruh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where all things must end whether it's good or not (#ShinigamiBocchan34), I mean we can do without the opening theme song we are in the middle of a fight here, people. ANYWAYS, this episode though, is SUCH A BLAST!! Haha yeah, let's get the exciting part out of the way first. Well, which also meant the worse case scenario did happen, if you know what that even was. So, story. We're fighting Sade. She was thinking of being friends with Bocchan until, you know, all negotiations fell apart. So welp, guess the flashback of her life and being betrayed firstly by her dad who noticed she can read minds wasn't helping much. I like how their dad looks like a reindeer. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, Satan would have been cooler. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All but Daleth still gave a damn, and even after she gave her those scars? Man, I would've just ended myself. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> But whatever that wasn't the timeline even travelling on this timeline might have its own effects, which probably pissed Nico off already considering this conversation is going nowhere and also how DARE you take a hit at Flea-sensei we can't let the coolest guy fade away haha yes it's not her btw, so they be fightin'. But we know Sade is too OP mainly because she can read minds and dodge every attack from Nico, but looks like the emotions are taking a toll on her. And that's funny because remember how much more powerful she was anyways? And how we know we can let her emotions get in her way? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I think that was the intention. Problem is, because this world has magic, and looks like our server is large enough to spin off another server on its own haha that's a network server cum general AI joke right there, eh... looks like Sade somehow lost control of her powers, and is playing defence even if she collapsed at some point, seeing like, Bocchan fight for his life to go against Nico's idea of violence. See, people? It's that easy, just do diplomacy and be friends- Well, it's not that simple I suppose. Ironically, Alice chose to walk back into the past with the magic school senpais who were the last line of attack/defence depending on who you ask, and the latter took the hint: Alice wanted to try to talk to Sade herself. But what Sade suggested is probably the best and worst plan while trying to stay alone in her own bubble unwanted and lonely amidst Alice's intrusion: Sade intends to remove their curses. Sade doesn't mind making everyone else happy since she can't. Sade doesn't mind dying for all of this. But uh, bad news, evil witch, we should do all of this. Just, not the dying part. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> In an epic troll from Alice who made the final draw, looks like Sade chose to believe in making friends once more, that feel that she picked up once before since her encounter with eccentric human Victor. Yeah. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> I still <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> cannot believe <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> this worked haha thanks to Bocchan and Alice of course, and all's well ends well- Uh oh, maybe not. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... I think I know what will be the conclusion to this "fight". Yes, Sade will deal with her own magic which went berserk. Just tell me this is the dad's power she took away from, just... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know, I am wiping my tears as I type this, and damn, this was a good plot twist. I mean, we probably saw it coming when Alice dropped into Sade's soul, but heck, it's still such a feel I can't even. I know, maybe I should be an evil witch so I can have friends. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Or not, just kill me with my own magic then I guess. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> Haha anyways, I'm excited to see what should have been. The happy ending, however this works out. See you then. </div><div>[TL:DR; "You (Sade) are just like how Bocchan used to be."

Yeah I don't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Damn, maybe Sasakura should just quit bartending. HAHA say it ain't so because in this new episode (#Bartender11) we are still crying. From one tearjerker to another is hardly any comforting to my disheartened soul, but heck, I'll do this once again, as many times as I can. So firstly, featuring our first old man lol, we talk about Kaze-san. Yes, that mentor to Sasakura, which in the flashback of such a young kid haha ah hey, we learnt that Sasakura even before he went out to get cocktail recognition in Europe, he was just a lad working at the local bar along with Kitahara, now his senpai. Ever since, it has not been easy for the old man, as we have previously mentioned on how no one cares about you when you go old *OOF*, but looks like Kaze-san is well enough to at least do one more <strike>day</strike> night of bartending. Somehow it got on social lol thanks Yukari-chan, and everyone crowded in to ask for one final drink at Kitahara's place. But suddenly, choice becomes hesitance. What would be most memorable if it was your last? Can't be letting the bartender decide- Wait a minute. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, I mean you can, you can do whatever you want, that is what service is about anyways. Speaking of, and man I rather not, and I'm surprised we can still slip in the reality check afterwards, is the Chairman Kurushima's mind that is still set on Sasakura Ryuu, to be his bartender on his top hotel. It's an honour alright, but between bearing this role while literally pressured to do this as far as convincing the owner to close Eden Hall (WHAT?? NO!!) (lol) altogether... It would seem like we are just in a rocky relationship even after so long. Just look at that smug face on that old man. It's as if you don't want me to talk about- Wait, I know this story! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Okay, and in case you haven't known of anything especially its first adaptation back in 2006, the series actually started with this story if I recall, that Miwa-san is trying to find a bottle of alcohol that her grandfather (yes the Chairman) and his father were intending to share to reconcile with each other, only to be destroyed (HAHA DESTROYED lol what am I, a kid?) by Miwa here when she was just a little child. No, we are not animating that I can't cry to a story of reunion and cuteness overload at the same time. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Coming back, and in the process of everyone and I meant just the owner of the place they always hang out lol thinking about this, and how reluctant the granddad was to transition into the hotel business from <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ryokan target=_blank>traditional Japanese inns</a> not forgiving the Westerners for the war lol WOKE, the dad should be (1) smart enough to not serve Western drinks lest he pisses her dad off again and (2) would choose a Suntory Whiskey bottle because even if it's Western in surface, the essence within is still fundamentally Japanese, symbolizing how new things can still be done the Japanese way. You know, wink wink, capitalism, not going to elaborate too much lol. All in all, this might be way too emotional for my dear heart. I know, AND talking about old men? I feel the same and I don't know why. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> To conclude the series I would assume Sasakura would not have much of a choice to reject Kurushima here, but if he wants to add another condition so that he can get laid at some point with his granddaughter right here that would also be a good idea. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Don't think that's happening haha but hey, just like Sasakura's impending fate, we can but hope...

Wow where have I seen such a person before, hmm... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>I know right, this series is short enough already do we need to be reminded of that short brat Maurice Cole again, huh, Redmond? Also can you make better choices of your drudges though? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where deja vu is an option and murder is a choice (#KuroshitsujiSchool10), I mean, do all rich kids in Weston College work like this?? If so, I'm glad Ciel who is technically younger than ALL of them is better off not receiving formal education. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, about the scandal. Well, the P4 found Derrick and friends bullying the heck out of other students, what are we going to do about it? Apparently nothing it seems, because Derrick is so far up everyone's arse lol, he's about to be a Duke under his family line, he can just bluff his way through, just like apparently how all drudges in Red House have been doing so far lol I want to beat Redmond to death with a cricket bat now but damn, somehow he's holding the House reputation, so I'm not going to think too much. The others though, might have problems. And so the incident. Greenhill went and sent Derrick a message to his ancestors lol ie. he gave him the bonk haha I just can't say stuff like this, dude, gotta get me cancelled. But yeah, to cover this up, and this is interesting how Redmond knew of Undertaker and I guess this is why the Red House is the worst we're better off with just three houses in Weston lmao, we have come back to where we are at now. Of course a showdown is going to happen and there are many more people who are technically undead including Agares which will explain his eccentric behaviour of falling down steps of stairs for no apparent reason. Something to do with his Cinematic Records, maybe? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay Derrick too I guess but we didn't let him walk down steps to get to here so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright me we can stop dunking on the undead, because we gotta talk about the small small happiness we got from the fighting!! Haha well all thought of from Sebastian's mind it seems, because he has determined that Ciel will be under more danger if he chose to fight, and Undertaker made the smart choice to run away instead, so I guess we will save the fight, for another time. Heck, if you want more of this though, go back to like, the <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/31812/Kuroshitsuji_Movie__Book_of_the_Atlantic target=_blank>previous</a> <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/22145/Kuroshitsuji__Book_of_Circus target=_blank>story</a> <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji target=_blank>arcs</a>, even Campania had more action than this. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In the conclusion to the story though, and yeah that grass is so much sin in that college compared to Ciel's place, even the new P4 were worried if they can uphold the so-called "tradition" they have in these school grounds. And somehow the Queen is interested in the undead? Ew. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... man, did I forget the lore that was in my head as I read the manga all those years ago? Then maybe I did, but hey, we don't have much to wait for considering another story arc is in place, but damn even just talking about this one, it's DOPE!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, this is probably the best episode to give you a full taste of what the Kuroshitsuji series is about, and more than complaining about the quality of the animation, I am just glad that this Cinematic Record is still extended beyond its usual length, and I'm totally grateful for it. Next week's episode might be the last, but when we reach the next stage of Undertaker's antics hehe because why not, then MAYBE I'll talk about the lore I recalled back then. I mean, of course I knew of this but where you stopped is typically where you remember the best, isn't it? Just... just watch back the episode of Derrick again you'll get it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizmRtL_DxZxgvZPXySd1Z_piYxrZF7FFcw6JXBlcDRr194drD6w9mCUpSJr-yklnk89h4h7X4FIbm1BcRG0vBMNLBNdKcaourv-Xr7qg19C_VosksBYfc-7sDLWmogOlu-7AaDtawXvQ0yCCHU7j1VRRxts1TV3GIwAoQdy4BqoUhQWktsZldoxdJTOtA/s320/kuroshitsujischool10_agares2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I have a harsh feeling, since I constantly have headaches, that I <em>might</em> have these lines on my forehead<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrQ4Z6tQaZf8WkSrhbISOsSaKEYDvcAvpAzk4hsaoxlG82c0BpCVHiegd8mH0UIg1PkwJKo0umKGLqe0QvhJxa6vuqn8NCPDhqvmYbDkq3M_AuYAjXmZEyr5FZ9xxiTR_L9KHAvWpaGChs1LE2XmH0QWFCqt7NqHG4twKmcH9-0DH_xPe_xJJYVJ41PiA/s320/kuroshitsujischool10_scythe.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>THERE IT IS!!!

I did not give <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kick-out-single/1749915782?l=en-US" target=_blank>SHE'S new song</a></b> for some reason I can't explain lol but ironically, I did give the thumbs up to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC-%E3%83%A6%E3%83%BC-%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A6%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89-single/1746676215?l=en-US" target=_blank>The Floor's new song</a></b> just because I missed their feels and the melody is alright and catchy enough, so I just let it come in. Also in my music library much hesitation and me indirectly dunking on her while she still liked the post (lol I'm sorry) is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%8D%E3%82%89%E3%81%84%E3%81%AB%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6-single/1750260260?l=en-US" target=_blank>Tsuji Shion's new song</a></b>, it's her new song in a while, hopefully she found footing to release more songs, but damn, our hopes might be futile. I hope not. Moving on haha, I ended up listening to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tokyo-friday-night-feat-kana-hanazawa-mori-calliope-single/1747466797?l=en-US" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana &amp; Hololive English VTuber Mori Calliope's duo song</a></b> and boy does it have the vibes too good you will forget it's written by a music artist called "Joint Beauty" (hell yeah they are) (not sure on the latter though <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>) which makes these kinds of songs for a living so it's no surprise. It's good though, even down to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2Hsp26oF1E" target=_blank>the animated music video</a> which you should watch. I also listened to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/slits/1747949656?l=en-US" target=_blank>YUKI's new album</a></b> which released this week too (and I have to be notified on Instagram to know to pick this up so no thanks lol) and I was kinda worried since the last time I heard of her songs last year and uh... this one ain't bad at all. Ended up giving more songs than I expected, so yeah, it was worth a listen despite the heavier pop styles present in this. I also also (yep) ended listening to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/refrain-ep/1503277113?l=en-US" target=_blank>Ueda Reina's debut mini-album from 2016</a></b> (OOF) because she played one of the songs on her radio show, so... just that song haha I wasn't keen on the others anyways. And don't ask if I gave <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%88%E3%82%A5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9-ep/1749029097?l=en-US" target=_blank>Takagaki Ayahi &amp; Toyosaki Aki's duo song single</a></b> because I didn't even if they released <a href=https://x.com/sphere_PS/status/1801121027545760210 target=_blank>the music video for the title song</a> since... yeah, I'm not that into them now. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> It's still a trip down memory lane though, listening to them covering each other's solo songs. (Edit: LMAO Aki-chan's cover of Ayahi's songs is most popular song on Apple Music Japan haha it is indeed a great song I've given that back then)</div><div><br></div><div><b><a href=https://x.com/trysail_staff/status/1800002569164796270 target=_blank>TrySail announced a new single releasing in August</a></b> and yes it's for Anime no surprises there.

They NEED to make this more comprehensive I'm not going to watch videos just for news updates. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Moving on haha I watch for tech news though, <b><a href=https://x.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1801947891185168816 target=_blank>SHE'S announced a new album releasing in September</a></b> so that's rad but going by how I did not even bother with their songs over the past year I choose to remain optimistic, so let's see how it goes by the time I get there. And let's not forget about <b><a href=https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1800149125561987551 target=_blank>Kroi's new album song previews</a></b> which you can browse their social media accounts to listen I am not going to share all of them since there's only the one new song and the rest are instrumental or from their singles earlier this year.
