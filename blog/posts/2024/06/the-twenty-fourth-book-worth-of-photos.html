Not like I have watched her in Anime even after all these years and don't ask me why I can't justify this by watching that animated trash that is <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/53912/Seiyuu_Radio_no_Uraomote target=_blank>"Seiyuu Radio no Uraomote"</a> which is also her first main role in a new series for a while (lol), but suffice it to say I'm not here to justify that she has great voice acting because her deep voice isn't exactly a turn on even for me. Even her image took a bit for me to get used to, as I think I started getting interested in her and to a lesser extent (sorry) Itou Miku who was her partner in idol duo Pyxis, you <em>may</em> have heard of them. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>It was not only until recent years after the fire happening around the world that Moeshi here took a dive again into the stuff she does rather often with Mikuu years ago: Taking photos of themselves half-naked. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, it's an idol thing to do, it's better to be done earlier than later, and with Itou Miku's appearances in <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gurabia target=_blank>gravure</a> magazines and as with many sometimes just not showing any skin haha yep that's possible if you are super popular, but Moeshi definitely went ALL OUT when she started doing a couple of these digital photobook a couple of years ago which probably caught everyone by surprise. Not much of a surprise to my bro though, he took the bait real quick and got even more into her than me even today.</div><div><br></div><div>And it wasn't until this year where after like about a year did she surface once again in the gravure(?) industry to reveal to us what they have been planning so far: She announced a photobook to conclude her 20s as she turns 30... next year haha I know right she was more desperate to make this happen than many, I would say. But seeing her past and appearing in a few Anime even appearing in main roles in new shows and sequels including her long time coming role in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/39894/Hibike_Euphonium_3 target=_blank>Anime "Hibike! Euphonium"</a>, it was more than an opportune time to make this happen, and I cannot thank her enough.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>THE PROCEEDINGS</div><div>Since there was like, 2 months until release date and as usual I was hesitating on what special bromide photos to get which was dependent on each store out there. I salivate on social media on the specific store offers ranging from <a href=https://x.com/moeshiphotobook/status/1777912711248236779 target=_blank>Gamers</a> *umph* haha to <a href=https://x.com/moeshiphotobook/status/1777330975305068932 target=_blank>Animate</a> (acrylic board so maybe not) and even <a href=https://x.com/moeshiphotobook/status/1778258273340416111 target=_blank>HMV</a> because close-ups, until the details of <a href=https://x.com/moeshiphotobook/status/1778598534738309601 target=_blank>a signing event and its random selection of 3 bromide photos</a> attracted my attention. I then diverted this to my bro and we eventually came up with a bet: Whoever got the cat photo with Moeshi ie. "got the pussy" will treat the other a drink when we meet up next time, and if we both didn't then we'll just treat our other friend because in all lack of hope, we can't get pussy, not even outside real life. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, we get a chance to get a signed photobook during the release date of the book itself (a total of 200 lucky winners) happening on a lovely Friday where you don't have to work and <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> so about that.</div><div><br></div><div>This particular signing event (among other events too Moeshi be a busy woman) was hosted by <a href=https://muvus.jp/muvus/ target=_blank>MUVUS</a>, and if you go to their site you will notice even more tasteful content that will make you drool but we are here for one girl only so come back haha, and the thing with them was first, you gotta read the Japanese. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well in the modern age of tech with automatic translations that would not be much of an issue tbh they also stated that overseas buyers are welcome (and even linked to Tenso lol "yeah they're a friend" <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>), and it wasn't much to worry about on the times too since there were 2 events that day with one at 5pm local time here and 7pm, but the problems specifically which my friend faced were two-fold: He didn't have a Japanese name within 10 characters to put in (lol and the staff <em>kindly</em> reminded us to not key in Kanji lest Moeshi takes 2 minutes writing a name correctly) (and even then she screwed some up haha), and he didn't have the time to watch any of them, as we found out much later after signing up for this during start of April. The solutions were then to directly translate his name into Japanese (unlike me <a href=../../2020/11/that-time-i-got-myself-japanese-name.html>who came up with a Japanese name years ago</a> <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>), and he chose the 2nd event with my promise that I will just tune in to give him the most updated info on his signed book winning, if it happened.</div><div><br></div><div>Well, as you will see below, I had a good time. I *specifically* took a couple of hours off work on that Friday afternoon to go for an appointment and take a follow-up vaccine for work, only to have too much time left because it took like, less than 5 minutes lol and with an hour and a half to spare before my work hours are up, I- <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Don't worry my employer does not know of my social and this blog. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So in an ABSOLUTE CHAD MOVE but not really so that I won't *technically* be at home when I should *technically* still be at work, I, uh, took the bus home which will take infinitely longer than if I took the metro which - with the added benefit of not being underground - allowed me to watch the 5pm signing event on my phone without being interrupted by anything. Or anyone.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>And that was when I heard my name, about 17 minutes (I can still remember even if the archive was removed) into the livestream and I still could not believe it, dude!! I expressed my disbelief during the weekly post that week that maybe there's another dude named "Shouhei" who got it instead of me? Yeah, suspicions and all, but it is indeed mine. <a

target=_blank>I even took a screenshot of it</a>, despite how low resolution that secondary camera angle is and how she didn't bring up the book to show the sign which you would NORMALLY do when they change eras though <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'm just glad I got the dub. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Little does ma bro know that less people would've registered for the first event because many would think they have to watch to see it happen and chose the later evening one which would statistically decrease his chances of getting it signed MUAHAHAHA</div><div><br></div><div>We <em>are</em> going to treat our friend to a drink though: As much as we can't get pussy in real life, we also cannot get pussy even just betting on an idol signing event.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Now that I'm done with all the lore, let's introduce ourselves to her body! <span

This is waaaay worth the money compared to many other photobooks we have seen in the past 5 years to be honest. It featured so many outfits they actually had less cuts on some of them which I assumed they can't put in this book just because, it's an overseas trip and not Okinawa thank goodness lol (then again she did go there before last year so), and my waist is moving by itself for no reason. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Jokes aside though, this truly is a work of art in itself, just displaying the many sides of Toyota Moe here. It's just as if I have long planned on the title for this review: "<abbr title="模様津々、絵のように (Mo'you Shinshin, E no you ni)">Motif Overflowing, Like a Work of Art</abbr>".</div><div><br></div><div>Little do you know the first letters of pronunciation of the Japanese title are "mo" and "e" so "moe". <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>If you want more than this though lol I meant images of Moeshi half-naked, this was also done in conjunction(?) of her (yet another) gravure magazine appearance in Shupure+ where she talks more about the photobook because by getting a <a href=https://www.grajapa.shueisha.co.jp/item/detail/weeklyplayboy/1ebd29818f5f8bb796b470a958296101 target=_blank>digital copy of the magazine</a>, it entitles you to a <a href=https://x.com/grajapa_2024/status/1797931331986551189 target=_blank>30+ minutes video footage</a> (linked is just a preview) of all of this and Moeshi in all her moving glory... during her journey in New Zealand. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Haven't pulled the trigger on this yet so uh... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Joke review though, this photobook is basically how I watch... adult... videos lmao I'm going to get cancelled: I try to survive watching till the end but I probably "settled in" at just the intro leading into the first s*x scene and then I'm done. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And then I come back a week later to see the rest as and when I feel like it. Yeah in instalments haha I gotta pay my debt back dude with every push is a PULL- Oh, where I first settled in? When she stood up in the pool, I think? I felt a tingling. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Phew! This took me an afternoon. Every time it's so laborious yet I'm so happy to do this on my weekends because you know, I don't meet real girls so might as well read about their bodies. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay I'm done lol let me go wire my ethernet cable because damn has it been slow doing this review but I gotta be done with this book in order to get it out so <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> (haha) alright I should wrap up. Oh yeah happy birthday <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/5250/Rina_Hidaka target=_blank>Hidaka Rina</a> haha sorry for reviewing not your photobook but not like you have any before you got married to Walter- Dude, how is he getting all the chicks? Haha it's ok I can lose to <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/33995/ target=_blank>Uchida Yuuma</a> I never won anyways and I doubt I will ever but I guess I can score in signed photobooks...?</div></div><div><br></div><div>And yes, Moeshi saying my real name on a Pyxis livestream last year on my birthday when I turned 30 was better than ALL of this. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>MOE~!!</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. And since I was so much of a fan (hehe), I went ahead and bought the accompanying Shupure Weekly magazine that was out a few days before the photobook release, see the final few paragraphs of the review. I can't share anything because I want you to buy it too, but I'll talk about the documentary-like interview she had in it (with my comments in brackets):</div><div><ul style=text-align:left><li>For reference, they did concept thinking and planned for this when she was 28, released this when she was 29, and it was intended to be done as her final photobook before she turns 30. (Fingers crossed, people haha) (But that's always good, means this will be a treasure) She tried her best to bring in all her emotions and what she learnt over the years (I assume in modelling) and compensate for what was missing these 5 years or what she did for her early 20s.<li>When they raised the topic about the location of the shooting and stated the global stage, she immediately stated New Zealand as she has always wanted to go, so that decision wasn't hard.<li>She has always felt one with animals, so meeting the sheep and alpaca made her feel real at home.<li>She wanted to dress up like a sheep, so she tied her hair to have buns like mini rams and wore a crocheted outfit while still fitting into the gravure theme.<li>Her favourite scene was when she got to take a dip in the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/onsen target=_blank>hot springs</a> bath (in New Zealand?) (okay as in hot springs haha) of course being in a swimsuit (yeah normally you would do this naked-) and she said it warmed her heart as it was the best thing to do ever during the photo shoots.<li>She knew that the nerdy look with the glasses and beret would make her cute (and yes she is right) so they did it during one of the days of the photo shoot where it was coincidentally raining.<li>On days it wasn't, she still had to brave the harsh winds and cold weather (which can be assumed to be opposite to the North Hemisphere ie. they likely did this last summer) to take those photos by the river in the yellow bikini. (Again, kudos to all gravure models who had to do this at any time of the year as demanded)<li>She insisted on wearing the strawberry panties for the morning home scene, even the stylist knew it was <a href=https://jisho.org/search/dasai target=_blank>tacky</a>, but it's just such a classic she just wanted to recreate that feel. (She's right, got my neurons flying in different directions haha that full shot of her in this is WOOOOOOOWIE) (Haha)</ul></div><div>If you <em>do</em> want to buy it though, they aren't lying it's in there, the video is embed inside the digital book. It'll be annoying as you can't leave the browser to multitask, so you have been warned. But why would you not watch it attentively just like what I did? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggOvyn_K4aweJF_VQLhECQjtDSXpskwbqP6H-WkvnMajpBmDWwUHenFimDucLwsgGsbN9UnJL5TidguuNzqZINCaJrXWY0V8ldSFH3uM43r37DjKj7t1K520lEnhrrW4vRjsxDGP5VNDnYA4pkC765wZ-MNK7jtdDIhk99OKGtOcX0i7r6mWTyhmKUt04/s1600/PXL_20240615_105544829.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3072 data-original-width=4080 height=241 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggOvyn_K4aweJF_VQLhECQjtDSXpskwbqP6H-WkvnMajpBmDWwUHenFimDucLwsgGsbN9UnJL5TidguuNzqZINCaJrXWY0V8ldSFH3uM43r37DjKj7t1K520lEnhrrW4vRjsxDGP5VNDnYA4pkC765wZ-MNK7jtdDIhk99OKGtOcX0i7r6mWTyhmKUt04/s320/PXL_20240615_105544829.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Okay we can NOT keep another photobook we need to think of something before Kyari-san drops by- Ah.<br><span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></table><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEverydayLife"><span class="material-icons small-icons">nightlife</span>The Everyday Life</a><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheReview"><span class="material-icons small-icons">edit_note</span>The Review</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
