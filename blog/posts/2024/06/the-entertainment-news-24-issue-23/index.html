And this time around, I will move out of the comfort zone. No, I meant this blog. We are still into the tales of girls I like. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Bad news is man, I am SO STOKED stoked at the next season of my Fanfiction series since like, last month haha yeah I planned it all, I'm just gyrating here right now ready to write this every Saturday as usual in a couple of weeks, I have been revising the stories I wrote over the past year! So yeah, if you don't mind you can read it back, I maaaaay have tweaked some of them to not sound like I want to bang my married cousin or-</div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of marriage, heck, I'm just glad that people like Fuchigami Mai and happy birthday Tsuda Minami in their 30s are finding their true love. Gives me hope that I'll find mine at some point <span class=emoji title=🙏>*prays*</span> once I decide to change my lifestyle, for better or for worse.</div><div><br></div><div>I won't for now though besides changing the blog's domain name LMAO so yeah, more Anime and music I suppose! We are near the end of the season and I know next season will be more tame than this line-up so yay...?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki10><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Towa-chan you never get angry, do you?" You mean angry as in like Shiu-chan or...? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>I think Shintarou just wants to get spanked by Towa-chan because she got angry at him, prove me wrong. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where angels can't get angry haha ah hey (#TenshiTsuki10), let's do it ! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You know, make them angry. The fun stuff. Drama is too stale for a series that is a literal harem. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So firstly, about Towa-chan. She never gets angry. Well, so far into the series, and it's not like angels don't get mad just look at that brat of an angel lmao, but yeah, maybe Towa-chan is just such an angel I wished <strike>she landed on my balcony</strike> I had a balcony for her to land on. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways, not that, but if Towa-chan will ever get mad about something ever since she landed on Earth... probably has to do with Shintarou himself. Yep, you guessed it, purely just him hanging out with girls is enough to get her to rage, let alone what was Noel-chan doing to him at the cake shop though?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Don't worry, not as indecent as half the things they did at home, so we are good. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Come on, Noel-chan doesn't know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking of which, and probably also why we have NEVER talked about the girls hanging out together... we are finally doing it, and if you wondered why it took so long, we finally found the break in the linkage so far. That ice-cold snow woman, dude. As much as she is great at freezing the people around her lol, her cold demeanour also meant that she only recognizes Shintarou as her friend, which effectively made the others just side characters in their... friendship? Haha also said romance, then again is this friendship? I don't know, ask the others. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Because despite Noel-chan finding Shintarou for a movie date (hehe) but then ending up with the girls at the cinema, she still cannot get why she is doing ALL of this wrong by not going with her ACTUAL friend- Bro, I don't consider my buddies in Army friends but damn, doesn't hanging out with them from time to time even as obligation count as being friends? I mean, spending time together is what makes friendship last, right? Oh Noel-chan is concerned about how it doesn't even last? OOF haha ah hey, I wasn't the one telling the girls the truth about what she thinks about them so you can't blame me. Then again, it's also ironic to not see anyone, literally ANYONE not even Lilishka haha, that will see through Noel-chan's character and offer her some sweet friendship advice even if she wants to be all sincere and honest about it. You can have honest friendships, just pray that you can dunk on them and they don't get mad, that's how you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I speak from experience that's why I only have the one. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> All in all... I mean, I'm no relationship expert? But yeah, don't draw the line so hard, people. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> For Towa-chan, that means not worrying that he has friends outside of your circle even though you might be special just because, and that goes for Noel-chan too. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> But specifically for Noel-chan though... well, speak your heart out for once, won't ya? They will forgive you, in a world without anyone dunking on you now. Well, I say now, but you know, her childhood was kinda rough, so I'll forgive my past too. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Making friends is tough. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, we don't' have to do that next episode because it's your typical summer vacation showcase, so HELL YEAH GET YOUR BEACHES READY- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah we'll figure it out next week haha WOOOO WEEEEE <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "Towa-chan isn't an angel because she is literally one, she is an angel because she is above a literal one."

Nah, they are just extending the film roll. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In the new episode where we are still trying to convince Sade to turn lol whatever that may mean (#ShinigamiBocchan33), WE HAVE WAITED 33 EPISODES FOR THIS ACTION LETS F**KING GOOOOOO haha alright me calm down. So, not going to spoil too much as in I will spoil everything here so watch first before you even read the next sentence, because damn I like how reconciling we are in this whole episode alone. I gotta say I rather expected the Bocchan has to crawl to Sade to convince her of stuff she will never think he can do even better than Victor but she is starting to change her mind, and I think in essence just through Bocchan, they are trying to prove that they can change Sade as long as they believe in Bocchan and his persistence - and that Sade read his mind too - in being friends with her. I mean, probably not along the lines of going to the movies and stuff lol hey <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/56838/One_Room_Hiatari_Futsuu_Tenshi-tsuki target=_blank>Anime "Tenshi Tsuki"</a> this week, but you know, the first thing friends do is... get into fights with each other? HELL YEAH LETS DO THIS lol so instead, let's talk about what action we have seen so far. So far... very impressive I am SO GLAD another season of Anime "BLEACH" final story arc isn't here to ruin this lmao also me not watching any action series is helping out here. Because it's just Cuff just being annoying to Sade because her mind has been trained by Ichi-sensei to deal with a witch who can read minds and so far it's working otherwise Cuff will lose in an instant lmao. Other than her though, everyone else present for the second wave of confrontation which includes the teachers and Daleth who is more resolved to fight her sister after what she made past her do to her now lover <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, so shout out to everyone else who has been leading this to a ceasefire more than a double-side annihilation. But hey, not like convincing past Daleth to not fight and trying to get on Sade's nerves until she chose not to break, will be helping out in this whole situation, but I would nonetheless argue that the argument so far has been very swift yet influential on Sade and her thoughts right about now. Yeah, she had to smoke bong to calm herself down, I think this is working. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways haha, really makes you wonder if an eventuality will happen where Sade either goes berserk or...? Yeah, or what? I can't imagine what is going forward if the gang's argument so far has been more solid than Sade's love for Victor BOOM GOTTEM haha please don't come to the current timeline to kill me, thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... damn, what an episode. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, I have been saying that every episode so far in this supposed final season, but heck, this time around it came with tears <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, so I think the magic is working. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What magic? Well, friendship, apparently. Yeah, "the friends we made along the way". Maybe that's the real magic. And as if Sade will ever understand that. I don't know, maybe she's a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/deredere target=_blank>dere</a> herself too? Oh boy that can only mean one thing, we will have to break her. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> This is going to be fun, guys. Maybe get yourself prepared more than Zain and Walter, would ya? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; "(Bocchan) gave me (Nico) the possibility of being friends with you (Sade)."

Yeah, remember that dude? He was hanging out with I forgot her name let me look... Kimishima haha I'm sorry <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/10765/Ai_Kayano target=_blank>Kayanon</a>. Yeah, about how they coincidentally met each other after sort of a quibble at Eden Hall. Now they are somewhat friends hanging out talking about their troubles when suddenly, Hayase had to move on in life. No, not the wife, no. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As in, he had to work overseas because he got promoted, dude! Best part is, it appears that he was fully convinced on this too, being the only one capable of such a job *shakes head* haha do you even know the corporate world bro, and thought this was his best move. Turns out, going to Sasakura <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> Kitahara's bar was a better move, because as much as Kitahara sees RIGHT through this idiot and thinking he should just not give a damn about a woman in his life just like he did before with his dead wife *OOF*, he also can see he is hesitant about his move. As such he offers some advice in a matter of dice rolling. And the senpai is right, because sometimes all you need is <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%B0%8F%E3%81%95%E3%81%AA%E5%8B%87%E6%B0%97/1537905172?i=1537905179&amp;l=en-US">"a little confidence"</a>, shout out to Spira Spica. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Like, I'll give an example. It's an obligation. You can reject it last minute, but you have to do it eventually. No consequences whatsoever. Would you do it now or later? Don't think that's how school homework works but <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> not that, just a thing in life. You already know the answer. My answer yesterday morning was a yes, whether I liked it or not. And that's one less of the same task to do. Same with Hayase here. He's lost his partner RIP. Some woman he met also had the same fate. Maybe they can...? No, no banging, please, have some decency. As in, keep them company. And despite it being the obvious choice it's hard to find a better person to talk to in life trust me I have a sis who doesn't care and a bro who forced himself into me LMAO oops. Because in life, if you know the outcome, the choice is easy. Problem is always when you have no idea of the outcome. Hey, just look at me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> For Hayase's case, even if the dices were on the floor six inches down (I am SO sorry I will stop making dead people jokes) and not stacked up high, he would have known what to do. I know right, Chen did it better than this bloke. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Moving on, I rather take that as bulk of the episode but it's worth mentioning about two other things. Firstly, about Eden Hall's last bartender. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I gotta say now that I think about it, that my life very much resembles Sasakura Ryuu. I might end up having to be forced to change my job in order to move on with life, or else I will be content of who I am. Hey, not going to advocate on Sasakura's thoughts, but heck, I might as well be. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> He might still be stuck at that, and it really doesn't matter because SAME dude, and that's probably what the owner of the establishment thought too until you have a jerk not even friend like Kurushima (BRO <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kurushii target=_blank>suffering</a> is in his name, dude), but if that means he has to follow the headwind (shout out to Kawakami) in order to stay relevant in the industry... I'm afraid he will have to do so. Not like the Chairman will understand him better than his granddaughter, and THIS is something I think we should talk about to conclude this episode to be honest. No, not Sasakura crying we can make him happy. We can have someone be concerned of him for once. You know, Miwa-san being so nice to him despite no one else giving a damn. Also, somehow this is going to end up as a romance plot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Somehow, Kurushima will be convinced by her granddaughter to leave Sasakura alone? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay maybe not that, but all in all... I think this episode got its point across. That Sasakura is so alone sometimes, he could use some advice. Not the one that the Chairman is shoving down his throat lmao, and not like his master who is in hospital right now will give him any, and not like the senpai Kitahara will be nice enough to not make his own buddy want to kill himself lol I'm also sorry for suicide jokes... But yeah, the decision can still be on him. I don't like the idea that he may have to downplay himself in order for him to get kicked of his new job, but uh, Hayase will be able to do it from the looks of it so why not you? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> We shall see the fate of them next week I guess, we are near the end soon.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRSRYVJx1R4Ataca-CgoVaQIakYOwvgOv5qCPUq7OHiZZ9lekQfHzd67_AraZpnA6RY7tg0Hl9KhyFxNw7bLtCg06fmGt8G66H7JCqvX2NdHc0i7gl-3wWH5mRmUuEfUZZrdshW13PSnyHVoEdGPrIoT2-i-psU-nRiHlAWM4Ujtx_7w30shHdWoq4oHI/s320/kaminoglass10_sasakura3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is not going to lie, me throughout this episode</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnpTDuCp-IEIjapYp0nQHPv2EjCgG9YlH6p3SGpxkJ58Fw01AINZ4bILFCM7zIIfiEJSSwVWSt0kvRYXBpC2qJlNr2fpvE9uLBBeFXidzWeq8RRj9eHpiJWj3eCnmt9XGCU2ej9Qc3wc-XGl5Ba-DE3z4m9s-PjDGYXVyZuIBgQyoGNyVHt-5mccas4So/s320/kaminoglass10_A1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>A1<br>- Dry Gin<br>- Orange Curacao<br>Lemon Juice</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKvrGdblyj1MSbB9B3CG_KSzkxrcNJW-V28ym7nlcixAivT7XrokyxDcUbrMT16Vurnl-SsV_UhWu_G9HxBt5OHHhLQ8iv1FFhkOfQOA2qne7-HjX9a0I3jvuI5eoBADXAUB5MvXKJ3hMrPUXo0aFDSEPSn0zfATtX6TTdGpYK2XcvzN8wL7fO-HgzchQ/s320/kaminoglass10_boilermaker.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Boiler Maker<br>- Bourbon Whiskey<br>- Beer</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I'm like why is the name Ryan so familiar I- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Hey, if you haven't been watching the series, then you will be surprised at what's going on now in this new story arc. Like, in which incident Ciel is investigating NOT involve this new episode <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> (#KuroshitsujiSchool09) where the headmaster's mind (get it, mastermind) all along is run by, you guessed it spoiler alert you have been warned, it's Undertaker, yeah, don't be too surprised. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But still, his story is less important when you already knew the timeline, so let's briefly talk about that first. So, story goes that Undertaker is? He WAS an aide of the Phantomhive family, offering valuable advice to the people who aren't alive, to speak, shout out to Madame Red and how we knew of Grell. Since then, we knew Undertaker was on our side despite Ciel ending up getting a demon on the same side as the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> for some reason. We will hit on that in a moment, but suffice it to say it seems that the Aurora Society as seen in that ship Campania in that one movie in case you haven't watched it was awesome btw has somehow convinced Undertaker to its operation in order to experiment how to manipulate a force of undead, and as we have learnt, seemingly going full on opposite direction against the ideas of live and death as how the world has been governed so far. I mean, we do not know of God itself in this Anime world, but that doesn't mean we don't know who the God of Weston College has been so far. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> So speaking of, we know Derrick is long dead that's not too surprising if you think about it, he has been seriously used in experimentation to see if he can still smell tea as an undead lol, but more importantly, is how he became as so. Turns out, the P4 killed him. *yikes* So, this is the part that is new, and somehow they are in part of as a conspiracy themselves, and it's no wonder Greenhill was willing to take that hit from not Derrick. Because damn, was Derrick such a wonderful gentleman in school. He didn't have any weird intentions of taking down the P4 by any means, not like anyone can take over the prefect roles they all so fought to achieve, I'll give them that. But seeing that a bullying incident has been rampant and suspects have never been found, it's no wonder why Derrick is so on it likely just to cover its truth. Interestingly, someone leaked a poem to the prefects so let them know independently about its clues, and well well who do we have here. And after that it's obvious what happened, Greenhill was the only one who managed to grab on to Derrick the culprit, and in an effort to confront him... We just did the cricket bat thing but hit <em>juuuuust</em> a little harder than what we did to Ciel. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> And they thought Lord "Ciel" Phantomhive was a nasty character just having a demon by his side, huh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>All in all though, if you hate storytelling because they have toned that down so far... you are not alone. But still, it is crucial to explain to people who have yet no f**king idea of what is happening thus far apart from the lore in Weston itself. Still, if you ignored the Derrick running slow-motion animation lol my eyes hurt from seeing that TWICE, it's all coming together. I mean, we won't be disciplining the prefects the school might need a makeover soon and that's not before we had to deal with Undertaker himself which, you might have known, is sitting at the other end of the table. What you might not have known though, is- I think we will leave that for the couple of episodes that are left. I'll write a cryptic poem to tell you guys when in the story I read to in the source material, I assure you.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTQ2xRLKM-4vfZKb-WBCWg-bdPHBptvUDA-TRddBqZ9q0TjQ9CZXp0WxfE_LFjS_BcOtpgyaGvr-nNfyzlUWcAHTAd2ASM29Q1UrXsNTTQJBT3-CIzyqfpahgOtdtIdF87Bw6YDlslWQGErKZqDafOvpFAaSfTJTnRIZcCN3inOw5oMXIzNBLLUB7zXI4/s320/kuroshitsujischool09_undertaker1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Undertaker has NEVER looked this cool-<br>(Well, if you disregard the rest of the series lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimVBzkyhYB38cc1Fmqv-mGR63JenCUmaXovEzllYhU86S3aInVCW4EQbxHhyHqXPlkXosGzImZH62aRNrZvvD8GYoqylaZCppXvcL7_gIKg-MJ-Z8ysX-Hc205yDa2SQrAcdugwM6rH7wdAR0astsixrV4j8lo7sD3SaWUxSIPT7JkzfJzQzWJVspoptg/s320/kuroshitsujischool09_P43.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is just SO, so gay haha<br>(Yeah, remember their promise to protect the students? *yikes*)</table></div></div><div>P.S.
