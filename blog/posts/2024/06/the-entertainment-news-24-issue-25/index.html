Well, for the last time apparently.</div><div><br></div><div>Because this will be the start of the end of the Anime season with once again a record-breaking number of (maybe regretful) choices which could've taken another turn but hey, at least the best thing about this is <strike>all the friends we made along the way</strike> panties. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I still cannot forget about <strike>Noel-chan</strike> Moeshi's photobook dude, it's just too good it's making me catch colds left and right. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Maybe I should go see a doctor. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Well, not to fret on that just yet, we got a season to conclude starting this week! And then maybe we'll talk about songs because those are rad too. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki12><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"To be honest, we don't know what will show up." Online campaigns be like <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div></blockquote><div>Oh, we summoning demons now? That's just Shintarou- In this final episode of a great series that really is my personal fav this season don't tell anyone else hehe (#TenshiTsuki12), if the demon is the friends we made along the way, then this show has delivered. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> For on this conclusion episode of the series of course don't expect too much on this, but yeah, we had to do whatever Lilishka wants to do on a whim which she forgot last week, and then wrap up with some not couple moments. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> For the former though, I'm just more surprised than amused that they actually didn't just make the wind just be wind and that's it because that'll be quite a bummer but instead actually ended up summoning Shiu-chan (LMAO) for like, a moment haha so yeah, no more of this nonsense, thanks. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Because come on, it's still better to relive the initial moments where Shintarou only hangs out with the one angel he came to know after all this time. And milk. And underwear. And whenever we are getting our feet wet. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But what Towa-chan might not know is that, because Shintarou felt bad about enjoying her good food and cleaning the house not to forget all the service he got to see probably way more than we have haha ah hey, he just paid for her to dress up and go visit the Tokyo Skytree which I must say, is a very boyfriend thing to do so kudos to him for making this date a good one. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You think we need to explain this to the passers-by on their relationship? Towa-chan doesn't even know what <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hanabi target=_blank>fireworks</a> even means, dude! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, till the end, the author still remembered to make specific jokes here and there like an angel telling a human to get scared but seriously you think Towa-chan can save all the humans on board if the tower were to collapse? No way, right? She gotta go back and record her TV shows first. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways coming back, emotional moments all around just for the round-up at the end, many people we met along the way which I would argue are not human but eerily like one haha looking at you Lilishka, so yeah, we will take those even if they don't make much sense. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all... I say I'm still glad to see such stereotypical of a slice-of-life romance series still being made in an industry full of &lt;insert any genre that kids are hooked into here> Anime haha looking at you you f**k, and boy is this overall package such a good one I am so glad to have stumbled onto it. Yeah, just like how lucky Towa-chan has been so stumble into a nice person on her first encounter. No, not the one who wanted to bring her into a hotel, no. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> There is much pureness to enjoy here even without the mention of an angel. We didn't go too far into Tsumugi's jealousy which is fine she is rather timid anyways with some shame I would love to be her bf hehe, We didn't have too much <a href=https://jisho.org/search/otaku target=_blank>otaku</a> dump just in case Noel-chan wants to introduce me to another genre lol I highly doubt so because with her expectations of reality extrapolated from Anime it feels like she is into the girls love genre more than me LMAO bro I just started with the one this season, give me more time. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> We didn't also bother too much about Lilishka which isn't a bad thing because getting into her whims is fine and all not until I see holes on my nape lol please don't. And we received a late arrival of a kappa from Hisui-chan so let's not say too much about her lest she drowns me in one of her family abode's lakes or something. Yeah, or gets her maids to sumo wrestle me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all content-packed yet funny to watch, thanks for the fanservice I will remember the first few episodes of this for years to come haha, and stop asking which girl I like most- <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8ip6K7Pymf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target=_blank>Oonishi Saori</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> </div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht06AfaPaMjAHbnpPLI8Uhq8Wuwu22gGbDZKZJsH8iT0J_CEoDEhe7YC3M3SERFt3WMR10KbIH94Lk9N_WYh2TZv1CvuVHfEeybmvNKoIixJRv5vIsZKJ0sLOsthGgAX6O5LJMWpCpKA3fcxla45MDC8q5Y5dWewZx010IidRH6tusw6GYTGMUX47Y9KU/s320/tenshitsuki12_towa09.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How this series started<br>(<a href=https://jisho.org/search/kawaii target=_blank>Kawaii</a>~!!)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUbODL3CvK9BWpdSZ8GI4ZE1AHmkn-ertJFFhn6q99HV7xR8Xy98N18X9H2NLC04rzc1qF5K_VKpd-FdoF_4AkO5EVChIfuStGKLGC1y6DQtVkYbqRFhDkFACVYHrKx0MiuThl1JO3wAIu_uGmTUXEdCw9Tolv-aKbNkdANkBWO0SzIgQiS8Occ9oKyI4/s320/tenshitsuki12_couple4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>How this series concluded<br>(LAME haha)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Or else we may ACTUALLY have to kill you- In this new episode of we can touch the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>god of death</a> now lol let's go (#ShinigamiBocchan35), I HAVE WAITED ACTUAL YEARS FOR THIS!!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah wait till you watch Bocchan touch Alice and we have an upcoming funeral awaiting for us- Yeah using Sharon's coffin, dude!! Haha I'm so glad I wasn't on that timeline. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What we DO get though, is plenty of hugs, no kisses unfortunately haha I know right, and plenty of handshakes. Let's talk all about them. Oh we are not going to talk about Sade fighting her magic, no one cares. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So firstly, about breaking the curses. Nico got old, very old. Old enough for make Ichi cry for the first time we've seen her, and likely with a face wrinkled enough we can't show on television lol they didn't draw him in huh didn't know Ethan Winters is a magician in his past life lmao that's a Resident Evil series joke. So yeah, that's that, and likely without a fight with Sade means also the magic school will be populated with all the people who have died with the now not villain, so that's good, we saved lives. For Bocchan though we are also saving lives, because we prevented the touch of death to happen to anyone he can touch now. Literally, anyone. The red rose won't wilt now. Of course Alice gets first dub and I'm super jealous because you now, rack. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright I'm sorry if you haven't seen this for yourself because please do I didn't make that joke when I was <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> crying away anyways, and so to the many other people he met when he went back, even his sister Viola-chan welcomed him back with a hug. Jealous. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I like the suggestion of telling Victor the good news and letting Sade see her first love once again, being so positive about it, you know, rather sus but hey I guess people can change so we will give the benefit of doubt. But what I have to doubt is Victor's... somewhat unfriendly signal to Alice and Rob that Bocchan will be moving on since his curse is lifted. Yeah, Victor? If you didn't say the last part about making choices, especially to Alice? Then it wouldn't have been cruel. We know the first half part about not being together because nobility, the mom warned us already. Well, the other guys in the family, but still. And in a twist of fate, of course OF COURSE Alice chose to leave in secret, what else she can do? Tell the mom they want to be together? Haha alright me, relax. But really, because Alice thinks this farewell is as easy as the farewell dead Victor and his wife have given to all the people he met so far on his world tour? BRUH. Well, that's not how that works Alice isn't a bro so she won't get, but seriously though, and THAT IS WHY you don't get Bocchan as well as we do. Like, right? You showed Bocchan the world when the world rejected him, and now you want to leave? Who is going to show him the world again now? That is so not PogChamp, dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Sure, things can change, friends can fade, but love is forever. I speak from Anime experience. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh come on, you guys can just f**k everything else, even Victor the old man said it. But serious talk though, <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> WHAT A CONCLUSION!!! <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> You gotta let me wipe my tears too mine is as much as the couple now haha <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> ALRIGHT-EY so in conclusion haha we aren't even at the final episode yet that's tonight if you watch on Japan simulcast we will cover that next week, but yeah, everything this episode is going so well until you realize how much of a chad Alice is NOT being here, but hey, I suppose we have waited three seasons of this almost 3 years of content for this part, I cannot praise this enough. The moments, the hits, yeah sure the jokes in between because or else how you gonna explain the current Sade haha, they all landed perfectly in place. Besides the betrayal haha Alice how could you. Still, great episode I wouldn't have expected better, and I'm glad things were as they are. So yeah, congrats Walter, you can be the family head AND have a human partner once Daleth turns human... which is likely what will happen so yay, the best ending ever! I know right, I wanted a Sade decades later betrayal but that might be too much for this series. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh boy, will we get everything we wanted at the end? Or is Viola going to propose to old man Nico now? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We shall see it till the end even if it means running to the end of the train, folks.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgE5l5O7E5G0Pw26-HL9fbZbWeHtfRXlMqAat-wln7EqvHLzXUmWOIduNAZYoIGWEW3Acf_W0ocVKx42lfsxEdMq5kbUIFrKrLANBcl0D7K9ooMNac2JSqkG1qwVFHfprWs8Zyzxq7v4vhIvlmvZ6jKfcyJTPSJjwS3v_tlBuftXGAIH9RnpQqvhpl57DI/s320/shinigamibocchan35_magic.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Ever seen magic this cute?<br>You haven't watched this series hehe</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7DyaP7nRRABnYzSnLI-0MQib1IpRaSj8N-LNK_DiFyEPMjgvaYTYrTukhdoQ5GGYvN5HFtavsu6pZ8IWIPu2IUMVt6a-YMO-mJO8EiL77uvyBtpwzp9_1SsfJC8VEcOCR7dERXaQEXH2lV0orh7FGLhEpHoF4SRHhQ0lFH5FPDINpsGEf0FG6t1cNniA/s320/shinigamibocchan35_gang6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Trust me when I say small things matter because I noticed <strike>Viola</strike> Philips over on the left<br>(I got you bro, I gotcha)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

LMAO this old man with the teen talk</div></blockquote><div>Yeah, the Chairman Kurushima has done everything. And I think Sasakura will take the bait, but it's not because he wants to. In this final episode of a series that turned from respect to a joke haha ah hey (#Bartender12), they at least tried to re-enact the scenarios again, I'll give them that. It's not the same, but that's not the point. Even now, we have problems dealing with whether Sasakura wants to join the hotel. Well spoiler alert he did, but not without resistance. (I'm not going to talk about that depressed author by the way, we know he's voiced by the one the only <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/212/Daisuke_Ono target=_blank>Ono-D</a> hehe) (Please I am watching <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/55855/Kuroshitsuji__Kishuku_Gakkou-hen target=_blank>Anime "Kuroshitsuji"</a> this season you think I won't get his voice??) In general, Sasakura mentioned that he doesn't really mind being in another bar, he is not mad about Chairman here trying to force him his way, and neither is he regretful of what he saw in his mentor today that he disliked his current job because he would never. His only concern of building such a spectacular bar over the years and taking in a meagre salary (OOF) is that, as much as we can move everything including the counter top and the drinks to make it even the bartender himself, it is really hard to bring over the moments and memories people have spent in here, in order for him to be deemed the God of Glass. Even till the end, he is still serving drinks and touching hearts, preventing people from committing suicide even. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways haha <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> but really though, making people come back for another drink and NOT thinking they walked into the wrong place must be the weirdest thing that would happen for such a transition. As such, Sasakura's only request to working in the hotel was to bring its name there. So his reputation stays intact, and he is able to work for the hotel. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Of course on sacrifice, he has to pretend to play <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kyacchibo-ru target=_blank>catch ball</a> with his new daddy (lmao) to pass this off and hopefully get a pay raise so he can not just read books borrowed from the library on his days of and instead <strike>get a girlfriend</strike> <strike>get drunk</strike> play gacha games all day haha every single one has its meaning mind you, and then pray that all his customers will make their way here someday. Okay maybe not so accessible anymore since it's not on the streets, but hey, people online will know where it is. THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH WE COVERED ALL OUR BASES lol say he doesn't care anymore, dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And that's it! Hey, I may have a lot of complaints just as I walked into the bar getting dunked on by a totally different person I see at this bar called Edenhall, I may have hated the way it presented itself to me even going against my expectations, but once I take a drink of the God of Glass... It all changes. I think this is a good way of describing this series in general especially with respect to the original series that was made 18 years ago. Because seriously, I would recommend this even if you have any little interest in the world of cocktails, just like me even if I don't drink alcohol. You will fancy the counter top and the handsome bartender (haha ah hey) as much as I will, and appreciate the story behind every drink and everyone who drank them. But if you are here expecting this to have a sequel, expecting this to see epic moments to compare to your favourite Anime series, then you might as well go home and make your Nikolaschka. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So yeah, this still holds up as Edenhall's alternate reputation, but I would say, if you want more impact and more of those feels of the stories behind the drinks more than the lore that is presented to Sasakura Ryuu himself or whoever Chen is haha, then give the original series a go. Either way, it's a great way to talk about the emotions of cocktails, and I'm still glad I took on this journey even after all these years ago. Yes, it was the theme songs that ruined this. We listening to crappy hotel music now, I missed the days where I hum my own songs and cry to Natural High's melodies hehe alright me stop acting as old as Chairman Kurushima here</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhStoLuVE05s93re5AaMggjA4fi8BPmdrac37UF-LxOuxjmXH8SieKmufBwg0KkqcWe0ir-GvmSoLeJcK2OofvRcyrOInK3jB4irmgGa2owAcVJS6pxpaZCshVYV5O6cTbaIPUkZXPieNZSar68OZKz8XPmoAVRNX3qbFJwjhq4n9ihhF02Dt-bc63DVw8/s320/kaminoglass12_kuzuhara.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Remember: This is not Mister Perfect...</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMqyWm70vaE__Yr6FPzL8KsLX3GodUVv_MpqVV_ZNMGiYxlqn13mqjCNN_vm5BpeXa2OqxKotGuANG8QKXXsarUqdT4NfmH4FWvXJ0cqDCMrVfdW_3LQJwIq9xT6oQX165hEq9bvTB2KDVOK9DHQMyTVWM-01eKWV4L7I7nexBtioqdgxX_koNiGYYhvw/s320/kaminoglass12_kurosawa5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>... this is Mister Perfect.<br><span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRo5FyPg2Cgu13lKpks6Hn0FIn_Pee-XAUtE2BR0TsBQd8WDRJ1Ke5MG4MXr0VzgIp0bOsFqTT_WIOweyQXMwyNetbxvN4vz9G-3vfGWmwGOegyl6TegzbFpAtrPu3FdeNk0UCM20BfJhqEqDl98oW8xYZuLau7OioUARaOqXz2g9-1euUkQzyysIQU1E/s320/kaminoglass12_sledgehammer.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>(For the last time)<br>Sledgehammer<br>- Vodka<br>- Lime juice<br>- Orange juice</table></div></div><div>P.S.

OH NO AGNI F**K OFF haha</div></blockquote><div>Wow it is indeed rather cringe to not see intro recaps in this week's Anime, so weird. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Which is good because in this final episode of the end of a story arc here (#KuroshitsujiSchool11), uh... this is very tame to be honest. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> We were still bullying teens a couple of episodes ago- ANYWAYS haha, let's talk about everything else we may have left out of the arc. Well, Agni. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay not Agni because who cares haha he's just annoying and thank goodness he didn't appear in the story arc itself but DAMN Souma has some luck of the Indians he didn't expect to have against the devil. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Meanwhile, we are blessed with a little more extra stuff to wrap the season but I'm sure most of this is in the source material so let's go through them. Meirin got some glasses so she can see Sebastian more clearly haha she's a sniper btw, Finnian got a new hat but not until we decorated Ciel's head with a dozen more lol, Snake got a bag for his buddies and we are glad we aren't chased out of the store by the presence of them haha pls bro, and Baldroy got a bunch of sweets as consolation. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Bro, we can't give him a gun, he's just a chef. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But more importantly, Sebastian requested to go to the government offices to find out, interestingly, the lockets on Undertaker in which they grabbed whilst fighting on the Campania, if you would recall from not this story arc, that movie. Surprisingly, one of them is Ciel's grandmother, with a strand of her hair as one of his seven lockets. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> GRANDPA IS THAT YOU?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, not going to spoil anything as I have never so far because of my terrible memories lol who screwed up my Cinematic Records, but yeah, we will come to know of this relation a little more, a little later. No, not the grandpa thing haha. BUT, there is a reason why they are related, say Undertaker and the Phantomhives, and we might not be far off the truth. <span class=emoji title=🤫>*sshh*</span> Haha we aren't that far yet to know that truth, don't worry about it. On the other hand, we might as well worry about the lack of sales for the new Funtom perfume line and thanks to Sebastian helping the lady out at her new opera performance with a surprise unicorn appearance lmao, all's well is well. Again, marketing is as important as the product itself, though in recent years I would argue that has been leaning towards less of the product and- ALL IN ALL haha this is a wonderful series, and I will not explain any further. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Like no, don't ask me what happened to those two at the end there, they didn't listen to the witch's advice, and they get what they deserved. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> That's all I'm hinting though as far as I recall Queen Victoria has a cousin in Germany if I'm not wrong, and we will find out what has been going on there soon enough. Without a date though, so that's kinda concerning. Well, guess I gotta live long enough to watch it! Hehe see you guys then, and I PROMISE YOU, this next arc will be more interesting than cricket. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipH14AWcN3gbuU3CrwIunbAHAknEmgtEx3g_nt6c4zvxHwi5gxJbtlsiQ8_EZYY7XrYBM8Q8FTfpvQ3_g4oyt1fIEm5jQr4hWGKJ5l-_GvHVgJ5oq4HI7LeZdfhYVfJZZxY5mUcwekLtqz53YzOTho8yjzXdLlgeCi0be6JzQ5ZF70_Vb1IxE0vLPaFjQ/s320/kuroshitsujischool11_sebastian7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I like about this series<br>(The jokes haha demon-powered carriage, anyone?)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaATBhp9PGAqX8tUTq4lglX6osVvFdwFiX4ZRyrVuv4g3vBTHHTws8ZbmqFImUgT73sCNmIpyliN1eMWicXFLe4DPJWVgH-eEnAl7DmiHg8IVAgfWw5wHzHPP5IwPafv6ZfHvEX0FDYJC4NWpKIl7WJPuojfdi7a7sqcz08TJI46LBk3s6fwEr7ygHofU/s320/kuroshitsujischool11_irene5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I like about this series<br>(Lucky unicorn hehe)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqU3BlznCPq2zW7t7DThOfH5dQAjXulbH6tVDnwEQ5q9EhgObn5xifxK1bvwLecNDgjQnNVze2TrdtOFPhyphenhyphenEUGdcdoIU8_LBVRwlj0zSmfeqQdddVhQT0Cf59ic9YT1thsBEn4YuBcHHD0GobLYTv6SyU4hHBHNamWaQe_0cpPTjEqqoUSPLk2JurNGQI/s320/kuroshitsujischool11_tea.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I like about this series<br>(How is this tea pouring still blowing my mind??)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

So instead we're going to FUSE those two bands together!!! Yeah, make friends at a party LET'S GO- Wait, we not doing that? Welp what even is friendship. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Yo Miki-chan what did you even do to these girls. So, let's talk about what happened. It was a mess. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Smack cake in someone's face of a mess. Shiho IMMEDIATELY walked out on everyone when she found out that she has to taste test stuff with her most hated rival band who is trying to pit them in the upcoming school festival. And we don't even know if the food taste good, dude! You want to make peace like that, Himari-chan?? Haha alright as much as I feel bad for Himari here, we now it's a mostly Shiho problem that even just on the surface, she refuses to tell anyone else about why she left SSGIRLS even though we told her everything. Like, Yori is going out with Himari kind of thing. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And as such, Shiho thought it'll be a great idea to get Himari on their side as their manager? Damn. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> So alright, if the showdown is on, and Laureley wins, and then according to Shiho later that Himari-chan gets to make a request, then won't she ask them to befriend each other?? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, 200 IQ brains here, this Shiho. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Whatever she is intending to do though, is really ambivalent to all of us including the SSGIRLS members, but that isn't stopping them from making sure they can win, even if it's writing new songs from our resident composer Yori-senpai over here. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> I mean, between Laureley focusing on their skills and SSGIRLS trying to win on novelty hopefully making the audience fawn over them emotionally then build the hype... Like, I don't even know which side losing will make of a better drama plot. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But I do know one thing though: We just need to keep proving to Shiho that everything she does to spike this is totally not working, and we just need to make sure she gets this. But oh sh*t what is this, Himari-chan asking more questions about Shiho's band and past already? Bro, like for starters, you think Shiho has backup when she left SSGIRLS a year ago? Like yeah hey I have friends I'll find 2 more who thinks like me and we form a band HAHAHAHA don't joke with me Himari. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> And so, we might be on a journey unexpected from Himari's expectations... But I mean, how dark can this get, really? In comparison Laureley's song for the ending theme song this week is more dark, dude. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, HIT ME dude, I've watched a decade and half of Anime, and if you girls aren't killing each other physically lol, I have no worries. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Just like Yori-senpai has no worries when asked about her girl joining the rival band as their manager- No really though, I am right on the surface. Yori is Yori's problem, that I can't fix. But CLEARLY Shiho intends to influence her by effectively making her their ally, but that's just not how this works. Well, as far as we know Himari-chan won't be this easily swayed. By anything, really. As her positivity shows so far, her attitude will go further than any of these two bands' future, take my word for it. Hey, let's find out about Laureley's story... sometime soon lol they didn't drop a release date and we know it's not next week so, uh... see you next season then? Haha hey I like this series' drama so far but can the production not have its <em>own</em> drama, dude?? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9Q7ZP7xYHFdiJyfeX7BphCq-tDPROVgwPylgL0zSceEdNlVuy0JDHa3mq0ZiPsrfRmU5Aj0q60y5fY_2ZD2xcctxMgmaCbOVHkQvXuWVdX5d8f2ZjpDQWfh_L0qHaa44TM-S-CyHnddjOU9A3cwbXaMZI0frdzpg9nCdlBjCWghEnUhYEjLRnfCefym8/s320/sasakoi09_friends2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>EXPECTATION<br>(Best friends forever, what a great place to be)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDmchUUAZXxAOnj9_rWckpHEP06dtfltec9uahmZ7VsaLaQF8kBqTQTjxreY5K2fw5Ed-fhgH-F6Izia1Kt3jfqIVwyXEuMwrNts3nr7iGlzmQY5xpYr6xj0GxuYzH8biLGJydJd9gcnOTE1njdxEXG1XRlkPcXbiVT_HJvFsOGVg2JB23Gub26jyG5HM/s320/sasakoi09_rivals3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>REALITY<br>(When hate is involved... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Yeah Shiho is getting jealous here BOOM GOTTEM haha "You are bothered about it though" Haha true but Yori isn't worried the way you think, Aki. </div><div><br></div><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote><div>This week's new releases are as mainstream as they can be, so maybe let me show you the way how much I like or want to like these artists instead of whatever Anime idol TRASH there is polluting my watchlist. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sensitive-sketch/1747505718?l=en-US" target=_blank>Scenarioart's new mini-album</a></b> for their 15th anniversary isn't too bad at all and getting those songs with melodies I didn't like out the way, I still ended giving half the release and got <a href=https://x.com/aozakish/status/1803337274136154309 target=_blank>super hooked into one of them</a> for no reason even though this isn't that great compared to their album 2 years ago, to be frank. Moving on haha, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/unspoiled/1747839682?l=en-US" target=_blank>Kroi's new album</a></b> is also not that impressive but this is expected, but what I did not expect is to like a new album song AND like <a href=https://x.com/aozakish/status/1803236248691286178 target=_blank>the title song from their 2nd single</a> despite my criticisms of it half a year ago. Goes to show one needs the mood to listen to songs, I cannot explain more. Also this week in a summary: mainstream is NOT them, and that's what makes them different. That's... the joke I want to make. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><a href=https://x.com/sphere_PS/status/1802628180827648087 target=_blank>Idol group sphere is hiring extras to cast in their upcoming music video</a></b> (lol had to define the category lest people think I'm talking about a shape) and as much as that sounds awesome I'm pretty sure fans will be delighted to take on an acting role which is basically being background scenery. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href=https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1802687891988152547 target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina is releasing her 3rd album live audio on digital</a></b> for four weeks as she did the last time just because they are rad, did use a livestream to discuss the titles like before just this time I wasn't watching it lmao, so maybe we can start listening to them <a href=https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1802687643852976181 target=_blank>starting next week</a> if you are keen. <b><a href=https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1803080238437462514 target=_blank>Ikimonogakari teased their new song</a></b> for Anime next season and it isn't bad at all to be frank much better than the previous one so I might just listen to it, maybe watch the Anime? I don't know, not that keen on rice-planting anyways. Ironically, what's more interesting is their <a href=https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1803276521215500582 target=_blank>maiden overseas performance in Macau</a> (somehow they decided to gain international fame lol) so we know who's behind the restriction now. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I just noticed <b><a href=https://x.com/wodofficial7/status/1803397329292239338 target=_blank>w.o.d.'s new music video</a></b> and THEN realized their new album is out on October so time to follow them I guess they already deserve my follow at this point. <b><a href=https://x.com/nanoripe_info/status/1803593756157026779 target=_blank>nano.RIPE's new song is for a high school baseball commercial</a></b> and it's going to be out in 2 weeks so I'll listen to it by then. <b><a href=https://x.com/vividundress/status/1803774920763330731 target=_blank>vivid undress' remaining band members announced an instrumental band</a></b> project they have been working on and... that's it! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, I was expecting a little more, like, a debut song/melody at least. Oh well, good luck, guys. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, <a href=https://x.com/MONOLITHIC_PJ/status/1803774628902621654 target=_blank>they have a livestream next week</a> revealing more so maybe we find out by then. Well, I will. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href=https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1803790909558899004 target=_blank>Kroi's new music video</a></b> is for their new song in the album released this week and coincidentally is the only song I did not like so welp guys, should have done an MV for <a href=https://x.com/aozakish/status/1803234851686064299 target=_blank>the other song I liked</a>. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> <b><a href=https://x.com/kuronekounion/status/1804190040140189969 target=_blank>Horie Yui's new song preview</a></b> is somehow more interesting than the previous one, so fingers crossed we can find something good when this album drops by in 2 weeks. <b><a href=https://x.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1804469381088342427 target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new live video</a></b> is for some song I didn't give so not like she will get me with this one, she's married already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And this is interesting, <b><a href=https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1803744613254975800 target=_blank>Kroi was due to perform in a live they intend to stream on YouTube yesterday</a></b> only to <a href=https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1804415477273497958 target=_blank>encounter some network issues</a> but then are able to fix them so I missed it last night so I watched it this week which <a href=https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1804533024853520845 target=_blank>you still can by next week</a>. </div><div><br></div><div>For next week, if I weren't taking meds every day then maybe I'll take a listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%A6%E3%82%BF%E3%82%BF%E3%83%93/1750687806?l=en-US" target=_blank>RYTHEM's new album</a></b> which I don't have high hopes for but hope they will be good, or else I'll just take a break for wrap up the month, I haven't been listening to this month's tunes though been listening to them GTA radio lmao, so maybe I should go back to my music library.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I think I hardly remember anything fantastic that happened this week since I have my contacts to share with (lol) and also I have been like, sneezing for morning, I think I am running out of MCs to take tomorrow. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I don't know, man, anyone have advice for a potential sinus infection? Haha okay bro we need to stop talking about stuff like this, me, and maybe consider opening up a medical advice post series in the new blog instead, yes? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah just joking but moving forward, I may have some ideas for some of the stuff I am doing here. Or there. In about a week. See you guys here next week though that will wrap up everything besides <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/54233/Sasayaku_You_ni_Koi_wo_Utau target=_blank>"SasaKoi"</a> just because lol, and until then... maybe I take some days off to prepare for the new blog- I thought I was ready?? No, me, never.
