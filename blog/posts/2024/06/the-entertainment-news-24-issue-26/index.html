NO. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Well this is also not the final post nothing is final until I actually stop blogging but I will never, but in case you haven't heard, I'm doing another major refresh, contrary to what I said last year. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I will properly conclude this later tonight if you guys don't mind, since this transition coincidentally happens on a Sunday too? I have plenty of stuff lined up so say goodbye to Blogger you might not see this trash platform again <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Now that I've ensured I'll get cancelled by Blogger haha, let's talk about Anime and what's up next season! Then maybe we'll talk about music lol when did that become secondary</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=ShinigamiBocchan36><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Good morning, Bocchan." Someone sell me a sound clip with Alice saying this to me- Ah.</div></blockquote><div>Oh so we HAVEN'T got the approval and we are trying to get it. Damn, I thought we're like, hard cut into the future where they lived their eloped life already. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, we gotta close this one up, so in this final episode of a wonderful series and when I mean that I meant Alice <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> (#ShinigamiBocchan36), it's all about decisions. Decisions that all makes sense now, and will make sure you get the tissue box ready. I mean, you should've. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Let's talk about them. Firstly, about the family. Not going to talk about who Victor is really haha we have to mention the grandfather in a bit too, but yeah, Bocchan is intending to be with Alice. That also means he won't be carrying the noble title and that is fine, but not because he gets to do it. Ironically, and that's why Sharon is by her side, Gerbera is now open to ditching traditions and letting Walter take over the household considering he is also more acquainted to the people so far compared to him who is like, inprisoned since he was 5. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> But yeah, this extends to Walter too, where he promised the one woman Daleth (lol) all the love they have expressed to each other so far, including Daleth's resolve to be human. Yeah you see the problem here is you gotta marry him as a witch so you can be human? Is the mom okay with that? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But no we jumped the gun or at least he did, and yeah what a way to ensure someone can save her because she can't use her magic no more, and it being destroyed all thanks to Sade being around... it all makes sense now making these decisions. Oh, we don't care about nobles marrying nobles no more, just so you know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> As Sade said, Walter's hanging out with like, the daughter to the demon lord so that counts, right? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, let's talk about everyone else. Outside of the family though, the world has opened up so much just seeing the letters to the wedding invitation as such a great opportunity to give him best wishes, but also, to reconcile with him once again since the curse. Looking at you, Philips. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, it's already way better timing compared to Sade who for once can't even explain herself to Sharon who she just cursed to eternal sleep yet heal her daughter in the process. Again, not exactly evil because if she was no one would be around anyways lol, so Sharon forgave her. Considering not just Sade, even Zain and Cuff were the first to approach Bocchan and Alice making this whole removing the curse thing more than possible, and Nico and the others even though he is way beyond his age to be living now lol what about Ichi though, were still vital in this wonderful ending we have always desired. All in all and let's wrap all 3 seasons of Anime up, I gotta say, the 3DCG really held up more than what I expected, and even seeing all the kissing scenes this episode alone is making sure the animation has never bothered me the least and even in many occasions made me laugh because it's still true to Anime as it can. Other than that though, we love a happy ending, we love those tearjerker moments, I'm sad Viola is still single and I want to change that lmao I'm older than her we can make this work, and yeah, this is how the world should have been in this story. So yeah, congrats to all reaching their romance goals lol I guess not everyone, can't wait for Bocchan to flub on his first piano performance in public, and Victor and his wife when are you going to visit your grandson someday after they have settled down? Oh, they haven't even had kids yet? BOOM GOTCHA wasn't talking about the old man haha but seriously though this is such a blessing, if Inoue-sensei's next work (which I have been following their social) will ever become an Anime... it won't be the same again. Not with the huge rack teases HAHAHAHAHA</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUn89H9xjlGuTONrByRfj3-PU9h78c_wi9ONgla7CEh9kOz5V8WH5V9iWy2ErnQr49noD2cQfSdzT9PdT45Y16pbWEDjqlPov5yb6-DsxKZWJ5TWm2Do1i0IUkN-bRvnTH5qf7hIt8qmnF042hSovRK_zAPAQAw_Btu3AjgD5BGJGhhsj4Nh9n9juIZ6E/s320/shinigamibocchan36_couple1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>BEFORE<br>(Technically there's the blanket as shield)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0Nf3nv9fN-wvGSzLAQQ0QxxBxD8w1nl3EzEH0xVWd0nH_2HpL_5qPgVHRqrQxPy7wI9iZszFVcRV7zyoE9dmGoEnReDR8L4L_zpx7t_oSKR068ODsbVLSLscEc4KzOX1EvBS6yN-C3in5f_dWH0zhY8ex2jwLmilyEDwwWvQ28bbv2VG2jvgAELKjMlo/s320/shinigamibocchan36_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>AFTER<br>(Hehe nice)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Uh, why are we heading to a cemetery? <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span></div></blockquote><div>Wait, what? So Kyou-chan here is with the other 2 from Laureley gang...? Oh. OH!! <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> In this new episode where uh, I hope Shiho isn't mad yet haha oh she might be already (#SasaKoi10), eh, we find out what happened to Kyou-chan. Yeah, that girl who was Shiho's rival for all the time when she was a kid? How she got beat in violin and guitar even? Yeah, you killed her, b*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay not like, physically with a violin or something that'll be first degree murder and this will become a crime investigation series, and it's really kind of hard to explain, so I'm glad we got around this thanks to Himari-chan which I already said before, is probably a mistake to put her as your band's manager, Shiho. So, about her. Turning point of the flashback we seen before was when Kyou-chan met directly with a vehicle. Not like, she got a new car or something, something hit her. Like, on the road hit her. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay moving on haha death is such a hard thing to talk about in reviews, but as we have learnt, death does a lot of things to people. To Shiho, she practically lost her hope in life. There was a wall to climb, Kyou-chan at the top was the target, and it was suddenly gone. To her, it's probably the worst thing that can happen to her even if she switched to guitar. But to Kyou-chan though, it's a different story. Remember how Kyou said that she liked Shiho's music so much? Shiho didn't take that seriously, but that was the point: People around her knew she loved this girl called Shiho but never expected her to be such a lost brat. AND she wanted to quit music AGAIN, DUDE?? (This is the SSGIRLS quitting) But seriously though, just look at Momoka-chan cry. How can you just let her down- You can be my girlfriend, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/26063/Reina_Ueda target=_blank>Ueda Reina</a>. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> (Hey hey I meant date me as a woman- Happy Pride Month by the way lol) And that's why saying really isn't everything, even if they are alive, the emotion thing. Yeah, death is one way to make sense of words, but hey, this is just her experience I'm pretty sure our experiences will differ. But all this made sense... until you realized we never found out why she quit the band then. If music is something you pursue, and you aren't kicked out for who you are seeking perfection you were invited to be in SSGIRLS too... Okay okay haha here's psychiatry with Shiho 101 right here: She says she hates Yori-senpai, but then Himari-chan asked her why she said it was without reason. So yeah, j-j-j-jealousy, right? Yup, that feeling where you feel bad when you see your beloved with someone else? But okay, even if Shiho didn't really have to spell it out, you guys got it already, right? I mean, I got it from <a href=https://x.com/sasakoi_anime/status/1807096440017092997 target=_blank>the social media thumbnail</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And the cycle is complete, literally. It's a love triangle in place, Shiho hates everyone now, and vengeance under a solo leader who wants perfect music of hate is Laureley as we know today. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Damn, this is making my head hurt, you don't even know. All in all. what the f**k is this mess even? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> And <a href=https://x.com/sasakoi_anime/status/1807096696188620963 target=_blank>they dare hang this on us without a next episode air date</a>? AARGHHHHHHH Shiho just needs to go to Hell. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay okay serious talk though, I have never been more hyped for where this drama is going and that's probably why it's getting a real life drama series, but damn this episode hits more than I expected. Yeah, if you really want drama up your rear while forgetting that only girls exist in this world lmao, then this is a very good recommend. I know I may have never been the target audience for this, but I'm still so, so glad I picked this up only for the one and only reason: <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/10071/Mikako_Komatsu target=_blank>Komatsu Mikako</a>, wait, no. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah Shiho, what are you going to do? Hate me too, huh?? Haha it's okay you can hate me everyone hates me already there is no love. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Whenever the conclusion to this may be, let's just hope all of this will surface once again with Himari-chan's help of course little did Shiho know she is digging her own emotional grave (I gotta specify this lest I get cancelled by Momoka lol), and we will see her rest her piece sometime down the line. Someone please save her, even if not in exclusivity in romance. Aki-chan here could use some love, she liked Shiho back then and even now. See where I'm going there? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div>[TL:DR; Every time Shiho does something bad to others she is effectively shooting her own foot. And then you say you can't walk no more? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEim6qQGsFmmTrAZj3auK9A-RMl9H30TrJTG0dkzSzScsb2TXeImW4StJmQ9l5-JBshMgz3FgwzXuesGC6ckcVyIQtjzIbDxBs3ns9TpMGcCwzygar2ltOKZVsJlD99i0jiDYCA2kqhqArwe2lKwzBcJM90PWutLUGS3GZKYvsi3hsXYQtUUK9nHog0fjEw/s320/sasakoi10_momoka1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Girls crying special I guess<br>(WHO MADE OUR MOMOKA CRY HERE HOW DARE YOU)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTQho-g9bzIiAId1HEiIIOHB_EOcSi9DxKZ8EVPBBqTa45fdHao8vY9cMsayALPwxMkV5L2CODMsc-HHD_QMiNDrqQbVZTOrdBjO4x7ktjSkksWCskLtIXitXuOgIJbAvG8Zsj8SqjSKsDuQRYcVV99FJiWWp086K5Q5RUJL_vSZ6h2tyDuqYKbLMCsfc/s320/sasakoi10_shiho11.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Girls crying special I guess<br>(I feel bad for Shiho ngl then again it's also her)</table></div></div><div>P.S. "Why? I was the one who made the decision (to break up with Kyou)" Well, then you have no idea what it means to have consequences, Shiho.</div><div>P.P.S. "I've never had someone I know die before, and to be honest, it hasn't really hit me yet." Yeah SHE DIED OUT OF SPITE- Okay not out of spite but again, Shiho has experienced quite a lot of what God has to offer to her, that's for sure. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=Amanojaku><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Suki demo Kirai na <a href=https://jisho.org/search/amanojaku target=_blank>Amanojaku</a></span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I have to give it back" Give what back- AH DAMMIT the kid got before me lol</div></blockquote><div>I feel like I should watch an Anime movie every season, but not like I always have the time to be frank and not like we are rushed to migrating to a new blog lol, but here we are. I would like to say though, there is absolutely no regret in just picking up a cute movie to watch once in a while I am a fan of such things I would argue, so let's talk about what this (#Amanojaku) is about. My first impression of this honestly?  Is that there is no monologue. No such thing, that thing is as dead as the Snow Gods that are in the Hidden Village. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I always and now am more than aware that monologues ruin the thoughts for the audience who should have been thinking given just enough dialogue that will go through in the storytelling, I've always believed in that so I really think that irks me if I see them, but this just goes the other way around. Even then, I'm pleased to say I can understand the story, so I hope the negativity on this isn't about why this isn't explaining more of what the lore is behind them because I'm sure Tsumugi and the Chief might have said more than enough for you to understand what this is all about. Secondly, I would like to bring to attention that as much as I would like to not refer to depressed people as "oni" lmao *points at self* I would still make sure that this read makes sense so whenever I refer to demons I just meant people who have been so depressed they emit so many little demons they become one, like, they lost their soul. Damn, that Chief has 3 horns how many husbands have died before her? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> MOVING ON haha, and lastly, is that to go with the flow. I sat down to ensure that I won't be too concerned about the rating (Spoiler: I lied haha) online and just go ahead to watch and see where it took me, and I tell you, it's a lot better than people give them criticism for. With that, let's talk about the story.</div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>"You two make a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/oniai target=_blank>great couple</a>!" Yeah get it? Because it also means "loving a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/oni target=_blank>demon</a>"? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div></blockquote><div>This is no romance plot mind you, though I guess where is this series without romance at least in the family terms, so let's talk about Hiiragi. He's a nice guy. Yeah, they don't make shows with bad guys now, this guy is so nice he'll help out a classmate be her fake boyfriend. I know right, where is you shame even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But after having an itch to help Tsumugi out at boarding a bus, Hiiragi would not be too surprised to learn more about why she has been here. Well, in this world, there are demons. And people become demons by going to Hell- What did I tell you don't mix this up. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> People become demons through negative emotions, and too many of them you will just become one. Oh, descendants of them aren't this depressed. I mean, just look at that cutie Tsumugi, try getting mad at her. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also yeah, imagine he nods to everything about helping everyone around him who in turn doesn't care about him at all, and then he rejects the heck out of this demon girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Who are we joking he's only scared of his dad he'll not help her- Oh what the heck. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Tsumugi is here to find her mom in a shrine Hiiragi knows about and I assume many do but only he will help, and not until the former realized how much trouble they are in pursued by the Snow Gods that this is potentially a huge lore behind on itself. Yeah, not going to spoil much, but Hiiragi did get eaten by one in front of his real dad so uh... YIKES?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And this didn't just stop there, Snow Gods are flowing out of the village and supposedly targeting people. It's like the Snow God is some game host "so who is our next CONTESTANT!!" lmao I'm so sorry I need to make jokes this is how it is. But turns out, we know they aren't just targeting certain things, it's specifically just the demons and even Tsumugi herself, and that is probably where the issue is here.</div><div><blockquote style=text-align:center>"I did find (Hiiragi), but he just vanished right before my eyes" YIKES</blockquote></div><div>I would say the problem of how the Snow Gods, where you might have figured out on your own especially with the flashbacks Hiiragi experienced while being in a Snow God (remember when I said he was eaten?) and also again when Tsumugi reached the inner shrine in the Hidden Village, is surprise surprise, the mom was involved. I would just infer this as the mom was the lynchpin for how the Hidden Village stays hidden, presumably, and the Snow Gods are the ones protecting them from the people outside because what better way to protect introverted depressed people than to <strike>send them so see a psychiatrist</strike> build an invisible village in extreme cold conditions to keep those extroverts away? <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> We need to not know how the lore goes, we need not stare too much at the blinds that were in that dude's café, because even if historically it has happened, does not mean it won't happen to Tsumugi's mom, who had doubts on being the carrier of the world of demons while she misses her life opportunity to be with her dear family. Yeah. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> This is probably why it can never be mentioned the dad chose to hide it from her, and also being the sacrifice to keep the village "safe", she was being nice and had to do what she does. Just like Hiiragi. Deja vu, anyone? I think this is a safe explanation, and kind of breaks tradition in the way we have not expected much walking into this just because. I would argue that Tsumugi is also likely right that they don't need this cloak (unlike the ones in <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/16067/Nagi_no_Asu_kara target=_blank>Anime "Nagi no Asukara"</a>) in order for them to stay safe, so that's settled rather easily without much heavy conflict or whatsoever. Heck, even the Chief didn't try to stop Tsumugi to find her mom even when she know fully well what is going to happen. Nice world, people, nice world.</div><blockquote style=text-align:center>"How can you say it's better for me not to know?" Well your mom is, you know. Your mom is... you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></blockquote><div>All in all... sorry for looking at the rating at MyAnimeList as I say this, but in the comments and reviews I saw something that made sense: It's nothing amazing, but it's good. I think the biggest problem with it is how people will not understand the lore because once again, and this is why the audience today is dumber than the homo sapiens when they were in caves, people are not using the brain to link things up. But I also can attribute this to the lacklustre storytelling that is going on, since it takes quite a lot to link the dots and of course, have to consider that this whole time no one will tell you why your mom was not around you is because of them. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, not like it's anyone's fault she did volunteer to do it in the first place, but still. And certain points that are supposed to be important didn't stand out, like the Chief actually not responding to Tsumugi saying she doesn't mind the Hidden Village opening up to others (demons, of course, motherf**ker tried for months and can't even access the place through the hole lmao), or even just why it all comes around for Hiiragi to help Tsumugi in the first place... I guess this should need some improvement, probably will work if it's a little longer to bring in the lore and mood a little deeper. Yeah, it just lacks depth. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey but for a casual movie though, this is actually good. The characters are lively, there's this journey when you don't have money again I also don't know how kids can fly these days lmao, and all's well ends well and no one dies. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I legit was aiming for a sad ending, you know, the mom just can't come back, but heck prove me wrong, Anime. Still, it was a joy to watch, never a moment I thought it felt dumb because remember the audience is dumber lmao, but it's not going to make me like this any further. Well, not as much as Tsumugi will like Hiiragi now AMIRITE FELLAS haha hey maybe being an demon isn't too bad after all. *sees little demons appearing on my back* Uh oh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5b3HgVAXB9Ta6sPkZXRIkgbZWNzvbtZbrZNgS6QJTKKy0YLnPbOxU1Ixw2FnvyHDIuBzDxBje2b3ujjig84DRSdYFzfd38NG3ROAX-kitHIXS7wz77dg5p6PNFstTht0YEpnygr52jKy5EWrCmQcx8mzTB7KjwmF7SUAk2sv6GAPLoioKSeNTvA1Wvu0/s320/amanojaku_couple3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>My opinion of this movie<br>(<span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span>)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibp9hN1HFRsP-V-uRTE5s1J9sWA3ltwzj6Cf8dhcxHpDnC1RoZtvAPGFzQGRB3HQE5ZhF0u2YSIJVzNYEJDrvk-okwdrdEbNaHGt6qxKbUrx8vwRP5fg29pl7cp2Z6f_bUbNrP1frd8lrQkUK2JkolfQ_Lwl3snxQuer_a1EUFa7uRsTK1bgFBcVjtydY/s320/amanojaku_mask1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me sitting at my desk every day at work be like<br>(BRUH)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHs3yxxXZFg7y3dPiCXygt83wminjf4h29LCBRlblZwXc8tNnvFkQ8Tk4E5vTaNdS3L1nbfcS_9JGSfnrKHopi0jwYJi398z5hZUlHiHtFH-PXH0483KAPAPrcQYv7fnbJ_RD_WWhr-whqnYlZLXmdav_5-oUJd8jiE5D67yO_w1_OV2EuK_b764Ha1QI/s320/amanojaku_brofist.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Job well done be like<br>(Not at work though no one will bro fist me <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnohKi4kif5r1-L2PpejX7Ec4JHC3tczj11S-dQnJ0kJF-PKUxTMDsQc0uhW48MtX1b-Xec0-sg5UM2vNRgXwkFelAk3Lv2mIEy5htFvcz0JljpSZ_azLE_EwI9YZDLnhYMlHL2o-8p8OH9HehFsGAd8AjH0DgLIqMagwvNpSxky-dl68McvVs5Fc9E18/s320/amanojaku_snowgod.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW I had a great weekend hehe</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Haha seriously though anyone is listening to the songs? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href=https://x.com/trysail_staff/status/1806495570825191663 target=_blank>TrySail's new song will pre-release next week</a></b> so in case you didn't know how that works it's for Anime and will align with the Anime's first episode. <b><a href=https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1807285578855231544 target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's new song is also pre-releasing next week</a></b> for the same reason. <b><a href=https://x.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1806628614416519459 target=_blank>Aimer's new song will be for Anime</a></b> which ClariS has sung a theme song for so damn, that Anime is getting all the good songs, eh? Moving on we got more news, <b><a href=https://x.com/rythem_official/status/1806659401752903862 target=_blank>RYTHEM's new live video</a></b> is a good reminder of their revival song from a couple of years ago was so good, it probably reinstated our love for them. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Okay, maybe not much for me but for fans, I'm sure it worked. <b><a href=https://x.com/kuronekounion/status/1806726754096034186 target=_blank>Horie Yui's new song preview</a></b> is also into the summer mood and I hope the rest of the album will be this cheerful. <b><a href=https://x.com/uesaka_official/status/1806613513604870432 target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new music video</a></b> will air in 3 weeks and be out for pre-release in 2 weeks if you are impatient but it's not going to be that great so I can wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And in case you haven't got bored, <b><a href=https://x.com/AKG_information/status/1806855102696939679 target=_blank>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's debut song remastered for this year will pre-release next week</a></b> to give you a reminder that their single best album is out next month. <b><a href=https://x.com/Creepy_Nuts_/status/1807021196589883590 target=_blank>Creepy Nuts' new live video</a></b> is all that I have wanted of course including fans who knew how to sing the song better than me. </div><div><br></div><div>Next week, we have <b>Horie Yui's new album</b> to deal with and I think that is quite enough haha yes I'm trying to ignore the fact that I have to give new Anime theme songs AS SOON as their first episodes have aired so we shall see on those and how many I can talk about as I watch them. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Wow, isn't it ironic yet cool to (not that I watched it) see <b><a href=https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1806973442639430096 target=_blank>Ikimonogakari performing on Taiwan's Golden Melody Awards</a></b>?
