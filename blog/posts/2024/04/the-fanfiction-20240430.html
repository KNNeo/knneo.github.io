Writing these before the daily wallpaper is put on my phone is weird, isn't it? HAHA that is NOT what happened yesterday, bro. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span><div><br></div><div>Since I will be halfway done with the work week by the time you have seen this noon time published week-long special, you know what's the best way to unwind after a day of hard work? YouTube- Uh, I mean, hanging out at a bar! Hey, it may be lonesome juice bar that you don't even drink, me, you are neither of those so thank goodness there is fictional me so I can write about this next story! I've always wanted a drinking buddy, so this should set things up. Maybe. We can be friends. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>...</div><div><br></div><div>HEY GOD OF GLASS <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/3741/Ryuu_Sasakura target=_blank>SASAKURA RYUU</a> HELP ME OUT ON THIS!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Aizawa Saya dressed in a gray dress with a black sleeved top, holding on to a glass and taking a sip" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=356 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl802860.jpg title="Aizawa Saya" width=139></div><blockquote><div><i>Thanks to a friend's recommendation, I decided to drop by this popular hotel bar alone after work. I was greeted with a mellow atmosphere set in front of well-lit alcohol displays, but also fully filled seats on the grounds. I was lucky enough to get a vacant stool by the counter. I first ordered my usual and it was a good as I remembered. I then asked for a recommendation from the bartender. That was refreshing and all, but as I glanced around, I was surprised to see a young lady in beautiful long, black hair shining in the dim light, holding on to a glass and staring back at me I think for as long as I have sat down. I greeted her out of formality and she replied with a nod, sipping on her drink.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>It wasn't long before her friend returned and they carried on their conversation. I then overheard that she is called Saya-chan, and this is her first time at a bar! She exerts such a matured allure even though I'm sure deep inside, she was excited to hang out here.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, by episode 909 of this I'll <em>actually</em> do dumb things to her after getting a couple of drinks down. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Get it? Aizawa Saya's birth date drop? September 9th?) Since me IRL thinks of going to bar but never, maybe this will be that vision to see how far will I go as fictional me? Haha I WISH we have a comprehensive library of images for this type of scene but not of what happens afterwards LMAO also I have no idea if I will ever get drunk because, now in my 30s, I have never drank any alcohol. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Don't ever test it out, me, not now, just don't. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But since I also overheard her saying she liked the place (as so did fictional me), at least you can be assured this won't be the last time we will see of her. That's a promise from me- She's technically below 21 when they sold this photo set? Uh oh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Speaking of age, I wanted to convey like, some kid who has never seen someone this crazy to let the bartender offer a recommendation in their life, haha yeah, or maybe just witnessing such a monstrosity sitting beside her like I am who's that guy, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/184506/Harumi_Takeda target=_blank>Takeda-senpai from Anime "Senpai ga Uzai"</a>? Haha I'm not that well-built though. Whichever she saw of me? I will not know. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> This will likely also the most haphazard concept of a story for the week mainly because I last minute (as in 3 weeks ago) dropped another story in order to alternate between a couple of new characters for the week which, wink wink, the other new character's story for the week will be better. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Stay tuned for that too, will ya?</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction"><span class="material-icons small-icons">category</span>The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
