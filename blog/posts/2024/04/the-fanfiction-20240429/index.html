<div></div><div>Well, we're in Japan's Golden Week... week now, so I have planned something special!!</div><div><br></div><div>To celebrate what is almost a year or me writing stories of fictional me interacting with women which itself should be considered a miracle (lol), I will have fresh stories every single day until Friday! We are starting of with... well all stories have a beginning and this one is too even for fictional me so...</div><div><br></div><div>Shall we begin?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Kitou Akari dressed in a black blouse and pink coat, standing by a tree in the background" border=0 data-original-height=357 data-original-width=512 height=139 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl367784.jpg title="Kitou Akari" width=200></div><blockquote><div><i>It was the first day since the snow stopped falling in the new year. It has also been a week since the final exams were over in my first college year. Thanks to a gathering last Christmas with Kitou Akari, we went steady recently and today is our first date. Trust me when I said I was more nervous than I was in the exams. I struggled to remember the lines I want to say to Akari as I do not want to screw up my first impression with her even though we have been course mates for months. Back then we were just being friends, where impressions were casual and we can joke around. But I want to take this new relationship seriously, and with my anxiety I could only be more worried just standing at our meeting point in what was a chilly morning.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>All of a sudden, I felt a tap on my right shoulder.</em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em><abbr title=行こうか？>"Shall we go?"</abbr></em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>The tap pumped my heart and prepared me for the day ahead. I started by doing a morning greeting and she apologized for not greeting me first. Looks like the impression making isn't just on me.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>LET'S FUCKING GOOOOO haha hell yeah I wish I can date someone like Akarin you have no idea what she sounds like when she said that quote <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> yeah I don't know either. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know she is wearing something awesome underneath though HAHA <a href=https://jisho.org/search/eroi target=_blank>eroi</a></div><div><br></div><div>You are WELCOME for another seasonal dose of Akarin lol I should stop doing her but (haha) for now I don't have any confirmed stories of her backed up so I'll just let this go for now I still have way more of her images which I have been refraining myself from writing anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also yeah, very misplaced even for this time of the year but heck we can date anytime so who cares this is after final exams period too also also this is just a flashback why am I so upset about this?? See, that's the start of the breakup lol can we not? We're trying to have a good time here, well at least I am, I'm not too sure about her, you sure it's ok for us to just, you know, hang out? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (Fictional me with the existential crisis)</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. This is still season 3, even though I took a week's break. It's just... a lot longer than I expected haha I just can't stop dude this is the weekly motivation for months just this year alone. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> And yes, I actually rushed this to work to publish on noon Japan time every day. Hopefully I won't be as hesitant to prepare for this tomorrow onwards. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S. Yes I exceeded the character count on the first draft but I saw 1016 and I didn't bother to reduce it anymore hehe it's her birthday dude</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction"><span class="material-icons small-icons">category</span>The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
