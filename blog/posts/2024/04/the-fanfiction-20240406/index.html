<div></div><div>Well, I hear this could be <a href=https://tenki.jp/sakura/ target=_blank>the best weekend for cherry blossom season in Tokyo</a> so I better do this seasonal story up before it dies out in about two days lol</div><div><br></div><div>It might be a good day for an outing today, because damn did I botch up a lot of stuff just being at home. Breakfast home delivery was super screwed for some reason I shall not iterate, and I guess we still haven't planned for the mom's birthday dinner for tonight. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well I'll think of something while trying to curb my anger, because seriously, how am I going to be mad when I spent so much time just thinking of how to write this month's stories featuring fictional me?</div><div><br></div><div>Shout out to half a year ago when I wanted to write more of this woman, and here we are! Don't worry, me, you can do perfection over here this isn't real life she is totally up your alley and so are you. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I'm ready I got all the wallpapers on my phone to start me off this week LET THE FANTASIES BEGIN!!! (N-No, those exclamation marks don't mean anything <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Amamiya Sora wearing a white long-sleeved top, smiling and holding a cherry blossom flower to her face" border=0 data-original-height=357 data-original-width=512 height=139 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg799408.jpg title="Amamiya Sora" width=200></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>Natsukawa Shiina, Asakura Momo, Amamiya Sora and I walked out of the studio into a cherry blossom park in front of us, on a sunny afternoon. Since our day was over, Shiina suggested that we walk around the park and take a couple of photos while we are at it, and we all agreed. Once we crossed the street though, Shiina immediately dragged Momo away to the field of cherry blossoms across the park, leaving Sora and me alone.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>We took a stroll along the path, taking in the light pink hue blending into the pale blue sky. Sora then walked near a cherry blossom tree branch and put one of the flowers close to her face.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=さくらは綺麗ですね>"The sakura are beautiful, isn't it?"</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=そらは綺麗ですね>"The sky is beautiful, isn't it?"</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>Her smiling mouth opened up after hearing my reply, with a blush deeper than the cherry blossom petals around her. She then laughed it off knowing that I was making a joke about her name, and I nodded in response. She looked away and reminded me that I should stop saying such things.</i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, me. You have a girlfriend, remember? Also hard cut to the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> looking at the both of us embarrassed and being jealous in the distance haha I know right this is such a <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgU0kHQdi1yYqSc3366Slok24ESCoI8m6XyxZXOaPvkY2fxj3VeysNtYp83ycvS5oQdxd3TeBeJ4XZrRoD5sIUmVYu2znbVfn9r4HbvmK0bYV8ldI_RebDyV1bGpAivVdgMqRiJfHwF-pJimQfLCpKrVsvlFy9EmX-BbuRqjSCevyGver2K3jCC3HXThA/s320/PXL_20230824_125155491.jpg target=_blank>"Douki-chan" scenario</a>, literally. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Considering the girls (which I might refer to them as "the TrySail girls" from here on if not for the excess character count here lol this is a short one I might add) were working and I somehow had a day off or two, YOU BET Nan-chan is going to use me to carry their belongings more often than you think, and I think I might keep up with this lore for as long as I can. Why have the manager when there are so many of you to take care of, and you have fictional me? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Also, this will be the first (and likely last) time I will be speaking in these stories, which in this case it was purely to associate a reply to that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/dokidoki target=_blank>doki</a> moment I thought of, so don't worry, I will keep my presence in real life to a minimum. Oh, fictional me. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Unfortunately, I won't be able to keep the presence of fictional me with Ten-chan separated, for spoiler alert... let's just say there may be more heart-throbbing events heading our way.
