<div>Wha~t!! Another story featuring Ten-chan again?? Yes, it has come back once again because as I said, this is just compensating for only mentioning her the one time, and I'm here to make it up to her. Not her personally, she has to be in my fiction in order to interact with fictional me.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Now that we let the cat out of the bag, maybe we just start with extrapolating my... invisible role in the eyes of my stepsister's career: Being the sort of a substitute manager or errand boy I guess at her beck and call? So yeah, basically when Nan-chan says go there, I go there. She says I go with Ten-chan, I go with Ten-chan...!? OKAY THEN LET'S GO TO SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY!! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ah hey</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Amamiya Sora barefeet wearing a dark blue blouse, translucent sleeve top and white skirt, sitting on a bed with her head tilted and smiling" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=357 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl787574.jpg title="Amamiya Sora" width=139></div><blockquote><i>As my stepsister Shiina knew that I took work leave to stay indoors, she ordered me to join Amamiya Sora for an assignment in another city. She told me we will be able to book train tickets back at the end of the day afterwards. But contrary to what we found out when we arrived at the location, we were told it would be done in half a day. This left us stranded when we also found out return tickets were only available for the next morning.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>I booked the only hotel nearby the train station and updated Sora after she was done. But the series of events did not end even as we arrived at the hotel soon after, as we were told by hotel staff that only single king-sized bedrooms were left. We had no choice but to accept the offer. After we entered the room, Sora took her shoes off, sat down on the bed in front of me and smiled back at me.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=二人きり、だね？>"The two of us are alone, are we?"</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>I wondered how she came to this conclusion and we jokingly laughed. We then looked away from each other in silence.</i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I imagine what's going through Ten-chan's brain was that she was glad someone was going along with her on this very normal thing we will go back by the evening until she realized how much of a predicament we were in, until so coincidentally to the extent that we will have to spend the night together, in the same hotel room, ON THE ONLY BED?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Only someone who think kinky will come to this conclusion haha <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Also, do you think, do you even think, that Ten-chan will be this level of cheeky to play around with me? You think she told Nan-chan to get someone to go with her which implicitly means me? Fictional me, yes, I know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I wonder, dude. This sounds like too much of a good story not to fantasize on MUAHAHAHA and that's why we have this. How many years of idolism did you think surmounted into the making of this one? Haha come on she was still the OG first love, fictional me knew of her in high school. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, real life is similar too I knew her than everyone else... after her haha I can't upset the older ones not even the married ones lol</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I know we reached the character limit for the story already but I promise you, I SWEAR the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> did NOT see this coming. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She might not be jealous, but she did call me to find out if we were okay, and I told her everything. Including being in the same hotel room together. Alone. Just not on the same bed though, this might break her heart. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> She also called Ten-chan too behind my back just to make sure I wasn't lying and that I didn't do anything to her dear friend. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I know right, she is very sus right here, dude. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
