This is because I was trying to test the blog migration thing I've been trying out for so long, gave up halfway for trying to fix all the scripts and files that are making this more of a mess to deploy separately to another service, ended up making me do other stuff on my GitHub pages which made me even more pissed fixing the older versions I wish I could just spend more time to redo them.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Hey, I promise you I was having fun haha I know it doesn't sound like it but that's programmer life. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Also Japan online shopping life I spent WAY too much money on bromides this month alone, we shall collate them next month when they arrive. You'll see. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>And since I didn't watch any Anime on a Saturday, I shall pay the price and rush all of them on a Sunday! The only downside is that I will do shorter write-ups? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Isn't that a good thing though</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TenshiTsuki04><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>One Room, Hiatari Futsuu, Tenshi Tsuki.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Oh, I put peppers in the omelette rice for dinner." LMAO among all the confusion Towa-chan be like you still wanna eat?</div></blockquote><div>Hey, I don't think even my mom would stop to not question me on anything but ask if I ate. My dad asked me more than her. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, real life sucks, but having a bunch of new girl... friends also sucks in this new episode haha (#TenshiTsuki04), where uh, Shintarou you are on your own I gotta go bye!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, I saw the harem tag on the Anime listing page. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But really, why are me making this look like Tsumugi is the weird one? Oh, she is. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> OH SHIT I GOTTA GO lol this Anime, dude. But yeah, the triangle conflict. Okay it took me quite a while to even watch this part alone haha I kept pausing the video is the problem, so let's talk about what happened. Firstly, let's talk about Tsumugi's reaction considering she is the odd one out in this situation. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I can't I gotta laugh this out first. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In case you haven't noticed, she has been going on about not the fact that she had to deal with supernatural being around in this world of hers, but more of, that there are a lot more women appearing around Shintarou's life than she expected. Because you know, she likes him. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, basically in every corner of this episode, Tsumugi be having the <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>j-j-j-jealousy</a> haha I love that song. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Maybe that's what kept her awake all night, but I'm pretty sure even if all the new girls here are just friends, and she did get the assurance from Shintarou that the others aren't going for his... I don't know, body? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She will still be as paranoid as we know her of just two episodes ago. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Which brings us to our next girl, Noel-chan. Of course she is not surprised by Towa-chan's appearance too much considering she is born into a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yukionna target=_blank>snow woman</a> trait, and is perhaps more attached towards her new friend Shintarou here haha yeah not the others though they are friend's friends they are different <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, but yeah, between Tsumugi's hot and cold personality towards the main guy, this one... is also hot and cold, but it's being friends and just not being friends no more. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> When she's hot, I imagine her in her panties- Wait, not that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> When she's friendly haha this is safer, she acts like such a great friend, I wonder why I missed that other Anime last year with her as main girl. Heck, this will do too. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I mean, I like the shame on Tsumugi here but damn, can I go the Noel-chan route? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Not until she doesn't, and that's where her problems on making friends are, because apart from rejecting her colleagues at work to be friends and literally avoiding Shintarou after the boss told her to tone it down not erase her bright side personality lmao, she... uh, can't just stay in the gray area of socialization- Oh, she's always white. OH SHIT- Speaking of white, there's Towa-chan. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> This is also the first episode she has been in contact with more humans than ever ie. other than Shintarou lol, and the fascinations she gets and whatever she didn't learn from the book, coupled with her guts to do anything to make people happy... will make her perfect to work in the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/famiresu target=_blank>family restaurant</a> the guy is working in... provided she is also an employee at the establishment. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah boss, if you need more hire and said the floor was busy earlier, I think I have some candidates. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, joy is the best word I can use for this series, and man have I not liked such a series more than I should have. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, this is great so far, Towa-chan is making waves so far even without blending in with the humans as she should lol, Tsumugi needs to get her game up to not lose to being friends with... Noel? Haha because with Shintarou and we can't mess with Noel's feelings, Tsumugi you just have to jump straight from classmates to like, lovers so you won't mess up their friendship, just saying. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Ah, I love this dumb Anime haha</div><div>[Sorry for ranting about this but HOW THE HECK are the theme songs here have some release schedule for their physical releases (opening theme this week, ending theme in 2 weeks), when everywhere else is just into the digital thing only?? I don't know, because idol artists? Yeah probably I hate digital singles as a trend tbh]</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYvl39pEF69OF9UagIJ61Etz0O71nZisYax8fdJy4xfMtid3R0bA0lDNhz5GzqzR1sHNs_DXuaoE47fx9QwSm31Wj9b3OalZVICJ4DBViNkeLNneoUBfkOHA5h1C0I11lZORMGECNdPjBNHpMsS3SgIPW-v6nvKb0Ohu9Sff0VJYE7HMntHjee_6k-XMk/s320/tenshitsuki04_ded.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Literally me every day after work lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAaXYoQgWkVHEMX4tVvQqZL0I1Waiw-Ku0sgZD3k5pUU5YGl7VmwgSCkoo6rkwGWprPmQlMWVdWcNqYhhroHpZRXTd1ivL1la9sa8OIZR9LtvVmtbxoPadSk67K0lwt2Mf3PJ24xqBwlfQI-e_0QBsg5vHHQ3vEZXzaTtTKY0KLUzB0KpReJVnb4W4U1w/s1600/tenshitsuki04_oh.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I don't know what I would use this for since I don't know<br>(Haha)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Is it though?? We just got spooked by Sade's clones bro</div></blockquote><div>Oh yeah true Bocchan does have a timeline here Walter will become king of the household if he still has this curse. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN I mean it's not that hard just make Walter female. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where we plan to make Viola the head of the household lol (#ShinigamiBocchan27), well she's not eligible yet just in terms of height lmao, so maybe not for now, the mom's still here. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Still, we can talk about what happened in the household. Sharon finally got to talk to Bocchan's mom (I'm not her friend so I'm not calling by her name also her name SUCKS-) which I assume after some time to recover for the latter, will accept her as a maid in the household again. Whether she's accepting her as her friend again or not... b*tch you didn't have a choice this is your first friend and YOU are wondering if you want to have friends or not? BRUH. You're not even friends to your kids- I know right, what a stubborn b*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The flashback definitely did not help much to understand this, though why she chose Sharon back then is likely that she wanted to learn from her how to raise her own kids, this young mom. Did she learn anything though? Eh... let's not say anything much. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And that's why Walter had to sneak out in disguise in order to not be found by the mom when he wasn't allowed to go to the circus when he had tickets to it, and thanks to Viola-chan he managed to have a good time without being spotted even by Zain and Cuff, only to have to show his identity when he noticed the local pickpocket nicked his stuff. Excuse me, her stuff. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Speaking of Zain, he gave Alice and Bocchan some magical tools to play with apart from each other lmao but I may have said it too early, since one's a love potion which Alice drank which made no difference because these two are a thing already, and the body switching one got me a laugh so they win. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Daleth is lamenting in the Underworld of all the paperwork she has to do and maybe is considering automation? No, no automation, just get Teto-chan to do them. Yeah, don't have to be leader to approve, just hire a secretary. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Viola-chan had a moment with Rob which I don't really want to guess if he has ever loved their grandmother (lmao) but heck, let's just say he did with his blind eye- No, that's not laser, thankfully. Please, it can only have two (haha f**k you Walter) outcomes when someone has a covered eye: It's either hollow in which case will come out of the other side which Rob's isn't lol (that's an <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach target=_blank>Anime "BLEACH"</a> joke and it's <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/3210/Nnoitra_Gilga target=_blank>Nnoitra</a>), or the eye is so expensive Rob would rob himself of it since he wouldn't be able to afford it anyways lmao (that's <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/46471/Tantei_wa_Mou_Shindeiru target=_blank>Anime "TanMoshi"</a> with <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/188639/Yui_Saikawa target=_blank>Saikawa Yui</a>). Not like explaining my jokes would make this funnier, but this is still funny so far by all means. From Alice touching herself (lmao) to Viola-chan wanting to touch Rob... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You get the idea. It's still great by all means, I don't think I should explain them all because watching is probably better, and it isn't as dry, as I said, compared to earlier seasons because back then they had to squeeze out more content even from a Christmas party. Still, nowadays we are just waiting from the Academy to go back to the past to... talk to Sade? About love? Yeah, get the confession ready. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh, we need proposal rings? Alright, let me snatch it from Viola-chan when she lost it as a kid haha so you get the point, this show has plenty to offer even without Sade ruining their lives. What will happen next? Your guess is as good as mine, but looks like we might be exploring if Sade is as heartless as she has always been. My guess? I mean, you can outdo evil in love. They are crazy or else why would they do anything- Haha I know right people don't even know about <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/1081/Ulquiorra_Cifer target=_blank>Ulquiorra</a> haha I'm sorry for the references dude</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8DBnOaR7xq0BPE5NrmdCTDVHtNwwfNmvR0WGSXsdUmTUgqHQeju754sSCLhw4rWzIPpenPdwad48KMQe06i04apqIOZmLW_6R-57LeXT6Tt7fh8rRq8oYAKcrmAdC6NLWpHDTHo8mQ5m4BQFp0e24XLIAQdqZVghcbgv3vpvp5o39WH-9KuJv6RCthG4/s320/shinigamibocchan27_burn.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Anime without context lol<br>(Or I guess "my sis telling me to pay for dinner with my meagre pay check" haha)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHHGZLX-7St-_IO7Y-LFJqROfLb3p8Zd4cMF0FKKSFd_GkWY8OacEBA3NxmlrtwcQqGWfkEt1aYIskDCZg-0SZwS1-iu8vKrr2XOZFDPJInP3mwb_24vJi0NOiduaZc1_r-Yvz8PQzQpeJvyHEx1Y0pYbIbmW-_9Zcq3UpnYQmkU3GqxxaIwa7pMIBse0/s1600/shinigamibocchan27_squeeze1.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is all I can show you LMAO</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkUQLph_W8CxUdcJ0f58tyJpxV6n0o0Nu8iQOepo2M1M0xYCt5kH_Mu3ZGE93k81HK5MSg1K7c9hn6GEP-sGXdD7dsZ78mNIFulWSVief94QQ4hwqvqf0yw8UCQY1vZGlhxVA_PYYHLIPYwJjSPEEWTHLKOmZEIb5sqT-9gWqerE0HRX60wMsJPZaFm8k/s320/shinigamibocchan27_viola3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This is the closest thing we will get to a horny Viola-chan ngl</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Not like this is a very chill one, we did piss of a French chef way too many times already haha, so let's talk about him in this new episode (#Bartender04), shall we? So, about the hotel's next hiring candidate. I know right, a French chef who is just super picky about his ingredient choices? Talk about mission impossible after trying to get Sasakura as a bartender. The usual hotel staff gang did try though, and not like he was convinced of anything anyways Japan sucks in his opinion lmao, but heck, maybe the Glass of God can help. Sasakura graduated as a bartender from Europe, so he has some idea on alcohol there. So if this blind taste test doesn't work, nothing will. Yeah, I don't think calling the other guy from the previous episode will help us out either. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, basically speaking that Sasakura introduced to this French chef something that could be made to deceive, but also kind of hint to him that great food and even authentic food can be made the same way regardless of its ingredients. Not going to call anyone cheap in tastes right here that's how my local Thai restaurant and artificial flavours exist lol <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span>, but even with high standards, I'm pretty sure it's still possible (maybe with much effort so yeah bro remember to negotiate your salary haha) even if you are running a restaurant far away from home. And that's how food works anyways. Also alcohol haha gotta credit the manager for that Sasakura didn't do nothing. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> YO KAMISHIMA-SAN <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Haha yeah, gotta read the script, bro. THIS is how you get the hotel staff off his butt. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, we talk about the most flexible cocktail in the world. The one with more faces than <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Face target=_blank>Two-Face</a>. The one with more faces than that <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bian_lian target=_blank>face-changing act</a> in traditional Sichuan operas. Yes, we are talking about the Martini. Of course this episode is also leaning on the ways to make a cocktail which has as vague of a formula as this one because damn what are recipes even haha, but yeah, that's what defines, and breaks, our dear Kawakami and her character as a bartender so far. She just... can't make a Martini for sh*t. She thought just following her master's formula will do. Like, bruh. Firstly, you can never. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Not that you suck, but as Yuri in the other bar they also visited has said, your Martini determines your character. How do you know what uniqueness you possess as a cocktail server if you have never added any creativity in your works? I know right, even I do creative stuff despite being a programmer. The skills make of what you are as much as your ways of doing things. Well, let's hope Kawakami figured that out, or else we are going to drink No-Face from her again. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey, you can do it, my girl, I'll give you some personal support. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> All in all, lovely episode and damn am I sitting in tight as I would be if I were at Eden Hall and boy when will my first ever expedition to a bar be this good I don't want to ruin it like that French chef <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span> haha, but yeah, the story might be different, but the feels are just right around the corner. And relevant to the initial Anime series too. Ah, I'm just glad to hear a story or two from this.

Haha ah hey, I gotta make more noise than he does, you know. It's the law. India law. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Uh oh am I going to be called out as racist-) In this new episode where we brought the gong out haha (#KuroshitsujiSchool03), yeah he's just going to replace Redmond. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In flair, please. You can NOT be more gay than Redmond. Or Maurice. That b*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, for starters, let's talk about why Souma is here. Well, they intend someone to look into Maurice's life to see if they can bring up more evidence to his underhand deeds, and since Weston College doesn't allow us to mix colours lol what about Art class though <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> and Ciel is in blue school, it's hard to know exactly what's up. And so rich guy kid Souma-kun here will be of help, hopefully, to find out more about what this kid is doing which hopefully isn't as useless as this Indian prince. I... hope Ciel has a backup plan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Because damn, we are yet again reminded of how Souma does things in general, which if you need a reminder, is to pester someone he has taken a fancy too. He did that with Ciel who eventually bent, he is just doing the same thing to Maurice. Of course this pisses of the latter because damn we cannot find out when he has to assign his jobs to his underlings, but that we know is harder to notice than it seems if we don't like, find out where he is every single moment I guess. And as if by accident haha really no joke, Souma created an opportunity for himself by... uh... crashing his elephant into Maurice's room <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> so he can't sleep there no more. He still let Maurice sleep on his bed?? See, Souma is the best guy on the planet. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I know right, Ciel is getting real deja vu right about now. Not about his bedroom, but still. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> This did allow Souma to spend the night with Maurice though (lol don't think too much this isn't BL), and that's where all his secrets are revealed. Yeah, even doing up his makeup. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You sure that isn't done by some of his underlings? <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways, with the evidence they have, it's time for confrontation. I mean, obviously Ciel isn't scared of this Maurice at any point even if the latter has a gang waiting outside the room for him if anything goes wrong, because, well, he is prepared. For starters, Ciel has Midford. Yes, his fiancé's brother. Don't think their relationship is ruined because of the one meeting with the Prefects, but purely so, is Ciel able to get help to address the situation when it gets dirty. And dirty it did hehe, because as much as Maurice wanted to shame him in front of the school with a photo which we can't show on TV lmao, Ciel also ensured Redmond gets wind of all the problems that are happening in the room, with like, rigged paintings tied to taut strings in a room? Damn, that's only a thing I did in my childhood but not a century ago. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Also, you think he didn't choose a room close to the gazebo in distance than in access to it? Remote, my a**-) And don't remind Ciel that he was the younger brother too- Uh oh spoiler alert we haven't reached that far yet huh. OOPS haha forget I said that, but yeah, if it's revenge, Ciel is always prepared to shame you, even if it's at the expense of one heck of a butler. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> HE HAS THE FINAL LAUGH YOU BITCH- All in all haha, what an episode, wasn't it! Damn, I don't remember much of these, but yeah, this is as sweet of revenge as it can get. And that's what the whole series is about anyways even though this isn't the final boss, and in case you need reminder from watching this 15 years ago- IT HAS BEEN THAT LONG?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Damn, I'm old. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, now that we got this idiot out of the way, we finally have a direct route to the Headmaster talk, so let's see what he has got to say. I'm pretty sure the dark stuff is impending, so we shall see how far this takes us. </div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRaCoctdknP31fkJ2rcQoTXbMfi4Ac7Qv3rc_BYasrmCDjPq46Kg0U2tLWqVStGZ495QvCT1eIGLwBCCUnlDo2szJLubX5ShN4TywTRqi6NcnQ2y6pNYvex9U94yP1T6hwYdhTvJZ4tGSh_oBGIdfykalBTpr_JUs2KM07nV9-JQ3ghplU2TQK-5-I5Vw/s320/kuroshitsujischool03_bed.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I shall prove to you that this is not a BL series:<br>Uh... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaYDZnU8WgwAe_zyonRaata-R-MZC8vwMe6aGMdbo3GubgdqCCTkx5YAyLK_mLISbM2RQmAjy0xnVEHFnX3Xzx7WLDk-2z4y1CjQUCErxK-jQir4oLjF45eYL5PuWeBCLtbFvHE0BilCw8qW9BOospHDwXiBXh32VPOLVwru2gwZ95UeeWpYi0sL64Vpo/s320/kuroshitsujischool03_bros3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I shall prove to you that this is not a BL series:<br>No, this I can explain <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></table></div></div><div>P.S.

But I think my love is different than the kind she feels." This series in a nutshell haha</div></blockquote><div>Oh Himari-chan thanks to you this is also the reason why I'm still watching this, to be honest. If it's just straight girls love I AM OUT!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Wow, literally got friendzoned just because you love guys differently than her though?? <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> Haha oh well, what are friends for anyways Yori-senpai is so much nicer in this new episode (#SasaKoi03) because what she did previous episode was EVIL lol well, not evil, but selfish. I mean, confessions are selfish, right? It's a favour to ask to someone to be yours? I know right, Miki-chan won't explain this much in. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, we still got the idea, so let's see how Himari-chan here got to a conclusion because damn, she can't love for anything. Well, love as in friends and between girls are a thing, by the way. But yeah, anything beyond that? You better tell us straight up. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And we take this from two interviews (lmao) she did with her friend, and her mom. Yeah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> For the friend though, looks like she just hang out with the guy the one time and felt like she liked him, and everything else is history. Which then brings us back. If Himari-chan wants more time with the senpai and vice versa, so yeah, they should date. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'll take my leave. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well not so simple, let's hear the mom out who probably didn't know the dad is cheating on her and not coming back home LMAO can we not. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In the mom's standpoint though, the dad was insistent about it, but that's how guys work and I am not a guy lol yeah didn't try hard enough, but the idea was same with the friend. The initial confession or anything isn't real, we just do that because it's hard to suppress such feelings, as with Yori-senpai too. After that though, even if it ends up in a rejection which will of course suck for this as it'll ruin all the music stuff we have built up so far, they can still be friends, we can technically still hang out together, but things will be different. And since Himari-chan is nice and innocent we can roast her on the pit fire without her knowing lmao you poor thing, she... is basically giving the senpai a chance. A chance to spent more time together, but not exactly a chance for Yori-senpai to, I don't know, hugs and kisses with her?? Haha if that happens I might just stop watching. Till now though, coming back, I DO wonder what I think about this series. Yeah, I'm thinking as hard as Himari-chan here, even longer than her because yeah, from the start. And I feel like I should reach the same conclusion as her: Just give this a watch and if anything fails and maybe I'll still watch it till the end. The animation quality may remind me of how bad it is for a bit, but again, romance shows focusing on that isn't much of a thing these days until they are important, and besides, the lore here is much more than what everything else this series has to offer. So yeah, maybe I'll take a look at this till the end. I might just regret my decision so far, and there are probably better series to watch this season like that No.8 beast thing... but heck, we're on the Yori-Himari ship already I'll just ride it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Besides, the music is going to carry us there, right? Yori-senpai is already giving what we want. Well, just that she doesn't like me haha CRINGE lol it's fine though Himari-chan can be happy for once and that is good enough. *thumbs up* And I can be happy too with just the voice cast so <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> no really the band members are doing a lot of heavy lifting here</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEid2keN0CDFu8mfKG1dQHF7eqKUVPDxyjgpGRH_Vw8Fv4c5eYIhl4U6qCiSJO8SU_OHnRU3fXHiVRYySoiYPfzZbthGf9vMw1_czVnhvO34Il7-_DIxH4YizYE1oUZ_5mKKx04P-xn0F8QJ2YR_Yubjk1yqoRPmtx6DgyMptbH6KxtAA56xZrvez-Eknu4/s320/sasakoi03_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What I want out of <strike>Himari-chan</strike> this series haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAf4e07fZfXx6NAfJQm_s4AqYHk4ISxkhT3F-M35gPa-EJ99nosPswj44PtyR0BTyySkk7cDEVF45TkcB1ABpidVpdlp4QLh-eP7eDMMKlK0eW6-pyKBHUNJlmkl_HqAQuB9cNtRCjM_WNIsSrx09fEE-XJRklzCWXlY12E1ygoq_u3WVZvn_LJUQdFeg/s320/sasakoi03_cat1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Damn, do they make this cute look so cute</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaRiyKQ9AXlWSVlGspBvNp8HmCuyBJ8brt_u0SlXRamBxcmQrGjAKtYGLNthv4gVbXBmd14B3qyd6Rf4EAZzOiC5ATO5-eepT7fgG6tW3AtnIBeHLHhl571s4_PkxoH22-fQUV0AYtabErLtC6xKywOQ0SoSWKpbu6GibaNV2sheZKGTzGC8XzGh-Ql4I/s320/sasakoi03_himari8.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Not as cute as this one though MUAHAHAHA</table></div></div><div>P.S.

What I was here for though if you are reminded, is the ending theme song for an Anime in the previous season, and then I just ended up giving a couple more songs because it reminded me of other songs I've heard of. Thanks to Toyosaki Aki's radio show on Thursday which I accidentally tuned in because I was bored lmao, I ended up listening to a song she played which led me to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/so-precious-ep/1737146563?l=en-US" target=_blank>Asaka's new single</a></b>, which made me realize this is Anime "Yuru Camp" ending theme song, and basically find out that the title song was written by Sasaki Eri oh hey girl long time to see.

So those are (already all out FYI) <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/cinematic-parade/1737740697?i=1737740867&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank><b>nasuo's new song</b></a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/the-parade-of-battlers/1737982818?i=1737982826&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank><b>Otoha's new song</b></a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/stardust-memory/1735516488?i=1735516502&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank><b>Kawasaki Takaya's new song</b></a>, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/spica/1739746991?i=1739746992&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>Kamishiraishi Mone's new song</a></b> which released last week, <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/follow-your-arrows/1740060249?i=1740060547&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank><b>Sasakura Kana's new song</b></a> under SSGIRLS band name for the Anime, and then if I have time I'll deal with the character songs used as theme songs, like <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/etoile-memoir/1737740608?i=1737740610&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank><b>Alice from "Shinigami Bocchan"</b></a> and <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/gifty/1740060249?i=1740060788&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank><b>Himari-chan from "SasaKoi"</b></a>. Oh yeah <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/reaper/1734750342?i=1734750654&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>SennaRin's new song</a></b> too I haven't even given that yet! (not newest anymore, she released something this month) So you see, next week can be busy if I wasn't busy taking breaks from work. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> They all have something in common because THEY DO NOT LIKE FORMAL RELEASES NO MORE lol relax, me.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Oh yeah, so about next week's Fanfiction week. I think I might just stick with the Golden Week special instead of doing every one of the weekdays mainly because I will be working and I don't want to rush things at night (or if they don't let me have the night lmao <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span>), and also it's more aligned to what I want to do for Japan's grand holiday season. I know right, I have to get work leave to look like I'm one of them? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Well, I have more plans than ever for the blog moving forward considering its 10th anniversary is in less than 3 months, so let's see if I can make it happen. I'll make sure the Fanfiction stuff happens though, I'm already changing my phone wallpapers according to who I'll be featuring for the day. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> I also did fix some of the earlier stories specifically the first two to give it more depth and context (because I didn't establish who I was back then just some normie lol) so yeah, I changed a lot of things but not like you realized. See you guys next time then, and until next time... I feel like I should say this, but I am ever so seriously considering if I should go to <a href=https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/series/mosaic-music-series/hitsujibungaku target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's live in my area</a> since <a href=https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1782650775858233774 target=_blank>they are doing an Asia tour</a>. By the way, I have been reluctant to go for even Rie fu's lives even if they are free like, a decade ago, so I doubt this will make me change my mind also I hardly know the band, but I do the same thing watching live videos on my PC so why not just support them while I'm at it, eh? Yeah, something for me to think about hoenstly haha more than the package forming up end of the month MUAHAHA I'll update you guys next week then.</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
