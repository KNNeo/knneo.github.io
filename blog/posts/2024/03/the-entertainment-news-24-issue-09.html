We shall see about that. Same handler as my Twitter though, I changed that too.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyhow, a less complicated week this week, hopefully I will get better after whatever trip to the doctor's (again) has done to my physical health... let's not talk about those and focus on Anime and music!! Yeah, I'm "only into Japanese animation and music culture", what of it? (No one's gonna understand that Bluesky profile written in Chinese  along with Japanese haha)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanaTen08><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"This has become a problem" Oh what else is new haha</div></blockquote><div>Oh damn, the whole class already knew about you two doing the hanky-panky? Who ratted us out? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where telecommunication is faster than Lily's little feet running to school lol kawaii (#KanaTen08), yeah Hirota just needs to be sad enough for someone to ask questions, especially if it's about Lily-chan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> School drama, by the way, be reminded that this is still in a high school setting, after all. So, in continuation to what happened previous episode as if a couple walked out of a love hotel, well it's kind of similar that it's a guy walking about of a girl's... place... I wish I was Hirota. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, not like Hirota ratted them out, but let's just say Yuuka-chan had a big mouth. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Didn't take too long for the whole class to know about it and Yuuka-chan to stick her finger into Lily-chan because technically they are still rivals and no one wins for getting Hirota anyways he is basically my crushed hopes (get it, crush?), and <a href=https://jisho.org/search/manga target=_blank>manga</a> freak Koyamatsu-san here to analyse the situation at hand. WHO?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways haha, this girl thinks that the two aren't being weird to each other not even in the acting phase that they have been so good at doing to each other lol watch back the intro of this series for answers, but more of being less suspicious to the extent of eliminating that these two have a thing for each other out of the window just like how Akutsu was letting out of the window his marbles- How wrong is this even? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then again, I don't think Yuuka-chan is giving up by now, so she did a bunch of things that aren't like herself, thinking she will get Hirota jealous (which she didn't) but more of on Lily-chan just because. Akutsu got the lucky end of this though, spending the weekend not hunting down his own kind and going shopping with I would argue best girl in the series just because <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, only to realize (soon enough) that they were being followed. I mean, is that surprising though? Says Tanigawa who is also dragged into all this. Blah blah blah it was a great date between Yuuka and Akutsu lmao, they were in the park bench, and Lily-chan is wet. Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I know right, this is the author going "how can I make hiding from sight more exciting" just because he can? 10/10 for originality, I'll give you that, even though I rather Yuuka-chan be on that same position. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Obviously Yuuka-chan was here to ask all the suspicious questions to Akutsu, in which he did answer honestly but also simultaneously break the poor angel heart of Amane Lily. Oh you poor thing, Lily-chan. Only Kyari-san is able to console you now. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I meant ending theme song, what are you talking about, I didn't read the source material. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Lily-chan did soak herself too long in a feet-deep body of water though, so I wonder who will be here to save her. All in all... alright I think the romance arc is over? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, I did watch this because of the romance, so I'm just glad it's working out as expected. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I thought we were all acting here? I mean, Akutsu sure is though, not sure about Lily-chan. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Looks like someone is here to stir trouble soon, and as far as I know they might be the antagonist of the season? So let's properly introduce who it is by then, yes?

But serious talk though MORE ACTION?? SIGN ME UP!! <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> In this new episode where it suddenly got cold for no reason (#MajoToYajuu07) haha yeah even me too and I'm not even in the world, we are facing the commander of the Paladin Corps that has been summoned to catch an innocent witch with a Demon Sword, if you would recall. I got that right, yes? Yeah, that priest in the castle is more than suspicious. Okay, let's talk about what's the obvious about this incident first. Well, for starters, the Paladin Corps are acting under orders to deal with a witch who killed 6 people. But seriously though, given Helga's reputation of being single and wanting to date handsome dudes, how would she deal with SIX of them at once is- This is not a porno. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And given what we knew from the previous episode, Helga here is way too suspicious to deal such damage in the city. Interesting thing is, that it's that serious, the Paladin Corps had to be called in. Sure, not every governing body will call upon the Order to help them out, but heck, is this serious though? And just because she had a Demon Sword which she probably can't even unleash? Yeah, think twice, commander who is not <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/245/Toushirou_Hitsugaya target=_blank>Hitsugaya from "BLEACH"</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yeah, this Matt never thought of how this is all way too sus? <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> I mean, what do I know, I don't play Among Us. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Okay references over, after much of a meaningless cat chase, Matt did get hold of Gideau and Helga and took them back to the castle, only to stop Ashaf on his feet (literally, encased in ice) and hear him talk about what incident this might have turned out to be. So, the less obvious stuff. We know that the old priest in the castle is likely someone working for the bad guys, and looks like we are right, but calling them Executioners might be too ominous even for me so uh... bad guys. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And not like everyone is against this guy now, purely because the Demon Sword may have let out too much influence to make the Paladin soldiers fight against one another (deja vu tbh, I thought that not Bankai sounds familiar) (haha alright I'll stop), but what we did NOT expect is that Matt's aide here who looks like another commander (who is also super hot ngl) ensured Matt's downfall at the right time to stop him from realizing that he might be standing on fire (get it?) without even noticing what is wrong. Yeah, too much, too late, huh. Don't know if Ashaf is able to deal with TWO mages at once (I mean, I just want to deal with one, serve that woman up <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>) (why does she sound so good though- oh, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/34/Yuu_Kobayashi target=_blank>Kobayashi Yuu</a>) (haha), but one Executioner sure isn't able to deal with two rug rats in the castle. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Apart from Gideau being quite a rowdy one haha hell yeah brother, Helga also made the right decision to not activate the Demon Sword's powers (from my Anime experience she is probably right), AND at least ensure the Sword won't fall into enemy hands, as long as the enemy isn't that Executioner we kept talking about who isn't Helga's cup of tea. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What will happen next? Your guess is as good as mine. I gotta say though? It really feels like we are threatened to unleash the Demon Sword even though I FREAKING SWEAR there will be dire consequences in doing so even the Lord himself may not be able to deal with, so uh... maybe we try to do it at some point, I guess? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Just don't kill my dear Miyu-chan, uh, Helga-chan, she <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hinsou target=_blank>smol</a> and she cute and she needs a boyfriend and I want to still give her that option. If you want to join the queue, you gotta sign up for <a href=https://tomitamiyu.com/mob/ target=_blank>her fanclub</a> first though. I did it already, very recently. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> </div><div>[TL:DR; How many people you think are dead as of now? Haha my guess? Let's say 0, yes?

I'm still stuck on giving <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/believe-single/1730876787?l=en-US" target=_blank>LUCK LIFE's new song</a></b> because damn is this not their best, so I might just skip it if you don't hear from me about it next week. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%B9%BE%E5%84%84%E5%85%89%E5%B9%B4-ep/1730928736?l=en-US" target=_blank>Omoinotake's new single</a></b> I suppose for a drama series is definitely hot even in the J-Pop industry, not hot enough to be on my shelf though, a bit too reminiscent of their usual style I'm not too fancy of. Yeah, it's more of their unusual ones that make the difference. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tenshi-datta-janaika-ep/1727968422?l=en-US" target=_blank>Base Ball Bear's new EP</a></b> and one which I have not been listening to them for a while, is alright, not much to offer to be frank their usual style isn't strong, but I still picked up one song I felt sang to me. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tears-single/1731984357?l=en-US" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's new song</a></b> isn't any impactful too so I skipped it. I also went the extra mile (as mentioned last week if I do) to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%9C%AA%E7%9F%A5%E3%81%AE%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88%E5%9B%B3-ep/1730928214?l=en-US" target=_blank>spira.spica's new mini-album</a></b> and I think my motivation for listening to this... band? This artist now, is for Mikaha-san singing cute love songs. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I'm sold, sing no more. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/portrait/1729546776?l=en-US" target=_blank>Fujifabric's new album</a></b> sounds more interesting than the competition here though, as I try to give more chance to their title songs to no avail, and ended up giving the end of the album track list which featured either quaint, emotional songs (which I think they are good at) and wacky ones because how can you not get over <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/lets-get-it-on/1538107107?i=1446249522&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>that jackoff song</a> that many years ago? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Fs in chat for my-</div><div><br></div><div>I also took the chance to listen to some live albums including <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/wacci-live-at-%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E6%AD%A6%E9%81%93%E9%A4%A8-2021-youdience/1730894444?l=en-US" target=_blank><b>wacci's live from 2021</b></a>, and <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/just-like-this-2023-live/1730871602?l=en-US" target=_blank><b>SPYAIR's live from last year</b></a> featuring YOSUKE the new singer. Don't ask if I listened to all, I only pick <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/saijokyu-wacci-live-at-nippon-budoukan-2021-youdience/1730894444?i=1730894838&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>the</a> <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/just-one-life-just-like-this-2023-live/1730871602?i=1730871814&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>ones</a> I like. IKE-san still better though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright, it's different, it's like if someone shaved their beard away, you know?</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, still news from Twitter/X because I don't think any music artist is promoting themselves on Bluesky. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Someday, someday my newly created account will have some use. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, <b><a href="https://x.com/shionnu10/status/1762229133583822876?s=20" target=_blank>Tsuji Shion your live tour video to China</a></b> is great but damn if you can't open a convenience store plastic packaging for their packed lunch, I'm pretty sure you're doing it wrong. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (From what she did, the way to do it is snap that plastic edge, and then open the inner cap. Don't think she figured that out lol) <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1762402943758934469?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari is releasing a new song</a></b> <strike>next month</strike> in a month (borderline weeks are the worst) and looks like it's for a product commercial. <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1762495432545153247?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new live video</a></b> should get you excited if you listened to their single end of last year which I didn't so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> haha alright moving on. Yeah, also <b><a href="https://x.com/inoriminase/status/1762779927806624200?s=20" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new live video</a></b> if you listened to her single from last year. Somehow I think I'm losing out in a lot of the action. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/_tokyo_pjm_/status/1763542441108586780?s=20" target=_blank>Aimer's music video light effects are projection mapped onto a building in Tokyo</a></b> this weekend which looks cool if you remember the music video itself. And I'll just take a listen to some of the <b>short music videos from Ikimonogakari's tribute album</b> covered by various artists including <a href="https://x.com/wacci_jp/status/1764168947224727815?s=20" target=_blank>wacci-san</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1764257706653925807?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai</a> to name a few I know just because the former introduced a new generation of music artists, in case you don't know how old we all are now. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> And to wrap us up, <b><a href="https://x.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1764289633809047974?s=20" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new album trailer</a></b> is definitely refreshing to say the least, so let's hope this one holds up with PONY CANYON assigned song producers on the line, I saw Okii Reiji already your album cannot be bad. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> I'm already backlashed with the single songs I rejected already haha</div><div><br></div><div>So next week, hmm we have a couple from releases including <b>miwa's new single</b> battling it against <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/party-ep/1725467568?l=en-US" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</a></b> which I highly doubt the latter will win but damn are they losing the war anyways because I wasn't keen on any of them at this point (hehe), so if they fall off then I'll take the chance to dig out some (sort of) older releases since I missed out <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/green-jade-ep/1730928467?l=en-US" target=_blank>ChouCho's new single</a></b> released this week, and I didn't even know <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/seven-pops/1726934179?l=en-US" target=_blank>seven oops' new album</a></b> dropped in January. So yeah, still a hectic week if I tried. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Damn, these Tomiya Miyu fanclub videos are geat- Ah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sadly it's just related to her dog stuff because damn will she make a birthday cake for her doggo but not me. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> If you want to know what I liked about her, I gotta say that her chubby face isn't my thing, but her character and learning to give back to her fans, and of course her voice, are really boosting my appeal points of her, so keep it up, Miyu-chan. On other things, spending my precious weekend naps (What?? Haha) doing up the blog, patching for a lot of minor stuff which are tedious to do, because damn is its 10th anniversary drawing near and I need to plan to move to a new site, if I am going to. My plan so far is just to route this place to the new site, of which by then it will have waaaay more code overhead than what is running this cr*ppy place now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I got used to this web editor, dude, ain't got anything out there to offer such flexibility which I have now. Anyways, see you next week, I already know I will be doing one, no, two MORE posts next week <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, so look forward to that I guess.
