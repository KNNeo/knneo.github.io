<div>New month, new story, I guess! I mentioned before this one will also be to celebrate another occasion and boy I have been coping with these feelings of love for her all this week, I feel like breaking it to her now that I have a girlfriend <em>miiiiight</em> be a bad idea after all.</div><div><br></div><div>As such, we will delay the sadder story, for next time. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>I know right, there's that many people who want to be with me. Who am I, an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ikemen target=_blank>ikemen</a>- Oh, fictional me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, sorry for actually dreaming earlier that was a nice nap knowing that my coughing can be saved yet again lol, so let's properly daydream now. I gotta continue to show how cool I am to the girls, aren't I- Oh, fictional me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>If she isn't annoying enough here as she says she is, that's normal. She is infatuated towards me, naturally she will behave weird- Oh, fictional me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Let's get to it!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Takahashi Rie dressed in a flower dress with translucent sleeves, holding a teddy bear" border=0 data-original-height=342 data-original-width=512 height=134 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gg548881.jpg title="Takahashi Rie" width=200></div><div></div><blockquote><div><i>Our boss won a pair of tickets to a coveted theme park and announced it to the whole office. He also declared, after I rejected the offer, that I bring Takahashi-san along with me as a reward for our efforts, hinting that we were a couple of sorts. I did message her that night, and she chose the following weekend.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>On the day itself, she dressed up in a beautiful flowery dress with see-through sleeves. We had fun throughout the day but I felt like she may have noticed my lack of enthusiasm compared to hers, and that I should do something to make up for it.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>We passed by a toy store and Takahashi-san stopped because she saw a teddy bear and told me it was cute. Taking the opportunity, I told her I would get it for her even if she was hesitant. I got my hands on one and passed it on to her.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em><abbr title=今日はありがとう。>"Thanks for today."</abbr></em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>She stared at me with a pair of beady eyes. She also mentioned that it was her birthday today, and I gave her the birthday she wanted.</i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>What? It was her birthday?? <span class=emoji title=😲>*gasp*</span> Haha ah hey, you knew this was coming, you knew. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Also, IT'S NOT JUST A BIRTHDAY IT'S A DATE YOU BLOCKHEAD- Haha yeah, I'm just scolding fictional me for thinking that this is <em>just</em> happening on her birthday. Like, bro, she picked her birthday and went with you to a "coveted" (can't say DorsneyLand or something lmao) theme park, just the two of you?? Normally this will involve at least 2 other people spying on us but heck, let's pretend that did not exist, yes?</div><div><br></div><div>So yeah, this is quite a colleague-friend relationship we've had so far. Going out for meals, went to her place, even quite practically going on a theme park date on her birthday? How much of a couple aren't we?? Even those rumours are spreading in the office. <em>Surely</em> Rieri must have <em>some</em> thoughts about my relation with her... right? Oh, not for me I don't, fictional me doesn't overthink he only thinks about his girlfriend which IRL me doesn't have lol</div><div><br></div><div>Takahashi Rie, I will <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%8E%E3%82%85%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8-%E3%81%9A%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8/1730928214?i=1730928677&amp;l=en-US" target=_blank>hug you forever</a> if I could, the way you hugged that teddy bear. I promise you. <span class=emoji title=😘>*kiss*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Okay time for dinner I won't be eating her out but-</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction"><span class="material-icons small-icons">category</span>The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
