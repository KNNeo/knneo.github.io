Heck, at least I didn't forget this week has White Day and wrote that one fanfic and also unintentionally reveal the line-up for the rest of the month hehe you're welcome.</div><div><br></div><div>Well, not like anyone cares anyways (lol), so welcome back to another week of Anime and music! The new season is upon us though, "Majou to Yajuu" will probably conclude a little later considering it took a break, but I'm not so let's keep up with the newest stuff! All the info and opinions I provide here are free. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanaTen10><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"This hot dude is Amane's elder brother?" Is that how Lily-chan got her fancy towards handsome guys like Akutsu? Haha just asking</div></blockquote><div>Hey, this doesn't have to be love. Holdings hands until you sleep can be family stuff. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh right, angel and demons can't be family because in this episode (#KanaTen10) I think even within the family we have problems. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Someone's elder brother Zwei is here downtown. Which yeah, probably doesn't mean good things at this point, but we'll take it one step at a time just like whatever happened behind their back, yikes. Anyways, Zwei was nice enough to just ask his sister out into the park for questioning, and I mean, Lily-chan did answer all of them properly without much issue until, as expected, it's not that hard to suspect that the trap in which the avatar was concealed in can only work with a presence of a demon around. I mean, I would've just said that I was dealing with another demon nearby too when I activated it, but Lily-chan isn't exactly a good liar and we need Akutsu to stop snooping up on the rooftops lol. Then again, as Akutsu reports to his boss, he also knew that all of this happening right now is technically easier to resolve if Lily-chan just got rid of him and all of this will be over. So yeah, I mean, it's technically her fault. Okay, gotta go! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Of course Akutsu didn't or else this will end as fast as the start of this story, so yeah, cool guy to the rescue, I suppose. And of course we can't expect the fight to go any well, and seeing that Lily-chan isn't exactly helping out in this showdown, I don't think we need to know what's going on with the family drama even with Akutsu innocently being involved in all of this only to be pinned down by... Yo Zwei are you <a href=https://jisho.org/search/rorikon target=_blank>lolicon</a> or what, why FOUR little girls as your avatar? Oh, displeasure from this not cute <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a>, got it. In my blank thoughts I also wonder if Nan-chan was indeed for me- Oh, fictional me. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Zwei then revealed to the unknowing demon that, among other things Lily-chan isn't, she is likely also not much of a powerful angel herself, which will explain why he and the elder sister will never think that Amane Lily here with her fake skin (women, amirite??) and even fake wings made out of her own power chains (I legit thought I would also see like, a homeless guy or beast out of her true form but) (lol), could take down anything decent by herself other than just demons. So NOT the trap that was set within the avatar, got it. So now what? Is this it? Lily-chan will just take this all in, or Akutsu gonna do something about it? Hmm... I don't know, what do you think is next? Looks like Akutsu got something up his sleeve? I hope so, because so far he only has one demon eye, I assume the other eye will get him to his true form. Isn't he somewhat also beast type, just having a humanoid form? I'm not sure, I just watched this. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> But yeah, extrapolating what is just ridicule is rather stupid at this point, but I would like to think it's for some purpose, which I think we will be let into the lore soon enough considering we now know Lily-chan is nothing compared to her siblings. I know right, what are the chances that this is a "BLEACH" scenario where she is nerfed just like how Rukia was? From the looks of it, she might be just a weak angel because she was cursed or something, by likely the sister. I don't know, I guess we will find out next week if Akutsu (or his boss) could do anything about this. It's hard to take this seriously after all the jokes we had for the past couple of months tbh lmao can't wait for Akutsu to be killed in front of the girl HAHA NOW we can stop.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPrYMgoeLmyghLHvC-A3rmN9FoJszAVM56sOVffxA7HfCUV-1JFESGSTwF35I5PCG92YTZXmqpEGy7Pg_Gw9kJUSLhvykraRlEUlM_djwNySs90WcryqomPZGh3eveZjIKZ0h64bZ_gZDHT26LCQjCqhHL0PJF-ue-6fFYBGZkSjY9iiUgJWiMkqY7J2c/s320/kanaten10_zwei7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>What gamers think being cool looks like<br>(Haha what is this, RGB angel wings?)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmaTyhkDSh7OAfUmu0CLZ_MuRNVyRAiQK8Dir-TJvjHQgofatpQL99NbUVcGZIV53IKEWWo4kZQPIgZnefEU4D3uEMj7AQJ-1fbjdviNCM4qKPO_j4CHGVBrNI-KvztQurVwdkiGopFcKsYIpwapX3TUCwSPVCfY0hf5f72ZIyZDI8NgI37FwwUcPcuCg/s320/kanaten10_tear.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>*Not a porno, by the way<br>(Haha nice)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

Yeah me too dude, wo hen jing ya HAHA (oh you need a translation for this? <span class=emoji title=😲>*gasp*</span> lol you're welcome)</div><div>P.P.S. "How did you defeat the avatar that our sister blessed?" Ooo sweats down the spine until that one episode we fought her with the help of a demon- Then again did he do anything? Well, I guess having one more person to help is already an issue since she works alone, huh.</div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=MajoToYajuu09><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Majo to Yajuu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Blood is filling my mouth, so I can't tell what my first kiss tastes like." WHAT?? Haha I don't want to kiss no more ngl</div></blockquote><div>I mean, this is <strike>"Blood and Kisses"</strike> "Witches and Beasts", right? This arc has serious lack of the latter right now though. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Then again not like the previous one had any haha it's just Phanora... and... Oh, Johan? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, this new episode continues on the action I so anticipated (#MajoToYajuu09), and boy did this turn out quite an action-packed episode indeed! Just a reminder of what happened in case you forgot. Two girls kissed. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah more than that lol I like how they ensured this lore went a little deeper so we can get this <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yuri target=_blank>yuri</a> action going if the actual action didn't please the target audience haha ah hey, a kiss between a witch and Gideau essentially means the curse is lifted, and the beast can be awakened from the coffin. And damn, are the reactions to this thing at this point more interesting than what we saw in the very first episode. Well firstly, there isn't just the one witch. As summarized by Ashaf, we have the Demon Sword Ashgan, we have Matt Cugat who has the Ice Elemental on his side and he is still struggling to fight against the former, and we have... Gideau the Beast, let's call that. It doesn't really have a name and I assume they are two of the same thing so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> haha Ashaf calls the beast by her name so we'll take that. Everything mentioned from here on is better experienced yourself, but in summary as much as the aggression goes, looks like Ashgan can just cut through literally anything, even if he has been <strike>asleep</strike> sealed (oops, they can't sleep) for centuries. Yeah, this Sword is just warming up just by fighting with those two. You guys are just training material to him now. *yikes* Haha oh well, good game everyone. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Because dude, he just cut through EVERYTHING!! I mean, we don't know for sure if he is like, <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPGv4ZIT6REt_uAoKQ4fAAKZtmU0L8pE4fzIDJADWB9aIRq_Gz2nlJOFchxS2uTSHB6NVsOXs2tm-rGUKtFk9bZ90kUyzboJX66lJvnhfTyFVh8fiDxX1CayrYXPdn9y7ni6bIV7oNTqX88gG4fy_hcrYa-DMhMLn9P-69Va5vl5cQKjOCNWOCMnKsqa4/s320/577Nozarashi.jpg target=_blank>Zaraki Kenpachi with his zanpakuto</a> but uh (sorry for the "BLEACH" reference again)... in this world it is kinda absolute for what it is! And yeah, Gideau is just playing the defence role now it's kinda unreal. Thank goodness this is Anime. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Ironically though, Gideau the Beast is able to hold its ground despite being cut through the middle by Ashgan breaking its face mask, and was able to deliver a decisive blow just like <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEii1RpWxPK161K68bUrUOolf0rd8BHRkY8y41bqMx2XfM_XGI6BOXvu6g-LFLX6CSXCqu2-Cix1FCQ0D7mxr_QajHK4oiBoQNdUvFl3iTLTB5vOsnAdEhCojq-DpXWQZFkSL2fOIA2is9PVuD1x6lqw1dwkW5fhG21lffGYLrorG_DF0Rj-mu0zwfrYPBg/s320/Ep158BrazoDerechaDeGigante.jpg target=_blank>Sado Yasutora with his right arm</a>, the one that doesn't kill. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (I know right, dear author did you steal from "BLEACH" though, honestly asking?) The Sword isn't destroyed by any means, and it can be repaired and later sealed by Helga again I suppose, but meanwhile, we have stopped the inevitable from happening. Oh, we also stopped that Executioner. Two of them too. They don't kiss LMAO, but they are kinda stealth by breaking into the Paladin Corps right on set in order to fulfil their motive of taking the Sword their way. Evil, and yeah I guess Matt here is too nice. He doesn't have to anymore though, the fates of these two baddies are sealed, unlike Ashgan. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Well, in Matt's defence, they did kill a lot of people he kept alive so that is kind of crossing the line so RIP Howell I can't believe we had to kill Kobayashi Yuu (in Anime) again lol last time we did that was <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/45887/Sasha_Blouse target=_blank>Sasha in "Attack on Titan"</a> haha at least from my experience. All in all... GREAT EPISODE by the way the best so far, and I can feel towards what the lore behind Ashgan's seal is about by letting him be conscious (and super awake) but physically disabled, how Quena has quite a resemblance to Helga (to the point of voice acting too I think also Tomita Miyu, no proof for that though), and that feeling of hate I don't know what to call it, sugar daddy? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Either way as Ashgan concluded, it's in some way the witch's curse. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Hey Helga, get yourself a boyfriend someday, don't stick around to some demon sword, this thing can't get you laid on your first date. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Otherwise, I would hope Helga will join the Order as a witch since she won't be the only one shout out to Phanora again, and we may never cross paths with the Paladin Corps again. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Looks like next episode we might be touching on Gideau's origin story? Oh great, is this some thing where she doesn't know why she is cursed by a witch and we have to travel back in time to kill her? Haha thankfully this isn't <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/155895/Bocchan target=_blank>Bocchan in "Shinigami Bocchan"</a>, so we shall see what her story is.</div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiWdCZQQBcYu8fi-DSkcr08KfOHOJXRWt54S1SraXV662HL3NRLQJcsNDiHv84f9JpDpaKTkR0SheK4npj18StUfZpWNGLUcrW1rwhmpotaDZku4Tmht2QvX5P3jQG77PfS0kkvpv2bJb3UbPAgfnfRQeG_KKN5yp_hmKTSNSCQY49XPKMCkFcx_Oa5L8/s320/majoutoyajuu09_helga8.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Love is...<br>(I know right, so cringe hugging a demon sword)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVEifTed6NU2McKODkKxFx4lwivsZzMQdt6izfPmMvIfyLtf4ozqzRz8xbI4zf7nHwQIc9dwTSLSV4bsGqE4TopK0IVd0e9Ek6S86d2DH688xVrbAa3FUyRKt8ZdACUA8yAmIaozBaDeMgWl22FqSy3iLK6Qx5FZGPWhs5LTPqUtURf3_KsZFzCIuhGsY/s320/majoutoyajuu09_kiss.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Love is...<br>(Haha oh <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hitomi target=_blank>being watched</a>, are we?)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

For starters though, the anticipated <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/marbles-ep/1732377935?l=en-US" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new EP</a></b> is not bad, I did not give the old songs <a href="https://x.com/aozakish/status/1767714910580904194?s=20" target=_blank>I did not even realize they have changed music labels</a> anyways, but I did give the new songs, so that's good enough evidence I missed their style despite subpar melodies which I will not comment much on for now. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%96%B0%E8%BF%B7%E5%AE%AE-ep/1730674196?l=en-US" target=_blank>FINLANDS' major debut EP</a></b> (yeah I know right haha single member band btw) isn't bad, but also isn't any interesting but I did like the first track on the list which isn't the title song so maybe just that. I also took a listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/candle-songs-ep/1732967085?l=en-US" target=_blank>a flood of circle's new EP</a></b> with title song produced by Gotch from ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION- Why do I even talk about it so much it isn't even good as expected anyways. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well, this band's style has died on me already, I'll be darned if they can get me going moving forward. Hit and a miss, these past few weeks or even just this year alone. Oh well, bring in the next one! Haha</div><div><br></div><div>Oh, just so you know, we only talk about new songs here, and things that are directly to them, like new releases or artist info. So don't ask why they revealed the cover art and I'm not talking about it. It's not that important. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What are important though, is probably <b><a href="https://x.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1769317757865411069?s=20" target=_blank>Natsukawa Shiina's new music video</a></b> which damn you wished she wore a tighter outfit just because <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, but also, with Tabuchi-sensei behind the helm, looks like the last time he wrote a song for her was better? I don't know, ask me in a month when the single is out. <b><a href="https://x.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1769287636878028891?s=20" target=_blank>ClariS new song</a></b> will be for Anime no surprises there, the only surprise is if I watch it, even then if the song is good I will still give regardless. With their new EP, <b><a href="https://x.com/oral_official/status/1767478003351818390?s=20" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES released a live music video-like documentary</a></b> featuring their newest song and yeah, it has been a while since they sang an emotional tune, eh? <b><a href="https://x.com/miyustaff/status/1768562788077904323?s=20" target=_blank>Tomita Miyu's new song preview</a></b> is alright, I don't think it'll break any grounds, but I would want something better to be honest. <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1768109800704139643?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song will be for a commercial</a></b> for a vegetable drink brand I will never like (lol), because trust me, this song will be great if they can convince me to like what I drank. <span class=emoji title=🤮>*pukes*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/Finlands12/status/1767883312167854131?s=20" target=_blank>FINLANDS' new music video</a></b> from their new EP obviously did not get me, not even after whatever this thing is presenting anyways. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> Interestingly, <b><a href="https://x.com/vividundress/status/1767536048048062730?s=20" target=_blank>vivid undress' band members revealed their return in due time</a></b> and that is getting me somewhere, this feels like a SPYAIR revival thing now, so let's hope this will be something to look forward to. <b><a href="https://x.com/3_phantasia/status/1767387147286564973?s=20" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song will be for a movie</a></b>, and I'm pretty sure we are close to an album release at this rate. <b><a href="https://x.com/KroiOfficial/status/1766845709486350737?s=20" target=_blank>Kroi will be releasing a new song next week</a></b> so sudden I might like it? I don't know, kids these days like shadow drops or anything. And <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1766842742192439485?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new song is for an Anime</a></b> next season so that's interesting, it has been a while since they got such credit. </div><div><br></div><div>So for next week, we have much going on in Klassic Note. Yeah, I suppose I should give a listen to <b>Creepy Nuts' new double A-side single</b> and hopefully review that with miwa's new single if all goes well. <b>Kroi's new song</b> too, there's that. And then TWO ALBUMS haha because <b>SCANDAL's new album</b> and <b>yanaginagi's new album</b> will compete to see which regular artist in Klassic Note will disappoint me more. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I hope not lol but both have recently not broken grounds in my music library so I'm kinda worried.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Oh yeah, me? Listening to Koko-chan's radio (passively) instead of tuning into your <a href=https://jisho.org/search/imouto target=_blank>imouto</a> music video YouTube premiere? What kind of <a href=https://jisho.org/search/oniichan target=_blank>onii-chan</a> are you- I had a hunch that the latter will not be great and I was right so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> haha maybe I'll just wait for the free gift bromide photos to go to the used market instead. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you guys next week then, not much is going on in my real life which is a bad thing considering everyone else is making it worse for me <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, so wish me luck. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4nXMAIPKjj/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target=_blank>MaiMai will make me happy</a> (*opens up Instagram* See? New post), so I'm good for now. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh yeah also <a href="https://x.com/moeshiphotobook/status/1768318909063823579?s=20" target=_blank>happy birthday Toyota Moe</a> I suppose hehe this is quite a week just from seeing her half-naked body-</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I suppose I can do what I did with marupi-chan's photobook last year, I showed what was essentially naked Moeshi to my bro too hehe:</div><style>.slider-image{opacity:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}</style><div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;position:relative><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=1143 data-original-width=642 height=200 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_Q0gSOBtxdd2t0rgob0MRT1zQNEJgzwDTjCCrUNX7S8ODWLDU8gAoFFh-idjszwyuIwqNeOya4_oSlV89Jc_lgbFGkxU9EyYmmbafVNTiAgh3lJ8l5OSQrNna5QeCLQnFA45DlRzkvcSm_2jvJrJUBIF3JKmnfhpzVMJsjydtVlC7PzQWGgQ0fD4CSFc/s200/GIszUagawAA3MT-.jpg width=112><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 class=slider-image data-original-height=1143 data-original-width=642 height=200 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfxTLqkYDceW5MWvnHuuGhhhmxcSBUaRO5IKJ_84-k_HE1_XZMnk6k9ifezS7HCYgNaIUsc_I3gpmTWjLlmdlaSfAP9ArdGF6j9uq_6hqYQCKJSln9iAdfYS-sYXD4fKFX8fT_kDsRoLHyCvBEjbI17EH7KAKdljc1MPY9OPgTkeb3P0NJImwWPgtiUUI/s200/GIszUagawAA3MT-MASK.png width=112><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center><input class=slider max=100 oninput='document.querySelector(".slider-image").style.opacity=.01*this.value' type=range value=0><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>As usual, take a look around you before to move that slider to the right hehe</table></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
