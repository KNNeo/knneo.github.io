Okay let's make this quick I can barely even remember this already haha<div><br></div><div>Also is this is the first time I mixed virtual with reality? Well, not what you think but hear me out, yes?</div><div><br></div><div>"I was in a resort-like abode with a huge living area space facing the sea. I was holding a skimpy red sleepwear with black laces and I think I told to myself that this will look great on her, though I distinctively recall I also saw Ayane from DoA series around in a swimsuit, or maybe it was another person of the same name.</div><div><br></div><div>Regardless, I found Isobe Karin and she told me she is enjoying herself while wearing... I think what looks like a summer outfit? Let's say it's a dress of sorts. I told her to try this out, obviously with much reluctance from her. I said it's either she wears it now or tonight, and she took the sleepwear from me. I followed her to a corner of the living area space, and she put it on without taking anything off..."</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, lame I guess, but somehow I can't forget how Karin-chan behaved in it, almost as if I wanted this for myself. That or maybe it's influenced by the DOAXVV game because I swear the resort and that sleepwear looked familiar haha. Or was it borrowed from the same place where I dreamt the night before but I totally forgot about...? </div><div><br></div><div>Alright, dreams over, gotta wake up for work!</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheDreams"><span class="material-icons small-icons">cloud</span>The Dreams</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
