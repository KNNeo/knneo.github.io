Between making money and just being in front of my PC all day fixing up blog stuff (I didn't change anything here, just cleaning up code behind), I'm just glad I still have the sanity to write some fanfic here and there, oh boy is next month and likely the concluding month for the season going to be great. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, they don't know yet, me. Don't tease the readers. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, new season of Anime incoming which also means I better enjoy the little break from music before they throw me a buttload of new theme songs which have no physical release *oof* haha, but before all that, let us wrap stuff up.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanaTen12><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span> <span class=head-title>Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"The place you destroyed... wasn't worth protecting to begin with. And you freed Lily-san from it."</div></blockquote><div>Again, it's like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/5/Ichigo_Kurosaki target=_blank>Ichigo from "BLEACH"</a>, dude. Akutsu doesn't know of his inner Hollow powers- Wait. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this final episode of a series which hit me in places I didn't expect just don't take photos of me pls lol (#KanaTen12), well, let's conclude this properly, shall we? I don't know if this much is still in the original story Anime production likes to do fillers to give this a proper conclusion, but heck, we'll still talk about it. I just didn't expect Lilia-san can ensure she gets some blackmail from Akutsu and yet STILL be able to keep all this from Lily-chan just because the avatar doesn't share <em>her</em> emotions with the master which makes NO sense haha so yeah, just in case the demon servant gets his angel master mad again, we'll film a porno featuring Lilia-san and Akutsu going at whatever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Where do I sign up though? LMAO) Meanwhile, she should be glad that Akutsu will unlikely do such a thing apart from whenever he goes berserk but that won't happen again... right? Haha we can but hope. Though for now, maybe letting Lily-chan stay over for the night at his place was the right choice- Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I consider the conclusion to this series a fanservice episode, where we get all the damn shame, all the bullying of men letting Akutsu brush his teeth outside of his own bathroom because female rights and this is still International Women's Month lol, and I wonder if he knew that Lily-chan's <a href=https://jisho.org/search/sakura target=_blank>sakura</a>-coloured lips touched his or not. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, I'm just glad this ended rather amicably, as shown from the ending parts where Zwei phoned her sister to say this weak nothing of a sister is perfectly normal despite being able to fight a powerful avatar possession controlled by the snake power <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, and even so baiting us with the reveal of Akutsu's boss in front of Lily-chan's very eyes. So yeah, all in all a lot of stuff to cover, yet still a lot of stuff missing even if it's just a satellite battle between angels and demons and this romance in between getting sweeter than ever before. Overall though, I didn't walk in to expect anything crazy to happen and quite literally the first half is what should get you anyways hehe, but I did enjoy watching this series as much as the drawing of the characters didn't get me as much as I wanted Lily-chan could be cuter, the action though did deliver and I'm glad that's part of what will keep this series going, if anything else. Still, looking back on these episodes though, I wished there was more romance going on and I don't mean with Lilia-san that should just be a spin-off in itself LMAO I know right, but considering not like we have a hierarchy of angels and/or demons to talk about who will approach the couple anytime soon because if Lily-chan's sister ever drops by all this will be over lol, so I can't imagine there is much on the action side, so more romance maybe? Even that has been apprehensive though rather definitive as Lily-chan here somewhat expressed her love for this demon of a servant she was glad she did not exorcise... in the usual manner LMAO there are other ways to exorcise a male AFAIK <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, and I still think this might be the series' strongest point. Maybe more antics is what we need from this series. Don't expect sequels though, this isn't like the others where there's a good story and it can be a money grab for years to come. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> I may be wrong though, but this is as conclusive as it can get, in my opinion. Still worth a watch, I liked the jokes where they made this sound like a porno but it isn't, <em>every damn time</em>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBPEvOOvtwDsEY0HBr-Ilx6SZ8w8cDuZ8oYa-EQDBv1zALGnOzp4PYHFF4Ao0UIOLRj2_K1wa0AHI9aQXBpZJCSQ0GK-oYeTQ_nHd5iOvAB6C57aIv9VheeEA5zD2SJ1sxI6h0KxKzEtnZOSEbFOa26kM5MqJ73BGDcM9ciqfM1RnGfGpy-FMhWiCsuxc/s320/kanaten12_camera1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Akutsu has always been the lucky pervert, isn't it?<br>(Self-directed, self-acting, self-recorded drama lol no edits)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3OWYGooDJxZcSJij4WRNBDof3kcyKZt6n9Arr7SGZJ1QCtnrH-UTFlIxsG5-DoVh5TwcYe4l1kHmHqC4uQaUi6bKwQ_oNjJ_DLLAsy4ktDuFoQupXLEzGqbfm5h9f1kmXAOtHkoZxdimtS9lhPlYGdg2upI1OgayvbivaBW22BhP44x-yq_SBrspcfT4/s320/kanaten12_fall.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Akutsu has always been the lucky pervert, isn't it?<br>(No we can't do this we should separate work from-)</table></div></div><div>P.S.

You and your brother are surrounded by too many enemies." And you thought your life sucks, eh?</div></blockquote><div>Really though Gideau, this dude Ashaf understands you so much, it makes Helga jealous of you. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, palette reset in the new episode I guess let bygones be bygones also who can predict Angela's appearance anyways (#MajoToYajuu11), I think we are ending with another story arc. Flashback too, this is going to go well. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Anyways, storytelling time, so listen good. Story goes that Ashaf was investigating an incident in a village supposedly devoid of witches... or so they say. We have Falvell, who can't speak for heck and we also found out that she is under a line of powerful witches who articulate their spells through speech than in writing, which makes her case sort of suspicious as if someone placed a curse on her just to not let her cast any kind of spell. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> And then, there's the monster in the village. Now that we know who the culprits are, it's kind of safe to say that whatever is standing behind all these incidents whether it's throwing livestock out of the sky (lol cringe) or even destroying the mayor's place and them... it's definitely certain that whatever it is has always been on the enemy side. The lot of them. Speaking of the lot of them though screw you villagers you guys are dumb all the never-seen-witches Andy right there haha, Gideau carrying her own coffin sure sounds as weird as it is funny to see, not going to lie here. How she convinced this gentleman to carry it for her... we will leave this lore another time, Helga. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay coming back, Ashaf told Gideau to use her brain lol but I don't wanna go to school, and just with the talk of the people involved being at Falvell's place, looks like everyone around her is out of suspicion of being the culprit. Unless... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I don't believe Ashaf didn't suspect the slightest even just feeling the magic around him when it happened but you know, putting your enemy at ease is one thing to do as a gesture lol, so no surprises there, since we know Executioners work in pairs and why did Craig even describe them like Ashaf didn't know anything like he was as dumb as Gideau lmao, one of them baddies are ironically is in front of their eyes. Well, behind their eyes as Ashaf tried to ambush Craig, but in turn also got hit since not like the enemy didn't realize what's up this his 200 IQ plays. Still, that brings us to the fact that Craig's father is in fact the other Executioner, where they are now marching towards Falvell's place to... that's the thing, to what? We know Executioners have weird objectives in mind sometimes crooked, but that doesn't say anything about demoting this powerless witch's reputation into the ground. And then what? Set their footing on this harmless village to exert dominance in this uncharted area? I don't get it. Or maybe it's just out of spite, I don't know, just look at that sick pervert Angela. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Either way though, Gideau will have to deal with both Executioners by herself, which she will learn to build up trust with Ashaf I assume, considering he knows of the third way to undo her curse. Yeah, that sounds like something cool to end with. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all though, I'm still really invested in this series I don't know why. Heck, even if you tell me this season's offerings had better stuff than whatever trash I'm watching now lol I don't know people like to rage on the Internet nowadays, but damn, this is still way more interesting and very  progressive storytelling as far as I'm concerned, and that's good enough for me. Looks like we have more trouble on our hands to conclude the season though, and I'll look forward to what happens next. What are the chances Gideau has to kiss Falvell? HAHAHA ah hey at least it's not with Ashaf LMAO that will really break Helga's heart too for some reason lol ah this series is great why can't we have sequels to this instead</div><div>[TL:DR; Oh, or is it the tea made from a witch that's fuelling the Executioners to protect her? Oh. OH!!!

(Yeah, I think I need a minimum requirement that I will give a damn only if your title can fit 1 line of paragraph text when viewed on desktop lmao)<li>I may not be as hyped as I was back in 2011 when I watched it because damn the original one is way back when theme song artist "Natural High" was still a thing <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span>, but hey if the remake <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Spring%202024%20Preview/Bartender%20Kami%20no%20Glass.jpg target=_blank>"Bartender: Kami no Glass"</a></b> [Premieres April 3rd, 2024] is any indicator of a touching series about cocktails which I don't think I will convince myself to try one even after this breaks my heart once again, maybe this will make me watch back- I'm getting flashbacks already don't mind me spending the rest of this weekend crying again lol <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span><li>Oh yeah my sis is hyped for <b>"Yuru Camp" season 3</b> right here I don't care for camping shows and don't quote me on <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/50796/Kimi_wa_Houkago_Insomnia target=_blank>"KimiSomu"</a> since that is just because <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/190255/Yui_Shiromaru target=_blank>the one girl who wants to take pictures of stars</a> lol<li>Okay this is one of the ones I worry about not giving because <b>"Hananoi-kun to Koi no Yamai"</b> has a quite simple premise based on its very title: Hananoi-kun here has lovesickness.

And that's the problem. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><li>Anyone who have heard of <b>"Yoru no Kurage wa Oyogenai"</b> probably knew that the girls band Anime earlier and Idolmaster already lost lol, for this original series is doing the same thing but we don't have to outsource all the production because in this time and age, <i>they</i> are the production. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I think it'll gain mainstream popularity just animating a making video series of making a music video, which means I won't watch it. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span><li>Oh come on, Power Rangers but they always win? What on Earth is this nonsense- Oh that is the plot of <b>"Sentai Daishikkaku"</b>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Interesting premise though, giving the baddies a chance to rise up once again. But what the heck, don't ruin my childhood pls haha KEEP THOSE BADDIES DOWN<li>I am good with <b>"Yozakura-san Chi no Daisakusen"</b> I don't like the spy genre let alone seeing a seven-member <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/50265/Spy_x_Family target=_blank>spy family</a>- *ack* haha<li>And raise your hands up for the last time to get hyped about <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Spring%202024%20Preview/Shinigami%20Bocchan%20to%20Kuro%20Maid%203rd%20Season.jpg target=_blank>"Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid 3rd Season"</a></b> [Premieres April 7th, 2024] because hell yeah this is going to get concluded at least, where we plan to attack the antagonist Sade-san from behind ie. we time travel to hit her- Or make friends with her, as Bocchan would have wanted to achieve. I wonder though, I want to know how he can do the latter. Maybe we get another handsome and nice dude like Walter to romance that maniac like we did to her sister? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Otherwise, you will be glad to see that <a href="https://x.com/TVguidePERSON/status/1768109866630160767?s=20" target=_blank>Mano Ayumi as stacked Alice and Inorin as cutest younger sister Viola-chan</a> are as great as ever hehe, and the 3D animation isn't going to drop in quality (and frame rate lol). The new cast of characters might be what it needs to end Bocchan's curse though, but even then I am not too sure even if we are two seasons into this so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span><li>In case you wonder if <b>"Jii-san Baa-san Wakagaeru"</b> is more cringe of a youth transformation series than anything else, don't even doubt it because yes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So unless you're keen on <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/22/Shinichiro_Miki target=_blank>Miki Shinichirou</a> (hey Urahara Kisuke voice actor) trying to <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kabedon target=_blank>kabedon</a> your grandma or something- <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> MINE ARE DEAD SO RIP-<li>Damn, <b>"Vampire Dormitory"</b> has a main guy who is basically me if I'm a vampire...?

But really, this fantasy plot might be quite a thing, because this is the thing <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/155895/Bocchan target=_blank>Bocchan from "Shinigami Bocchan"</a> doesn't understand: If you will accidentally kill the one you love because of a curse, just love someone who can't die from your curse. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Oh well, at least this series will fulfil your desires seeing that the witch is also quite a hot chick if you know what I'm sayin'- If you are keen on this though, I'm sure <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/17215/Atsumi_Tanezaki target=_blank>Tanezaki Atsumi</a> who is probably worldwide famous because of her main roles in Anime last year, will be able to satisfy even your deepest desires- Voicing, I mean voice acting. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><li>And because I have watched the special podcasts featuring the Pyxis duo ie. <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/24413/Miku_Itou target=_blank>Itou Miku</a> and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/25395/Moe_Toyota target=_blank>Toyota Moe</a>, I already know what <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Spring%202024%20Preview/Seiyuu%20Radio%20no%20Uraomote.jpg target=_blank>"Seiyuu Radio no Uraomote"</a></b> [Premieres April 10th, 2024] is about: It's basically saying that voice actors have flipsides they can't show on camera. I mean, Moeshi did say that they don't have those and Miku be like "but you keep talking all the damn time" so you tell me if that's true. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> On the story though, they have done drama CD for this before which is why they are casted here again, but between <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gyaru target=_blank>gal</a> Miku and <a href=https://jisho.org/search/doesu target=_blank>sadistic</a> emo Moeshi, I can't imagine this being a joyride but hey, at least get me with a genre I will care about, other idol Anime? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I'll give this a listen, if Moeshi's voice and her character won't be too much of a turn-off for me- <a href="https://x.com/moeshiphotobook/status/1770345364417118560?s=20" target=_blank>I only like her body</a>, okay?? I already pre-ordered her photobook. Haha and I don't mean the former, they both be idols but I gotta draw the line using my voice actress photobook collection-<li>All you need to know about <b>"KonoSuba" new season</b> is that <a href="https://x.com/konosubaanime/status/1771798142440050904?s=20" target=_blank>Aqua is stacked</a>.

Even <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/157058/Guideau target=_blank>Gideau from "Majo to Yajuu"</a> will be surprised what this idiot of a main guy who transformed into a beast has cooked up for himself. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The animation is kinda gross though so I might take a pass on this one.<li>Hey yo Sebastian it has been a while because in <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Spring%202024%20Preview/Kuroshitsuji%20-Kishuku%20Gakkou-hen-.jpg target=_blank>"Kuroshitsuji -Kishuku Gakkou-hen-"</a></b> [Premieres April 13th, 2024] which is a new season in at least 5 years counting, I'm glad the Anime production (Aniplex, I assume) still wants to keep this going, because for the 4th major arc and 5th Anime adaptation (2nd season was original story), main guy Lord Ciel Phantomhive is going to school! To investigate stuff under the orders of <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/20367/Queen_Victoria target=_blank>the Queen</a> (*oof* RIP), what else is new. What is new though, is probably the new set of characters promised to make the incoming female audience cream lmao, and a deeper plot which I do recall, is also the last arc I read on the original work. And they are still planning to animate another arc afterwards? Let's hope this holds well 16 years later since it's Anime debut. We got SID as usual singing the (ending) theme song just in case this needs some popularity boost. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><li>Man, imagine if people like not you but your singing and guitar skills. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> That's just being a music artist lol but yeah, if you're ok with that then <b><a href=https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Spring%202024%20Preview/Sasayaku%20You%20ni%20Koi%20wo%20Utau.jpg target=_blank>"Sasayaku You ni Koi wo Utau"</a></b> [Premieres April 13th, 2024] will be right up your <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yuri target=_blank>yuri</a>-loving alley- Wait, what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, when two girls love each other a lot in high school... I mean, the story sounds palatable though, I won't lie on that. But unless their end goal is to get together even as friends or idol and fan in this specific case or if there's any plot twist in it, this might be worth a watch. Hey, she said the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> singing is great, right? Maybe I watch to find out since she didn't sing in the trailer <span style=font-size:xx-small>I just secretly want to listen to Koko-chan's voice acting a supporting character again hehe</span></ul><div>Oh, this is it? I thought there would be more this season. Okay, so two sequels/names I know of, and then the rest is free real estate? Hmm... I might give more unconventional stuff this season though, we shall see. That beast no.8 thing is real cool ngl, and nowadays it's really the story and animation that should get me first so I should just focus on those. But we are at my acceptable weekly watch limit of 5 shows per season just from selecting the above so... maybe we up that limit again? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Please me, you want to do other stuff instead of watch and review Anime, trust me.</div></div><div><br></div><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote><div>Well, this is quite a week to conclude with new songs to please just in general, not that I was generous but at least I wasn't playing through them all and then putting them in the trash, eh? <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%8C%BA-ep/1734618562?l=en-US" target=_blank>Porno Graffitti's new single</a></b> title song is just <span class=emoji title=😙🤌>*chef's kiss*</span> so I won't say much, however the B-sides I don't think hit me any way so I'll leave it at that. Same goes to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/all-right-ep/1735702867?l=en-US" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE's new EP</a></b> which I thought will only be physical limited edition only thank goodness it's on music streaming services, it's alright I thought the front songs got me but turns out them singing normal songs is better so the final original track before they dump their live recording on there, just like the previous one too. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ten-to-bluer/1735673775?l=en-US" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's new album</a></b> I guess came up top but not what you think, it's mostly me getting dragged by her into giving the title songs for the year which included her new single celebrating her solo music artist 10th anniversary, and then don't ask me if I have a problem with finding something I think suits her singing voice. Maybe allure, maybe, I don't think even the standard emotional song got me enough. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh yes, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/fantasies-ep/1719381137?l=en-US" target=_blank>Bombay Bicycle Club's new single</a></b> is not bad, but they didn't get me enough for me to give the final track which I was keen apart from the title song, so welp I guess. </div><div><br></div><div>Okay let's go through what's new on social media for music right now. <b><a href="https://x.com/ryokushaka/status/1772262260637098471?s=20" target=_blank>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's songs will be for a drama series</a></b> and yes ironically they aren't new, which really says a lot about their songs just this year alone, but hey, what do I know I didn't give any of them. <b><a href="https://x.com/pg_koushiki/status/1772579252312936542?s=20" target=_blank>Porno Graffitti is teasing their new music video</a></b> for their single released this week and boy are they still on the teasing stage so maybe I'll update if something happens next week hopefully. <b><a href="https://x.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1772943648860033501?s=20" target=_blank>Hanazawa Kana's new music video</a></b> served as the title song for her new album out in 2 weeks is alright, it's refreshing to say the least though super familiar in style, but we shall see if it sticks by then. Too much CG in one video though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> My sis has officially listened to <b><a href="https://x.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1773007204989214908?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari's new song</a></b> earlier than me just because she remembered she still liked their songs, and I think their album last year is still better even though she thought otherwise. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Continuing the trend of teasing stuff, <b><a href="https://x.com/miyustaff/status/1774043901114093831?s=20" target=_blank>Tomita Miyu's new music video teaser</a></b> is also a thing, I'm not that keen on the song but we shall see if the MV will help make it better.

Fans have already listened to it last year by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I might change my mind after watching <b><a href="https://x.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1774048968286277824?s=20" target=_blank>SHE'S music video</a></b> but it's not because of the video because I got used to the rather catchy chorus, so ask me again if I gave it. And if you got tired of new songs <b><a href="https://x.com/fumika_tweet/status/1774383639024853285?s=20" target=_blank>fumika did a ukelele cover of her song back in 2013</a></b> which is kind of nostalgic, so give that a listen, why don't you? <b><a href="https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1774391335342231951?s=20" target=_blank>miwa's new album is releasing end May</a></b> along with <b><a href="https://x.com/3pasi_official/status/1774352123570069539?s=20" target=_blank>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new single also releasing end May</a></b> these are hot off the press so ask me which one I would look forward to more.

Haha that will be proven wrong once the new season of Anime hit me in the next few weeks. Seriously though, I've taken a trip to listen to <a href="https://x.com/aozakish/status/1774383102561062940?s=20" target=_blank>Audioleaf indie artists</a>, and Skream for the new music video but none of them seem to stick.

Okay then that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Boy, not did the <a href="https://x.com/aozakish/status/1772963374172647933?s=20" target=_blank>new IDOLY PRIDE video game gacha gave me crazy deja vu</a> I thought I saw this pair of angel wings from a music video 2 months ago lol, but I was playing with making music video GIFs again yesterday night but this time, we are using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAHWVsXgHZg" target=_blank>Ten-chan's new MV</a> as reference. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh boy, it sure was a music video, her latest title song from the new album.
