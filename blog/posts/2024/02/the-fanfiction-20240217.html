<div>Never thought I'll say this again, but welcome back.</div><div><br></div><div>Welcome back to this glorious series I have so far managed to keep sane (lol) by introducing women into my fictional life and making sure I don't offend any of them. Well, mainly because I can't find images of any two of them at odds with each other (without JK cosplay because we know that does not exist lol), so let's just assume they don't have much relation to each other, or the drama happens behind the image. We're still good on images though, next season I won't be too sure but that's a future problem. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Starting this week is possibly a choice, but also, it coincides with many occasions that is not Lunar New Year (lmao), and I suppose I can start with a love story for the occasion- In my defence, not everything is a love story over here, we got family stuff I talk about once in a while with the sister and many, many cousins. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Okay okay girlfriend time, and you know who I am referring to...!!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Koga Aoi at the beach in a white dress, right cheeck against a sunhat looking back" border=0 data-original-height=512 data-original-width=355 height=200 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/gl993417.jpg title="Koga Aoi" width=139></div><blockquote><i>It was my first time going on a week-long trip together with Koga Aoi, and we cannot be more excited for it. However, the weather has not been great to us as it has been raining every day when we planned to go to the beach. We did postpone it to the final day in hopes of the sky clearing up, and we managed to do everything else on our list. As we sat in our hotel on the final day staring out into the dull morning sky, Aoi stood up and decided she wanted to go to the beach! I explained how underwhelming it might be and the possibility of rain again, and she beat my argument with a squeal.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=けど海に行きたいの！！>"But I want to go to the beach!"</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>And so, we took off to one a bus trip away.</em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>As we landed, Aoi rushed out into the beach with her sunhat. The weather did clear up a bit, and the beach was rather empty. The sky brightened our moods, and the sea breeze cheered us up in no time. She looked back at me with a satisfied smile. I was so glad I came out with her to her hometown.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I wish I can continue on this but there's a character limit I set for myself (hehe), so in short the conclusion is I stared too much at the sky, she got jealous (of the sky haha yeah) and I hugged her like a gentleman I am and reassured her she is way more beautiful than the sky. <span class=emoji title=👍>*thumbs up*</span> Yeah, gotta show more rizz even for a popular guy like me.</div><div><br></div><div>But seriously though, we were at her hometown but never once did we see her parents? BRUH. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Of course I know her hometown it's at Saga Prefecture, because if you would recall I bought her photobook) And that is how I think Koga-chan will work in a relationship with me. Being uniquely weird and very possessive about everything, including me. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Dear Lord if you are up there, chance me upon a cute girlfriend who I can fancy and will never let me go. Forever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then maybe I'll stop doing all these by then- Then again this is just literary work so I can keep on doing this...?? Yeah ask girlfriend for permission first? I will do that when the time comes. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> </div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Wow first draft perfect 1000 characters I'm the perfect boyfriend let's go <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Happy Valentine's Day to me, me.</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
