Let me get some mint or something first to clear my sinus before we start.</div><div><br></div><div>Did I just do it? Did I just reject Anime again after watching it for three whole episodes?? YES I DID IT lol but seriously though, you should've noticed. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, this will be better on my Sundays anyways as we continue on the others which hopefully will deliver I have higher hopes now that I've put ecchi scenes out of the way for the season <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, which hopefully will still be more optimistic than whatever my next package is because I still have no idea what it is either. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Hey Gamers Online Shop you want to drop that birthday month voucher soon already? I need to buy my copy of that Ogura Yui photobook please and thanks haha ah</div><div><br></div><div>More Anime and music on this... I don't know, blog? Yeah nowadays people just blog about tech to pad their resume what am I doing churning out terrible reviews of Anime and Japanese music LOL</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KanaTen04><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Oroka na Tenshi wa Akuma to Odoru</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Because you are a demon" Hot damn, I wish I was one so I can be erased by Lily-chan-</div></blockquote><div>Wait, so his true form makes him weaker? Same. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this romance comedy which if you did not notice will not take its action and fighting scenes seriously lmao (#KanaTen04), and boy did the intro not do much to help this series out, but heck, if you need advice on whether to watch this... if you want action please leave. Because not only did we get jebaited by Lily-chan here who sought to slay every demon she sees, at least for her this angel right here (ah hey) will only exorcise them which just means removing all their sin where we also see in this case and the previous one where she just sealed their demonic powers, then still found shelter for their original animal forms? Yeah, find a better angel out there, I tell ya. As such, I don't think Akutsu <strike>doing the BL thing on his ally</strike> doing the bad guy assumption thing on Lily-chan (lol) would bring him any further, but heck, it's war. "Warfare is about focusing all your might in a single spot." Thanks, <a href=https://jisho.org/search/naporitan target=_blank>Napolitan</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Speaking of which, the demons are technically in war with the angels, so uh... remember this series is about Akutsu trying to find <strike>a bimbo</strike> <strike>a VTuber</strike> an influencer (I don't think he knows ANY of the ones I just mentioned haha) to help bring the demons together to fight, so when he was reminded of that by his superior which dude, never in my Anime-watching life did I imagine sleeping with Kugimiya Rie in the same room- Hey, what's up, lady, it has been a while. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh yeah sh*t, the job. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I mean, I can be a slave to a beautiful angel but I still gotta fulfil my duties. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So that's what's going on so far, not like we have any progress but Akutsu here is technically controlled by two females <em>at the same time</em> (lol, much bliss) that I don't know whether to pity him for being <em>slightly gay</em> or (lmao) that he has to date Yuuka-chan for some reason because some purple-haired demon doesn't know about his high school life and thought wearing a high school uniform would suffice in helping with her disguise in the human world. Bruh, those demon wings? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Interestingly though, it's all the jokes that landed right beside me before deciding to crawl under my neck and into my nostrils so I laugh and choke on them lmao you gotta watch to understand most of them anyways and the others are just word puns lol, but yeah remember this was also a romance series? So yeah, most of this warfare is focused (ah hey) on the guy himself, though I don't know if Lily-chan did want to appear in whatever wet dreams which has been in his mind so far, or deliberately intended to just because. Don't ask me, I don't know what that collar can do. It can turn him gay, I'll give you that much. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all... I really wonder where all this will take us. If not, this might as well become a slice-of-life series. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, with all the stuff that is happening and Anime characters being able to sleep past noon?? WHAT MADNESS IS THIS- Alright me, you don't have to be as dumb as this Anime haha <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Not like we are hinted on what is happening next so far I just want whatever Akutsu is dreaming about but featuring Sakura Ayane instead <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span>, and bro stop having wet dreams already Uchida Yuuma you are married you can't do this thing- Oh. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> See you next time then.</div><div>[TL:DR; "Something's wrong; Are angels really like this?"

Yeah, get it, grave and undead? Ah subtitles dude</div></blockquote><div>Okay now I learnt of the format liao, the intro of each arc is leading to something about that arc, so take notes, guys. We are reviving dead people now. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> In this new episode where cryogenics are far ahead of us in time (#MajoToYajuu04), let me guess, if we revive the dead they won't have their own memories and it goes on a loop so they look like zombies that eat humans? I, uh, speak from experience haha that's "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/31812/Kuroshitsuji_Movie__Book_of_the_Atlantic target=_blank>Kuroshitsuji</a>" by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, this story. I must say they got me the moment we started last week's trailer with a bunch of new guys in town instead of the usual two, because unlike the main duo who do not deal with the undead don't let the coffin deceive you lol, this new pair we have ONLY deal with people who are dead... before. Yeah, with the advancements (not in tech but) in magic and this town allowing undead to roam the streets, it's no wonder why people will worry of whatever violent stuff these things may do if they aren't maintained or controlled properly. As such, I'm not surprised that people like Jeff here aren't believers of such magic, where his fiancé passed away and, you know, no one would want to make sure they "live" till tomorrow. Not surprising too, this series has its own interpretation of that, and from being not controlled to fully controlled, seems like necromancers do have to decide (with consent) the client's way of the dead just so uh, they can make their family members happy? Hey, want to resurrect your mom so she can continue to do house chores forever? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Forget I said that. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> ANYWAYS, it's probably wise for Phanora and the gang to hang out in an abandoned church outside of town I assume, and test out their lantern to find out if there are undead which are not taken care of which also means they are much illegal considering that anyone can just dig up a grave and resurrect them illegally. <span class=emoji title=😬>*cringe*</span> (Brings a new meaning to grave robbing lol) But the reverse is true also that what if the town's undead residents exceed the number of alive residents, like a Resident Evil situation? Then uh oh, maybe lighting that lantern might be a bad idea. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> And so it is, despite how easy it is to stop them compared to an actual mage pardon me for saying that but if you are dead maybe stay six feet under and don't touch my dear Phanora-chan over here though?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So looks like this case is not about not being able to find the necromancers of those who have attacked the citizens of the town so far, but more of some one dude is controlling all of them. Illegally. Yeah gotta emphasize that so you know how stupid this is- The other towns are smart enough to ban this anyways, heads up to them. Undead heads- All in all, impressed by the voicing of the new characters especially if they "resurrect" <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Hikasa Youko- No, wait. You have to listen very deeply to notice, this IS Ueda Reina in the flesh... voice haha, damn! I have keen ears, what can I say, I listen to her weekly podcast. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> (Edit: Oops, screwed that up, hey Hayami Saori it has been quite a while since I heard of you lmao please just kill and revive me) (Trust me, I did ask myself why Ueshama sounds like Yocchan when they never are, also this voice sounds sharper than Ueshama) Oh and what else? Of course, the story that awaits us. Pretty interesting though, don't you agree? Undead may be undead, but what is this necromancer(?) doing stuff poorly and wanting control of... well, this very town I assume? I mean, these undead may make of good pawns or even blackmail to some extent RIP Jeff's fiancé that's why we incinerate the dead today haha gottem necromancers, but hey who knows? It's mostly women too maybe this guy wants to taste some undead vag- See you next week for the conclusion. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Oh in case you didn't notice, Johan is probably an undead or else how do you stay a faithful servant to Hayami Saori- Not true fan if you're alive, isn't it? She isn't that young anyways lmao <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRM83g1Bkv_2PZf3UFuht53qx-d-6lznBUXxGqvmxUTmPm2RKgvFGShAaEJrDHECdqm20CQn_UcmvWiJ-yvN3CNCr1QWWiJHcvDnTVnzUd5YwI97TmQfxGMfaSXt8RVKSe5U0Nmf6w3onk4sUUTFL2xAIGrL52RGKH9t6MTscEY4xxUqbQy446raTmi_A/s320/majoutoyajuu04_slash.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>I like how nonchalant the guys at the back are talking while all this is going on lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWrTK9JzTp-8n2xKTqLGRtZNTYzFLWr14gV8sifgDymY7zYgAif_mrNOb6n7gBeJzhNrPV953tGlzCEay4I_IOerEMjxdkjT53rjiuotpxDj2IfBzh3Q8sVeu7W28vDRPqQ8u5vYuN9zNTyi2EobxUa9zRJNCJzOYKe1mTYYSXxo-yyJGg6xjYlwlEvLU/s320/majoutoyajuu04_undead2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Don't think this scared me but it totally freaked me out ngl</table></div></div><div>P.S.

I did end up giving the one song from <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%B8%95%E4%B8%8A-%E8%88%9E%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BB%E3%83%97%E3%83%88%E3%83%99%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%83%90%E3%83%A0-dreamy-stories/1725127387?l=en-US" target=_blank>Fuchigami Mai's concept best album</a></b> after all, not that it's great but it's the best out there, so... I'll take it. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> What I ended up struggling though, is for this week's releases because damn did I abandon the heck out of <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%A2%E3%81%AE%E7%B3%B8-ep/1720311775?l=en-US" target=_blank>Kitou Akari's new single</a></b> AND <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E8%A1%9D%E5%A4%A9-ep/1722395209?l=en-US" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's new single</a></b> (despite tuning into her release celebratory livestream) and against all odds, instead gave an Anime theme of a- shit I have to name the group out huh. I ended up giving more chances to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%88%E3%83%AF-ep/1722198259?l=en-US" target=_blank>Taiyou to Odore Tsukiyo ni Utae's new single</a></b> even on its B-sides but decided that these 9 girls don't deserver SHIT (lmao) and instead just give the one song since I can credit the composer again for such a good song. I swear he didn't choose the singers too. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> I started the new month after this very harsh review season with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/awakening/1485215865?l=en-US" target=_blank>SHE'S EP from 2017</a></b> which is one of those I missed thanks to a live video I watched recently which sang the one title song in it, and I ended up giving more. Why new songs no sound like this? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Well, I guess I could have listened to <b><a href="https://x.com/no_buses_band/status/1753073070393430421?s=20" target=_blank>No Buses' new EP</a></b> which is basically the songs released separately in the past few months and I think I did mention them all including the one last week so <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> haha we'll leave it at that, but if you haven't listened to it please do. <b><a href="https://x.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1753010794550480947?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's new music video</a></b> for her new single releasing in Valentine's Day (if that isn't an indication) is adorable but not as great as when she shook her rack in that summer song last year so <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> so I'll give the verdict by then in a couple of weeks. If I have time and if mol-74 writing songs for other bands is an indicator of potentially good releases ever since that one last year, then I might give <b><a href="https://x.com/mol_74/status/1752678501294174297?s=20" target=_blank>airattic's new EP</a></b> a listen when it's out in a couple of weeks too. <b><a href="https://x.com/Bearwear_jp/status/1752346069198057791?s=20" target=_blank>Bearwear's new single</a></b> is just a remix release of a couple of their songs in the new album released last month, and thanks for asking if <b><a href="https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1752346107798290456?s=20" target=_blank>Hitsujibungaku's first live audio release</a></b> is good or not. Almost got me into a listening fever like SHE'S but heck, I'll leave that for another time. Meanwhile though, you can listen to <b><a href="https://x.com/hitsujibungaku/status/1752346200882438613?s=20" target=_blank>their 360 Reality Audio live video</a></b> though, see if you can notice that experience or not, my ears are already getting old with this sinus I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <b><a href="https://x.com/oral_official/status/1752300878592389184?s=20" target=_blank>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new EP teaser</a></b> is anything but a teaser lol it's rather long, but it's actually great though so hopefully when it comes out in March I will have the mood to listen to these guys again. So far in the couple of years? Not being listening much. And this teaser isn't quite like <b><a href="https://x.com/miwastaff/status/1751621181210612156?s=20" target=_blank>miwa singing for her new EP</a></b> releasing in March, though I don't think I felt anything enough for me to fall in love (with the song, mind you) on first sight, so I'll try again next month if you guys don't mind. I'm plenty hyped with <b><a href="https://x.com/rythem_official/status/1753343588094947757?s=20" target=_blank>RYTHEM teasing they are recording a new album</a></b> which will release this year I hope and is totally different from last year with that best album and 2 new songs of which the 2nd I couldn't even care to listen mainly because it's not on streaming services too (lol) so let's hope this one will serve up to me when it's time. (<a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1753365825640395144?s=20" target=_blank>Thanks for the like</a> too, ladies!) <b><a href="https://x.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1753750430062903801?s=20" target=_blank>Aimer's new song will release in two weeks</a></b> which is for a drama series she is raking all the popularity I suppose, so we shall see by then. I like to use the words "by then" so much now, it's like we get to know to wait for new songs to release than just receive so many shadow drops I feel nothing giving them credit. Yeah, I'm still stuck giving the Anime theme songs too because they just drop on you to coincide with the hype on the show's first episode. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> I can wait, I listen to so many artists anyways. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Next week is going to be the release date for <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/dear-panta-rhei-ep/1721109758?l=en-US" target=_blank>Uesaka Sumire's new single</a></b> and I have even less interest in giving this one after what I've gone through this week (lmao) and I really need something good Pop music and such so I'll probably give a miss. I could use a break from music I guess and even life in general hehe ugh my sinus (Okay maybe I try listening to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/1723791328?l=en-US" target=_blank>Yourness' new mini-album</a></b> it has been a while and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOW50gTJsXM" target=_blank>the trailer</a> don't sound too bad imo)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>No, I didn't buy the online tickets to watch Kanno Mai sing yesterday night. I know right, not true fan already. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Happy birthday to a lot of people today though, and I just noticed included is also Yamane Aya who hangs out with Tomita Miyu on their fortnightly series who is also younger than Oozora Naomi and Tomatsu Haruka ie. mom fever LMAO, also sounds great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahZO1qmEuKM" target=_blank>singing</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPNxZyZj9II" target=_blank>covers</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKWn35eV5Q4" target=_blank>on YouTube</a>, and more if you read into her music label project. As they say though, falling in love with your friend who is more attractive than you are... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Alright Miyu-chan I just dislike dogs I have nothing else on you that I hate, promise. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> See you guys then, and boy did I give the stamp of approval to play "RAILGARDE" after much thinking since last year which will feed on my little itch for simulation games, apparently has an epic trailer and put little scraps of crude comedy to sh*t on you whenever they can, and overall still rather fun until you get out of the tutorial. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Gotta play more so until next time! Next week will be holiday season here so we shall see how watching Anime will be then maybe I watch earlier? These guys air pretty early in the week too tbh and I do intend to get MC again if what I might have gotten from my dad doesn't go away in time to go get red packets next weekend so... we shall see. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Alright time to go click on the photobook purchase or else I will be alone again for Valentine's...
