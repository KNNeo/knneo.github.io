<div>Well, it's a hot afternoon out here and my sinus is not in the mood to take a nap yet (lol), so why not do this first? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Unlike the weather now and boy how is staying inside an air-conditioned room worse, this week, in celebration of a birthday of a certain someone (which we will do another next week so FYI), we are introducing a new woman into my life! Well, in my fictional life, you know I can't get chicks. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Anyways, this might be too intimate for my own good <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>, but also this might need more imagination as much as I have tried, and no, we are not talking about Kana-chan even though it's her birthday tomorrow. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span></div><div><br></div><div>You can figure it out, this week I will be talking about...!!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="Kouno Marika in a thin blue top covered below a blue scarf, smiling with squinting eyes" border=0 data-original-height=358 data-original-width=512 height=140 src=https://www.suruga-ya.jp/database/pics_light/game/g3792564.jpg title="Kouno Marika" width=200></div><blockquote><i>I recalled the first time I had a trip with my cousins years ago, to a summer beach house in Okinawa. Everyone had a great time outdoors, I came back to the abode early to chill. I sat legs crossed on a table with a bowl of oranges, and was reminded by my aunt we were free to eat them. I peeled a couple and ate them slowly. As the sunlight softened and the fan blew a steady breeze on me, I lied down on the tatami floor, closed my eyes while I listen to the scenery of nature, and dozed off.</i><div> <em><br></em></div><div><i>When I woke up, I felt a piece of blue cloth covering my view and heard someone giggling to my right. I turned my head to see Kouno Marika beside me, with her hands almost touching my face. She was also under the cloth in her skimpy summer wear, looking at me with a smile and squinting eyes.</i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i><abbr title=寝顔もかわいい～！>"(Your) sleeping face is also adorable~!"</abbr></i></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><i>We stared at each other for a couple of seconds before I realized what was going on and sat up, lifting the cloth behind me. Kouno-san then laughed and ran away.</i></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Before I talk about relationships, let me talk about the above story from Marinka's perspective. It's likely she found out I was missing in action outdoors, found me dozing off on the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/tatami target=_blank>straw floor</a>, and decided that among all the things she could do, to cover me using her... scarf? And THEN hid below it with me, looking at me sleep??? This can only happen in Anime- Also hard cut to her hiding in a corner in shame of what she just did though?? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Please, I was the one who was supposed to be shocked at this.</div><div><br></div><div>As for my relationship with this woman? The intro might have hinted already, so this will be the second time I am using my cousin lifeline (lmao) to write in someone I do not know where to assign them to into my fictional life. Also because *wink wink* you can accidentally f**k your cousin? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh boy, you DO NOT KNOW how much I want to write that but the only thing that is stopping me is because I can't draw an accompanying thumbnail? <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> She might have her own problems but this is fiction so I'll love her the way I know how. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Damn, if this is how I can help her curb her depression, I wish this lasted forever. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. In her birthday fanclub livestream yesterday (which yes, I'm still a member), she mentioned about how the depression was having a toll on her job last year even red traffic lights made her anxious (proper analysis was adjustment disorder) with the passing of her previous cat (RIP), her manager and mom advised her into taking a break to find a way to recover. Yeah, now I feel bad for her, I wish I was there for her, to be honest.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span></div><div><br></div><div>Remind me to unsub lol</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheFanfiction">The Fanfiction</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
