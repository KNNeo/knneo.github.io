But hey, at least I'm still giving something.</div><div><br></div><div>This time around though, I am NOT giving another SCANDAL single since I didn't like the song haha, I'm continuing the journey of Taketatsu Ayana's solo music career... 8 years after since she started around 9 years ago, so yeah, I missed out A LOT. Well, I didn't miss out on everything, I just didn't give this one song so this release can sit on my shelf. But now that it has... let's talk about it!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div id=AyanaCinderella><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq music"><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Taketatsu Ayana - Shuumatsu Cinderella [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy height=316 src=https://ayanataketatsu.jp/images/disc/008/j_01.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy height=316 src=https://ayanataketatsu.jp/images/disc/008/j_02.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table><div>(Do you even, have any idea, how adorable Ayachi looks, when she was younger?)</div><div><br></div><div>Origin: Hmm where shall I start.... Introducing Taketatsu Ayana, this is her 4th single from December 2013, which also means I should also mention it is close to her 10th year singing songs as a solo artist, and so far, it has been great. With her releasing a concept best album featuring songs titled after food, giving one of her older songs brought me back to this single which it was part of. In a nutshell, this single is like many of her releases, bringing much happiness and emotion all coupled with her adorable singing voice, and now I ponder how long I've taken to get back to this and experience all of what she had to offer.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Shuumatsu Cinderella [Weekend Cinderella]</div><div>From first verse:</div><div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>Didn't have time to (party) in the weekend</div><div style=text-align:center>(Even) on rest days there isn't time to sleep</div><div style=text-align:center>Really, just today is fine, right?</div></blockquote><div></div></div><div>This is a happy song. This is likely a party song, going from the lyrics, but if you have never heard of a genre called ska, all the years listening to ska music from Japan probably prepared me for this masterpiece even back in 2013. Because with the quirks in her singing and an adorably lovable voice, this is only a song to love. The music video only made a better impression out of this song, putting her in the fitting role of a princess after a day's work? It feels like a reality check even within the lyrics, taking time off a hectic lifestyle to party, play along, and have a great night. This song is all about having a good time, if you're in for her cuteness. The overall package of this song definitely did capture that mood, and I'm glad to have heard of it.</div><div>Rating: 4 stars (Lovingly Average)</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Marshmallow</div><div>From last chorus:</div><div><div><div></div><blockquote><div style=text-align:center>Someday (I) want to talk to you, about my feelings</div><div style=text-align:center>If it delivers, (I) want to know more about you</div><div style=text-align:center>Wait a little while more, but slowly</div><div style=text-align:center>It's very like me, (to) softly, softly fall in love (with you)</div></blockquote><div></div></div></div><div>And yes, with any release, the B-side is always the deal breaker, especially if it took me this long to even give it. At this point, I wonder why I've hesitated giving this song anyways, and I have concluded that it is likely due to me missing her singing, just in general. The lyrics made little sense talking about downloading apps with only a slight mention of mom-made marshmallows, so it really makes you wonder how much this would have been in the hearts of people who understood or even listened to it, even if it made sense it was about the dessert. For me though, I guess I really miss falling in love with her voice, and this song had a lot of that, so it definitely satisfied something in me that made me sit down to give this song because it isn't even bad. I would like to blame it on her subpar singing but since we have come this far... You're welcome, Ayachi.</div><div>Rating: 4 stars (Simply Average)</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: It's hard to even find a single release as nice as this in recent years, and I think this nostalgia trip back did teach me a thing or two. Even back then, songs are uniquely different and fresh, representing different moods and emotions, and that overall packaging and a solid melody is something many artists even lack of today. If you have been a fan of Anime songs, her solo music career will not disappoint, and her first three and now fourth release(s) are an easy recommendation to get into her as I have back then. Feel for this journey, and the rest will make you like what is Taketatsu Ayana for the past decade.</div><div><br></div><div>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(I feel so cringe writing my feels for Ayachi someone please help) (Haha)</div><div><br></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYaw_wL5m1uih9NedIDewvAkTOFnaqZSrsr3E-nZ0o1vvy26VgnZUuqrSr5SZc5EicVnxOmrNbEq7Iyi2olr0PLH6s9O5y1DQYnEbpYv_AWvI1HdKg4iOlKHa1O6Kyi2A5EwElDGbi1qRfhjMFaA8BHIQ-xN6cR32gEwrzLaECDJLdFw/s1600/PXL_20211012_125542718.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYaw_wL5m1uih9NedIDewvAkTOFnaqZSrsr3E-nZ0o1vvy26VgnZUuqrSr5SZc5EicVnxOmrNbEq7Iyi2olr0PLH6s9O5y1DQYnEbpYv_AWvI1HdKg4iOlKHa1O6Kyi2A5EwElDGbi1qRfhjMFaA8BHIQ-xN6cR32gEwrzLaECDJLdFw/s320/PXL_20211012_125542718.jpg width=320></a></div><div>Now that the hype is over haha, so is the hype (literally) for this particular package because it's just the CD now without any special gifts which I would have had if I've given this single AND followed the then trend of buying CDs off online stores directly after I cornered the market for releases for the first five years of Klassic Note haha yeah those were the times</div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwMff1j8cvoFcjf5FaFdK11sg51BwI-rzqVcpS8wWxOMe_Vt-2Am_I4M-gtZcUmXHS8aze3k75i4Dk-M37Fp_LTIW0MIZwyzjduq7yiWS7wSlKm3O8HUh3ZCp72AN4cTRbqZH-Y2Ico9EnUhQVT-PwMOYO_mv2_CEjc-0W83X2v77EPw/s1600/PXL_20211012_125704231.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=3024 data-original-width=4032 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwMff1j8cvoFcjf5FaFdK11sg51BwI-rzqVcpS8wWxOMe_Vt-2Am_I4M-gtZcUmXHS8aze3k75i4Dk-M37Fp_LTIW0MIZwyzjduq7yiWS7wSlKm3O8HUh3ZCp72AN4cTRbqZH-Y2Ico9EnUhQVT-PwMOYO_mv2_CEjc-0W83X2v77EPw/s320/PXL_20211012_125704231.jpg width=320></a></div><div>What we did get though, is a good price on this CD. Really, no joke, this was from Amazon Japan, and <em>any</em> of the bromides I bought from the Suruga-ya run probably cost more than this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But thanks to "bookkaitori.com" haha thanks guys, I was able to get a brand new physical version of this instead of resorting to getting used copies which will actually suck, at a <em>really</em> low price. (2 digits in yen low FYI I paid more for the shipping lmao) I thought it was a joke but upon close inspection it's definitely unopened, so it is a new copy of the single. So yeah, it fits in well with the recent package around the time I was waiting for the others to drop in too, so this just joined the queue.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmCm2dVm7gIq-bTPsux2RVMl-JN2yNAEHIf9lfRzojCzbtNTp0fz7NCb_R5tn3FVM6N_Alr3s0UckG2T5kmdWvsTTdcviYjBX6lfuq9RcpbXDOV-J5Gip7K9vdhPrgZH9Jyg4z83HxSzxR4l2DprQmVVk6RCClANEVAKThHD7S87GO6Q/s1600/PXL_20211012_124324710.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=2268 data-original-width=4032 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmCm2dVm7gIq-bTPsux2RVMl-JN2yNAEHIf9lfRzojCzbtNTp0fz7NCb_R5tn3FVM6N_Alr3s0UckG2T5kmdWvsTTdcviYjBX6lfuq9RcpbXDOV-J5Gip7K9vdhPrgZH9Jyg4z83HxSzxR4l2DprQmVVk6RCClANEVAKThHD7S87GO6Q/s320/PXL_20211012_124324710.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>To prove that this is not a re-release, the dates along the price line are similar on this release (below) compared to her first single (above) which I bought years ago (OOF)<br>[*Physical releases are known to only be in circulation within half a year off release date, and read the dates in (year).(month).(day) please]</table><div>But seriously though? If I had bought it back then (image credit to Suruga-ya, you're the best) the same place as before ie. Neowing ie. <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikdL0wGtVXcgfkB_ad-bFuywnltZcLVjki3kPovQGckNEjW6aDbaWmmQlHMhEbyVymmu8ePmxx9-KvCqiu_R50dlHVd9Z4XzNszBp8QvTPyqau6Z1UAyjvt20KebzO8pjkJwkyoQL5Oa44bNHOCx1G8RBI6vTJ0IrYQXFJ0J1LBO6uAQ/s320/g6224767.jpg target=_blank>CDJapan</a> I would've gotten something else which you all should know comes in the form of a bromide and even better it seems if it were from <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgw-g5YlmKgf0NvKggvy6Nw4O_u_1S7ruf2gnSA75uSzKIDY0uhJmnylnltBwX4nsprNalFSh12f8yOCEyaeK18La2ijXeAprNZqvTMK80uvmM3q8p1KkBSSI9wTSuTmFfjfOKAU-as1q2qqI1q2PC2qpjLsraR50YYHq6c0o664_2K5g/s320/g6224757.jpg target=_blank>Animate Online</a> where I first bought Mina-chan's and Yocchan's single back then. Ah, I can only do nostalgia now it's so cringe lol. Then again, I would have stopped at her 5th single which I rejected as a whole even if I gave this, so oh well. It's worth trying for this much 8 years later lol</div><br><br><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>And I guess this is it for the week! I'll be spending the rest of the weeknights scanning bromides and staring at posters so if you don't mind I'll be excusing myself right about now haha. Cya guys next time though, and hopefully then, I might be able to review another single because I don't think albums can be a thing since I missed Aki-chan's earlier this year and... maybe digital singles can become actual physical releases? I mean, King Gnu did it, someone else can try, right? Haha we shall see then bye</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Haha I read the booklet and found out the recording of the B-side percussions (apart from drums) is all done by yours truly, so she was doing the tambourines? Nice I would love to see that tbh hehe</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
