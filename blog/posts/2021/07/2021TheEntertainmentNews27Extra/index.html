WHAT YEAR IS THIS??? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><br><br>Okay, I did mention on Sunday anyways, so if you didn't read that, idiot (haha), then you would've expected this the least. Suffice it to say I'm NOT going to do this every week from here on until the season ends, but just because I can't stand seeing those Anime previews and recommended videos on YouTube I'm doing this earlier, just the first episodes of two series that will be airing on Sunday nights from here on.<div><br></div><div>So yeah, let's see if they were worth doing this one post on a Tuesday haha thank goodness for work from home amirite?? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span><br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TanMoshi01><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"You might say being a trouble magnet is my nature" Wow isn't that all of us bro? Haha okay it's just you</div></blockquote>Normally people ask for help from doctors on planes but this one asks for a detective. You better have a good reason for this or I'm out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this... mystery of a mystery of series I guess (#TanMoshi01), if your life is as messed up as this dude you can live in an Anime universe too lol. No really, you should go see the doctor. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, before you do that, we can talk about this one-hour special which I totally forgot about its length and thank goodness I didn't choose to watch this yesterday haha. So, we start at the plane, as you have seen in trailers probably, of a flight attendant asking for a detective. Apparently it's because someone at the cockpit which is not the pilot, asking for one. Yeah, it's a hijack, in case you wonder. Whatever genius detective Siesta volunteered for the task and pulled Kimi... <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kimi target=_blank>Kimi</a>. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She pulled this not random guy out of his seat to negotiate with a... partial android? Yeah, that is seriously a lot to absorb even just 10 minutes into the story, and I mean if you enjoyed the action scene good for you, but as you may have noticed this Kimi guy is not pleased. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> As much as the hijacker is also not pleased of a detective immediately being able to bust in and solve his mystery, as we go on forward we see even more of an Anime reality where Siesta might be like James Bond level with power up her a** and weapons to bewilder. Well in a world of androids and secret black organizations to take down, what else is new? Probably the "assistant" that Siesta has been desperately (maybe) trying to recruit, and even then you should've thought of why such a perfect... investigator would need anyone as her assistant. Right? Maybe as bait? Or human shield? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But as we can see, it's not the case as she gets more pushy than ever, doing very weird things only a stalker would do to this dude's place. Bear in mind that is literally the only thing funny about the series, as Siesta <strike>tries to</strike> solves Kimi's problems about his school in order to probably convince him to travel the world with her as an assistant as she has always desired. And I say that as an underestimation did you even think how he can be suddenly kidnapped and told to ship a briefcase onto a plane so that the gun inside could be used to take down a partial android on board?? Yeah, think about it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So part two of the hour long episode, we go to the school festival in which that dude has no idea recalling because he lives a screwed up high school life and has no idea of what happened to school- Dude do you even go to school? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And you say you life's lonely and full of trouble. Okay maybe that's why but that's not the point! Point is that- Okay who gives a shit about that Hanako story <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/39534/Jibaku_Shounen_Hanako-kun target=_blank>I already watched one Anime based on that</a> and I hated it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, didn't know they can do secret groups inside of the school which is DRUG SMUGGLING??? What world are we even in right now lol which will bring us to this series' main point: Why this dude will become the assistant of a... whatever genius detective in the first place. So easy point because I'm not Siesta who will explain stories to you later haha got her, I guess he rather live a life of danger in which she has mentioned she will cover that part since he's the trouble magnet, than you know, live a life like mine which is probably why I haven't gotten laid in the first place maybe I should get into more trouble so some cute girl will come and find me to be my bodyguard- I rather she be my girlfriend. Haha negotiations are over, girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> All in all, I find many problems with this series which will make me lose interest over time, to be honest. It reminds me of "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/39017/Kyokou_Suiri target=_blank>Kyoko Suiri</a>" which I watched a year ago where romance is their pitch over spiritual mysteries. This has the same feel, but the main girl or detective shows no challenge whatever, the main guy is even more boring, and romance is mellow at best. It's great if I'm sitting down in my bathtub with lukewarm water <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span>, but just in this case I don't have a bathtub at home and yes, this series also doesn't have much of a base that will drag me in at all. And that is just pitiful in my opinion. If the author knows everything but lacks in making it more dramatic, I would say it doesn't make of a strong mystery series. Well, that is, in my dumb <strike>Kimishita</strike> Kimizuka level opinion of course haha. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay, you know what? I might give this the three episode rule, even though this is more than one episode's worth already in Anime rules lol. I don't think it'll live up to the hype I think I want, but I think I can live with the idea of Siesta being smarter as she is from the beginning of knowing any incident, like you know, being a Ranpo-san or something. We shall see if this holds up especially, next up, we talk about the recollection. Yeah, "the detective is already dead", bro. (title drop) This storytelling is in another world, man, I don't even know. Well, you'll know if I'll watch this next week...end if it helps haha Siesta no second-guessing me please (unless you do cat maid girl outfit hahahahahahaha)</div><div>[TL:DR; Okay "I'll protect you" and "I'll be your girlfriend" is such a thin line away so why didn't he demand the latter?

FUCK YOU MOM- Heck, why are mothers all so bad nowadays? Where were those mothers who will poke into your relationship affairs or something? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this episode of a new series which got me up as much as that maid got her death god-like master every other time (#ShinigamiBocchan01), I think I'm loving this series as much as I'm also saddened by the story behind it, and I think that makes a good premise for this series, which is why I can see this is actually good. So firstly, back story. Bocchan here, as we will call him from here on, is a young master or duke of a prestigious family I would assume what looks like in the 20th century and of course, where witches exist so this is not real life already btw, he's uh, cursed to never touch anything living or else it dies. Man, that's kinda sad. Thus, the "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/shinigami target=_blank>shinigami</a> <a href=https://jisho.org/search/bocchan target=_blank>bocchan</a>" name. Yeah, he's kind of like the Death Note but as a human lol. Living inside this big mansion, he stays alone with the only maid who will serve him (for now) Alice, daughter of head maid at the family mansion until two years ago, she decided to come here to serve this cute lad haha. Hey, don't ask me what reason will that be, but it's a sweet love story I can get behind if there is one. We'll leave the butler for some other way because he's down and I'm not lol, it's hardly surprising to see why then for Alice, <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san target=_blank>she likes to tease him</a> as much as she can while she's at it, and yeah you bet this is half the reason I'm watching this series lmao. With this curse though, it has brought more than the definition of him as basically a monster who can kill anything living in seconds, as evidenced by him touching a tree which is not directly connected to the swing he was on. As <strike>one of</strike> his childhood friend visits him in the mansion- WAIT YOU HAVE A CHILDHOOD FRIEND?? *<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/43007/Osananajimi_ga_Zettai_ni_Makenai_Love_Comedy target=_blank>gets serious deja vu</a>* Haha okay other Anime jokes aside, introducing childhood friend Philips which, ironically were only friends when they were kids so before 5 years old which I guess not many will remember that anyways, dropped by to say hello. For the first time. Ever since the mother threw him in this one mansion to live with the one butler for many years. Long before Alice dropped by. See where this is going already? If you thought this meeting will end well don't fret, as Philips is so far still the nicest outsider so far though being instructed by the mother to come to check on him, is also warning him on the world outside: The family is ready to do the inheritance thing on the nobility of a family, and he's... not in line for it. I mean, you know why. He's no <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji target=_blank>Ciel Phantomhive</a> who can exact revenge, that's why. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay jokes aside, but yeah seeing as the actual family eating on the table and not even a little worried about the son, really makes you wonder who's the evil one here in the first place, over the witch lol. Yeah, it depended on which parent was faster on the trigger to kick him out isn't it? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh poor Bocchan, you don't even have a great name to remember by (You see, most main characters do not have actual names...) I can't even. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> So as you can see, this series has a lot of backstory we can jump in on for the next couple of episodes even, and I think I'm actually liking it a lot. For starters, I like the crudeness of the series. Did you watch the opening animation and think why the chest close-up coincides with the two character voices singing "<a href=https://jisho.org/search/mune target=_blank>mune</a>"?? Haha think about it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, I means crudeness is all it's positivity, by the way. Next up, the lore. The nobility family is a thing, Bocchan here might be losing his status as a noble real quick (maybe he can do part time funeral services and make sure those who faked deaths be dead? lmao) considering why the parents didn't do that to a five year old back then lol I'm calling social services haha, but also, the witch's curse is also a thing. Yes, in case you haven't watched enough fantasy stuff before, with every curse comes a cure. So yeah, it's sex right? Sex with a woman? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So as you can see, this has made many take sides as to whether even this Bocchan should be allowed to live even as a cursed person. And this drama, I am in for. And last but not least, the teasing and fanservice despite... yes if you have noticed, the 3DCG which I have safely avoided ever since I saw it first on a series called "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/35557/Houseki_no_Kuni_TV target=_blank>Houseki no Kuni</a>". But this time around, it has gotten better to say the least, there aren't crazy action scenes so I don't have to worry about fast moving c*appy motions, and I wished this was 2D drawing and animation so I can actually salivate at Alice's- Okay I'll stop haha. So next up, we have a cat in the story- It's dead already, right? Haha cya guys next time oh and I'm not going to apologize for all the death jokes I'm going to make for this series, just so you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span></div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6XERZO49dzp23_R0ZDFOkaB0jHqPZ3EZxSfJv5Aak2vAN98MmbPfZIDAPFCHziFMex8K5A75CAhBUwMqvzsRuKgF4I5pDG-cN3XXJ_L6TrL-VAOYuSK4AgslCpNLm6ma-wuXBVDS5-nw/s320/shinigamibocchan01_meeting.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Man, kudos for them to be maintaining this "social distancing" thing even though it's not a pandemic<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhISKmwzyy-TkRS5QIPyJ6dnt3W2SG6ggOygKC1rKMwF_31HMCsc_Om0P6fPGM9aH5tqDO9gh0_wFSeTEymZHQ79C6nJLC2q-0gJjPvyMZPeDTEBMqiwuNxhmcpn20_1waC3l0x9WL8qr4/s320/shinigamibocchan01_dining.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Goddamn THIS might be too far</table></div></div>P.S.
