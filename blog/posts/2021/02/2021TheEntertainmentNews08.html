It's the only type of week where I actually HAVE the time to think of other passion projects and not be tired from work. No really, I need to migrate to Europe haha<div><br></div><div>Yes, happy birthday to me. I just, uh, spent a lot more money on stuff that won't arrive anytime soon as in April and on like Inorin again haha you're welcome, <a href=https://www.inorimachi.com/goods_image/010061.jpg target=_blank>you adorable girl</a>. My supposed birthday package hasn't arrived yet too, unlike the one from last year- Hey remember last year? Haha of course I do I bought a lot of stuff from the Internet that my country's government is going to charge us in like, 2 years. So, might as well enjoy the tax-free joys of shipping while I'm at it haha. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> Also, probably reviving the photobook reviewing thing since I think it gets me going more. I'm getting lethargic from making blog posts remember I promised a Klassic Note post about the special compilation for KN2020? Yep, not yet I guess</div><div><br></div><div>Anime, I guess. And music, I have a lot to give this week... even though I reviewed a lot more haha hey I can't give everything I've been doing it for a decade<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BungouStrayDogsWan06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"A day without messing with Kunikida-kun is like a cola without its fizz..." "You should close it up" lol haha Atsushi ikr</div></blockquote>It's when you hear "Kunikida IS <a href=https://jisho.org/search/negi target=_blank>Negi</a>" you know it's going to be a good episode. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#BungouStrayDogsWan06) where we saw the ending TWICE mind you lol... I guess it's Dazai enjoying his days in the Agency again huh. Hey, if I had such a background as him as in from the main series I'll f**k around with my co-workers haha. So, since it's all Dazai this time around, let's put some focus on this good-for-nothing who is also a superpower in the main (action) series lol. Firstly, pranking on Kunikida. We don't do that everyday, but for Dazai it's just another day at the job lmao. I mean, again, I won't even do anything close to pranking anyone, but man is this getting into the habit for him. For Kunikida though, he just does his serious face, and the other has to do his part of his job anyways so whatever, which is why Dazai had to play it back on him, like write stupid things and slap it on his back without him noticing... without anyone noticing somehow wtf. The dude then went out with the President for a meeting which is considered confidential and then Dazai realised the problem with his note slapped to the co-worker's back... and did nothing about it lol. Hey, he did freak out for a while, but I guess Kunikida probably found out before the meeting anyways so it should be fine. (I mean, the President should've said something at some point, considering everyone has to move around so he would have seen Kunikida's back at some point) Next up, horror stories. Sadly, besides Atsushi, no one in the room knows how to tell a good horror story, so that kinda sucks. If you were expecting something like me though, remember this is a comedy spinoff lol. From Kunikida's jokes about him not being able to work which is never going to be a joke to anyone I just take MC anyways lol, to Dazai's story about how he got scared of... having to go to work more than once in a day haha really, to Kyouka-chan's stories about how the injured herself which depends if you call that horror I would call that abuse lol... no one actually quite nailed it like Atsushi even if his story is just him locked up in a storage him in his orphanage where he came from. Hey, even without the story the background is scary enough, bro. *shivers* But yeah, in case you need to learn how to tell a horror story, a simple case would be thinking of an unbelievable abnormality, and then covering it with suspense. The "no one can fit behind the cabinet" story makes enough sense to freak anyone out, to be honest. Lastly, let's talk about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/rajiotaisou target=_blank>radio exercises</a>, uh, I mean, dancing. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I hope you have seen the former because we're going to be talking about the latter instead haha. I don't know what possessed Dazai to dance but maybe it is the money, and also why Atsushi will join in too unless you tell me he wants popularity which I swear he has already for this series... I know Kunikida will join because of them fat stacks so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And I legit thought it's really the Agency (and Port Mafia too?) who were so down on money all of them really had to participate in this competition when Ranpo came by and... yeah it's still the three of them lol AWWWW I really hoped for that too but hey, imagine that whole scene not in chibi animation. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (And I swear Chuuya is not doing a M*chael J*ckson reference) Also, real cool for the scene to feature the FIRST opening theme song sung by technically Chuuya's voice himself, and man is the President cool we'll have more of them GIFs later I'm too hyped I woke up from my nap lol. (Sorry GRANRODEO you guys have lost, 5 years later) All in all, another funny episode in the works, and man is life in the Agency dull without people like Dazai and Ranpo lmao haha *dances*<div> [GIF FEVER!!!

Haha, guess who said this line. *<a href=https://jisho.org/search/chirari target=_blank>glance</a>*</div></blockquote>I saw Ishikawa heavily featured in this week's tweets from the official account so I guess it's his turn to shine, huh. I mean, what'cha gonna do when your bro stole your crush from you, amirite?? <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> In this new episode (#Horimiya07) to be honest? Ishikawa's love case is sad, but it's not as sad as that other Anime where you end up f**king each other because the ones you like got laid, so yeah, Yoshikawa. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (No, don't think it's "Koi to Uso") Anyways, let's talk about what happened then. Firstly... about Sakura. You know, that hopeless romantic who thinks she can't get a chance with Ishikawa because he likes the other girl... and now there's Yoshikawa hanging out with him? Oh man, it's already kind of hard already, isn't it? Not if you're not trying. In her conversations with Yoshikawa and then Sengoku (Remember his days before high school? He is not that strong of a person lol), she knows she still has to try, even with how much little courage she has in her, to you know, show some affection for the guy she likes in some way. And yes, we found out soon enough what that will be. In return for a favour (Where that favour is lending HER your jersey? You kind-hearted MAN haha) which I swear someone was happier than the other lol (Okay, it's kind of obligatory to help wash clothes lent to someone because or else Ishikawa you'll be smelling all of Sakura's juices lmao ok me joke's over), Sakura (I swear it was intentional) specially made some cookies as a gift. Oh Sakura you made too many cookies? Happy Valentine's Day to him man- Oh it's over? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I guess Ishikawa is a bit of a glutton so he just took it anyways haha. Anyways, this seemed to Sakura as a win, but apparently someone else was losing. Nope, not Hori, she still has Miyamura in her eyes which we'll talk about later, but her friend Yoshikawa. Yep. Yeah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Didn't expect the triangle relationship to be here ladies and gentlemen, but here we are cramming triangles into those toys with shaped holes like a toddler lol. Sakura even extended her thanks to her love rival (haha) by giving her cookies too. And man can you feel the burn when Yoshikawa just said "Ishikawa's somewhere eating cookies" haha ugh I felt that real good. But yeah, kind of despicable really for Yoshikawa to think of it like so, because it's open market man you all have a chance with this dude who will not like any of you all back because Hori. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay me, fancy you having such a problem in your life EVER. *BOOM* Moving on, so Yoshikawa thought of fighting for it in the way Sakura did it too apparently, in cooking. Sadly, she's not that great, and I meant that in the worst way possible, so poor girl gotta get sh*tted on by of all people, Ishikawa. But yeah, he did it like a bro, and yeah obviously I can't blame him considering he has no idea this friendo in front of him is... you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, Miyamura's trip up north so he is going to miss classes for a week. Can you even do that? I guess, maybe it's for a funeral considering they all be wearing black to Hokkaido. And in the worst way possible because this is 2021 or maybe not in the storyline, Miyamura forgot his phone charger, his is not those that uses USB-C cables (lol), and again like every single human who knows their phone is going to get cut off, did not send a warning to the recipient he holds most dearly to warn her about the lack of this communication channel. Really, you should've seen how sad Hori-san looks all day. It's just five days, girl. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (I know right, wait till I get a girlfriend and not be able to text her for a week HAHAHAHA) While Ishikawa and Yoshikawa were worried about their lines in class where their friend is missing from school (Interestingly, if you haven't done those as a kid it's when the teacher goes around the class and tells everyone to read a line of the textbook in class aloud, typically reserved for one's second language. And yeah, they had to read English so RIP Ishikawa and Yoshikawa haha), Hori on the other hand... is missing Miyamura real good. Like, as in, physically. And yes, thank goodness he didn't get trapped in those flight delays due to weather and came back safely, and finally sifting through his messages and saw the one that mattered (Dammit, test is postponed?? lol where am I going to copy my answers now), he rushed to go to her place where you know, she be doing the same. Telepathy, everyone. Last but not least, man it's quite an achievement even without this girls' meeting, but let's talk about them first. Well, in summary, Hori is worried about overloading her interest in front of her boyfriend on basically, horror movies. Yeah, it's a fact he's still scared. It's a fact that Hori-san likes them and forces him (and the father lol but more on him) to watch them with her... I know it's that "I did it for you" thing and I probably would if I have to date a vegetarian (Audience: ...), but for now, it's good to not do that to your dear boy <em>before</em> you get married. Right, Hori-san? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But instead of heeding the girls' advice first by NOT watching horror, she does everything they told her to do AFTER the horror movie, so holding hands, pretending to be scared... yeah those won't freak Miyamura out haha. So instead of that movie where the dude just ran away from it already and so did Hori into her bedroom lamenting herself, they, uh... I think you can watch it yourself to take a hint, but yeah, I would say "making out" is the safest word to use here? Because I highly doubt pene... that thing, even happened please they did not even have condoms. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And also we took care of our MVP Souta who agreed to let those two make out in bed lol okay not that but you get the idea. Amongst all the like, sentimental stuff to the emotional stuff to even the... forbidden stuff lol, surprisingly, plenty of feels this episode alone compared to the past few episodes to be honest. It's like they have to put in the HoriMiya ship every episode and then have to also talk about the... KawaKura ship? I like just the Kawa ship though you know they got affinity when they end the same. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (Get it? Yoshi<u>kawa</u> and Ishi<u>kawa</u>?) Anyways, great proceedings moving forward, and damn is it going to end real well. How to say, it always ends well, so I wonder how much of a drop can they make if they can't stretch it to more than an episode. Remember, this is a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/yonkoma target=_blank>4-koma</a> manga adaptation which is why it works this way, but if there is some kind of bigger drop I don't mind getting into it. I could start crying to this series, honestly.</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0O2nZniunrt90y9ZGmUV54UEDureZz_A8nCz6nK5JZFZnPGkiAqFgKNyMfzJ6HWJayZ3oD-nSkbkcXuyK3mnTbx6APSpzuj8tD2YqU0g9-gfFEFebxU6WldGYv2gxDF1UDtdRwUeziqI/s320/horimiya07_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Someday I'll have the feels of missing someone so bad I want to hug them</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivD0ca04_LdQfdsoBEU_Thrw9amgG8s0EBhhaxEXDiPlKa83j5qIBrsLyNw7l72WmUeLtllyD7mNkva_21D41rX1-GBW4HGIA5nv7M2ANl9QfwcfJMT0IDQ0B2R4dm_t6MzWqY4LW_aXc/s320/horimiya07_girls.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>TFW you're into something that no one is lol</table></div></div>P.S.

I hope you like Titans because I'll be talking about this today lol<br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan70><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"That guy was worried about you!" Yeah Falco he is, for if Gabi dies he loses his job and goes back hometown lol</div></blockquote>I don't know man, Gabi, whoever you are trusting, really. It's not like they ate your mom or anything. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Hey, Eren. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan70) I guess we shall find out from Gabi's perspective, everything... wrong about this war? Okay. I don't even know who is right already so tell me, girl. Anyways, story. Story goes Gabi... I mean she got so many war crimes I can't even, beat up a Paradis soldier to death with a brick from the jail walls, and escaped with Falco. Easy, right? Well, among all the stuff Gabi is doing, she is more like promoting the war than Falco is suppressing the fact that they are Marleyeans who don't belong in this island. Still, they managed to survive, and stay in custody to a family of orphans who may or may not be Marleyeans maybe, but live on this island. Before we get into the actual storytelling, the two had to fake their presence, I guess. "We ran away from home" Haha unlikely story that b*tch was about to stone the innocent girl man!! Call her out but Gabi isn't a nice girl Falco no point protecting her lol. Kaya, who saw them in the river, guided them to nearby shelter so that, at least according to Falco, they can stay low before their rescue because we know he's the smart one who wants to see live another day than that idiot girl who just wants answers from Zeke which most likely will get her killed first very likely by Levi because he doesn't care about your age he will just kill haha. So yeah, Gabi has to live a life off Paradis for now, eating their food and staying under their shelter- Remember: To Gabi, all this is ridicule. As expected, she doesn't know how to guise as a soldier. Seriously? A very bad tool for war. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No really, ask any soldier if they have not lied through their teeth. Or any Warrriors who have stepped on Paradis, they'll know. *looks at Reiner* ANYWAYS (haha), we change our channels and talk about the world situation now. The citizens from Paradis found out about the war situation now and that Eren is held captive due to his... war crimes? Haha, hey Gabi here's your buddy. Some people leaked this info to the townspeople, and sadly Hange had to take care of them. Well not kill them anyways, but man, being Commander for her now must be rough. Though I would argue, she has more on her mind and has way more technical knowledge than Erwin than to lead the Scouts now, so yeah, it be a rough time right now avoiding citizens and juggling between war and... maybe not Zeke now because she might be going with his cheeky plan now (Historia no~!! Haha well she technically can't be f**ked right now so), but probably also, plans with Hiizuru are going quite well, considering they have devised a flying boat...? Okay, it's that advanced now? This is not even 21st century, right? Wow. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> My guess, it'll be a flop lol not without the Titan stone powers though. So, moving on, and since we know something will happen at some point during Gabi and Falco's stay in the stables, yeah, Kaya then reveals she is a victim of some raid on her village years ago by, you guessed it, Titans. It's kind of like Eren, but it's <em>her</em> mom instead. Hey, sounds familiar already? And yeah, we finally reached the part where we have to explain to Gabi what the sins of war are to the future generations, and how that should even be avoided even at the face of revenge. Because really, "with both sides in revenge when will it end?" is a common Chinese proverb I learnt as a kid. But you know, Marleyeans started it first. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> I feel like I say this and I'm already getting beat up by Gabi lol. Kaya managed to escape because a certain female braved out to fight a Titan so she could... run... (<span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Sasha <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> she mentioned this before in a flashback seasons ago), Falco reveals to Kaya that it's because of Reiner and the others haha yep, and Kaya kindly helped them to find a way back. Wait, what? Because despite everyone else "being ruthless, human-killing imbeciles", Gabi, Kaya is still a nice person. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> All in all, this episode... Gabi you f**king woke yet, b*tch? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, if she didn't after this, I can compare her to Eren already haha talking about him man, we might see more of him soon seeing the preview. Quite vague though so we shall see more logic telling by then. Also also, looks like the Marleyeans down hometown found out Zeke was a traitor, and they can't wait for the world to help them tackle the island, so... surprise attack? We shall see. Remember when Reiner wanted to die so bad? lol</div><div>[I would like to give some credit to <a href=https://myanimelist.net/character/149205/Gabi_Braun target=_blank>Gabi's voice actress</a> Sakura Ayane for really, really drilling down what hatred means in this series... which is probably more meaningless than Eren's lol but man is the acting really good]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqWhQratWSFNJpa5Q2JeSPHyK4cvjR70xqbnz13SbH7jiwEWF6T-FeanCX8k_7apszg0RgBe6BNIdwn2-V6aCNr3UOuNgD6-fBBuBvAKS24a2QiMUc9G22Z0OB9AaRAA3Uid73vOBShdU/s320/attackontitan70_gabi3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you thought eating their food was ridicule, wait till you get eaten by... their horse? lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivMFCcNnRZKI41f4iZ1rFtrrBDX3hHkm00PMUvcjCilNQidFQHR_CYqgiayN1E-ChA2LJTXokbF-_W4qQI5ewFzMtL33TXGgblTpD6m0XK-18h_Qy7znHuAitWaMq1Uyhvr2lCU_xIaLs/s320/attackontitan70_sasha.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yes, I remember this part, didn't know they had to link to this episode</table></div></div>P.S. "Did you betray us and Marley?" Yes. "Why did you do it?" Because Zeke's an Eldian and he somehow has a way to end this war which will then in turn kill all of us? Hey, call me prophet haha I just watched last week's episode</div><div>[TL:DR; I don't have to put a war quote here to tell you this, but yeah, war is always a sin, especially to the people to survived.]<br><br></div><div><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week was quite a lot, so let's talk all about them. I still have no feels from <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/fight-ep/1551787082?l=en" target=_blank>ClariS' new single</a></b> and I don't know why maybe because the topic song isn't as great as the previous one for the same Anime and the melodies are quite similar, so I may sit it out. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/oikaze-ep/1548426061?l=en" target=_blank>SHE's new single</a></b> is kinda good not watching the music video so I might as well give it now already along with one of the B-sides because that makes me want to jump OUT of my room lol. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%87%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BA-ep/1551741127?l=en" target=_blank>sphere's new digital single</a></b> is... uh... no comment, but I'll see if I even want to give it first since it's a real meh. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/cho-kakumei-teki-koi-suru-nichijou/1547563250?l=en" target=_blank>Waki Azumi's 1st album</a></b> full of new songs is okay at best, because the clear distinctions of Rock and Electronic songs halfway through the album is making me favour more of the former, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7HEq99E9QE" target=_blank>YouTube highlights video</a> where she explains all the songs didn't make me like the other half more. Last but not least, because <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kuchinashi/1551590757?l=en" target=_blank>Cocco's new album</a></b> is actually really good it's obviously the reason why I'm disliking most of the releases this week haha I mean, ask my tweets. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But serious talk though, Cocco-san is a veteran at making things different. And all this was from the quarantine last year? Man, we should have them more often- Ah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> <br><br>On news concerning music and Twitter and maybe not Twitter this week, I'll get this out of the way first because <b>MIYAVI almost got me</b> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrQH2g-4qaE" target=_blank>his song</a> from last year on a CDTV Live (so no, not giving, and I didn't bother crediting on Twitter too) (I swear random comment if you said he's the best guitarist because in my eyes he's only a good music producer and that song is not guitar-heavy), <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1363297943717994497?s=20" target=_blank><b>Fujifabric released a new live video</b></a> on YouTube to showcase the special stuff in the Limited Edition of their upcoming album which is this live in full from 2 years ago and man did I love those songs, and no <b>LITTLE CREATUES</b> I'm NOT giving your new album since the last time I gave you like, nearly a decade ago haha. But really, not what I was expecting anyways, so no. </div><div><br>So for next week, I know I won't be giving but I'll still give <b>Kouno Marika's debut single</b> a chance for we have talked about how much I want her to sing original songs since <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/minnawagamama-feat-kouno-marika/1168505996?i=1168505998&amp;l=en" target=_blank>someone got her to do it</a>, <b>Ikimonogakari's new single</b> for Anime series "BORUTO" would probably be a miss but this is obligatory anyways, <b>LuckLife's new digital single</b> and I have high hopes for that because I've not heard anything yet, and <b>Teshima Aoi's new single</b> because after I shitted on it last week since Cocco I still think I'll be listening to it because... you know, there's nothing much going on already- I should find more songs to listen really<br><br><br><br><br>Okay, we're good. Cya guys next week then, next week's not a 4-day work week though so... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, for having this for like, 2 weeks straight, I wish I had another one haha I guess I can just get another day them colleagues be liking to burn money for lunch on Fridays anyways I can invest it to my weekend instead lol. Until next time people... I'm considering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8OjkcLzYCM" target=_blank>VTuber original songs</a>. Yes, if they get into Klassic Note, that'll be the second exception I'm making after mobile game "Alternative Girls" which will contribute to the Anime genre of my music library. But thank goodness for now, the latter is easier to give so we might be good. And I just consolidated that package for shipping, that birthday package, so let's hope I can get it by the end of the month, fingers crossed. Okay bye</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. When you know you have that birthday luck and win in all the gacha on that day besides... the one game. Thanks, "Alternative Girls", really should've stopped massaging them chests long time ago haha</div></div></div></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
