Don't ask me how I would not care much but don't expect me to give you anything in return especially openness from the biological fire that is upon us haha no seriously<br><br>Let's talk about more Anime, shall we? I promised we will come back for a closer to real time review of these Sunday airtime series yesterday so let's do it!<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=TanMoshi06><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Siesta... How did you procure such a thing?" I mean, Kimizuka, is this surprising to you? She's THE detective, bro, she can get her hands on anything including you lol</div></blockquote>Please, Siesta, we'll only do stuff inside this robot AFTER this is all over haha why is this sounding like a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/hentai target=_blank>hentai</a> now. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> In this new episode which I guess we are going against that SPES leader already (#TanMoshi06), we have quite some stuff to go through I think, considering I don't think we will get to <strike>Hell</strike> Hel this easily haha since you know, if that is done why would we be talking about someone's death isn't it. So, story. Story goes that Siesta came in with a government issued secretly developed robot (government as in British apparently because where would the Big Ben be at) (at under construction state haha got them) to go against Hel and her biological weapon, I don't really quite get the action that is happening because I swear any action series I watched got me more excited than this (yes, even the whole "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/2787/Shakugan_no_Shana_II_Second target=_blank>Shakugan no Shana II</a>" which was a total drag), but long story short Siesta just straight up crashed that robot into the monster who is about to spew all his biological juice on this planet, likely destroying it in the process(?). Hel survived though and managed to escape, so whatever, that's the whole point anyways lol. Siesta apparently got injured so she is on a wheelchair now but seriously why isn't she dead yet haha, and the couple is enjoying their lovey-dovey time in some motel and doing everything but follow up on Hel's escape. As Kimizuka went out to buy groceries specifically apples which are probably better than the ones I eat after dinner lol (sorry dad but it's true), he saw some girl sleeping in a box on the streets of London? Okay, sure, Anime, you do you. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> She introduces herself as Alicia, she's seven<strike>teen</strike> haha (yes I doubt her statement too), and (more importantly) she can't remember anything much. I sure hope this is not like, a spy thing to ambush on these two but more of an extension to help her continue her detective process considering her current situation, but we don't know. At this point it just looks like a kidnapping incident done by Kimizuka himself and only himself lmao, so we don't know much about that besides the reality we see in front of us. Also, Fuubi-san is back? Coincidental? But yeah, she's here to fill these guys up... this family haha <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜Ž>*dabs*</span>, but suffice it to say she might be staying instead of leaving again just because that heart ripper is back in action, which of course you would remember that guy who was doing it was killed which can only mean (1) Hel is doing it herself and probably doing it without a wheeze since she can just disappear in an instant with someone helping her out and (2) that monster might still be alive somewhere since that's the only thing the monster eats. I mean, if Hel is eating human hearts too I wouldn't be surprised but you know. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> All in all, pretty straightforward episode, we are hinted with that eye in which Saikawa Yui is wearing today so that's something, and I still am just sitting here for the ride which would explain this comparatively shorter write-up, but you know, I'm already in it there's no way I can say no to Siesta. Or Nagisa. Or Charlotte. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Because we know like, this series needs plot advancement but it's too easy to progress so they had to dedicate half this episode into shitting on the kid and/or Kimizuka because all of them are savage now for some reason haha Fuubi-san included lol<div><div> [If you have heard enough voices in Anime you would realize the voices behind <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/21543/Yumiri_Hanamori target=_blank>Hel</a> and <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/30901/Maria_Naganawa target=_blank>Alicia</a> aren't that surprising they themselves have held similar roles in the past]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcPiEwQ7lZXZdKvUp9DpwSlny4ScCpPmrmQm86uA3KRa35ZWMhpFVwsZgWOet7XCn0a98vfwSKUKHpO-K0MzwB8BCmU-pV2u3WNyXhSLgIi2WV_klIg12EWeZPf7ME4i1e4ZhbdiYV5q0/s320/tanmoshi06_robot.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Can't believe I'll say this, but imagine how bad it smells in that cockpit haha<br>(Ah hey I wish I was Kimizuka lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhstiW_67nR-IU_QL7Jrhyvo1Dj6DctWEyOmF1VjX5npBNBtsphnJol8vCZ_Pxq4clrzOUFDkuOtHQI1rQjShue-D2t0xP_ht0gclNoKxF1aXlKNo0JwxBPRzBdbhrAMEUcU8HYODviBw/s320/tanmoshi06_hel4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I say something wrong and immediately got shit on lol</table></div></div>P.S.

Ah yes, that sixth dimension parallel I've heard rumours about lol we call that "Anime" haha in this new episode though instead of going sci-fi (#ShinigamiBocchan06) we're doing fantasy theme it seems, since we are promised a trip to the wizarding world so f**k you Harry Potter let's talk about big boobs which also doesn't exist in your world haha <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜Ž>*dabs*</span> Anyways, story. (Man, I only need Cuff to burn an award-winning movie series lol) I guess they need some comedic relief or just relief to show off actually Bocchan's potential in killing living things, as they clean up the conservatory. Well, as Bocchan mentioned, two servants can hardly manage the whole place so that the royalty can do their reading anywhere anytime lol, but suffice it to say it's just another day in the house, with Bocchan of course talking about what he has known about his curse so far, and presenting anxiousness in going to the sabbath just because. Again, why worry when he literally has the power to stop everything living... well I guess the problem is on the "everything" huh. No exceptions? Haha we'll see that in action in a bit, but yeah, thinking back on again, how any witches would ever drop a curse on this little boy without any intention might be unlikely, which will bring us to the visit to the wizarding world (go away Hogwarts) along with Zain and Cuff, which looks like the focus of this episode. No really, cats and boobs are getting in the way. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So, the trip to the sabbath. Besides witnessing some great 3DCG magic here and there, I'm still impressed on the efforts to make an alternate world seem bizarre enough and also jokingly close to reality because unlike other fantasy series, this sabbath is just like attendance taking and news updating lol I mean the shortened National Day celebrations in my country with the world on fire took longer than this lmao. *ah* Anyways, it's all cool until a couple of things happened which, thankfully, will bring us more to the truth behind the curse. Firstly, I like the idea of Zain having kids with Cuff lmao okay who gives a damn about Alice now <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> but yeah, they had to pretend these two humans cloaked in I guess human detection material would not be discovered by others lest... they put them in as food for their magical beings as we also saw in the episode. Then, are the guys playing ball? Okay that is not important lol you play ball in the wizarding world? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Last but not least though, is the talk with the host of the sabbath, <strike>Hikasa Youko</strike> Daleth haha ah hey who knows what's under that mask like what Zain mentioned if it's the real deal I'm not even surprised, (someone make <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Youko_Hikasa target=_blank>Yocchan</a> do a Daleth cosplay with the mask on haha sorry just my fetish or whatever) and because besides seeing super sexy witches smoking, this one leader in what is likely a group of witches I'm just guessing, seems to know a lot about everything making me suspect she might be the direct connection to the original series author lol. So, in summary, Daleth talked about how she was "just" an acquaintance of Alice's mom which will already lead me to believe the "witch who put the curse on Bocchan" is likely someone they all know, but sadly that witch who cursed Bocchan is already dead which I guess is a bit like Siesta because lastly, this witch died because she was too powerful which is likely also her greatest weakness. And yes Bocchan ironically the curse isn't broken when the witch is dead... Which also means that as Bocchan mentioned after they barely escaped being found out (maybe Bocchan should be a magician you see how he battled those magical vines?) because Daleth was quite a <strike>bitch</strike> witch in revealing their identities (lol), we now know that breaking the curse at this point might be unlikely after all, considering it's a high level spell probably tested out of prowess and the perpetrator has passed away...? Yeah, probably just to put us down for now, but hey, at least Zain and Cuff did help him out and got two kids out of it so win-win...? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So next episode... wow why must next episode's title sound so boring? I mean, it's only boring if Alice is ill or Bocchan is not himself either so how boring can it get? Haha I guess we shall see it... next weekend by the way we hit our boob quota this week lmao bye</div><div>[TL:DR; "It's tough never being able to touch the one you love" Oh Alice-chan you cad]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTLQr69rOx6ZGY9if3F1JGLQgBEW1Ow2oaa1XyHxuIWBE4I-ip1gS0BIcL8Jr36MuyEaTrWJSIqYYkq_XwbkoaQrB_U4NqW0gZHeBcL8hcpMPwudD4T2XZCtJAUf16Nk_zsi-Ee7oSK0s/s320/shinigamibocchan06_alice4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Seriously though I think Alice just has a large bra and keeps all sorts of stuff in there lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3ztR7wP1px522okXpvLu6SsODK-kU3f57rhG0-gql2CQ7UXzsXllcaYNkckt84v96MjrsclfECvvlOhKXLOjxfvPRlChVwAeK78yCVKfDm6S8rVhPpxFuL6Z5xZMWlb73HLI5Y_hxjaQ/s320/shinigamibocchan06_cuff6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Ara kawaii haha</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrBdyY9HLqccJJ7hwcLFrsa8tx0t-QGJirXeFnhdh-obGn3Bt1Pjkoprv_XU58PQfrWh7jR7dbqrWhwTIzpFyLQCWbL5JiqgdmRB4ZJgM-Dy1Yajj0CLBHKOgaggf2DeFox-EPekXcKTY/s0/shinigamibocchan06_yes.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>See?
