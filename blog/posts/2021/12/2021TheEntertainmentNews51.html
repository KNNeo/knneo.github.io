May your chest continue to grow- I should stop writing stuff like this on the first paragraph people will walk into this place thinking this is a porno site lol (yes I meant to put just a placeholder)</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, let's not talk about birthdays because ironically my superior's birthday is also today I found out recently (ugh) (haha), we talk about that package! I can only say, if suddenly we're doing an unboxing tomorrow, you need to know how much I was rushed to consolidate this order so that I can get all of them in one box and not have to pay more shipping, so please forgive me. Will be a good week to start this with though considering next week will be my last week at work... for the year. Haha I gotcha didn't I</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, Anime and Klassic Note and the latter is only getting more important than ever so please me do something about it, I have my cold brew with me because I had to wake up early in the morning for prayers (not the church one, mine's Taoist) so let's try not to sleep while doing this post, yes? I mean, how are we going to top that lingerie leak from last week lmao not gonna elaborate you can check last week's post LET'S GOOOOOOOO haha</div><div><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KomiSan11><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span class=head-title> Komi-san wa, Komyushou Desu.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Don't you want to hear the singing voice of (the) goddess?" lol Nakanaka I'm with you you get my vote haha</div></blockquote>Man, what does Komi-san got to do with what the class is doing for school festival? *imagines vividly* Oh. OH!!! <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Yeah that's why I want Komi-san to- In this new episode lol (#KomiSan11) looks like we are concluding this series with some school festival! Hey, I would like to say that is all the time we have left, but then you realize they have SO MUCH CONTENT it will not even end. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Let's talk about it from the start, because even the class deciding on what to do for the festival seems like a struggle. In a nutshell, Najimi suggested maid caf√© even though it's clich√© and we'll talk about why in a moment, Yamai-san would like to host a haunted house in case you need a reminder of her name and how much of a groping perv she can be in the dark lol, I'm going with Nakanaka's suggestion because honestly we only need one member in a band and that is Komi-san lmao (also in her defence I've never heard Koga Aoi sing besides in Anime "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen target=_blank>Kaguya-sama</a>" so that'll be an <strike>eye</strike> ear-opener if it happened but sadly not), Agari-chan wants whack-a-mole because she wants to get hit and I can't believe they have a masochist gang in class lmao, but I'm sure they will find that Makeru-chan will join them in voting just because she wants a games stand lol how many times can she lose, no movie production I guess thank goodness haha, we'll talk about <a href=https://jisho.org/search/onigiri target=_blank>onigiri</a> later Nene-san haha you see how much interconnection they have in just this one episode, and how did three people vote for a disco. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Well, other than some obvious ones which are unlikely, and thank goodness Tadano didn't decide for himself as chairperson which he should have, but he did consult Komi-san instead so yeah we getting maid caf√©. *yay* Next up, preparations. Turns out Komi-san wants to help but can't because the others are stopping her from doing so due to her super privileged status (and that's how society works too in general tbh) but is kinda saved by Otori-san who is tasked with helping to buy some resources but... wait for it... <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> And she said she will do it but as you can see even this paragraph will be lengthened if we only let her go she will only come back in a week lmao, so she asked Komi-san for help since she is very free lol you're not wrong she's just sitting there. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> The actual preparation for the maid caf√© is wearing out the class so no one can actually join them haha thank goddess goodness (lol), but Nene-san volunteered to join lest they never come back. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> But seriously Sonic, slow down. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Because as you may have noticed, this new character is not only just *slightly* retarded as in speed, but also suuuuuuper lag as if we are dealing with a PC from two decades ago. <span class=emoji title=üòê>*silence*</span> Someone please help I'm in nostalgic pain right now lmao. Anyways, Nene-san was worried about them getting lost which was the smartest thing I've heard in this series ever lol, but they still kinda got lost even though we did get some talk about of them... well one's using pen and paper so go figure. Hey, new friend, amirite?? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Really Komi-san, just join like, two clubs and it'll total to 100 people you'll hit it in no time at all at this rate. <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> Then, we have flyers to distribute. Unlike the last time with tissues, this one, we are to negotiate placing flyers inside shops to promote the festival itself specifically their class, and Najimi really wanted Komi-san to do it haha. Well, at least it worked for two places so that's good haha I like how all of them share a common process where it's hands out with flyer and black box and then it's done even though Najimi and Komi-san did it differently. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> I'm sorry, I meant Kokko-san. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> And we thought we're getting to the real thing, we have an all-nighter to burn before the day itself, so it's supper time! The girls in class made rice balls which is a thing? Well, in Anime it is, and everyone is guessing which one was made by the goddess so they can actually NOT eat it and just like, frame it and look at it or something- Yamai-san trust me I didn't have to read your mind to know this. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> But yeah, turns out, Komi-san made a weird one super well so Najimi can go screw themselves lmao, and guess who took it. <span class=emoji title=üòâ>*wink*</span> And last but not least, the real deal- There's a maid expert? Can we stop introducing more idiots we got enough of them already. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> The worst thing is we know how this works, remember the aunt at the summer festival with the strings? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> So yeah, just like everyone else, he's full of pride about the *shit* this Akito-san lol, but he's an <a href=https://jisho.org/search/otaku target=_blank>otaku</a> so I guess he'll take in anything lmao can we not show him in the shower. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Anyways, I was correct along those lines, but apart from everyone else in class which clearly can be associated with a personality, we have a sadist maid here just serving him water and staring at him intently... (Must... not... mention... <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34618/Blend_S target=_blank>Anime reference</a> haha) One would think to be Agari-chan but this dude is probably right in referring to Komi-san as <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kuudere target=_blank>kuudere</a> so I'll leave it at that. I mean, she is though, especially when Tadano is dressed up. Yes. As a maid. Thanks to Najimi, and if you still don't believe that all main dudes in a romance Anime have to look <em>slightly</em> more gay than they actually are, you need to watch more shows. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Komi-san's brother is the new god now lmao, Tadano's sister already proved to his family that Tadano is that way lol, and of course cross-dressing has to be the next big thing for our main girl. I mean, look at the "<a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/6956/Working target=_blank>WORKING!!</a>" series. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Okay I better stop here, all in all great episode I've been typing for a long time already, and WE ARE STILL NOT DONE YET!! Man, what else can you give me Anime, I don't even know. Hey, just, take off that maid outfit please, Tadano? Haha I'm done</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRppueUsqDj5g2bW8euOmMTmKp0Ua9KP2WBppiYYd6F-Q06JQS52p73akWo_ei9oGn2LUifkAAK_7HemBYC9mVDu1DOz50ZFNc925-QCsWoUFUqj929OQUdMtLNZkOnDZEPopUrnHPy_O4cQHctsPiY9UBillIKEI_50MX5-I26NSAeQ/s320/komisan11_maid1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW the moment I switched bodies with Komi-san lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJdTECzwIDMvpWa0iXOODtckFfAt3sB50CcRrxz4uFE7wMtk2xwk2THFVQ8yZMk98alZROlbeA7jKgYrzS81RusTKwgML0bbmYDazBSoOL0KR6lwXvP9EniEVzNDodjdNyNOefzzOcNzFp-q7wrKU9q7wO2PQUdIegKpBRgdFggvmgeA/s320/komisan11_god2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This needs to be a spot at like, the back of the classroom at all times haha</table></div></div>P.S.

Uh, about that...</div></blockquote>Man, Ryotarou, what did you do to your sister that she's willing to walk for days to see towards your safety? <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> Anyways, in this new episode (#TaishouOtome11) where it's nothing but sadness now, Tamahiko heads out of home to find his beloved Yuzuki. Aww, that is already so heart warming. You know, just in case we have to talk about more bad news. *OOF* Anyways, as he heads out, the kids from the village came to find him at his place uphill, and <strike>Aya</strike> Ryou-san (Why did I say Aya? Is it from Yuzuki? Oh) decided to join him mainly because of her brother, if you would recall, left home to work in the city in view of the family's circumstances which of course includes that useless father but ignoring that lol, Tamahiko in return also wants everyone else in the village to be safe and offers his still sturdy abode for all of them to stay for the time being. Ah, nice guy Shima is not something I'll say everyday but for this, I'll make the exception lol. So yeah, the two head out, and as they walk a day and a half towards the city from Chiba which isn't very far but it does take a couple of hours via car today so you can imagine walking, they witnessed a lot of sad news along the way just by looking at the houses that were destroyed... besides the Tokyo train station that is still standing. Yep, can imagine how bad that is already. Also, if both of them are going good chances one of the people they want to see <em>might be in trouble- I don't want to know!!</em> *aches* Okay not going to jinx it since I didn't <span class=emoji title=üòâ>*wink*</span>, this is also ironically, the episode that brought everyone together. Okay, not Tamahiko's dad because I rather he be cremated right now lmao, but yay MVP Tamako is back!! <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> And this is our first salvation point: medical assistance in times of crisis. We also met the uncle who has prepared a first aid station to help the injured and Tamahiko who fainted out of fatigue walking the distance, still insists on finding Yuzuki no matter what it takes. But as the uncle said too, it'll be real hard without a clue unlike Ryou-san who actually knows where the brother is working at so at least it's easier. (Yeah she found him, thank goodness) From here on, depression only sets in worse because despite with the help from Tamako going along to find Yuzuki while Ryou finds her brother in another area, the siblings were still unable to locate Yuzu after days of searching and asking around. Serious talk though? There's a Chinese saying I know of so really "human if alive, corpse if dead" Tamahiko but going by things right now where they just cremate people together this might be hard. Like, really impossible hard. However, all is not lost, as we almost witnessed someone jumping off a bridge into the river- Just joking that wasn't the case, but with that the siblings met the actual Midori-san! Yes, the one who Yuzuki was supposed to meet... until they were separated- Ah I F**KING KNEW IT I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE THIS EASY lol ah hey, Anime experience. Well, watch enough drama like this you'll figure it out too tbh. But yeah, I'm not going to expect a pregnant woman to be able to crowd control under such hectic situations along with a shortie (GOT HER lol) to not get lost in the flesh, but as Midori blames herself for Yuzuki's disappearance and I assume Midori probably got taken care of since she does have a baby on her, where also Tamahiko kindly left his sister behind to take care of her while bravely continuing his search. Luck finally got to the better of him because apart from finding another pair of siblings haha how are the Shiratori guys here I don't even know but I could use more of their songs hehe, thanks to Tamahiko... sort of helping some kids out he was able to locate their "elder sister" who turns out, is whom he was searching for. Aww... so there is hope after all. <span class=emoji title=üòä>*smiles*</span> All in all... I mean, I've used two packs of tissues and my shirt already what more do you want. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> <span class=emoji title=üò¢>*sob*</span> So yeah, thank goodness we don't have cliffhangers in this series so looks like we might be good. How will this end happy when the world around them is on fire? We shall see. Anime, please don't create an Anime death I can't even deal with it especially when we are ending this year soon</div><div>[TL:DR; "This is about eye level for Yuzu" Dude we're in a crisis right now and you can still make short jokes?

Haha they are literally delaying projects, legally. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, don't ask about mine it's the same anyways lmao in this new episode (#SenpaiGaUzai11) since it's this timely let me ask you all too whoever is reading: How are you going to spend New Year's Eve?

It's end of the year, I'm sleeping all day at home lol not really for the sleeping part, but looks like Takeda might be doing that after his judo training so we same on that bro haha, but yeah, turns out Futaba might be alone this year. Well, seeing that the gramps is going on a fishing trip with his bros who are crazy about this super adorable of a granddaughter haha I feel you guys here, in the company dinner the guys talked about their plans for the new year. The boss is going on his usual skiing trip lol just wow, Ooishi is likely spending his single days with what's his name Hijikata haha sorry, don't guess on Sakurai because wink wink we know she might be trying to get Kazama to her place, and Kazama rather play video games than- Just joking of course he'll go because of Yuuto. <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> What a terrible excuse isn't it, asking him out afterwards. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Back to Futaba though, she feels a little sadness in her heart it seems, even after saying the year's farewell to her senpai. <span class=emoji title=üòâ>*wink*</span> So yeah, Natsumi will fix that in a while lmao ah hey, we got better things to fix. So looks like we're kind of playing the secondary couple thing here again this episode, because Yuuto gave the 360 on his sister by telling her he be hanging out with his friend (Must be that girl he paired with back then right? HAHAHA) so leaving her alone at home... with Kazama of course are you joking me? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Yep, it's happening for sure, this thing. I know, I know, you would think Kazama should be pissed at this liar of a woman lol but yeah, he doesn't mind, we've gone this far, so as you may expect they spent the night... together... is this even legal? And you dare say you not a couple?? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> The new year's dawn surfaced, and Futaba and Natsumi went for New Year prayers in case you don't know that is a thing with Japan not just Anime lol. Futaba wore a <a href=https://jisho.org/search/kimono target=_blank>kimono</a> for the occasion, but it's not until Natsumi saw Takeda at the shrine too that got her embarrassed wearing it. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> So, with the main couple alone lol, it's <a href=https://jisho.org/search/omikuji target=_blank>omikuji</a> time! Ah, for this I think the subtitles might have screwed up since not like anyone knows of the order of fortunes, so I'll help debunk their argument here by saying that... *confused?* Futaba's is higher than Takeda's luck from most of the Google search I just did lol, but it really depends, so be sure to get the reference slip when you are at your next shrine visit, yes? <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> Man, didn't know this is a cause for argument too lol. The two then ate ramen at the usual place after losing to each other over their argument haha, and... I must say Kazama you are just in time to make sure your death day is on the new year lol RIP Kazama you will be remembered haha I can't believe we have a character death in such a wholesome slice-of-life romance Anime. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> That's why they say you can't judge a book by its cover I guess. <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, I guess Kazama wins as he gets to rest on Sakurai's lap I can't even- Oh please just <strike>fuck</strike> get together already haha I know right? <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span> All in all, Sakurai is going to beat that kid up who tried to show something to Kazama with her camera lmao oh dear girl you should've uploaded to the cloud haha ah~ ah I think that's good enough for this series, isn't it? <span class=emoji title=ü§≠>*giggles*</span> Hey you there, you want wholesomeness and real life all put into one love package for your lonely (or not) hopeless romantic heart? You've come to the right place. Might I recommend you start from the beginning again, and watch how this ends next week. Man, can't describe how good this is already, so yeah, we shall see how this ends we still got the main ship to ship in this trading company so <span class=emoji title=üòÜ>*laughs*</span></div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=180 data-original-width=320 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHMYLLxdnvzlXJHc6JJYntCmf2dRfJmDpeyzivhk0FZeudmQDVMUvkFrFrbsMREyAsIp_uZ5h-gj-l4FqFRSjjX6dPhHdacoEynVgEljTh-lLwkaBrqi5QWKjAmUiKuNb5z7QxfqWRy8VMxkOQ6zE-RndCXD12SWfELU6vpSYkSD0xTg/s320/senpaigauzai11_sadge.gif width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>She is legit disappointed lol this is replacing all my sad emotes</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJI4eArdOWdjYOq-f8ZUYx-n7xYzxCjjTzeH6rXOel21mgoz5WbVfjIHEIcaRLPipk7k6k9h2hFppUTC3NgmyYHOk418NNnD5MIOnVYxYCFEqGnhyb9CLPKiInS_URzwN22qVUI77muUi24BvJMeWdXQKBjAvoIf7BsuJOgYuByGgrGg/s320/senpaigauzai11_natsumi1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>My work leave the week after next be like<br>(Haha probably not which is the problem)</table></div></div>P.S.

Yes, it's a digital single, and yes, it isn't great haha okay I gotta say more I guess. Overall I just think the melodies aren't great, the pop is just there to make it work to be frank, but I did get interested in the lyrics of the last song because they started with "bye bye" for some reason lol so I guess I might just give that if I had to pad the song count haha unlikely because of this anyways<br><br> In this week of music news that is on Twitter, we have a lot of music videos up online so let's talk about them from <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1470050149129125889?s=20" target=_blank>Aimer's new music video</a></b> which is meh, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1470349288064819200?s=20" target=_blank>Minase Inori's new animated music video</a></b> through her fanclub event which I'm not part of now lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/HZshizuku/status/1470348862493966339?s=20" target=_blank>Polkadot Stingray's self cover of Hanazawa Kana's song</a></b> written for her by the vocalist Shizuku so sure I won't give it anyways, to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie/status/1472495815877066753?s=20" target=_blank>Takahashi Rie's new music video</a></b>, they all are songs that I won't give or have rejected lmao. Anyways, other than that, I'll mention again below but thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/afoc_official/status/1471419841395494914?s=20" target=_blank>SIX LOUNGE</a> retweeting about them but <b><a href="https://twitter.com/afoc_official/status/1449706758763696129?s=20" target=_blank>a flood of circle's new album releases next week</a></b>, I guess this counts but <b><a href="https://twitter.com/anime_kaguya/status/1471829214643224582?s=20" target=_blank>Anime "Kaguya-sama" is releasing a music album</a></b> featuring all character songs including for smallest main character song that had a music video lol their budget is on drugs right now, and <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AnisongtaishoAJ/status/1471823339144740866?s=20" target=_blank>Asakura Momo's "Pinky Hook" got an Anison award</a></b> which no doubt will be awarded again once this year's song awards is over on my side so yay haha it's good man do take a listen to the music video in full on YouTube yes she is from MusicRay'n who doesn't release anything in full until this year<br><br>So next week, as confirmed by me lol, we are making next week the final week of reviews for Klassic Note 2021, with <b>tacica's best album</b> which I will hope I can give more of them considering I'm slowly but sure getting interested in them and their album trailer was good, and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%9C%E3%82%92%E5%90%9B%E3%81%A8/1597851130?l=en" target=_blank>a flood of circle's new album</a></b> which I found out recently so I'll slap that into the list too since <em>I don't have any intentions to give them any awards from this release</em> HAHAHA ok me<br><br><br><br><br> I klike how Sumipe's birthday livestream on Instagram is literally her having dinner and eating cake haha even after I went for dinner and choked on a fishbone¬†(Audience: lol wut) (yep) I still am able to continue watching her stream she has gone for real long I was just doing this post while watching/listening to it lol it lasted for 2 hours. Cya guys next time then, and as I mentioned earlier in the post, we might be meeting again sooner than we think, so let's see if that package is the last spurt I need to finish this year's work haha bye</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I'm probably more excited about the announcement of Anime "BLEACH" and its final arc starting... about a year from now in October 2022 so yeah that'll take some time but the animation quality is real good at first glance so let's hope to not have terrible animation like <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHnz7W9_QPm7EBbx-qS9Qp-o1d9zNvPOBU-t_wupyCHOMj3xtJMQjPlKrqFVCPuOb2TKE6fe6dI4wCM51FAzvr74BihHG1CM1dxEMKoGrIiuqS4Hz-4x4CmXEDEHqcwym5W7evjpR_BPb8l4NBX8CrpMRiB1so008p8-n2i9a-jgTsXA/s320/bleach308_95.jpg target=_blank>that Aizen fight with Ichigo</a> lol that is some animated trash I tell you you won't notice a difference watching it in 320p and in 1080p lmao</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content ¬© 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
