Is it that I'm not bored at work and have something to do that I'm not just tired over the weekend? <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Okay, me, I still don't understand you lol you literally cried for help at work I can't believe you can still smile today <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span><div><br></div><div>Anyways, welcome to the weekend or by the time you read this the weekend is over already, but yeah, we are at the final stretch! Of 2021 actually lol that package might just appear by this year who knows it's not even sent out yet haha by next week I guess. So yeah meanwhile, we have a couple more music releases to talk about, the Anime this season I watched are still phenomenal, and I may have refreshed social media too often because I'm that bored lol I should just play more video games or something</div><div><br></div><div>So yeah, more Anime and music this week, let's get to it! Did you see that Fuchigami Mai tour pamphlet <a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1466361501434859523?s=20" target=_blank>it comes with a CD</a> too but girl <a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1463824788745375745?s=20" target=_blank>I just want the book</a> lmao<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KomiSan09><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Komi-san wa, Komyushou Desu.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"When I start thinking about how I'm starting school today, my chest hurts" Wow same girl, literally me going to school every morning</div></blockquote>Looks like we have a student from the countryside? Hey, does this series need MORE lore?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where sadly the summer holidays are over (#KomiSan09), I guess we have more characters to introduce- You think this won't get a season two? I'm just waiting for the end of this month to see it happen lol. Anyways, let's talk about country bumpkin and if my Japanese were better I would've remembered what her name is because don't forget every single character in this series mentioned has a name literally derived from their behaviour, so introducing <a href=https://jisho.org/search/inakamono target=_blank>Inaka Nokoko</a> lol okay what a name, I really thought she was a transfer student until I realized (1) she has a Hokkaido accent because she ends with -dabe and (2) she is just like everyone else in class where they admire Komi-san too much they think everything she does is perfect which is not speaking which does say a lot about idolism today so <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Nokoko here thinks Komi-san is the perfect girl in the city considering her experience being in it lol not wrong, but she also gets amazed on how Komi-san can go into a... sandwich restaurant I don't want to reference anything intentionally lol, and under Najimi's crazy instructions once again, order some ridiculous menu in which is obviously not done right but again remember, she has communication problems so I must say I'm quite impressed on how she can keep doing this silence thing EVERY SINGLE TIME lol I feel like I'll get beat up in the alley if I don't speak. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, Nokoko probably did a better job than her because she probably spoke out her order, and Najimi had to apologize again for what pains she let Komi-san go through lol. Next up, and this is why you have a phone Komi-san, so friends can message you to invite you to hang out. And so did <a href=https://jisho.org/search/chuunibyou target=_blank>chuunibyou</a> nerd Nakanaka, who despite probably not hanging out with many people, decided to take a step ahead of Yamai-san how dare you lmao, to invite her to her place and maybe play some video games if dear Komi-san even knows how to use a controller lol. But yeah, Nakanaka is just thinking about refresh rates on her THREE 4K MONITORS you monster lol, while Komi-san is just thinking if normal people had rooms like these. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Spoiler alert though, Komi-san? No, this is abnormal. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Also, for having my dear RumiRumi (Audience: Gross) (I'm terribly sorry lol) say so much nerd stuff even I have to question myself if I knew of them... I feel sorry for her I feel like I should pay her to stop her from voicing this role. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Eventually Nakanaka can't deal with two of them alone, so she asked for Najimi's presence who then suggested (and this could've been done from the start) (yeah imagine if it's not Tadano teaching Komi-san to play but the nerd <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span>) playing some party or fighting game like... I'm not going to do more references but I think you can guess if you are nerd enough lol, and you know, see Nakanaka have a fun time with her friends, and when I mean her friends I meant Najimi because that's all she had anyways. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Then, we have part-time job? I thought Komi-san would've been better being the mascot since she doesn't speak, but that'll ruin her image as the appeal factor to... distribute tissue papers? Okay. And ironically, she isn't doing it until the one person who CLEARLY wants tissues lol the name is <em>so meta</em> (nope, not gonna explain the name) (yeah Facebook come sue me lol), where the queues started forming and (why are you here as crowd control Yamai-san lol) Najimi and the gang eventually got the work done. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> Sure, man. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Last but not least, they gotta end with a cringe moment which I don't mind, but yeah, Komi-san's dream is those future-predicting ones in case you don't believe those exist because I dreamt of people having a sesame seed on their face lol, and... we can just refer to each other by family name lol they haven't gone steady it's too early to call dibs on lovey-dovey names yet HAHAHAHAHA lol. All in all though, great episode, we don't need new characters stop printing more thanks, and I feel that Komi-san's appeal... is running low. Well, at least to me. And I would appreciate it if no one comes to my house for death threats, thanks. *locks door* Cya guys next time haha</div><div>[TL:DR; Bear in mind this is not an educational programme where we teach you to improve your communication skills because as you can see Komi-san can dodge everything just by being beautiful and having a broken vocal chord lmao]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtvVnGu0hyphenhyphensrF-8bCpOZt0_c2EGtglRxqWMcsMb8rqbYq0kLT_39WxM6dxM1PTBIdEf5z2cRLs5AtqqRhMX2rEgJEf8OAZa_m9_JHifuiRVfkiVcjocPxERNuLxi9QCPcMebS4p7age2LEnK_3kE5QdxCXn1iGLtWOItAaLl7c6-mumw/s320/komisan09_nakanaka4.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I force my friends to watch stuff I like which is never btw<br>(Can't have Anime to watch with friends when you don't have friends <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDr_Xtn26i16YitraFpiFbz4Or20xN1Lz7wCzBFtV28nVczmSgS2W277DX4nQYIq1Aj99mWSyPhTfr-BMK3nDQc2b0ItKIJuqukmxjXFXf49bsZCgn_RAl-W3KU73H32TuxI6Lti0pOIqBBk1bDmyJPQiM6a9jWxDVtHMgi5mgFVIhPQ/s320/5wp98i.jpg target=_blank>*brain tap meme*</a>)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=1080 data-original-width=1920 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5RIdVcrL2HenEZew-IyNDd7gA90cXJXfhkug3m_-KlRsiLS6q3ihpgCy3ZiZnvAJAw7bUlxgl3iVo4O_ab7miJdCGB6wPNEJggZwZsHjKrHQlZAa9j91nK9_CJ3fWhA8Bs51htRqzun7F2bOv1QH6rtZnpSF63ZwBuXw-bXd6WPkKOw/s320/komisan09_friends.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>If you know any of the posters in the background I would love to NOT be friends with you lmao<br>(I can only recognize Re:Zero and maybe Sword Art Online)</table></div></div>P.S.

Oh wow GREAT START lol it's not that hard though Yuzuki knows everything about it haha</div></blockquote>Oh Tamahiko and Yuzuki, so that's not true? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> GOT'EM lol in this new episode where Hakaru MVP for getting this ball rolling (#TaishouOtome09), let's just say all the songs are great when there's only like, 3 of them within the village, yes? Ask yourself how many songs people are listening to nowadays when like, two decades ago without the Internet we are still listening to the same set of tunes. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Rant's over, story time. Man, I sound like a Hakaru lol and we will find out about that later, but first, Kotori-chan's reason for being at their place. She wants to know about love. I mean, she can just go to the nearest brothel to learn about those lmao, but yeah, she wants the pure ones, the ones she heard from her twin brother that exists for real and is still piping hot... yes she be talking about our main couple here. She explains how much scoop she wants from these two, and they obligingly agreed just because she be their idol and also, they understood how music can be so powerful it makes Klassic Note Song Awards exist lol, but not everyone. Hakaru, specifically. Not that he doesn't we'll get to that in a moment, but more like, whatever Kotori-chan is now, how she can write songs and be an idol of talk, how she can be writing a column for a girl's magazine... what? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sorry but is this a thing in 1920s Japan? Don't forget context, people. Is that really a thing? I don't know now lol. Anyways, the two eventually figured both of them out, these twins, especially how Hakaru is totally avoiding his sister for some reason, did not even bother to talk to her about music no more, considering yes, we saw some flashback of Kotori with her brother with the guitar and singing together. Since Tamahiko is such good friends with the dude now and he did take a piece of fish from his lunch lol, Tamahiko decided to pop the question. Similar to Tamahiko though, Hakaru also fell ill as a kid even though he started this music thing on both of them, who then decided to give up on music in order to focus on recovering, which I guess is fine but you know music can heal wounds too? Not just the mental ones? Well I guess you can't really guitar in hospitals so that's understandable, but yeah, in just seven years not only did Hakaru recover probably be an even bigger miracle compared to Tamahiko's lol I'm sorry to say that but your dad is still hating you for killing his wife lmao what, Kotori-chan also became a singing legend recognized by many for her creative work. Man, it's all the more reason why you should fulfil your promise back then. I mean, it's no Tamahiko disability dude, you can totally go back into music- You know how cool would that be if it's a twins band?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, I'm sure that exists somewhere, but you know, just an idea? <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> Anyways, everything else in this episode is not important besides the singing with the kids and the last part, so if you missed that I don't know why would you, because that was so good I started thinking of my love life as a kid- Okay that's impossible that was so long ago haha. All in all, it seems like every other episode in this series is meant to make me tear up so you're welcome I guess, but yeah, looks like we're only getting more of these as their love settles down and we start to link everyone's lives together to actually show how much the main couple's lives have changed since they were together. And looks like we're getting more wholesome moments where Yuzuki goes back home to visit her friend in school. I'm very hopeful from the preview that this won't be sad, but we shall see.</div><div>[TL:DR; "Catching up to Kotori-chan right now would be exhausting" Yeah Hakaru, is it though?]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqk4-MjGc-amPAJqxStJLkVY4eKWZ5Lkd4oePGfxVCzKgsrh5-EOVqufWMGs74FVdsVxyYgUW2JZLPX8esrVciKWoTXJMH65kdo50FL2FxqTwlzUTCnBUEu6srABdrVg9GVjdiCKoKsAwkXqsMY3Ws3OYjLQTgXMlOyUWwOCj1czQM5w/s320/taishouotome09_light1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when I wake up in the morning and my mom pulls out the curtains lol<br></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4Zmj-c9IPfixK_Azirb3IypyDjI2vULH2To_dZiFJrzYsit4blvE_g4O0kpSq3BEgou36z8D1m2TsulPG42erv247LvRIlZBSZdMbhnG2t-W7cczGugvGTqXs8FNlC3Pk3_OkXyzYCoC_N7XjGeH7kquArRGzm-G0SKPFLVHxWUntEA/s320/taishouotome09_couple3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Man, I wished I knew how to ride a bicycle in tandem with... someone I like at the back haha<br>(Oh well can't ride in tandem if you ride alone *taps brain*)</table></div></div>P.S.

Hey Futaba-chan? Someone higher up in this production asked for this budget so shut your damn mouth haha</div></blockquote>I know right? Futaba be like questioning why is the whole Anime cast here when I'm already disappointed about why aren't all of them in swimsuits right from the intro. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where it's summer I guess lol and I don't hang out with my colleagues at the beach or even for anything <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> (#SenpaiGaUzai09), I guess this is the fanservice episode, yes? Ah, this is so good I can't even. <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> So, story. Story goes that Sakurai asked Futaba out for a weekend at the beach of course including lodgings, but turns out she invited the whole gang. How she invited Natsumi I have no idea, they know each other? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, they had a great time. The end. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> What, you want to know more? What's else to know? We already know the main couple's great senpai-kouhai relationship; We already know the secondary couple's great lovey-dovey relationship; We already know about Yuuto's soft cheeks... Wait, you don't know the last part? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Please, don't even ask me if there's a thing between Natsumi and Yuuto, because I'd like to believe that she wouldn't be ruining his relationship with the girl he knew at school, but more of, Natsumi is surprisingly a nice person despite her... rowdy tendencies like skipping school as a kid lol. (Oh yeah she did punch a dude but so did I so) (<span class=emoji title=🤫>*sshh*</span>) But you know, the gang played on the beach, went for a swim unless you're Futaba-chan because for her we gotta start kicking first lol, ate great food at the hostel, played with fireworks haha I hate my country for this lol, slept or unless you're Kazama or if you're one of the girls who talked about relationships with the lights off I doubt you slept haha, and so much more. I rather let you experience all the fun that has to be had on this episode alone, even the swimsuit reveals don't do them justice. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You know how it's always the dudes change faster and they can wait for the girls to line up and you see Futaba-chan and you punch yourself in the face? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, I feel like I'm going to end up insulting Futaba when I don't want to so I might as well stop here. This trip is also technically a time for Natsumi to find out about Futaba and her colleagues and it definitely made her feel relieved, if anything. We probably wouldn't even need to be worried about how things will turn out at this rate, for I rather have Sakurai and Kazama be the main couple if I could change this series out lol it'll be a different title by then though. All in all, great episode I especially like Natsumi's rack lmao hey Kazama I'm with ya, gotta love that smug on Futaba's face when she found out about Kazama's thing with Sakurai lmao, and guess who forgot to put on the suntan because she got sheltered (literally) by the grandfather every summer.

Haha man, I wished it was singles and they don't release in that Christmas week but oh well. <span class=emoji title=🤷>*shrugs*</span> Anyways, for this week, we have <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/soda-pop-fanclub-4/1594590710?l=en" target=_blank>Cider Girl's 4th album</a></b> and despite me talking about me bumping into their releases from time to time is always timed on each album lol I did listen to one of the singles tbh, but yeah, their style should be easy listening to many but it's always the melodies that fail to impress. For this one though, I thought it was actually good and accompanied by the short hiatus I had not giving new songs, I was able to give a good amount of songs other than the obligatory Anime theme song I had to give which was unsurprisingly bad because why would you change pace after the first chorus. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So anyways, that was great, and I hope the rest of the month will end this well. None of them here are Top 20 contenders though lol I just thought <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1466719811980107779?s=20" target=_blank>that Halloween song</a> is funny<br><br>On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and I don't think I can come up with a better title for this paragraph honestly, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1465155466841837571?s=20" target=_blank>Amamiya Sora's new music video</a></b> (preview, as usual) is nothing but her and besides being a song she wrote there really isn't much impressive besides her looks lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1464969831074123787?s=20" target=_blank>Aimer's new songs are released early</a></b> in view of her actual new single in January, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lucklife_info/status/1465607785492606983?s=20" target=_blank>more LuckLife live footage on YouTube</a></b> is always a joy they don't appear on TV or rock festivals often anyways, that <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1465621629434662914?s=20" target=_blank>Ikimonogakari vocalist Yoshioka Kiyoe's solo song music video</a></b> is animated and featured <a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1465689574005379077?s=20" target=_blank>herself and Hanazawa Kana</a> as voices in the web short, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/omigawa_chiaki/status/1465697606181425164?s=20" target=_blank>voice actress Omigawa Chiaki</a> I found out that <a href="https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/1465702940828528646?s=20" target=_blank><b>marble released a new song</b></a> and boy did that bring me back please tell me you have releases planned after this long, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ORESKA_Official/status/1465702153029185554?s=20" target=_blank>ORESKABAND released a new song</a></b> again but I'm not that keen as the previous time, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_mu/status/1465848170907578369?s=20" target=_blank>Night Tempo released a collaboration album with guests such as Uesaka Sumire</a></b> and yes this dude's a DJ so you can expect what songs will be in it so I'm not reviewing that, <a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1467350484067680260?s=20" target=_blank><b>yuiko is singing for indie songwriter Luca's new song</b></a> and it is something she sang for quite a long time since that music group Primary she was in didn't release any new songs, <a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1467454124757491719?s=20" target=_blank><b>Minase Inori released a new song</b></a> for Anime in view of the new album likely for next year, and I don't know how I missed <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sambomaster_txt/status/1467408626499592194?s=20" target=_blank>Sambomaster's live streamed on YouTube</a></b>. Man, when I realized it was over and tried to listen to a couple of songs and they cut me off? Welp. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Oh well I've listened to them many times over the years and I'm not so much of a live person so I'm good. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> (No really, I am)<br><br>So for next week, I hope I can review <b>LuckLife's new album</b> which is quite a while already I've been giving new songs but I could use more of them, before I get totally owned by <b>ChouCho's best album</b> and her infamous Anime theme songs trash the heck out of an independent band and I have to give half her album already. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Well, ChouCho's prime is <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/butterfly-effect-feat-choucho/1588871520?i=1588871793&amp;l=en" target=_blank>when she was not singing solo</a> but you wouldn't know if I didn't tell you so</div><div><br><br><br><br>I only realized how... weird I am when I talk about memes <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgK2u2E7wyeadXsAyE6KnB7vat34ZpwgkcdA7NnoCIpla8CENSDLr8JWeho2zc2zzqp7nmH52cG-pKrbbzg4IGDapM3Owm0dYn3exRvC1kTf-OvnmiATy-scWCCfelK5nf9Ny_01ucA-x4BiXZXCVmx3JBb5zFrVZZ5pSP8sRXVdSpu6w/s320/263314515_10159557781487460_537958011154410310_n.jpg target=_blank>like this one that I made recently</a> with some new type of virus type (lol) (I'm trying to be vague so this won't be recorded in detail here, the fire), and only found out maybe I was weird after all...? (I had to explain that this irony happens in our bilingual society where people do not know of the latter term and I heard it in the evening news for half an hour haha) Well, not surprising but their reactions are. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Package will be planned to come up by Christmas hopefully I'm not going to let that get stuck unintentionally with holiday orders I still have a Klassic Note Review due, and I still have the calendar for next year to set the next package in so, this and the upcoming one will be the last of this year. And maybe in a while because the taxation is coming blah blah blah even if not I will likely go for more digital approach ie. not buy physical goods and do digital stuff, say e-books or fanclub memberships. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> <a href=https://fc.toyamanao.com/ target=_blank>I have plans</a>, so we shall see. Cya guys then, and until next time... I hope you're still happy. I'm not, and I mean deep inside thanks to work, so yeah, I may want some change by next year, maybe starting with dealing with Army stuff I don't even want to deal with but have to. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Bye.</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Oh wow the new launcher which hosts that DOAXVV game will check your region? I may need a plan B for this because I don't have any lol maybe web version? That wouldn't be easy for grinding OR will it look good on my 24" monitor though so DMM GAMES can we don't</div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 class="page-footer">All text © 2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
