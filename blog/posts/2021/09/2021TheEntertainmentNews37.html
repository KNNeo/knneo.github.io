In this new episode where we snap back to present day (#TanMoshi10), I think we are starting on a new arc after what we saw of a long flashback from what is now 4 years ago because you know, 3 years she died and it took another year before the heart got to Nagisa-chan. Speaking of her, we have plenty to talk about on this ship. Yep, courtesy of Saikawa's huge fanbase and their fanclub fees lmao, we're on a ship now. And you know, it's no fun just being on a ship, so they have to coincidentally also see Charlotte who was also on this ship (wait, there were other passengers on this ship?? lol) somehow and we know it's not coincidental since she was here to find what, Siesta's legacy or whatever, right on this ship. Yeah, not that we know of that, and not like if she's dead why wouldn't she leave anything for the two sidekicks she had, but yeah, at least one of them is looking for it lmao. (One of them legacies too, no joke, there are more? Just a reminder this is a two-cour series ie. this spans two seasons haha) We got some Nagisa and Charlotte conflict but yeah, I think even till now we didn't really get around to Nagisa-chan's story even if we know it's just a heart transplant and now she's getting dreams of meeting with Siesta, doesn't really contribute to her credibility in working with Siesta or replacing her or whatever, but yeah, the others aren't that qualified either. So yeah, looks like Charlotte is the only one doing it now after she finally ends her last round of gambling in the casino lmao she's a gambler, and you know, more things happen on this ship. It's no surprise SPES probably got wind of this news too don't ask me how they know, but next morning after the guys have a good night's sleep lol well not everybody, there was an announcement from the deck which obviously is just someone from SPES echoing through the ship itself since no one is in the AV room, is that they got hold of Nagisa-chan. From last night. Haha guess who didn't have a good night's sleep. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, why didn't they abduct Saikawa instead since there's that eye, but at least with her and the two searching for her presence, we can at least confirm Nagisa is kidnapped by someone who can't be seen by her blue eye, so an android. And yes, if Chameleon didn't immediately spring up in your mind, you need to watch last week's episode again lol. But yeah, as the day is over and Kimizuka met with the bad guy holding Nagisa hostage (Tentacle porn, anyone? Haha I wish Ayachi was on it lmao *<a href=https://jisho.org/search/ojisan target=_blank>ojisan</a> giggles*), Chameleon asked the dude for his choice to either save the ship's passengers which are being evacuated as they were speaking, or save the one girl who has given him so much happiness since they met. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah hey, I meant Siesta, please. Nagisa may be an adequate replacement but have you seen Siesta drunk in her sleepwear? Haha okay I know she's great let's just not rip off dead people. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, SPES is just doing the dumb yet straightforward thing by destroying all evidence so even Charlotte can't do anything about the legacy, and without anyone digging Nagisa's heart out to save the legendary detective (lmao) we might just be in a pinch. Oh well, Charlotte might just come in at some point so I won't hold my breath. All in all, very straightforward episode, plenty of emotions from Nagisa-chan herself so I won't elaborate, and yeah, this is not exactly over yet. Not like Siesta mentioned about her will anytime soon, but I guess you have to figure that out yourself huh, as one of the sidekicks lol. Charlotte figured it out, so let's see if that will be a deal breaker for even Chameleon in this case.</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWru5hSRS-MotqSszbrjD4H3GK5BYPMugSAdkk214ztOHEgmz3_7_dhzu8oKNgexnKHfjZJKQJFGLc87Egy16mPKfQTyb4CbyCySCsILgBfiS_1VlnPsN_Q01ztWUdxPjU__sfSyZSekc/s320/tanmoshi10_nagisa5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Introducing: The many forms of Natsunagi Nagisa<br>(She mad but she's got nice teeth lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDjp9JmVd6Ww-HR3-i7knmV5apLd8FnBlN0XbNT_i0niLTIGeezdTWtFgfOYn14iaaCW7nD0-KBaP7HSBv3bk32LaO70z9bUjce7wdipfrqV5M7OU_OLYsnUUdnAN9i-3TosJ8mwMzPN0/s320/tanmoshi10_nagisa6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Introducing: The many forms of Natsunagi Nagisa<br>(She's got a great rack lmao)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkJHYYqdcyFhSaBno8PK2IHAUULY4PHIgqmOfrf9huL6pZDP3VDyhz1kDlUQ1c_3e97gHxjWjmXLUn7iCe2xwtQgiF0INl0_H-ybiipzyRHanwTOEnjnQByhlt_BaxSNOGRSS2aq_x5cE/s320/tanmoshi10_nagisa7.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Introducing: The many forms of Natsunagi Nagisa<br>(She's got... a great embarrassed expression on her face hehe)</table></div></div>P.S.

How did you even get pregnant as a slave of the mansion? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ignoring that, uh, ah hey Bocchan getting the stepsister route maybe? Haha in this new episode (#ShinigamiBocchan10) looks like we're getting some flashbacks? Hey, we know the conclusion of this series is likely not the lifting of the curse, so it must be something else. We might be getting there, as we speak. More wholesome content as we continue on the route after Christmas, and we totally ignore the mother on the dining table which is what I'm totally digging for actually since I don't really like those domestic affairs and could use less of those. Haha what is interesting than that though, is everyone else. For example, Cuff-san actually got to do things by herself, like go grocery shopping alone. Without Zain. Without asking for Zain to go instead. Yeah, she's growing up. Besides the occasional screw up on the communication which almost got Zain to interfere as he stalks his <strike>girlfriend</strike> buddy haha, but otherwise Cuff-san can take care of herself. I mean, she even knows when she got pickpocketed, so I would say she's good enough to go on her own. Then, we have the bed scene. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Haha, I know saying it this way sounds overboard for an Anime series where the guy can't touch the girl, but it isn't wrong. Alice volunteered herself to sleep with Bocchan on his bed even, and I don't even know what to say. Just... be careful haha. They had some pep talk regarding guess who, the mother for some reason, and I guess we're not having any s*x scenes for the night. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Moving on, we learn a bit more about the past, specifically from Rob to why Alice was here in this mansion. Yep, Rob MVP for this series by the way, or else we are probably still seeing depressed and suicidal Bocchan till date. So apparently, things were doing okay with the two at the old mansion, the kid was happy, Rob gets to serve the master, things were fine. But I guess as time goes on and Bocchan keeps thinking about being alone and his curse making everyone stay away from him... well, you gotta start thinking of bad things, isn't it? Can't say it's Rob's fault, but he might not be that great of a father. Hey, we don't even know if the actual father is even good he's not even around. (Ah) (Haha) Anyways, Rob knew that he needs to find some female caretaker who will talk to him about his troubles, so he recalls the time he saw Bocchan being on good terms with then kid Alice (which is super adorable btw) so she brought her in. He probably also got her out of the aunt's hands which is real convenient, and these two found solace in each other. This might be have been the best life decision Rob has made in this entire life- Rob MVP by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, we also know things don't last forever, which brings us to the last part of this episode, the reality of the future. Even Alice knows her good times with Bocchan won't last forever, and as much as Bocchan loves this voluptuous woman lmao, it's not going to make any stance to Alice's position in the household as a maid because societal status was a thing a century ago and not everyone is able to make their decisions alone as to how to live their life, whether it's family-related or romance-related. Think about it, and you'll see how disappointing and poignant their lives were compared to us. <span class=emoji title=😢>*sob*</span> So next episode... does the title mean we'll unlock some magic in Bocchan?? Hey, that'll be real cool if anything is along the powers of not killing living things in an instant lol cya guys then</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuZiPCpb-D_2DXvceBTyH3MDAEf4udKvB8FznMVTwEn5NqX5RwshNtI4Aa1Rc_2etvvPoaYIU817UPWqxkb9Y9NNun7boX9w2mIwRjW10tUhqmecDjwn43E5zFMRmdvOHQ0O6Q89BVVYg/s320/shinigamibocchan10_cuff3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Find someone who hugs you like how Cuff hugs the freshly made bread she bought<br>(lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEm6tM1KZ0QG8fniWsPnKG7sei1K8TFCKq-ZROlmQyIZIU_SX2aPWvpgC8xL0z7PnuIueMBW8wsOq7t8sdhmq2BeqWlkuDVr0rGE93PkQhYwMQLjqj1gj7BKpQgcGncWfoqAXoJg6vNJo/s320/shinigamibocchan10_succubus.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Do you even HAVE to imagine Alice as a succubus?<br>She is one already bro haha <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span></table></div></div>P.S.

But bro, please, show some restraint and make some decisions in your life and not be manipulated by the author- Ah. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, story I guess haha. I need to arrange all this a bit so please forgive me if I totally forget about writing this paragraph since you won't notice it anyways lmao. Firstly, we talk about Milika-san. In a nutshell we're not going to see a live porno lmao but we will in a bit haha, but yeah Rika-chan here just wants to hang out with Naoya just so she can have a chance with him more? Yeah, lovestruck already, isn't it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, from listening to Naoya's life choices to listening to Milika's... more fulfilling yet baseless identity lmao, it's not hard for this girl in heat (lol) to get excited at everything Naoya says- Yes it doesn't even matter to this girl now bananas are cool to her at this point haha. And as if 5 minutes of them together in the bath with Naoya in his likely tight pants which is probably getting tighter lol it's shrinking dude that's how fabrics work (thank goodness he wasn't wearing jeans lol), Milika gotta flash herself naked before telling him to leave- Am I really writing all this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And in his trip back to his room through the rooftop walking we mentioned this as a reference from another Anime so I'm not going to talk about it again, he slipped, and guess where he landed. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yep, so I couldn't believe they would do such a confrontation I thought it'll be more official, he landed at literally where Shion is. Yes, as she was entering the hot spring. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yep, the <a href=https://jisho.org/search/ecchi target=_blank>ecchi</a> references here are already beyond me so I'm just looking at it all and giving up at this point lmao. So part two, is the confrontation of Shion versus Naoya, the one we missed last week in school. Because you know, why not talk about stuff like this when we're wet and bare and naked in front of each other- Someone please help me this is literally the first time I DO NOT want to write this post. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Shion almost got him into telling the truth by dumping him with so many facts we can believe she will make of a good lawyer in the future (#TodayILearnt polygamy is illegal and socially discriminated in Japan), and also making sure he doesn't leave until he explains himself which I must say is of concern considering Shion almost let her towel off and still doesn't know of shame- Someone please help my typing fingers and my eyes that I have to read this. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> The two girls thought discussing about their trip would be safer in the hot springs so... guess who's the four-timing member in this complicated relationship. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I can't laugh anymore man I'm tired. I'll laugh at the flat chest though. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Saki-chan really thought that his boy got his d**k out <strike>in front of</strike> INTO her friend lmao I can't even, and Shion ran out in shame. Oh so THIS is when she stopped lol. Well, she probably also ran because Nagisa took pictures of her on top of Naoya so... please don't accidentally upload it to social media, yes? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Saki-chan gives his boy a good beat up out of this place considering this is a public female-only bath WTF, and last but not least we talk about Nagisa's life decisions so far with Saki-chan. Keeping the long story short, she's me if I try in life but still is average lol, but yeah, she's already content with weak-willed Saki-chan giving in to whatever this two-timing relationship is about- See, her friend is right; SakiSaki is weak. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So next week which is the final episode, looks like we are continuing with this pep talk about Nagisa's life, and how she mainly plays into interrupting a normal boy-girl relationship. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> I'm not even Naoya and I feel bad for her now lol let's see if any of us can wrap our heads around Nagisa's life next week I guess</div><div>[TL:DR; I won't say I have missed nude scenes in Anime even if they are censored... <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> But I actually did- Imagine if it was <a href=https://myanimelist.net/people/34785/Rie_Takahashi target=_blank>Rieri</a> man... <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpWWllsH_TdluvoTwH_4A5T78sHUmPC2sqevtEs_RtWt330yD146CwZ9NUQJ-3oZTkGTIEfmNIqvy0OfjDf2iCRVT4jbXUmjGg3w4GaQ12QSY3pk-bmxYQSoz1_JzUv5mhpVw5bDrkzdM/s320/kanokano11_couple5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This week on violence we have<br>(You think I forgot about these? lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghma_RDsI6Mry2jzzJh-Dbmfw9xBXNPAq4JEGz9xdxwfHBkUoNBa3ekGQKjfvMZx3Ia5vrJwDINTx6f6hXCkQxdBMxuzeeehKlzmH6o8p1rg6cSPtSFFT-3ZpPR58tnhxcuv5Yj7B4k-I/s320/kanokano11_punched.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This week on violence we have<br>(See Nagisa-chan, you gotta learn from your <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> lmao)</table></div></div>P.S.

This episode in a nutshell lol</div></blockquote>Wait, Mizuho's cats are having a meeting? What is this Anime even. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> In this new episode where Mizuho might be in danger lol (#SonnyBoy09), turns out, her cats might be even more in danger. Well, not hers if you recall, but yeah, I forgot I have to think about this episode more intellectually at every point. So, let's do this. Story goes that the Nagara team ended up in the same world as the party bus with Aki-sensei and Asakaze, in the world of Sou Seiji. (No, not what Americans think how Japanese describe their dong lol) Yes, there are two of them. Both are also called the same name. The only differences are barbaric Seiji doesn't dress in a suit, and he has one less hair on his head. Yep, fighting over such meaningless things. The others were right in that just removing one hair from the other Seiji or just give this dude a hair transplant, but we are totally missing the point here: He was fighting with himself. Remember the traversing of worlds and how everyone in this adrift world is like, a copy of the one in reality they can never escape to? Yeah, same thing here, but this is what happens when two copies meet. Yep, we're reaching that stage already haha. Sou Seiji has the power to revert all world progress to the point where all of them were before they were adrift, but because Seiji has to fight with himself every once in a while, they both use the same power and nothing happens. Worst thing is, no one remembers it, so this cycle continues. Why any of them would think this is a great idea to get back to reality, I have no idea. What I do know though that as Aki-sensei gave one of them some assistance to disable one of their powers such that time could resume in this world lol I guess sure, it's better than nothing. Literally, it's either two of them Seiji or nothing. So yeah, that was a waste of time lol. We did find out more stuff out of this episode though, specifically Mizuho and her group of cats. A flashback showed us kid Mizuho (we don't need another voice actress for the role Yuuki Aoi can handle all that I don't even have to confirm in the credits) hanging out with her grandmother which she hated a lot I'm sure, and started to hang out with the grandma's cats more and more until she wanted to become one- What? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Anyways, this one is just a short story between the cats who have the Nyamazon power specifically Sakura the white cat which is a millennial cat for some reason according to the others? Haha and it also thinks Mizuho needs to be protected. That isn't wrong as the dog senpai Yamabiko has found out, but yeah, in this world where everyone is adrift and did I mention this might be a place to learn life lessons, Mizuho might need to grow up soon. Apart from that, we know <strike>Rajdani</strike> <strike>Rajhdani</strike> Bill Nye haha, figured out Mizuho's power real early, that it's not that she can order anything even if it's living and the cats aren't allowing her to do so, but her power is to copy anything in existence. (Which is why copying living things is rough since Sou Seiji lmao) It's easily seen from when Bill Nye experimented with - he did a lot of this by the way so be warned - the orders by ordering something unique in existence and explaining it in detail even in front of the cats and that's how you know it's copied (keyword is "unique", you can't order a unique item), and the cats specifically interrogating them into telling the truth about their powers- How is this any different from that Seiji setting up a trap to catch Sakura to offer it to the gods? <span class=emoji title=🙄>*ugh*</span> (Yes if they can copy things aren't they technically connected to the real world? Is probably what Bill Nye thought of) All in all, if this is the only weird episode in this series you need to watch the past two months of content again lol, and even then we might only be scratching the surface. But as we continue to find more answers to the question the voice told them to give up finding just because, I'm afraid we can only think of this series as in imagination and analysis of life instead of treating it as a sci-fi thing. Because it's not, and I can tell you even without doing a double reversal on you lol- Okay thank goodness I did that or else we might never see next episode haha cya guys next week</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2O5sBSJJSTXB41bi127NOyGRLtpHSJj1ZDXSXuJAk7w9cj9aA9JQQdQzv_bmB3No6cVCOsK7u25YfxKfLNgT7eVUESvY98kKHtn5OT83Wik9PWIcV1gP63wh5VHnlC40Brlvo-RvrlVc/s320/sonnyboy09_mizuho1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Mizuho is so cute this episode I gotta share more<br>(My girl as she wakes me up from my slumber lol)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEsbetOgiOENPZ8wDWCrOUxzNTx-C4IZ4l9V0nQvZpW6xhmbxxeH0FrU9_H9OvHAzdZh5vFl8n4EOKuqGUTYl8g0Kak6TnpqFr1w4WTrBAVOKJAeChovi8bV0VNtOQoZk9jmGL-w-TCM8/s320/sonnyboy09_mizuho3.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Mizuho is so cute this episode I gotta share more<br>(Kid Mizuho is actually cute though!!)</table></div></div>P.S.
