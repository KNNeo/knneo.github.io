Oh hey, Ede-chan, happy birthday yesterday by the way. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> You are already 25 can we have a photobook please? I just lifted the ban on buying and reviewing photobooks recently so... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> *prays*</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, not talking about myself personally, I hope you have seen the work I've done over the weekend ie. mainly those packages for my birthday have arrived. If you need a summary RumiRumi won Valentine's Day lol I know right why bother pitting Ajuju against Aoi-chan I don't even understand</div><div><br></div><div>Not talking about any of them, let's Anime! I can't really talk a lot about music but I can for Anime. It's the time of the season where they dosh out announcements for the next season line-up, by the way. <br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=BungouStrayDogsWan08><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"I've never had flu since the day I was born" Yes, lucky you Akutagawa, not everyone has to suffer through this week unlike you lol</div></blockquote>The best part about Akutagwa falling sick is, you know, Dazai gets to visit. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Ah, man, I wish my crush would come to visit me when I'm sick lol I'm only sick in the mind haha. Anyways, in this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs08) when you have problems with Dazai coming to see you lol, Akutagawa has a fever. Not like a fever over Dazai or Higuchi if that is ever a thing lol, but you know, in general. Like when your forehead gets too hot, kind of fever. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And yep, in the dumbest fashion ever, instead of like, giving him like Paracetamol which I hear is the <em>typical</em> method in which to bring down a fever and most headaches (ugh too much experience, me), Higuchi went to buy him yoghurt drink. Yeah, just because he said the curry last night f**ked his stomach up. I don't think that's a proper remedy or maybe I should go do some research on it but (haha), so yeah go see a doctor. Who knows? Maybe you too have also contracted one of the most fast-spreading diseases in the world right now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, when you mistake a racoon for a dog. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, this pace of the series is strong, I tell ya. So yeah, it's literal joke fest when it's just Dazai standing in the middle of nowhere, shouting at a dog to come out when it's just like, Poe's raccoon? Yep, I remember that dude. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And noticing Atsushi maybe because the way he phrased it, it might not be the case because we can actually believe Dazai's an idiot lol, and also you know, so we can make Akutagawa believe Dazai is ignoring him. Man, the layers upon layers of whatever I can't even. Ranpo-san only sees a lot of them marching towards the Agency lmao. Last but not least, and this is my favourite this episode or even the series already, It's Port Mafia' First Body Double Competition!! <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, to be specific, the rules are (lol) the body double is to cover for their leader Mori Ougai for a shady trade deal, contestants are everyone in Port Mafia who has been casted thus far so whoever whoever appeared in season two I'm sorry lol, and it's whoever can capture his... man, count that <a href=https://jisho.org/search/shoujoai target=_blank>shoujo-ai</a> thing in too because if you don't sound like a pervert I'm sure the enemy will find you out. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So, for the results: Chuuya was disqualified just because he's waaaaay lower than the average height lmao must be the gravity powers (lol), Tachihara doesn't look half bad but he could remove that band-aid, Higuchi is for those female fans out there also perfect rendition of the lolicon aspect missing in Tachihara lmao, the lemon bomb dude also participated in case you didn't notice him for like 3 seconds in the video haha, Akutagawa might be the perfect double disguise until he opens his damn mouth lol Gin too but probably without the mask (hehe), and Hirotsu wins as Mori Ougai. No, as in, he wins because he can do it better than the original lol Mori just ended up going to the location as himself haha man did he lose so bad here. All in all, how to say, this is the level of comedy I expected walking in when I was watching season one back in 2016. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Hey, never too late, I suppose. Man, we're not even close to the end. Can we have a competition now but in the Agency? I can't wait to see like, Naomi dressed as the President lmao haha cya next week<div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjJgBiLTCvU67dzgPJjFzGZaH_qOsNvgtusBbpKKlXhYWFaba2cJtszumlBBabgVTnLsZ0PVdz92_QiBYVUjTb1dCIs9xXFDvjSzusnL9q1O6KnCkzPnQgN-6YHzj2QpwZAdwYWodhS8Q/s320/straydogswan08_mafia.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>We know who's in this meeting just to listen lol</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSIZYYiV4f3Ki_fkBd-yTZce3ITHTsAzKskx6KE-tLtlZZHDmNZzuI3wV7sPIKCEFhaw1RwmcHerv-Xi-jkHe-wLJJHrYAGsGoto1vgjo-ECEf7nw_E_ri-GxsGFX7GIxUg_JrUpjFhSs/s320/straydogswan08_akutagawa6.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yoghurt drink companies, I have your next mascot lmao</table></div></div>P.S.

In this new episode (#Horimiya09) we got more "friends" to talk about. Not talking about the ending, but more like Miyamura's... well the people around him who have been... observing him? I mean, what does bullying count as? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> And Miyamura might be right: There aren't any friends you can make. Eventually. Yeah. Just, you know, I don't want to. <span class=emoji title=😎>*dabs*</span> Anyways, story. Firstly, and I think this is Hori-san's fault in essence, is when she think's it's cool to hairdresser his boyfriend up in school. And then she gets jealous of all the girls on him. I mean, you asked for it, b*tch. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> She likes that stuff? Sure. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Sadly, Miyamura isn't all about that but we'll get to that later in case some female audience here is also keen on it lol, the couple chanced upon his... "schoolmates" let's call them that, in middle school. As we have learnt so far he's only getting bullied for being such a loner in middle school, these guys got straight into insulting him and his... probably not girlfriend with him. You don't want to know their fate lmao. But yeah, essentially he got the best deal out there in town: have a masochist girlfriend who can also beat shit out of people. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, if you ask me what my girlfriend ideals are, here you go Hori is literally it haha. How to say, Miyamura, "those two were great stress relievers". <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Right timing too, don't even have to think of something to appease your jealous girlfriend now. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, joke's over, moving on.  And of course Miyamura feels weird doing the sadist stuff, so he has to ask the father... who probably knows lesser. See, Miyamura, if the daughter bullies the dad you step in with your powers to teach her some respect, man. You see the cycle now? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But as we all have learnt so far of Hori from Ishikawa and Miyamura who actually know her more than everyone else, Hori may be popular but dating this time bomb would require a lot more than just being nice. No really, it's true. Next up, we got Mizuochi? I don't know, it's another random guy in class who probably looked down on him. You see... once you have a girlfriend you social circle starts expanding. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> No experience on that though, don't quote me on that. For witnessing Miyamura being an idiot about finding his phone until he dropped it knowing it's on his parson all along lol wtf, so him telling on Mizuochi how to date Hori-san... man, is this friendship thing really weird in these cases, but probably more true than ever. The masochist stuff... I hope that is not an IRL thing lol because I would LOVE to meet one. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Next up, Tanihara and his conscience waking up probably after getting beat into a pulp by Hori I guess. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Yes, it's another snippet from Miyamura's childhood, and apparently it's about rabbits. To sum it up because the situation in the locker sure is weird to understand, kids were off on summer vacation and Tanihara was supposed to feed them but didn't, and he shot the blame right at the poor loner dude. So yeah, what an asshole, this piece of shit- Oh Hori, you alright? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> But yeah, there are such things in school probably, not really the guy who will blame or have taken such blame before, but maybe, just maybe, it'll hurt if you don't move on. Again, Tanihara is the one feeling remorse of the rabbits dying because Miyamura ain't no killed any rabbits, yo. Who's the sinner now? So yeah, use your kid brain once in a while, yes? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Is this how I should review this? lol okay. And in the weirdest fashion ever, Tanihara tried to contact Miyamura. Yes, and still blamed him for everything even if he did not pick up the phone this shit can still believe he was ignored. He doesn't have your phone man how would he know. <span class=emoji title=😩>*sigh*</span> Oh well, part of growing up anyways. All in all, I feel... most not relatable, but sentimental looking back at this episode. How to socialise with another dude who likes your girl, people feeling bad after bullying you but loves the act of bullying I don't even know, your masochist girlfriend... <span class=emoji title=🤭>*giggles*</span> It's all in the day of school, man. Mine isn't as exciting but I'm glad Miyamura is living his life outside instead of inside, if you get that part of the episode.</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIBqP7W4ebICYoNwPrst9sphYVFCQ_GQcwMsm_uQCdUA4A_lyt7HPRaHrlYxWP6V7HZ8IeJNKvMExhWLyqL2jqKK5n65XCr09wSRYWuLe3GfC0gUmWp2-WtErmIendSDmPoRH1LjqcvvE/s320/horimiya09_slap1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This Week on violence we have:<br>Okay all is normal now haha<br>(Doesn't stop the opposite from happening though Hori likes that shit)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTpI5_8c8MAYrc-qgTSw4Y8kJjMq1xDLXVf0bEW9WylWiW6dX1jFmQ2L-weiLohzGdnv-L_AbULHJuSLfmnpvLY11-IEdwf-ftoZF4hnCFU822-gwXQADKiz4LkG3Xc8Ux5vbRrO1L2Zo/s320/horimiya09_lowson.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Couldn't be more elaborate, in case you don't know of Japanese convenience store chain LAWSON</table></div></div>P.S.

I don't know man looks like government sponsored treatments aren't working for a weak guy like me<br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=AttackOnTitan72><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title> Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"You may or may not want to save Eldia, but I'm sure those lives meant nothing to (Zeke)" Levi, you are very right</div></blockquote>And let me guess: Zeke already knows what has happened outside of the camp even though he's with Levi. Hey, prophets aren't everywhere but this guy is a good one. In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan72) we, uh, wow this is pretty f**ked up right now, I'll say it. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Man, the plot twists here are real. So, in the first episode of Eren's return into power to control the situation, we have learnt a lot of things about not war. Okay, should we talk about those first? Gabi and Falco? Yeah, let's do that first. So firstly, about Gabi and Falco's trip to an awesome lunch they will never forget. But of course, there's also another purpose for their visit with the family of Marleyeans: Kaya has noted to them on Nicolo who works on this restaurant who is also a Marley soldier, so maybe he can help them. Spoiler alert: He can't already. Well, mainly because he doesn't have any contact with the actual army already, so you should have guessed. Still, the kids go into his abode, have a great time eating, and Falco had to fake a stomach ache. So the two followed Nicolo into the cellar to ask him about... how to get them out. Sadly, they also had to reveal their identities as soldiers... who escaped Marley through an airship and killed some Eldians... which, uh, as usual, Falco's the one who saw it in case you forgot the context just like I did: Gabi killed Sasha, the one Nicolo likes, the one who loves his cooking, and who was visited by him on her grave which is also how they got this meal. Yep. Gabi totally deserved that hit, but again nice guy Falco strikes again- Why are all the good guys always covering for the dumb evil people? Haha I don't know. But man, is this already quite a climax, probably the best so far as remember last few weeks where we were killing people by the crowds with Titans? Now, it's even just killing the one kid that'll cause problems. They gone through a lot of talking which I think is necessary in showing how much Sasha means to everyone (RIP), maybe also Falco a bit (RIP) but yeah, the Scouts who visited also witnessed this whole thing. Man, isn't it hard to do war? Hey, not to the top in command who have the decision to end lives in their hands. They just have accidentally tainted hands even though they did not kill no one. ANYWAYS, moving on, we'll talk about how fast Eren is up with his plan to maybe reunite with Zeke. I would say Zeke knew everything  up till now even with Levi's soldier and his tip about what happened outside of the camp they were in. Because in case you didn't notice, unless I don't think Levi drinks and it probably wouldn't matter anyways, the wine they drank was drugged with Zeke's spinal fluid, and as seen in the intro, it kind of paralyzes the other Eldians. But since the dosage isn't that high, good chances they are meant for something else. Remember Zeke was screaming and Titans appeared? Yep. Haha yep. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Levi probably knows he's all alone in camp now without much supplies left, so good chances he'll be leaving sometime soon if he's still smart enough. Then, Eren springs into action at the restaurant. So firstly, as the guys were busy saving Falco, Floch and some guys came in with guns (yep guns are a thing now), just as Nicolo was talking about the wine. Surprisingly, Floch knew of this already, which also means... Yelena you piece of shit. Yeah, as you can see, the conspiracies here stretched long and far, for the people who have decided to support Eren from under the bushes as of like, last week to be honest. Then, Eren appears in front of Mikasa and Armin with his palm slit, perhaps ready to screw with any Titan form earlier than Armin maybe. Oh and Gabi, let's not forget that. And it's probably why Gabi isn't the one killed, for she has to witness all this. All of how serious this has already become, in the hands of the enemies. Man, all in all, I know I haven't described enough in detail, but man it was quite an episode. I have too much to absorb I don't even know what I can say. It's actually all according to plan. Well, just so far, we don't know who's the bad guy lol. From Zeke to Eren and his small army to the HQ to Levi's squad and everyone in between, it is already a confusing situation even within this island. I guess that's what it means to war. Deception and conspiracies, just like how Yelena and Eren liked it. *evil laughs* Man, I have a feeling this will end quite spectacularly, not because my friend is tipping me off about the ending in the manga which is probably over by now, so I would like to see this end, whichever direction it goes. Will Eren take over the place after getting into Zeke's mind and then betraying the heck of out of him? Will more people inside the island be under the impression that there aren't traitors among them? We haven't even fished out the current military from HQ and in the squads around now, man, you tell me. Okay cya guys next week for more mystery because I can't wrap myself around this to be honest </div><div>[<strike>Yes yes MVP Kaya-san now leave me alone haha</strike> *sees Kaya try to kill Gabi* okay nvm lol]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiM49zXDK6YeJG44MKN_mpnrrTAUJsF1kjqKJKsXU3emTlkW3fvH4FvH1CA3xCjzpc2gTGvhT10gisZz4tcp4zP_Rz53IiFhMTabJ_lNZa0q1kjZdYPUv3vMm7wdiTW8Bc_DFvah0tyW24/s320/attackontitan72_kaya1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This episode is too depressing (surprise surprise) so let's show cute stuff instead<br>(Haha kawaii)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDX4l_kAazJ6x2K1Vl4gYGfvdwEPQCJrTDAqs2szj7TN8XkqBr_Vxph20LzcW1dao95xTQqWawq68ZvJxV4rXoH3WfuVuyL8Y5AH47K3lidwM5snMkTYiS5UNQfQdxixZp4lTczUxVRwI/s320/attackontitan72_gabi.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>This episode is too depressing (surprise surprise) so let's show cute stuff instead<br>(Man, you look kinda cute you if you don't talk, Gabi. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span>)</table></div></div>P.S. "I'm just a captive, right? That makes us even, Eldian" Haha wow Nicolo, it's like you know the context of this world's situation now</div><div>P.P.S. "That is why it's up to us to shoulder the sins of the past" Let that sink into you for a bit.<br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span> <span class=head-title>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>So yeah, not much this week considering I still managed to listen to <b>SCANDAL's new single</b> and yes it'll come with Marinka's single from last week now and I can still do all this in my... half impaired state lol not really I did kind of recover and go to work for a couple of days just to "show face", you know. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> So yeah, didn't do much besides that. I know SCANDAL is preparing for their 15th anniversary, so I'll support them single-track releases as long as I can buy them, just like with Chatmonchy in 2012. <span class=emoji title=😉>*wink*</span> Oh yeah, gotta consolidate the packages... Done haha<br><br>For news considering Twitter and let's see how much of them are music-related lol, <b>Hanazawa Kana is back with a digital single</b> (credited for China collab ugh) and also best thing ever <b>her music library is going to be on subscription services</b> YES haha, it might be over by the time you see this but <b>yanaginagi's birthday live on YouTube</b> is not bad, I'll probably listen to <b>Anime "Horimiya" character songs</b> when I can, TrySail announced quite a bit in their recent live including <b>TrySail's new single in June</b> and <b>Amamiya Sora's new single in May</b> both for Anime, <b>SHE's YouTube video for blackboard</b> which is probably just a channel for music isn't that bad it's the new song, and <b>wacci release two new songs and music videos</b> which I didn't even notice until like, my Google feed told me. It's not exactly awesome so I'll wait for their next major release. I'm like that, by the way, unlike people who jump in to new songs just because they support the artists and of course this is a better way to create engagement as a way for metrics in Capitalism in case you wonder. <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Why do I know so much lol</div><div><br>So for next week, I'll probably be diving into new singer-songwriter <b>Kamiyama You's new single</b> (that is read as "yo") for Anime "Horimiya". Man, the following week is going to be great, Friends' new single and Middle Kids album? I better be well to listen to both of them haha<br><br><br><br><br> Okay I'm done. I'm tired, I sneezed a lot of phlegm in the shower just now which will probably let me survive the night, so let's see if I need to get more MC tomorrow to save this... hopeless body you know how much I want to jerk off already?? <span class=emoji title=😆>*laughs*</span> Okay, me. I have quite a headache now unlike when I was doing reviews for the Anime earlier today so I wonder why. Cya guys next time then, and until then... don't point out my spelling mistakes because I saw them from last week's issue and I see a lot I just don't have the time and/or energy to go through them I need to rest, okay? So, until next time, people. <span class=emoji title=😐>*silence*</span> Well, bye.<br></div></div></div><hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews">The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
