Yeah, I did. Had a real great nap after the cycling trip in the morning. This is how normies live their lives now? Okay, maybe I should start hanging out with friends like my sis does with Zoom now just because, but you know, I rather stay at home and play video games haha ugh I hate myself</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways! It's May now, and how fast time will pass because besides being a month of nothing but holidays (three, actually, including yesterday which technically doesn't count since I didn't work...?), it's also going to be the month of packages in quite a while! So I'll be looking forward to that. Sadly it won't come together because that warehouse can't store stuff for more than a month, so it'll come in two waves, I guess. You know, enjoying this happiness of burning shipping fees before the government comes in to tax my sh*t in a couple of years haha<br><br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id=KoiKimo05><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span class=head-title> Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"It's hard to hold back something you enjoy" Haha Ryou ikr just like my love for this Anime in general tbh but you seeÂ my friends don't give a shit (lol)</div></blockquote>I guess we have all the accomplices ready for this school trip. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Don't worry, Ryou; Masuda and your sister will have you covered to make sure you get the best experience of Ichika-chan without going there haha so stop applying for that business trip you twerp lmao. In this new episode as mentioned above (#KoiKimo05), I am actually relieved we don't have Ryou on our backs this time around lmao. Yeah, Ryou raging in jealousy of his bro being able to join the class in Okinawa is the best haha. Anyways, let's talk about the highlights of the class' trip to Okinawa. Surprisingly, Okinawa is not going to be the focus of this episode haha. No really, stop being a tourist for a moment and look at the spicy drama here lol. So firstly, Masuda's appearance as a photographer in this school trip. I didn't know they hire photographers to take pictures of the class in school trips. Without permission might not be in the requirements of this job scope but still. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> At least you won't have to take shots with your uPhone X or something since we got DSLRs around. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> ("What's the difference" lol) Anyways, we got more for later, but we be talking about Matsushima again this quickly? Hmm, I wonder why... so Ryou sort of found out that his co-worker is into Anime mainly because Ichika liked the same thing which is probably why he knows it now or else he will be his own unknowledgeable self tbh, but suffice it to say he got into a conversation with her and... yeah. Someone got excited. Won't say who but it's not Ryou. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (Now that I had a closer look at Matsushima, there are ZERO similarities between her and the voice behind her <em>especially</em> with that rack haha Kana-chan please don't hit me) Point taken though, whatever Matsushima might be involved in this series in the future. Moving on, the kids were in an aquarium (Hey <a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOBxSGbofL44fOK1GnsQ8QlYGe_qhh-8bzTjekKYjOqq-EQKzr9REDa4F-384cg8ebTh5CURfAkUdc4YEY_Q23G0cyQSpZRgLaBdJ_xZ5XzizLCHTUmqxen2alq3RyTr8cZe4LHV-A5Uo/s320/PXL_20210426_035411836.jpg target=_blank>I was at my local aquarium</a> just earlier this week!) (And sorry for the terrible selfie; I have no one else to test this on lol) Ichika got lost with her friends somehow which is fine until you realize her phone's battery got cut off (buy a new phone, girl, or at least ask Ryou to get you one) (lol), and Tamaru... let's just say if you didn't notice at this point he has very... obvious intentions on Ichika-chan here already at this point, if you haven't noticed by the end of this episode tbh. Too bad Masuda got in the way, and we will soon realize how much of an informant this dude will be to Ryou since he effectively saw EVERYTHING. With his camera of course, so basically paparazzi. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Ryou thought Masuda was joking about being in Okinawa, and got Ichika's confirmation via their usual phone call. (Rio be like "oh God it's not that nightly call again" lol) AndÂ instead of telling Ryou that having Masuda and Rio around without him is GREAT (haha), Ichika told him the opposite. Oh well, we in this deep already huh. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Yeah, that elbow drop of Tamaru against the wall eavesdropping was meant for Ryou. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Next up, we got some free time before the school trip's over. And what better to spend it on than... hang out with Tamaru? Eh? Ichika-chan, you okay? Ah, "Anime scene pilgrimage", huh. What a nice cover, Tamaru-kun. Masuda's going to find out about that too, bro. You egging him now? Haha goddamn this is something. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> (Tamaru even thought Masuda was some jerk trying to touch up on Ichika-) As we have seen so far, we know that Ichika is just nice in general to everyone around her including jerks who come for her even though they are a decade older (lmao), so when it comes to a point where she has to make a decision... it might be rough for her especially considering what we have so far, and I tell you, this is going to be as exciting as it gets.Â <a href=https://jisho.org/search/seishun target=_blank>Youth</a>, they call it. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Haha Ryou we can hang out we can't hang around too much with the kids lol. I wonder what is worse though comparing to current trends: Falling in love with Ryou or falling in love with their teacher in high school... wait, what's the difference? *got woke* Haha we might see this happen earlier than we think considering everyone around in this series tbh. Last but not least, because Ichika had to give her souvenir to Ryou instead of passing it through the sister like how anyone else would, she got rewarded with a movie. And mostly because that someone missed the girl, it's also because Ryou heard of a lot of things from his buddy that this is confrontation time baby!! MASUDA YOU F**KING RAT!! <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Hey, what did I tell you on this intro. For a change, they watched a movie which Ryou would enjoy... but I don't think that might be a good idea after all. Yeah, just watch like, Toy Story or something so no romance will be involved. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> Yeah Ichika, you may be feeling fine but Ryou... <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> All in all, fantastic episode in terms of plot advancement, plenty to absorb though I must say and as you can see from this review, but man things are going FAST haha. Even Ichika's worried about her appearance effectively dating a dude 10 years older than her- Wait, WE DATING NOW?? WHAT ABOUT TAMARU??? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> More spiciness coming up I guess. But as I said, Ichika is not going to go anywhere but <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojak target=_blank>Rojak</a> if she keeps being nice to every guy around her life. Including me, if I was in her life lol okay bye</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsCsfQYppRh2a7ZKdoUQ4e4SIaaGtGqnw4Ep4Hguy6rAGa76AqFiSwguxXxVX9DegYd6kACTS8nPC4QCncMz7zaGeiD7ZOMtFJDl2Xa4CeV89914NSWaBjxlpFdgMKKwJG46HfLzc2Y8s/s320/koikimo05_masuda2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>They say birds of the same feather flock together so<br>(Yeah what a freakin' light bulb)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq_n8EgrFdvQNiX4hmqvezpJs6fimq5fWbjDM-ssDN9J7d3IfXizpHWG4gCSQW8992Ko7tq_5d44AOW_j8d-nnQDBNMbZJd-lAyS2UudgmpWvMzzgn42FKqq_k6mdV_egv4hliSuktusY/s320/koikimo05_couple2.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>They say birds of the same father flock together so<br>(Like dude, you be glad Ichika didn't slap you with her other hand)</table></div></div>P.S.

Soshite Joshikousei wo Hirou.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>"Please let me work (a job)" I mean, Sayu-chan, go ahead. Who's stopping you? "Sure" Haha see?<span style=text-align:left>Â </span></div></blockquote>Besides, Sayu-chan, you don't have to do chores 24/7. There's something called "work shifts", remember? You can work an afternoon shift instead of being bored and mas*****ting at home. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Okay, maybe she did miss that "job" lol.Â  In this new episode (#HigeHiro04) where we finally got over the awkwardness of Yoshida not f**king this high schooler lol, you think she'll make friends with her Hokkaido classmates when they have a school trip to Tokyo? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Hey, tell me this can only happen in this Anime, please. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, we got a new girl to introduce since Sayu-chan immediately got her job at the convenience store as if they were desperately hiring people lol. (Must be the blow-) We got a new girl in town, mainly because Sayu-chan doesn't want to rot at home every day which isn't a bad idea until you realize you have to stand up for yourself at some point. No really, stop leeching on poor Yoshida he still has Gotou and Mishima to feed. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Anyways, this Asami... she may be high schooler but she looks like 27. Yoshida, you keen on this one? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Also, dear <a href=https://jisho.org/search/gyaru target=_blank>gal</a>, if the guy wasn't a decent person she wouldn't even have a chance at working part-time because she's so busy doing part-time sucking- ANWYAYS haha, story. Story goes Asami is real good at reading people but also because Yoshida is a bad liar, but then again who wouldn't be worried if you hear that your female co-worker is living with some dude who before this series started was just an acquaintance on the streets? So yeah, she did her field research including talking to the liars, tasting the great cooking lol, but yeah, she gotta dish Yoshida out personally so she can ask for the truth. Thankfully, Yoshida decided to keep matters on their side and let Sayu-chan do the talking instead of just giving the answers outright like this, which is a wise choice to be honest. And since Asami has heard enough, she left for home herself. Also, so Yoshida doesn't know where she stays lol (<b>This</b> is the real prostitute lmao ah hey) She also warns Yoshida of her many smiles of which most of them are fake but we got that covered in the past couple of episodes so we good, dear gal. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> It just keeps happening though, as we move on from another person who wants to dig into Sayu-chan's past. Remember that dude Hashimoto which is effectively Yoshida's buddy at work who knows EVERYTHING? Yeah, we already know he is the author in disguise lol. Mishima knows about the whole situation so basically this trio is a gang now, Gotou feels like she's missing out on this scoop, so just like a nice superior and boss she treats Yoshida out for dinner and make him ditch Sayu alone at home. Aw and Mishima still walked in with two cups of drinks...!!! OOF. BIG OOF. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Man, am I liking this whatever harem thing here lol. We then found out that Sayu-chan isn't the only big liar here because despite all the confession and rejection Yoshida got from this beautiful woman, she now turns the story back at the guy who she rejected and said the thing. Yep. THE BUDDY WAS RIGHT haha like no shit, dude. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> IT'S THE RESURGENCE lol hey I like how the author is right about himself. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> Anyways, it's not that, because Gotou didn't have a boyfriend to begin with, the rejection was technically a farce so she can have some time to think about it, and with Sayu's help effectively this brewing is going real well haha. Well I think we know Gotou is not being honest enough at this point, really. (<a href=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/la-noire-doubt-press-x-to-doubt target=_blank>Press X to doubt!</a> Press X to doubt!!) So instead of letting him do the honours again, he is going to let Gotou do the confession, whenever she is ready. I mean, it's mutual, we know he can wait to lay his hands on that rack (lol), so yeah, why not wait longer? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> (Now it's F cup you can touch versus I cup you can touch lmao) I mean, Yoshida's life just got better all because of that one girl. Just like Asami said "you can choose who to hang out with, but you can't choose who you meet". I know right, where's the STD-ridden high schooler on the streets in which I can pick her up lmao. Last but not least, we have some flashbacks. Don't be too happy though; Those were Sayu's flashbacks. Uh oh. Yep, she got those anxiety streaks. Don't worry, been there done that. But serious talk though, Sayu-chan? Find happiness somewhere else, maybe with Asami or whatever. Yoshida is going to get you nowhere. I know I say that for a fact, but she still won't care and like Mishima and now Gotou, they are ALL going to go for this one dude who is technically a criminal now, by the way. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> And surprisingly, Yoshida is taking Gotou to his place ie. this place lol to see Sayu-chan?? So next episode, I guess we are cleaning up the mess that is Sayu-chan now. Ah hey, you see, that's how Gotou can actually go out with Yoshida haha she was in the way lol. Hey, reality check incoming, I guess. Which probably also means we will know more about Sayu's past soon enough. Trust me, you don't want to know. But hey, we have come this far, and this series is actually real good up till now, so you know, I'll suffer a little bit of dark past if that is fine with me, me. Haha cya guys next week for more- Why am I watching nothing but harem this season? lol</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNVXDRijEPg7loiOSnClbULc5R_QqkgAPEZkVNpcksP9zQoHPUEIrn8RpUdE41x_nqI8HUK6Y4rSC422CuqbG-FpYeBvYysmsDAwD-bEuQWfU7fBSEcIDKmPiSKEgplrMq10EamvZff0U/s320/higehiro04_mishima1.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>The women in this series are very, very aggressive I must say<br>(*thumbs up*)</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxhmOqVQlWyTyhyphenhyphenSk726LpZQrJqtHSs-kC8i-f9Q6p8Ey551wAsrKaZ-xIW8cBMt-_eMn3tA-oBQQtWiZTNeDdXbWlloBML-WfmGc2Zfy78-jW6W4FFYvuqqdnqxYGiow7asx1Bv870BM/s320/higehiro04_yoshida5.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>MFW someone says she wants to have s*x with me lol <br>(Also MFW some woman says she's a virgin)</table></div></div>P.S. *holds Yoshida* "Why didn't you tell me about all this?"

Anyways, story. It's the day of the school festival in case you forgot which is the parent of which FYI the Confession thing is just part of the actual festival. The class did do some cafe thing too just so we can relate maybe, and don't ask me where Shirokusa is in this because she's already losing without showing up dressing cute like Kuroha so I don't know why she gotta ask the dude up to the stairs to the rooftops to reveal her past to him like we don't know about it. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> I swear Sueharu is like "Wow you and Kachi-san's past sounded real similar up till now- Wait." lol haha ikr how long did it take you to notice that, bro? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So yeah, blah blah blah you thought this was drama but it's not and it's all new to the main guy somehow, but yeah, Kuroha was listening downstairs. I mean, on the stairway? I probably can hear that from the first floor lol schools in Japan aren't exactly tall it's only like 4 floors max like any other school haha. (You think Shiro will think this through but nope) The two childhood friends tease each other like <a href=https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san target=_blank>Takagi and Nishikata</a> lol (Like seriously, where's the part where these two <em>accidentally</em> have s*x? <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> Ah, that'sÂ <a href=https://jisho.org/search/R18 target=_blank>R18</a>? Okay, leave that aside for now haha), they then went on a stroll around the school, and then she slapped him. You know, so we can do the "I've done my job" thing and leave him to decide who he actually wants to confess to in this Festival, to be honest. Remember, this thing is all about revenge; It's revenge against Shirokusa trying to go out with the senpai and rejecting Sueheru in the first place. Think about it for a while, and read on. So, the actual farce. I call it a farce for good reason, and I appreciate you stay along with me till the end to find out why. It starts with the most popular <a href=https://jisho.org/search/senpai target=_blank>senpai</a> on stage, singing and dancing to his beloved Shirokusa (What song is this, 2005?) (Haha this is going into the soundtrack, this original song...?) until Sueharu slid in smoother than Michael Jackson lol. One should have noticed by now on where's the rivalry part of this revenge, so to say. So surprise surprise, Sueharu's the one doing the confession(?), he started with Shirokusa but THEN talked about his real childhood friend and mother (lol) Kuroha which probably blew her mind considering she ditched him like a moment ago, and... she said no. Yeah, they are all losers now lmao. Think about it: It was for the revenge, so confessing to Shirokusa wouldn't even be an option in the first place. Why get back on your first love by confessing TO your first love? Then, I guess the flashback did a good job, but Sueharu has Kuroha with him all this time. From when she consoled him because he got duked on by this liar of a Shirokusa who can't get over her pride to be honest, to when they had to fake as a couple lol, and basically so far into his life. Why not confess to Kuroha instead? Is probably what the guy is thinking, but he'll be totally wrong. Since for reals, Kuroha is never going to accept him just because they are childhood friends for so long, and support is never better represented unless you <b>don't</b> become lovers. Especially when she said no. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So basically, if you don't get my warped explanation, and as mentioned by Tetsuhiko and Abe-senpai, the two girls are both losers. No one won, especially with Sueharu going in the wrong direction. It's quoted as revenge right from the start though, it's understandable, but nonetheless... you get the idea by now. Also, this is a romcom, so I hope you expected an ending somewhere along these lines lol. And if you noticed gaps in the story like I did, don't forget my review of Episode 1 and like everyone else in the story right now, let's move on. And that is the end of this arc. And the rest of the series won't matter anymore now that we know blatantly this is a love comedy series and there will be no conclusion lol. But hey, we aren't nearly done yet. NEXT EPISODE NEW GIRL INCOMING!! Haha I'm ready cute af Oonishi Saori BRING IT ON hehe</div><div>[TL:DR; I saw this on YouTube comments since last week but I think it's better to spoil everyone at this point: "The moment when you realize they are all childhood friends" So yeah jokes on them the title will always be true]</div><div><div class=thumbnail><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqRavDdGas0ly9lfSLR0mzwLe4ihS3x72RTwGW7PaDL9d2t6DFwk8JOBSQp1s0cc-G1ThgpghakVUpFilNGVbBdz5dEsSWxTE3h0eOt6qhe9m6kDSXZGJ5fCTdjzz7PDMi3Egi0_axmLg/s320/osamake03_cry.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Me when my mom refuses to buy me the new set of Jackie Chan Adventures cards lmao</table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=720 data-original-width=1280 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2DsVFs-WzYKUXndyqVt0N1YSzPVhuv2sNGQYNRjCh5s3DInpQBKawOsedOuJ5aV-t2mEykQqdjm0Ubic5NuljxiGkHHUeGZ_ORNT4f9Py3Y76UuauwhBCOrmkOT8pwINdr2MIrho90H0/s320/osamake03_girls.jpg width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Shoutout to that girl on the left getting pushed because everyone else was crazy for Abe-senpai lol</table></div></div>P.S.

WOW!! Haha if you get this reference you have enjoyed this week's new releases lol maybe just the one but it's not just that this week, I promise you. Of course, I'm referring toÂ <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tv%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1-%E5%B9%BC%E3%81%AA%E3%81%98%E3%81%BF%E3%81%8C%E7%B5%B6%E5%AF%BE%E3%81%AB%E8%B2%A0%E3%81%91%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E3%83%A9%E3%83%96%E3%82%B3%E3%83%A1-%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E-chance-revenge-ep/1561702739?l=en" target=_blank>Azuna Riko's new single</a></b>Â which surprisingly isn't the best thing out there right now but as I think I mentioned before how good this song was for an Anime opening theme song but man it's in my brain every day this week lol. Interestingly, that <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tv%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1-%E5%B9%BC%E3%81%AA%E3%81%98%E3%81%BF%E3%81%8C%E7%B5%B6%E5%AF%BE%E3%81%AB%E8%B2%A0%E3%81%91%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E3%83%A9%E3%83%96%E3%82%B3%E3%83%A1-%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E-%E6%88%A6%E7%95%A5%E7%9A%84%E3%81%A7%E4%BA%88%E6%B8%AC%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E3%81%AA%E3%83%A9%E3%83%96%E3%82%B3%E3%83%A1%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E6%9B%B2/1561703970?l=en" target=_blank>Anime "OsaMake" ending theme song single</a></b> is the fastest Anime release I've seen appear on Apple Music (because normally they need to make money first so <em>maaaybe</em> it'll appear after 5 years) and the fastest release I've given for Anime in years but that also goes to show how much I've ignored those songs unless they are theme songs lol but nonetheless. It's bliss when it's Sakura Ayane and Minase Inori in both of your ears seducing you in the B-side; It's quite an experience. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span> (Someone please send help haha also sexy Inorin fanclub content please lol) ("Only" sexy Inorin, sorry) (Haha) (Audience: So what type of content will it be...?) (I don't know come up with something so I can continue my yearly subscription haha I don't care if it's her half naked-) I also gave <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/terminal/1559690822?l=en" target=_blank>YUKI's new album</a></b> a listen which probably compensated for the one time I heard her new single from a month ago because I gave it anyways, the topic song, one of them. After that, it's free real estate man, so this will be continued until next week along with <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%80%E3%81%92%E3%82%93%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%8D%E4%B8%8B%E3%82%8D%E3%81%97%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B8%E3%83%8A%E3%83%ABver/1485199832?l=en" target=_blank>Tsuzuri Zukuri's latest album</a></b> from 2019 which both I didn't give due attention in reviewing them because work (lol) but yeah, gotta say I did miss giving both of them artists new songs. And so I shall.</div><div><br>On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and yes we are including anything from Anime, Anime "OsaMake" was impressive this week so <a href="https://twitter.com/osamake_project/status/1387614425801117696?s=20" target=_blank>here's a <b>cover of a song by an Anime character of an artist that doesn't exist</b></a>Â because they just got like 9mm Parabellum Bullet and ZiNG amongst many other composers and producers to make this super punk rock of a song I can't even, I didn't listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1388801593928126465?s=20" target=_blank><b>cinema staff's livestream</b></a> in full because dinner but I watched it again and I didn't miss much lol, I didn't listen live for <a href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1388659182925090816?s=20" target=_blank><b>GLIM SPANKY's new video</b></a> on YouTube but I did listen to it anyways it was good just not enough kick on that "Tokyo wa Moeteru" song because acoustic, if <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1388547227027578880?s=20" target=_blank><b>Amamiya Sora's new song preview</b></a> which is B-side for her upcoming single which she wrote the lyrics for entice please go pre-order now (lol not me), <a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1388463239801888782?s=20" target=_blank><b>SPECIAL OTHERS ACOUSTIC's new song/melody</b></a> is a meh, there was supposed to be <b>a <a href="https://twitter.com/TNK_of_MCNK/status/1387965712505868288?s=20" target=_blank>replacement livestream</a> for a cancelled rock festival</b> but too bad I didn't catch up quick enough so it's privated on YouTube now RIP, I forgot about these guys and only until I watched a recent live video so we will review <a href="https://twitter.com/POLKA_fukuoka/status/1385912977275035654?s=20" target=_blank><b>Polkadot Stingray's new EP</b> </a>in a couple of weeks, I've listened to a couple of her songs so congrats on <a href="https://twitter.com/miyustaff/status/1388063074368819203?s=20" target=_blank><b>Tomiya Miyu getting her 1st album</b></a> due in June, don't ask me how <a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1387980222297829378?s=20" target=_blank><b>Aimer's new album is now in music subscription services worldwide</b></a> maybe the licensing stuff got through lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1387383919792713729?s=20" target=_blank>SCANDAL's 2nd single</a> for their 15th anniversary</b> is releasing next month, and the others I don't care to talk about lol there's so many I mentioned above man just go read my likes page to know all of them haha<br><br> So as mentioned earlier, there won't be any new songs to listen for next week, so I'm continuing on <b>YUKI's new album</b> and <b>Tsuzuri Zukuri's latest album</b>. To add on, I went for a search on what anewhite was doing and saw them already being way more successful than when I saw them on a rock festival from last year so I'll be listening to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E3%82%92%E6%8A%9C%E3%81%91%E3%81%A6/1562255994?l=en" target=_blank>anewhite's 2nd EP</a></b> which was actually released within the week. Never too late, I guess; It's technically still a new release. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ¤­>*giggles*</span><br><br><br><br><br> I've been thinking about this for a while though well about a month already to be honest, I should review another photobook just like how I did buying one from a local bookstore from two years ago. Well, the birthday and friend thing we can skip here (We're still BFFs though I just didn't ask him out to exchange photobooks lmao because pandemic and he wasn't keen anymore I suggested Miku's new photobook because he likes the girl), but I think I can review a photobook from last year. You know, Hanazawa Kana before she was married maybe? So yeah. Problem is, this isn't readily available on the store because I guess she was popular? (Sorry Marinka) So if I do so it'll have to arrive as import for a couple of weeks I imagine. I'll have a lot of holidays on leave from work this month coming so hopefully I'll have the time to take a look IF I do click on the order button though. I want to continue the trend from 2 years ago. I want to make the magic happen. If someone announced a photobook right now I would've lined this all up, but no. No cigar. So yeah. That's why I'm stuck between the two worlds of whatever awesome blog post and my wallet to be spent on Japan once again. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span> So you see, it wasn't going to be an easy decision haha. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I just hope my sis will take some work leave along the days I did so we can play some Overcooked 2 which she got into during our time at my cousin's place during Chinese New Year. Yes, him playing with his wife. I'm still single FYI haha sadge<br></div><div><br></div><div>P.S. I thought of Sano Hinako's new photobook from this year and even Komatsu Mikako's from like 2018 but Kana-chan will do for now so you're welcome Kinokuniya Singapore please give me a First Press Limited Edition one somehow just like Marinka's photobook thanks (lol) There is a chance we might not get it though if stock changes at Japan's side so fingers crossed people</div><div><br></div><div>P.P.S.</div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpoc9_0ebJz2ienYy3LvlD9l81-3Jh1KeZ2HV1QRRTfiTTI6MGxdvbiOgYS64kmEx16UXVegZH7O47D5QdORNyrYkcCNBiH9A6HgvIU1E-4U_f5Prbi6tpHtrdIBiyfIO8UKtaJPNqnYk/s1398/InkedScreenshot+2021-05-02+215735_LI.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 data-original-height=884 data-original-width=1398 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpoc9_0ebJz2ienYy3LvlD9l81-3Jh1KeZ2HV1QRRTfiTTI6MGxdvbiOgYS64kmEx16UXVegZH7O47D5QdORNyrYkcCNBiH9A6HgvIU1E-4U_f5Prbi6tpHtrdIBiyfIO8UKtaJPNqnYk/s320/InkedScreenshot+2021-05-02+215735_LI.jpg width=320></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Remember when I said SGD80 was the average to ship these from Japan?
