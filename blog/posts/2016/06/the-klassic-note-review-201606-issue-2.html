Hey, everyone. I don't know I should mention this again but, after seven years down listening to this single I have given it. And yes, it's no coincidence. Allow me to take you back on a journey where Tsuji Shion was young, awesome and looks very differently cute from what she is now. No really, look at the covers.<br><br><br><br><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=TsujiShionMelody><div style=text-align:center> <span class=head-prefix><b>音楽</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Tsuji Shion - M/elody [Single]</div></blockquote><div style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy height=317 src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513pJs5tgkL.jpg style=-webkit-user-select:none width=320></div>(And you think she wouldn't have the capacity to hold that loudspeaker? You would be wrong. And really, her side view doesn't look like her at all.)<br><br>Origin: Wow where should I start this... how about last year? Talking about last year, she did release two singles - both are all in my list, both digital releases (which explains why they aren't reviewed here) - and she still didn't lose her style after her major debut album back then in 2010. This singer-songwriter started with startling BLEACH Anime fans (like me) with a great ending theme song, and this was the next thing. And yes, I liked it back then, but was different compared to now. And it shall be easily represented by the songs below.<br><br>(1) M/elody<br>Obviously pronounced as "melody", this is that subtle love song she likes to write and sing as seen in many other releases of hers (eg. all of her singles), and she does it pretty well. Not that she is pretty in the music video or whatsoever, but the song itself if also nice. There maybe the little things that don't matter back then seven years ago, but I was in love with this song. And her of course, but this song... It's my little fetish for a song written by the girl next door. It's perfect.<br>Rating (in 2009): 5 stars (Unbelievably Awesome)<br><br>(2) Naminori<br>Now let's talk about today, seven years later. If you wondered how it started, you clearly didn't watch her latest YouTube video, you frog-in-the-well.<br><div style=text-align:center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0 height=189 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oX8kPlh4eWc width=336></iframe><br></div>And then I asked myself "Why haven't I given this song till now??" and yes, not long after, I ended up loving her again. Hey, I mean, the song. Anyways, this song is in its simplicity a wonderful song, and probably if I know of a reason I didn't give this back then it's probably it sounds too similar in melody, and that in Klassic Note is kind of a turn-off. Not today. Not when you don't recall that this song was actually good to be given the thumbs up.<br>Rating: 4 stars (Missed Out Average)<br><br>Conclusion: Anyways, that's a good journey back to the past, and now it deserves its position in Klassic Note. If you like everything simple in music, this is a decently-produced package to start with. And yes, unless you like techno music 24-7, then please help yourself with a subtle love and a life song. Make your summer (even though different year) great with some Tsuji Shion today.<br><br>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br><br>P.S. Thanks Tsuji Shion-san, you will always be loved. Your music, especially, will be remembered here for all time. But I want to give you more. So please continue to do music. Someday... I'll go to your live performance. Someday.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en> Ah, maybe not.<br><br>(Next year perhaps?

Probably the same as if I bought the single 7 years ago, probably with more hype and enthusiasm in writing the review, if I ever thought of doing any of them.<br><br>Well, first things first; I can't really get a fresh copy of this CD. I mean, it's been seven years. So with also the recent journey to buying some stuff that I shouldn't have from Yahoo! Auctions (no, I shouldn't; see bottom of post for details), I decided for once to see if not getting a fresh copy will make a difference or not. And unexpectedly, it doesn't. For one, the only thing that is missing from this because it's not "New" is the plastic wrapping for the case, which is perfectly fine. Hey, talk about Japanese TLC of packages, man. Now to get some plastic wrapping to protect this treasure haha. Also, they made a big mistake by filling the blanks with large fonts of the official website. <a href=http://tsujishion.net/ target=_blank>Little do they know...</a><br><br>I'm a satisfied customer with his package, and that's all it matters. Unfortunately, it may take a lot more despite this being the cheapest price I've paid for the item itself. (You know, shipping problems.)<br><br><br>That is it for today's review. For more of these accidental release-to-review gaps giveaways due to me having to compensate for the times I didn't give these singles, stay tuned. Tomacchan's recollection journey is up next, thanks to her best albums. But later today, I'm going to be talking about why this single has been sitting with 9 other packages of nothing but photos and a clear file and took like, 3 weeks to come. Cya guys later.<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a href="../../../index.html#TheKlassicNote">The Klassic Note</a><a href="../../../index.html#TheReview">The Review</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
