Every week I have to deal with life, and entertainment. And then I found out that entertainment is something I forgot to enjoy when I leave it alone long enough. Well, that's good for impressions, really.<br><br>Other than that, my life is all over the place. Mostly anxiety, though. I can't get enough of those apparently. Okay, let's move on. Entertainment is supposed to be happy.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:text-bottom"><b>アニメ</b></span><span class=head-title><br>ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Kono Bitsujubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>Wait, is this filler content? Well, good thing I just have to wait until they reveal it on <a href=https://twitter.com/konobi_anime target=_blank>their official Twitter</a> on the Anime and Manga content! (Visit it for details and more images! xD) This episode (11) talks about the all important school festival, and since Koyama-sensei the previous advisor didn't give a sh*t about it before, Yumeko-sensei is here to take charge, and it all starts with a humble tin can. I sure haven't seen <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=tin+can+art&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEl-HHq5bPAhXDpI8KHSJbCoAQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979#imgrc=N0Juzs9LtnchsM%3A" target=_blank>tin can art</a> before, so this sure is something to learn from, actually. With her enthusiasm comes the cooperative effort of the club (including that half-asleep Club President) and quite a few mishaps (Imari-san you could've explained it in terms a teacher can understand you-) but then again we got to see some cosplay displaying chest sizes Usami-san wished she had. (I thank Yumeko-sensei for not talking about the room in that tight outfit lol) All in all, it was a good experience, and they managed to get that structure out of the club room lol. Oh wait, did I spoil it? Well, at least I didn't say it was a tin can art sculpture of a-<br>P.S. Wait, what? Next episode lol<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqEGSIZIHmSlLKUKWKtGcM6gp_MHHhLaOWJqHKgUFypLvPWIvnVHChbjd6uu5dLJVOkLQbRxSAn1G1fWXm17zmAop-taoO9wjAw1B0C19BlwP2St6fix7BOQwkO5AbnRe3-tZU1UA7Tq5b/s320/konobi11_cans.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Ah Colette-chan, sticking in again with the straight jokes.<br>Good thing people around her are understanding. Most of them anyway.</table><b>Time Travel Shoujo: </b>EPIC CLIMAX! Well, next episode, probably. On the other hand, we got good story this episode (11) leading up to it. Hey, I must say I'm not disappointed despite the less than satisfactory graphics, and I'm rather excited of what's happening. We witness the ideas of Edison come to life, and Hayase obviously knowing of Mikage's appearance in the past now we got him into the equation. Then again weirder stuff is happening that probably cannot be explained by science (that is good time to stop promoting this as an educational show then), and we're about to find out pretty soon. Then again, this could go many ways, the machine is going haywire (hey no one said it wasn't experimental when Hayase stole it), and somehow everything is going to hell from here. That is what I think though. You can think of anything, just like Edison. But for me, I'd like to think the ending of this series is some good fighting (as good as the animation team can make it) and probably we're going to lose everything, the lab and technology and all. What really happens next? We shall see it for ourselves, I guess.<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy border=0 height=180 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipiUw2NRccfVEh0daR5aBqcDbmpIPjmuQ9xhqtqhNMBzBORpNDiEC8lFxiJLZGxWcYlk8QYz30VwsrGunhjCVZ6OheIrceM3vCTNh7t9unlSDqmT9puyWaUnpqAt0qAU8xQq3TrmAykQ9D/s320/timetravelshoujo11_mad.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=320><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Yeah someone is already getting mad this episode. And thanks to him all this happened.<br>Thanks, Dr. Hayase lol</table>Still not spoiling myself of next season Anime just yet. Maybe I'll talk about it next week.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center;vertical-align:text-bottom"><b>漫画</b></span><span class=head-title><br>MANGA</span></div></blockquote>None, apparently. Or that Bungou Stray Dogs and Konobi (that art club) haven't finished airing the Anime so I can read the Manga... Oh well, guess I'll just have to wait.<br><br><br><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center><span style="background:#09a5b8;border-radius:5px;padding:3px 5px;text-align:center"><b>音楽</b></span> <span class=head-title><br>This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Nothing in particular came out this week, so... you know. I turned to liver performances of rock festivals. The people there are just... enthusiastic, and aplenty. Hey, I'd like to be in one though, despite my heavily biased tastes haha. Then again, punk rock seems to ring within me now, so <b>SWANKY DANK</b> will get a song from me... provided I can get their new mini-album somehow. We'll see. Talking about getting stuff, I have yet to review <b>Erabareshi's new single</b> which is the ending of Anime Time Travel Shoujo, but then again I don't think I want to listen to it after all. A character album or two is in place for Anime Konobi (that art club above), next week brings <b>Aimer's new album</b> (time travel shoujo ending) and <b>Mikakoshi's new single</b> which I may just reject (sorry it wasn't your fault, girl), and I may just go back to listen to another song from <b>Iwasaki Ai</b> again because of that live video. Then again maybe I should just reject it to make her impression for the year awesome. She's already in the Top 20, I would say.<br><br>Note to self: Review wacci's new album. Been rotting in your computer for days now. (Tehe~)<br><br><br>This is it then. Real short, because it will get shorter next week likely if no new manga chapters come along. Then again, I'm in increasingly less of a mood to do this recently, and it's definitely because of my own everyday life (which segment I have not been updating anyways) (I'll think of something lol) and not these stuff above. Anyways, cya guys again then, and until next time... don't think of committing suicide. There's so much to NOT live for.<br><br>Okay, I better stop myself before this turns into those "The Statement" posts. Really, go check those out too haha<br><br>[P.S. Miyawaki Shion-san you sounded great in that live just now (I only managed to hear the last song she sang though), and even it's practically karaoke (ie. no live band) you still were great.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang=en><div dir=ltr lang=en>Ok if you want that Anime ending song Miyawaki Shion sang, you can hear is live now.<br><br>Don't say I didn't remind you. <a href=https://t.co/7Qhp4Arng3 target=_blank>https://t.co/7Qhp4Arng3</a></div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href=https://twitter.com/aozakish/status/777452469261508610 target=_blank>September 18, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset=utf-8 src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><br>Yeah, it's too late now, a**holes.]<hr><div class="post-tags"><h4>Reported in </h4><a class="box" href="../../../index.html#TheEntertainmentNews"><span class="material-icons small-icons">newspaper</span>The Entertainment News</a></div><h6 style="text-align: center;">All text content © 2014-2024 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
