Another year. Another birthday. And yet another birthday surprise! I'm glad I'm alive. This year, it's all thanks to Tomacchan and her new single, which really threw my expectations off my windows so much I must give her the thumbs up for this one. Let's start without further ado, yes?<br><div><br></div><blockquote class="tr_bq music" id=HarukaCinderellaSymphony><div style=text-align:center><span class=head-prefix><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span><span class=head-title> The Klassic Note Review</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class=tr_bq><div style=text-align:center>Tomatsu Haruka - Cinderella Symphony [Single]</div></blockquote><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=595 data-original-width=600 src=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/adm_image/common/artist_image/70005000/70005303/jacket_image/152811__800_800_0.jpg width=320 height=317><td style=text-align:center><img loading=lazy alt="" border=0 data-original-height=534 data-original-width=600 src=https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/adm_image/common/artist_image/70005000/70005303/jacket_image/152812__800_800_0.jpg width=320 height=284><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Limited Edition<td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Regular Edition</table><div>(Close-ups are better. Screw the Limited Edition cover. Seriously. I demand it.)</div><div>Origin: If you have been reading reviews around here, we cannot be more familiar with Tomatsu "Tomacchan" Haruka, especially from last year I've been giving her new singles, trying to accept more of her music releases, contrary to my behaviour of her music career in the past few years. But anyway, she is doing a better job singing and being given better songs, which is not a bad thing. This is why we are here to review her latest, which may not seen to have much meaning in the title, but much within itself.</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Cinderellaâ˜†Symphony</div><div>I know. This has a lot of idolism written over it. And I guess it is. But then again it's also rather lovely in that sense. Just in time for Valentine's Day this year, this song is... a song for girls. To guys. And that really sounds pretty good. Reading through the lyrics I can feel the mood of this lively yet subtly romantic tune, and if you feel like it's Christmas you're not alone. Moving on to the music video, then that one we can just assume it's totally up to ourselves to judge, but as a fan of close-up shots then she won me with this one. This song may not turn out with much impact at first, but overall it sounds like you're in love. With her.</div><div>Rating: 4 stars (Close to better, but Average)</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Tsuukai! Romantica [Thrilling Romantic]</div><div>(I searched for a urban translation for "Romantica" and <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=romantica&amp;defid=1118865" target=_blank>you don't want to know about it.</a> Trust me. We can just assume that word is in Spanish.)</div><div>This one. This is that deal breaker. As always with many B-sides, this one turns me off the other direction the first time I listen to the preview as just a wild song which will sound potentially long in song length. Guess what? It's only three minutes long (probably the shortest I've heard from her song list since... I don't know), and it sounds better than many other wild rock songs out there. With the singer taking the lead in the song itself, there sure is motivation to give this song right off the bat. Well, I waited for the release date in order to give this, so that may still differ from person to person. Personally, this one is quite a surprise, and if it could be better they can afford to make this song last a little longer. Maybe it wasn't worth the risk. But still worth making Tomacchan sing to this tune.</div><div>Rating: 4 stars (Just short of being above Average)</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: This single? If you heard her last, this one is much better compared to that. If you haven't heard her before, this one will give you a reason to like her singing. Because of her generic style in music unlike others under her music label, her once-in-a-blue-moon (blue for this single too) awesomeness is always appreciated, particularly this one. Take a listen and it won't disappoint. Because she is good at singing, it doesn't hurt to give her a couple more songs from time to time. This one? I'm not disappointed at all.</div><div><br></div><div>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div>YES I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE.<br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=240 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBxYCAS0WP8N2rHc5qGltAIfkrvmLMsRMUZ4qrtftUyTNzjWe1NF6i1teh9_tczMLnWIj4mUgh_tZejcDpTPpF6U2HZxsgpYrYGLg3o7kQ1hroLnMs42PjG07Je8_2uiHahN2ALayfeeVC/s320/IMG_20160227_152151.jpg width=320></div>I mean, it's a late birthday, but whatever. This one is definitely my ideal birthday present. Or even better, her in person, wrapped in a ribbon (if you didn't notice she was trying to hang herself), and sent my way. Still, I've been thinking hard if in the case I have to give her the single what choices I have for the special gift. It's either between a thin, blue dress and ponytails. And yes I decided, and it belongs to <a href=https://ec.toranoana.jp/tora_r/ec/ target=_blank>Toranoana</a>. As expected, I need to see Tomacchan more in tied hair. YES!<br><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center> <img loading=lazy border=0 height=150 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0zHrOFTxUxrTJaVJhrQXVwRay-4YeKfn_YJyfiJeG9kD5D3GyvUS_1r-RhMuJCmOG35gi26f2K9QxrKMi2uyoxtUXwpariDccxzKRNaDBUPJ3Rh3uML8zyebqMxQkE3nsLCzl1D3X1E5b/s200/IMG_20160227_151922.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto width=200><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center>Lol she is covering her own cover</table>The inside booklet also looks great, but mostly because I really want her to be sent my way (lol), and then it's just me fantasising all along whilst I admire at the package already, so... yeah. Idolism. If you don't know what that means to be, this is mine. <span class=emoji title=ðŸ˜†>*laughs*</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This is it then. I swear I don't have anything after this paragraph (lol) And yes, this comes a long way to some of the few releases I'm glad I had raised my hands to get it. And in case the hints on the Twitter account aren't more obvious enough, I'm going through two more single reviews next week too, namely Sayuri and nano.RIPE which I probably have much more of an opinion than this good release, so stay tuned until then I guess. Until next time! *staring at special gift*</div><div><br></div><div>[P.S.: I don't want to spam too much on this post like Entertainment News, but here are the highlights of the music video:</div><div><br></div><table align=center cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0FfHzu5nlVjfY4aYmt1h8aYCeCs9xDPC7dway26AA1K2-BrjgthCNk29LCy6O1OVe-2tVw2KbQQvnh35B5Dd6QgQDCFxitFqppq-EWFL2O9rFuQgp96Zd6FWlqj3IqFjI9ouLZSHb8C5P/s1600/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony01.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 height=112 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0FfHzu5nlVjfY4aYmt1h8aYCeCs9xDPC7dway26AA1K2-BrjgthCNk29LCy6O1OVe-2tVw2KbQQvnh35B5Dd6QgQDCFxitFqppq-EWFL2O9rFuQgp96Zd6FWlqj3IqFjI9ouLZSHb8C5P/s200/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony01.jpg></a><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwwgUXm9ab9FMFQ32MdF_Nv6MdkW1Cr-grUiYZBKyUfB57XoYD2-wqyALOJ7jZrxoZigpLA7e_4mR3A6RPB21T0Yw-O9jhuUksFmz0qYGXMzWFl-BXJIIY41RHeEzc8mGbkGCUAzyRJPI2/s1600/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony02.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 height=112 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwwgUXm9ab9FMFQ32MdF_Nv6MdkW1Cr-grUiYZBKyUfB57XoYD2-wqyALOJ7jZrxoZigpLA7e_4mR3A6RPB21T0Yw-O9jhuUksFmz0qYGXMzWFl-BXJIIY41RHeEzc8mGbkGCUAzyRJPI2/s200/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony02.jpg></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5dBzZo2XPTZ8tgo59rRnsU5XAF-2p-T30DhJMfoA0QEBWpTKo1Zpwa2YP9xGfPJ7Ndx2YiFp3M7O43LJ7BE4RFHFNLQDOdcpfG9lKiF8Dvrp7FDX7GPBoahDBzakz1IvvuP5n56wf8cCn/s1600/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony03.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 height=112 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5dBzZo2XPTZ8tgo59rRnsU5XAF-2p-T30DhJMfoA0QEBWpTKo1Zpwa2YP9xGfPJ7Ndx2YiFp3M7O43LJ7BE4RFHFNLQDOdcpfG9lKiF8Dvrp7FDX7GPBoahDBzakz1IvvuP5n56wf8cCn/s200/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony03.jpg></a><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtmKg-zMsifUv7-jA7jyYQrcQcM7aLgWkkMT1emj7gjAji9974BmM4Koc_eOexjg9PHKSqbIQimlNVnEG8nPvJP77-wntzudCBzUFljtUrEWUMc_bunOfPepa5taaW0eLq_2dtSaOIP6bv/s1600/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony04.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 height=112 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtmKg-zMsifUv7-jA7jyYQrcQcM7aLgWkkMT1emj7gjAji9974BmM4Koc_eOexjg9PHKSqbIQimlNVnEG8nPvJP77-wntzudCBzUFljtUrEWUMc_bunOfPepa5taaW0eLq_2dtSaOIP6bv/s200/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony04.jpg></a><tr><td class=tr-caption style=text-align:center><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifIcvWRtFvCT3trIkOVWuVdmgXnvEA71x-D3_9O6hFSrt3X0MfoJI6w0Xor8XyCYacW1csHaWfKNjfbiO5quTpPe6mPCX57Uw-iwbbjZtwfsDr-H9Dc_0tI7G2NUepNed9BlGHS_4-mNWW/s1600/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony05.jpg style=margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto><img loading=lazy border=0 height=112 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifIcvWRtFvCT3trIkOVWuVdmgXnvEA71x-D3_9O6hFSrt3X0MfoJI6w0Xor8XyCYacW1csHaWfKNjfbiO5quTpPe6mPCX57Uw-iwbbjZtwfsDr-H9Dc_0tI7G2NUepNed9BlGHS_4-mNWW/s200/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony05.jpg></a><a href=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxU119BkdJLQE5BtmMGSfaNDzlWwX19xgAX9x55S5Ha8caHYj5Se6gqEGJghyRTs7gR-wJOJt25KyOlwCi9KXg6bX1vawx93Mti-C-uJMDllh4Y8r3hZ8dXrVyyPVflXHSbE04Svu77oQu/s1600/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony06.jpg style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img loading=lazy border=0 height=112 src=https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxU119BkdJLQE5BtmMGSfaNDzlWwX19xgAX9x55S5Ha8caHYj5Se6gqEGJghyRTs7gR-wJOJt25KyOlwCi9KXg6bX1vawx93Mti-C-uJMDllh4Y8r3hZ8dXrVyyPVflXHSbE04Svu77oQu/s200/tomatsu_cinderellasymphony06.jpg></a></table>(Haha) Oh damn she looks so great close up.
