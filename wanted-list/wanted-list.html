<tr><td>She's like that friend's friend who is more attractive than your friend lol (sorry Itou Miku). She is not as popular in roles though as she is somewhat new, but her roles do present her as being idol-like. Not that I've given any though. Without proper Anime credit I am refraining my idolism on her for now tbh</td></tr>

(*More commonly referred to as "Ajuju", and I hardly call her Azumi-chan tbh)<br />

(*Fans guess she's in her 30s, so maybe born in late 1980s- HOLY SH*T she is old haha)<br />
