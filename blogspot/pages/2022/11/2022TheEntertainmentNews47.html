Let's give some money to   celebrate the 5th anniversary of DOAXVV-<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BLEACHTYBW06">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "I've come to put an end to your life" Ooooh boy haha     </div>  </blockquote>  Yeah, I know, how would you even know who that bald headed samurai is in the   books in a Quincy conflict a thousand years ago? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Hey, Uryu doesn't   know, can't blame him. In this new episode though (#BLEACHTYBW06)   unfortunately they didn't give us enough time to grief on the passing of   Sasakibe so someone's joining him real soon. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> So, let's talk about what   happened. Well, for starters, we witnessed Yamamoto's Bankai, of all things.   Hey, it's rarer than a solar or lunar eclipse, guys, so make sure you see this   good. Or maybe you can't, because at the point of releasing Zanka no Tachi,   the world burns like a desert with the power of this demon (lol) and his   ridiculously matured sword. Things start to dissipate heat even if they aren't   supposed to so I don't know why my extremities are cold watching this lmao,   but maybe, just maybe, it's protecting my core from being obliterated by this   fire-type sword. As you might have seen, this Bankai has four specific moves   which display the serious difference in power among the   <a href="shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a> themselves or even to   Yhwach... that the old man is fighting lmao <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, with powers typically only   being witnessed from what Ichigo had to do to lose his powers ie. Final   Getsuga with the "East" power and goddamn it looks SO much better in animation   here, a flaming body shield with the "West" power which goddamn this sounds   ridiculously OP even by shinigami standards haha, the "South" power is   probably the most useless unless you have fought with the old man before but I   guess a group of revived corpses from ashes isn't that great for fight   especially if they look so detailed compared to the rest of the fight haha as   expected from AoT directors being involved in this they have experience   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>, and the "North" power is something one should really use with   extreme care, just like R**** Bankai which we will see in 20 episodes. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>   Anyways, Yhwach is dealt with quickly mainly because this Bankai will destroy   the world if it's not kept in place real quick and so the old man acted   swiftly I would say even faster than Sonic himself lol, but THEN realized he   was fighting the wrong person the whole time. Hmm.... remember how like, when   Yamamoto fights with something so far it's always a fail when he has to deal   with illusions and stuff? People targeting his non-power type weaknesses, as   with Wonderweiss, for example? Yeah, this is the same too. Which will also   explain that this is Loyd Lloyd, and the impersonation Scrift Sternritter   Round Lloyd did die by Kenpachi's hands haha that's the brother btw, and also   because the Anime skipped a bit of lore as I recall, is comprised of two   Quincies actually mimicking each other and the character and memories of their   leader so that the leader himself can take some time to blow up the 1st Squad   Barracks which wink wink, houses the one and only threat in the world and   everybody's favourite: Aizen Sousuke. Hell yeah it has been great seeing him   still alive haha also   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/1086/Sousuke_Aizen" target="_blank"     >Hayami Show</a   >'s voice is just the best I tell ya. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay nostalgia time over, and   so is old man's life, as... I really don't want to spoil why the Bankai   medallion can still be used on him but not damn Ichigo, like, apart from him   as main character lmao, but uh, let's just say Yamamoto is still pure breed so   far. That itself, along with the others, is just a matter of time if we can   find anyone to suppress the Bankai using their own Quincy powers, to say.   Sounds like spoiler territory already but let's leave it there. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All   in all though, I really appreciate them creating a better narrative showing   the contrast of the fight a thousand years ago compared to now, as mentioned   the corpses part is animated <i>too</i> well, and the rest I guess it's hard   to imagine how powerful Zanka no Tachi is even in drawing, so I'll forgive the   animation team for not being able to <i>fully </i>capture the power. I mean,   how do you <i>even </i>capture the prowess of the strongest zanpakuto in   existence? Well it is not there now so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So next week, I think we are   going to start the salvage operation real quick hearing Byakuya's... dying   voice lol, but not like we are hinted with it yet, so... maybe we'll talk   about it then haha yes help is technically on the way and it's not Ichigo so   haha see you then though I'll go back and amaze myself on this Bankai reveal   hehe I'm a nerd I know but it's just <i>soooo fricking goooood~</i></div><div>[Yamamoto Genryusai tribute because why not]</div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="1080"               data-original-width="1920"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi05R5v3lzTzVAWHhB8nnCq2KzkOvvnJN7TYIxZJ61PHK7YfnQOiZXf1-5WnxXb2HK42R00aRJoFV72EHCL9t73_9fiHDZmtsCkQuH3OrYNWCuQNBpUJRhkFz3wkxCaiA_jrwccmGW4dJWcxhmkGylnAMBhbKJNrONHCGH7zXIaNrus-QeCY6G7Z--o/s320/bleachTYBW06_yamamoto09.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I'VE WAITED YEARS FOR THIS lol I'm going to say this real often btw           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="1080"               data-original-width="1920"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzee8ZhW_AU5YM-L-B4CH02sHJULtY2Y877o497uSAurVMpNIYwC2LXZE7AdEa1fBi-qhIlfZFPNl__TU82mpHroYzOuPh5Rza8a3mgCgOpegNMcOpi7Dd4a-tyqRisTKMB35BACyh-gIdxKFSQDRVcffdpsSweG0EH4Wuna4KDLRKe1ZAfVQvb_Gh/s320/bleachTYBW06_yamamoto13.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is the best we've seen in this series EVER           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="1080"               data-original-width="1920"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9yC2lWwzJiMR9k4RctDMnuxUvtzzuGo5eO4aNTPxqj_izNpXWebuGXB5ji8WbOphTGNZUB158PU0cVJfG3GTpDv5hW_AJiO1O0Eb_-om_HdGTuHUPXYtAX4uB90vYAB1ONXpTGN4fqsjPLTEJeP7vom8V7HPTQ_VupckAKqrLxqEIA5qj2YdCdFtD/s320/bleachTYBW06_yamamoto18.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Rest in peace, old man.<br />*salutes*           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  P.S.

Double</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "I see, they aren't at first name basis yet" Yeah apparently not after two       seasons lol     </div>  </blockquote>  I mean Yanagi-chan this isn't your fault your mom tried it out too and got   sh*tted by this middle schooler Hana here. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, in this new   episode where we are dumping recaps now (#UzakiChanS208) but damn, maybe it's   because I had noodles for lunch but damn, maybe I should stock up on rice   snacks or   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/onigiri" target="_blank">onigiri</a> for   this. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We continue from last week where Yanagi drops by the sister's   workplace and had a chance to talk to handsome, ripped gamer Sakurai over   here- Hey, not girlfriend, it's just a coincidence, why are you pissed about   this? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So clearly, Uzaki (Hana) here is pissed, and expects Shinichi   (lol) to give her an explanation. But we know, we all know, that the point   that everyone else has their first name called but just specifically her as a   friend is called by family name, IS already itself a special thing, isn't it?   No really, saw that rice cooker from a mile away, boys. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Just didn't   expect for them to do the whole animation- Ah hey, in case you don't know how   to get rice from a cooker, you can thank this Anime. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Somehow though,   it got worse when the mom found out and thought that Sakurai would be a thing   to Yanagi too, further deepening the whatever relation he might have with the   family members, and she's a middle schooler too. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> (Audience: Which   one you talking about?) (Yes haha) And then she chose to put herself into the   equation and tells her daughter to bring her along if she wants to go to the   café next time. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> 4P! 4P!! 4- Sorry, dad, you were here? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man,   we really CAN NOT let the dad in on this, no freaking way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What we   DID let the dad on in though haha, is about Kiri-kun over here, the only son   of the household. He's burnt out with exam preparations, he needs a workout   even if he's not that good at but seriously though thanks for reminding me to   exercise even if it's against my will lol yeah there's people like me, just   took on the offer from the father to go work out at the gym where there are   bench presses and treadmills and large swimming pools with advanced lanes and   he can have a good afternoon showing off his youth and prowess to the elders   who were hanging out there because that's all they do. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Little did he   know, he has always been bested but I would also say that he is too arrogant   about just his youth to be honest, that he always felt underpowered while   comparing with the super fit in the gym including, yes not like the father   knows so naturally not the son, Sakurai who "challenged" him in swimming.   Well, according to Kiri-kun I guess. That guy's got more than you on his mind   so don't mind him lapping you on the swimming lanes, boy. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also more   in every department compared to your body- ANYWAYS all in all... F**K YOU DAD,   this is all your fault! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, not like Fujio-san here knows what is   happening, but okay, maybe that old man on the bench press and Speedy Gonzales   disguised as an old woman on the treadmill aren't <i>that </i>much of a   problem but <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, the pace of the series is still relatively slow,   but now we got to know more of the rest of the family and how they can help...   the girls can help Hana-chan over here- F**K YOU DAD WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF   DOING NEXT WEEK!!! Haha oh well </div><div>  [TL:DR; "Hana-chan is a late bloomer..."

That's not how this   Raven Consort thing works where did you hear this from? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new   episode of not God even though technically Jusetsu is one   (#KoukkyuNoKarasu08), we delve in deeper into the everyday life of- I mean,   this is pretty much what she has to deal with on a daily basis, right? We just   had special episodes shown because it involved the emperor. Excuse me, Summer   King. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, more sad tales to talk about apart from some random   woman walking into the Consort's palace to ask to revive someone she knows.   That one, we can't help much. What we can help out though, is the friend   eunuch to Jiu-Jiu. Apparently he dropped by probably not on behalf of the   Consort he's serving under but not like people of higher authority appreciate   that *ahem* (period drama, by the way), to mention about a ghost he saw in the   palace. Since the Consort is afraid of those, he was punished *ahem* for even   saying that to his superior eunuchs. I mean, reasonable, *ahem*, but we shall   not talk about more, but yeah is violence a problem even in the past, so   Jusetsu kindly put a stop to that, well, at least for the one guy. She can't   prevent what happened in the past though, where the ghost on the bridge was   previously a eunuch who brought feathers for the Consort to please her, did   some, uh, I would say animal abuse-level approaches in order to achieve the   latter, by trapping birds and taking their feathers. Seriously bro, I know you   are young and don't know sh*t, but damn is there worth taking a dying bird's   feather? And you killed it too so... I don't even know how to comment on that.   And that's why those feathers are DROPPED, bro, not plucked from their bodies.   It's rare, and thus it deserves praise. Which is precisely what happened the   first time he presented one which was dropped to the Consort. Again, if you   thought bringing more is a trend and can get you promoted or something...   Where's that cane I'll beat him up on whoever's behalf lol <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Okay   jokes over haha, and apart from punishing servants for the wrong stuff like   speaking formally and with the capital's accent (In Ancient China people from   the South spoke a different linguistic accent than the capital North, think of   Ye Old West), maybe instead of keeping mum about the presence of a ghost such   that the Consort would get the chills walking past the garden's bridge, how   about get Jusetsu to help out so we can ACTUALLY send the ghost away so that   we can be actually be rid of spirits, yeah? Man, servants really don't think.   And that's why our new boy (lmao) Yi Sha is a smart dude, and maybe putting   him under the Raven Consort's care is a better option. Like, how would the   other eunuchs know his value and loyalty, right? You can only know people that   much and THEN just punish them for saying stuff not in the book because they   can't speak to higher-ups. *ahem* All in all... yeah. This might be the most   emotional episode yet. As I *sniff* wipe off my tears haha ah hey, we can   ponder about what Jusetsu is experiencing here. It's something we know doesn't   come often in life. It's something we know only people with power can do. It's   justice, people. That, is only existent for people with right of mind, without   hanging on to tradition, and with power. Most people don't have all three, so   it's good to see the Raven Consort be one. That's all. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> See you all   next week for more emotional tales I guess where I think we might just   conclude this series with more of these sad tales now tbh </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkL34IEMBe9Za0tChrtylcLetWh0eECSDJjOKMkNFidZpKPDcANcVQ4Cnirwunj3a5EMspDlJm2VdaW2xw4x_SGMYQvsUuZGGk-c5k3Rc6CndlZNZL_lRdpalFbsRxe_6snSQDDXJrtWwT3a9wn22M_JGLEI_d4ECt7VwM07PQqWhTmHj2T3fJZDEj/s320/koukyuunokarasu08_jusetsu3.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Oh yes Jusetsu just stare into my soul please<br />(lol)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWsiNmIu2AYi2rIkT0Z83nCZN21_WOZyBe9w6SnvU15H5liIlGR-9L3ou1Uacv0duP7udNer5aR7M7_RunjafQKGwmyMqA3onvS8gPLhBGJSqEQbijt-knnwghRYQxGkf6azy0qzqLHA0HKc9KZxZYS5g0p_nBjumlMlvq4XjcT7JdbREap6p6VNgP/s320/koukyuunokarasu08_eye.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Man if I saw this??

Yeah, from their 2006 album.   It has been 15 years and they have decided to sing more songs which is   surprising. I did only give the one song though, the topic one I assume, but   heck, they still sound great maybe I should go back to listen to the album   back then now that it's on music streaming services.<br />  <br />  So, in news about music that is on Twitter and I guess we should report on   this before the whole thing shuts down lol,   <a     href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1592875032216473600?s=20&amp;t=zZhX9h8WKfpp8HE48uJYdw"     target="_blank"     ><b>ClariS new lyric video</b></a   >  for their winter cover album is unique in several ways because (1) it's   <a     href="https://twitter.com/jitsuimo/status/1592796597251108865?s=20&amp;t=XqS5y4rEsVGkNxnqIDAD6g"     target="_blank"     >a collaboration with a light novel character</a   >  that (2) I know of is drawn by illustrator   <a href="https://twitter.com/minori_chigusa" target="_blank"     >Chigusa Minori</a   >  which I knew of through pixiv and I will not bore you with so you can just   listen to the song,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1593076962938875906?s=20&amp;t=zZhX9h8WKfpp8HE48uJYdw"       target="_blank"       >Aimer's new music video</a     ></b   >  sounds okay so I'll look forward to the mini-album next month,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1593212364018442241?s=20&amp;t=zZhX9h8WKfpp8HE48uJYdw"       target="_blank"       >Taketatsu Ayana's new music video teaser</a     ></b   >  is for her new single next year in March (just had her first baby by the way)   which is once again for Anime so looks like her popularity for this credit   isn't dampening in any way,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1593535504758120449?s=20&amp;t=zZhX9h8WKfpp8HE48uJYdw"       target="_blank"       >RYTHEM's new cover song video</a     ></b   >  for the week is of something we all might be familiar of if we have watched   "Spirited Away" and   <a     href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1593579371201441794?s=20&amp;t=zZhX9h8WKfpp8HE48uJYdw"     target="_blank"     >they are also doing a livestream next month</a   >  maybe with more news about their best album, in a surprise to no one   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1593529452557910018?s=20&amp;t=zZhX9h8WKfpp8HE48uJYdw"       target="_blank"       >Uesaka Sumire is releasing a new single in February</a     ></b   >  next year for Anime "Nagatoro-san" second season which I did not watch, I feel   like I shouldn't talk about this yet since there is no song preview but   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1593586835032543233?s=20&amp;t=zZhX9h8WKfpp8HE48uJYdw"       target="_blank"       >GLIM SPANKY guitarist produced group has been formed</a     ></b   >  with new songs slated for release next month so let's see what that is when it   comes out in due time, and&nbsp;<b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/tweedees_tokyo/status/1593221201367027715?s=20&amp;t=zZhX9h8WKfpp8HE48uJYdw"       target="_blank"       >TWEEDEES has released a new album preview</a     ></b   >  for yes their new album slated for next month so I'm glad I caught of this and   maybe it's time to follow them. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Wow, maybe quite a lot of stuff   ending the year which will probably not go in the ranks I hardly give songs   end of the year in the Awards. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Anyways haha<br />  <br />  For next week, we have the Anime "BLEACH" theme songs line-up and boy have I   not been taking them seriously but that also means that   <b>Kitani Tatsuya's new single</b> should be safely good with its typical rock   style music and newbie YouTuber-singer <b>SennaRin's new single</b> will be a   fresh take on the trend of pop style ending songs in action series thus far. I   mean, I'm saying these in the nicest way possible so let's see how much I want   to puke once I hear more of them in due time. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Well, initial   impressions are good so I hope it stays on I hardly ever reject BLEACH theme   songs so don't break that record, guys.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /></div><div>  You saw my review of my   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>-chan's   new single already? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> If you haven't, be sure to check it out she can   sing emo and cute in one easy package, it was hard to say no. And they didn't   had to drag the release two months to me to decide too. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> With regards   to this blog though? I may have plans to simplify the site a bit despite this   current "sleek" design customized by yours truly, but maybe I might not move   to a new site after seeing what content warnings Blogger dropped on me when I   imported it again to test things out. Turns out, mostly Anime "TsureKano" so   maaaaaaybe that is too much naked Yume-chan. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Cya guys again likely   in a week, and until next time I will try to find a *searches online for term*   WYSIWYG editor web hosting service (apparently many put HTML custom content   behind paywalls) while still letting me export my efforts. We shall see then   this is 2022 SURELY there is a workaround to my blogging empire. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>   Haha bye bye </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
