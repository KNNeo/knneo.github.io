And that's how a fall from the bicycle will ruin your weekend. Well, I ruined it for myself so whatever haha<br /><br />As you can see above (I promise no injury gore shots so don't go mature rating this blog), I have a scraped knee so it hurts to walk, so I'm staying at home all day to... not watch Anime apparently the mom brought her friends over to the home. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> I don't know. My family issues are difficult. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Let's do this before they come back for Round 2 lol ah shit they're back haha<br /><br />[12 more days to Animal Crossing New Horizons HELL YEAH haha I need to come up with a town name that is dumb but isn't lol FYI I named by first character in Stardew Valley "Jerk" lmao. Oh don't worry I recently named my Japanese Harvest Moon remake farm "Grandpa's Farm Farm" haha they didn't warn me when they appended the last word]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion08"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Doing so is also on consideration for you" Okay Jeeves-san, where do they live now? They haven't even worked yet bro you making them rich kids homeless now? lol</div></blockquote>In this new episode of "Family Matters"... lol okay again, I didn't expect to drop into this fiasco where the mother only appears as an illusion or in a flashback haha. In this new episode though (#HatenaIllusion08), we have a bunch of people who just don't like how our main characters are living now. Hmm... dear author do you even have a backup plan for when they fail in life? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, hopefully so because things aren't looking that great on any of them now. But it would seem we have something to look forward to here, and it's all taking shape, unlike Yumemi-chan's skills in making Artifacts BOOM GOT HER haha. (Also TIL you can just destroy an Artifact by physically destroying it lol) Firstly, why Mariah-san can do whatever she wants with the Hoshisato family. Because everyone knew what happened. How though? And why the big secret though? For not knowing the answer to any of those, it seems like we can't even progress because we really have no idea about why any of them can never tell the kids what actually happened in the actual home. Maybe the mother was truly kidnapped at the old home of the grandmother. We don't know. What we do know is, all of them around the house, including Mamoru, Jeeves and Ema-san included, probably can't do anything about it. I mean, if they can save the woman this will all be over. Or if they did then someoene's gonna die so thank goodness for not that ending haha. So, despite all these, the kids are kind of fooling around and finding ways to overpower Mariah to no effect and almost destroying the house, which continues to power her reasons for them not being able to stay in the mansion due to their lack of power. Problem is again, even if they can't control, then why chase them out? They not family? Or must people be skilled in order to live in such a mansion? (Maybe because it's the mother that has been protecting them this whole time but you're actually supposed to be skilled to live inside a mansion of the family?) Sometimes, this series don't make much sense, but I think we might have an idea in the second half. In a couple of flashbacks from Ema-san, we can see that she, along with Jeeves-san, have been around for the family serving the Hoshisato family for a while, and since the kids not being skilled in their Artifacts is a problem, then I guess the solution is to teach them. Kind of like how in "BLEACH" Ichigo doesn't know sh*t and he gets into a crash course and saved the world within a couple of months. So, Ema chose to ask Jeeves for help to train them, for now specifically Hatena. How though? Turns out, Jeeves is part of the mansion, and being an Artifact himself, probably fought more battles than most of the generals in recent history lol. But sadly having embed the powers from the family, he can't really fight too long. You know, OP issues lol but hey, Hatena will be dead by the time he's done with her so whatever haha. Okay, how it all come to this, you may ask? But I would argue that it's because everyone is hiding something. From Mariah about what happened to the family specifically that made anyone have such an authority to influence the mansion itself, to even Mamoru agreeing to the matter and technically avoiding the issue as he sees Gregory... everyone is hiding the truth from them. And us viewers too, in retrospect. Which is probably what is pissing me off right now; most action shows should've already dropped a hint episodes ago; just look at "Hanako-kun" below. What is more irritating though, is how everyone is reacting to this. As of now or up till now, it has always been Mariah VS the kids, and that's just hard to watch. Which is why Hatena kept mentioning why is it just them and her, because it's as if the rest aren't involved. But I guess with the end of this episode and some resolve of Ema-san wanting to end Hatena-chan (lol) (I meant her suffering), we might see some progress. Hey, I know this series may not have an ending, but please tell me Maeves-san is okay, please. On top of all these of course, we hardly know about Artifacts. We know they can go berserk if handled badly, we know they can be used in basic function by anyone which will probably explain how that fat b*tch be heating Hatena-chan up a couple of episodes ago lol, and it really seems like it's not that safe, but is it though? Why is this show making reality checks so real I need to stop thinking about magic girl Anime and not compare how great those are with respect to this haha. All in all, I want to see stuff happen, whether it's fighting or plot development with this shitty drawing because I'm getting bored. Even that swimming pool part won't get me hard now. Come on Anime; I know you have a trick up your sleeve; Please use it sooner than later before I leave like Gregory did so wait Makoto did not show him anything?? Ugh this show man...<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nkw-nenGaWE/XmSuYaLzyYI/AAAAAAAA5og/Y68ACKz9Yrc5KHgkv-xKvLM2YYbdbx0hACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion08_jeeves5.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Okay combat Jeeves-san is cool, I'll give you that</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lMO_FVaKD6Q/XmSuYC1vv7I/AAAAAAAA5oc/CB0bJ25ow2cZ5fpCzeMN98uLgIoPLZ3jACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion08_yumemi5.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yumemi-chan be MVP because she is so much cuter compared to Hatena I mean JUST LOOK AT THIS hehe</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

There's a boy who looks just like Hanako-kun" Wow this is the most elaborate of an intro to an episode in this series EVER haha</div></blockquote>Haha is that Yashiro playing an idol game? Hey she the same as us. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I mean, you know you are a daikon, right? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay jokes about <a href="https://jisho.org/search/raburi-" target="_blank">lovely</a> Yashiro aside, let's talk about this new episode. In this new episode (#HanakoKun09) woah are we introduced to the bad guys real quick. I mean, if Yashiro isn't that <strike>dunb</strike> dumb enough (sorry, dumb typo) to get ambushed by the other two, who knows what worse things might happen to our girl haha. And we're invited to a tea party too? Come on, we girls know that in a tea party you NEVER stop eating and drinking and talking lol ask how Cinderella's stepsisters came about haha. So yeah, Yashiro got... kidnapped, is the intro to this episode. Hey, it's all well planned, what can I say? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Firstly, someone from another class is finding her. I mean, a male student?? What?? Is this an alternate world of Yashiro Nene where she gets laid- Yeah, just saying. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> The guy is Natsuhiko, and as we have seen him from last episode... ignoring the fact that he might be an apparition himself, he's a senpai in the school. He asks Yashiro out (yeah right), she follows him (yeah, no really) and... she gets splashed with a bucket of water. Yeah, what did I tell you? It may be too elaborate a plot considering how the bad guys also didn't do much to her, but yeah, she got baited by them real fast here. Well, Sakura-chan didn't intend this to happen, but hey, a climatic entry doesn't hurt right? *looks at author* So, she ended up becoming a fish, as we have known if half-human her comes into contact with water. Well, a lot of water. It's easier to transport her this way, I guess? Sadly, it's destination is to a Boundary. A Boundary, where the bad guys are at. Sakura-chan introduces herself to be a senpai in this school and currently in a contract of what seems to be evil Hanako and I'm still not wrong, because now we know it's a twin. So yes, Amane and Tsukasa are twins. So according to this, we can already deduce from the stuff I said last week on what might happen. But instead, we get the long story drawn since Yashiro ended up enjoying the tea party and complaining the sh*t out of <strike>Hanako</strike> Amane which I'm sure Tsukasa already knows most of it but we still don't know something. Don't be tricked too, everyone, for we still don't know the truth. Someone was murdered by another, remember. Still, half an hour later, Yashiro didn't really ask on it, and ended up trapped in the world and being sent into another world between worlds, I guess? In her desperate effort in praying Hanako to save her lol, I mean, it worked, to say the least. Hanako appears in a radio inside of that world between worlds, and instructs her on how to leave. Okay, this might be the episode already, so I hope you're ready for some analysis. Firstly, acknowledgement of Hanako as Seven Wonder and how fast Yashiro came out of danger unscathed. Okay, she did get ambushed but other than that as she said, they were "nice" to her considering she is an innocent party so good chances she won't die anyways (she is technically dead, by the way), but also how Natsuhiko understands what Hanako was talking about. So yeah, that is still plenty we don't understand. If Natsuhiko says this is playing from Sakura-chan or Tsukasa maybe, means it'll be over if they deal with Hanako? Or eventually they will be let out of the world between worlds? Then again, it didn't take long for Hanako to save the maiden as long as she enters a fragment of his past, it would seem. Funny to think that maybe Hanako has absolute power of this school premises, which is why the "bad guys" had to resort to schemes to take Hanako down. As of now, I don't even know if they are anywhere close to friend or foe. Tsukasa did turn a ghost into a monster-level apparition, and then on the other hand did just not kill the girl. I mean, if we get rid of the assistant then it's easier to deal with the one guy, right? Next, we might get some psychological fights incoming. Considering Yashiro knows nothing about Hanako thus far even after all this flashback and stuff, her lack of knowledge of the situation may get Hanako himself into trouble as he tries to deal with the impending danger that is happening within the school, in case you need to remember what happened in a nutshell. Then begs the question, and sorry for saying that this plot is better than Hatena Illusion lol: What is Sakura-chan's motive here? Remember Hanako instructs Yashiro to work for him, well mainly as bait so that he can control the apparitions appearing within the school to some extent, like that love tree for example. If Sakura is doing the opposite and helping as a broadcaster to make monsters in the school, then what is their motive? Destroying the school? I doubt so, but to just create chaos until Amane can face his twin brother again? Maybe? I don't know. For now, let's follow and see what happens, because we might get an answer soon, for the next episode hints at direct confrontation of the two Hanakos (lol) in a room of mirrors. Someone please explain to me what has happened so far, please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />[If you need a difference check on subtitles because I can listen to Japanese now, Natsuhiko actually said "she won't die" as Tsukasa freaked fish Yashiro out because... she has mermaid scales, and the bond with her and Hanako makes her immortal. Now you know subs are bullshi-]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VWSoSKjATbg/XmS71Erg2dI/AAAAAAAA5pA/EYTUCSm5VcIi92606IO_nLlP0G3nfX5RgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun09_game.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">LOL Yashiro even your idol game guy looks like Hanako still don't admit you like this type?</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y9JhXZcvJV0/XmS7097WLXI/AAAAAAAA5o8/U4s6G3AsVTgDDlvYt2KPsbA5D2uMdv2LgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun09_sakura2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">MFW someone says I'm going out with some ugly f-</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

"No, not when we're here" Okay Yamamoto-san stop writing on your notepad haha</div></blockquote>If you thought Aika was walking in a real life airport, you're not dreaming we saw that too haha. In this new episode (#RikeKoi09) of nerd shit... it's the long awaited BIKINI EPISODE!! YES IT'S HERE I'm so going to jump on Himuro like how she jumped on Yukimura but in my dreams lol. So yeah, we're not going to the beach, by the way. We're going to a science conference- I mean LOOK AT THEM!! Kanade-chan say something!! Ugh haha. "Playing with dolls on the beach is new" lmao Yukimura don't shit on Torasuke you're not much better. So, beach time, I guess! We go to Okinawa for the lab's training camp, but we know we don't want to be seeing just science work in Okinawa. What are we, science-type nerds? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But man, was this a good episode. Everything in essence about the series is back with another hit, and it all went well. Yes, even that one guy who hit up on Himuro haha. Firstly, Yukimura sitting on a plane. I mean, is he desperate or what, as he tries to do physical contact with Himuro on the plane ie. saliva sampling but seriously, you can be more discrete. Did anyone teach him that when he was a kid? You can be stealthy in everything you do in public, like collecting saliva, hugging, kissing, f**king... Well, you get the idea haha. And Himuro desperately wants it too, so Yukimura you should have done it. Discretion is key, if you need someone to tell you that. Some would argue that doing things discrete is a fetish in itself. *winks* Amongst many missed opportunities, we see many more in this episode as the guys settle down in their short stay, and enjoyed the beach. Well, I mean, if enjoying is running laps around the ocean like the Prof then I guess, haha. And also, someone paid for the high budget hotel, so thanks, poor author haha. But seriously, Yamamoto will make a story in real life even if she has to make a 4P out of the others besides the main couple- MOVING ON!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And thus, we should give some credit to <strike>Yamamoto's hotel budget</strike> the main couple's interactions this episode (lol), as they try out ways to do some <a href="https://jisho.org/search/roshutsu" target="_blank">exposure</a> play here (sorry watch too much porn liao my knowledge stretches through horizons haha) including a private session behind the rocks. You know, where the REAL rocks do things. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> It... was hard for Yukimura. And I like how I am already jumping the gun by saying you won't get too much besides Himuro's RACK haha but yeah, he backed off, and in the eyes of everyone else, they started thinking of ways to maximise "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukinshippu" target="_blank">skinship</a>", as they say. I'm not going to reference whatever kamasutra thing they may have talked about or Ibarada's craze for BL (lol please stop), but suffice it to say nothing happened. Well, might still be enough material for Yamamoto though haha. Embarrassment will make of good writing material anyways, to be honest. They played some watermelon splitting using complex planes (ugh) (yes, I know you can only know the angle from that; "x + iy" amirite?) and without insulting how weak Yukimura is, uh, I mean, that reflector plate lol. And Yuuichi, (yep, that one guy that likes to hit on women specifically all the main girls in this series) who is also on the island, tried to chat up Himuro and Kanade to find out it's them again and ran haha, and went for Ibarada and got knocked out by Torasuke, haha. I mean, you will never win that poor fellow in "Seitokai Yakuindomo" lmao (you know who I'm referring to, thanks to the <strike>sensei</strike> despertae f**k lmao), but still, he's just out of luck. Going to Torasuke, I still don't get why Ibarada still can't get any real emotions out of her with regards to Torasuke being like, you know, manly to her in danger. I mean, it's not really danger even if Yuuichi grabs her hand, but you know, gotta blame someone, Schrodinger. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, Ibarada, you no appreciation for this idiot to any extent? He might be your childhood friend and you have shifted on him all his life but somehow, at this point I would expect some appreciation, but her tears so far is just shed because she laughed too hard lol. Oh well, I guess not in this Anime. All in all, thank goodness they didn't do nothing but experiments but I think Yamamoto may have gotten her money's worth out of this trip haha I hope your next work sells which is this series maybe lmao. Next episode though, is where we get to see presentations? Ugh, I thought I can get out of this outside work but to be honest? It has been some time since I saw one (don't jinx it) (haha), so if I need to pick whose work is better Kanade-chan can just stand there and I'll give her full marks haha dear other Profs go easy on her, yes? Torasuke you can beat him up haha I wished my FYP presentation was in Okinawa lmao bye<br />[Since they are so many long shots I'll do a couple]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i1dcp1-bxN8/XmT4kVEksjI/AAAAAAAA5pk/vow-81Wtpq0A2uv6aW8ZIxqIXrDYoFMuwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi09_nodding.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is so cute I can't even</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="626" data-original-width="1600" height="155" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-COtziZTrGig/XmT46Aki8ZI/AAAAAAAA5pw/C-uH9D4kUJMJPurtLlxRueol67QUcFrVwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/rikekoi09_watching.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="400" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When your friends come to visit your new home and you two are alone and you forgot to lock the door lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Okay maybe you're not Kotoko-chan level yet haha</div></blockquote>This is as intense of a fight you will see in this series ever, so hold on to your seats, everyone. Saki-san being commentator is better than any sports game imo haha. In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri09) we are set to take down Steel Lady Nanase, or how she has been named after (Rikka-san you piece of-), we finally get into the debate which will hopefully settle this once and for all. Well, almost. Kotoko-chan will try though, whatever it takes. She's got a long night to play this out, and so is everyone else, so let's see how far we can go. Firstly, Kotoko-chan talks about pushing responsibility to a virtual killer. We have talked about this before in past episodes so go watch those, but suffice it to say we have to make this a murder, and not a ghost who haunts and kills people like what many have believed. Riding on Tereda's death (RIP bro), Kotoko-chan used his case to show that there needs to be someone smarter instead of stronger than Terada in order to take him down, and this requires much effort in the back end. But maybe talking about how a murder takes this much setup just to get rid of him the same way a ghost <i>might</i> be doing to kill someone may be a bit of a stretch (sorry Kotoko-chan I'm not on your side in the forums now lol), so yeah as much as this doesn't make much sense, it still kind of works in her favour since again, all we need is enough people to think it's right. And after a good amount of explaining (shoutout to the one guy who said TL:DR; haha), she managed to convince people that Terada might be killed by someone who possesses strong feelings for the detective and wants to kill him over probably something superficial like, he got a girlfriend and it's not her or something lol. So to be honest, Kotoko-chan is explaining past events as humane as she can, as a Lord of the supernatural. And in retrospect, she chose a feasible killer to convince all, a woman, to kill him with wit instead of force since we know Terada-san is a Judo expert himself. Reflexes though? Hey, who knows? It's a dark night at an abandoned gas station. Also, if you think she is going to make Saki-san the scapegoat you are not alone because Saki-san thinks that too. With association to someone who is close to him preferrably at work and knows a lot of his behaviour and movements, Saki-san sounds like the perfect person to point blame at this point, so yeah if I were here I'll freakout too lol we know girl it's not you. Also, it won't be you because Kotoko-chan can't hold this lie for too long either. Because now, it's answering questions about this lie. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Kotoko then now has to hold on her stand by trying to go around the many loopholes many may have found about this "murder" and rather believing fiction (what a bunch of idiots haha) that a ghost killed someone which sorry for saying this, can't even happen in the first place. Okay, this is Anime so I'll forgive you if you think otherwise. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Which brings us to the main question with respect to what we know about the only two survivors of the Sakuranogawa experiment that, Rikka-san is also manipulating this discussion behind the scenes, dying time and again (remember last week's GIF? haha sorry) if needed to change the tides slightly to her favour and that'll bring Kotoko back to square one. Because if you see, let's say politics now is left wing, and someone said a lot of left wing stuff to make people wanna vote right wing, what do you think the eventual results would be? Then, all it takes is for Kuro-san to also take the extreme side of the future polar opposite to Rikka-san's, and they'll be done. Problem is, it's not working as expected, and that might still be a problem after what we have seen so far. All in all... they're going to one solution per episode, huh. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh okay at least we get an episode discount we presenting two more next episode. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> Cya guys next week haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9tTw-3ZU2IY/XmUDL4wgXEI/AAAAAAAA5qA/AZkPSCg8kbc6EkZPD0uzHWjK8mjeFXVaACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri09_killer.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Looks a lot like Saki-san, isn't it?<br />Haha I mean, they could've given her long hair but</td></tr></tbody></table>[Don't ask for postscripts it's either intense action or intense mystery talk I can't make a joke on that okay besides Saki-san being the culprit haha that was a good one]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well, this is probably one of two weeks we'll get something out of this month, so let's talk all about it, I guess. Man, the week after next is going to be rough as in I'm going to play Animal Crossing all weekend haha. Okay, songs. Firstly, <b>SID's new single</b> is up for review but I haven't given the online order yet mostly because of the coronavirus thing so it's only going to delay so might as well (also I blew my budget last month so I gotta), but also I'm thinking <b>whether to give Jibaku Shounen Band's single</b> ie. "Hanako-kun" Opening a thumbs up because it's also a one-track single. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I'll think about the latter for a while more. Meanwhile, <b>ClariS' new single</b>&nbsp;was disappointing to say the least, but I got a lot out of <b>KANA-BOON's best album despite the new single</b>'s lack of punch, so I'll add a couple more songs to my list. Well, songs performed by when they were a four-piece. Bassist why<br /><br />Talking about the Internet news first so I can have a grasp on what to listen to next week, let's talk Twitter first. Because <b>Touyama Nao's new single is up on streaming</b> including Apple Music, we can also infer that Numakura Manami's best album which released a month ago will also go through this sequence, so I'll probably listen to it again after that it out; I've shortlisted a couple of songs anyways. <b>Asakura Momo's new music video preview</b> on YouTube is lovely but man did I have a different image of it based on the style and melody of the song (but hey I'm not he director who gets paid), <b>miwa's new song</b> is out on streaming but not like I'm giving it a listen just yet, <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's 2nd major album</b> is out next month in April so hype fever, <b>SCANDAL released a new music video</b> featuring the one emotional song I gave in their latest album which is great because it is, <b>Waki Azumi is releasing her 2nd single</b> in May and from the first impression of one of the songs in this again double A-side single it's... not going to top the first haha, and Anime "Kaguya-sama" is starting their 2nd season in the upcoming season with a <b>Kaguya character song</b>? It's not mipressive even considering Koga Aoi who voices the girl just won an award for this role and technically sang in an Anime-based band in "Tenshi no 3P", so... oh well I'm not giving anyways also please tell me Koko-chan will have a character song too that Fujiwara has so much chest she can sing a good song even holding her breath amirite?? <span title="*silence*">😐</span><br /><br />With this, so next week yes <b>Numakura Manami's best album</b> is under review once again after I skimmed through it last month which I would admit is my fault with my mood at work and all the other singles around (I mean, there's Fuchigami Mai for valentine right?), and also talking about stuff releasing next week actually, is <b>TrySail's new single</b>. Let's hope the B-side is good when people write for Anime most of the time it sucks I don't know why and only sometimes Naruto gets the best theme songs from like Scenarioart. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> Oh well never mind I can only reminisce now to be honest<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Well, I guess I'm finally done. Sorry to anyone who cares like those guys in the Steel Lady Nanase's forums about this late of a post on Sunday night, but yeah I took a while to start watching because my mom had her friends over and... I think our house is getting a renovation without anyone's approval besides herself. Oh well, she's a co-owner anyways, whatever. She can do whatever she wants just DON'T TOUCH MY CDS AND PHOTOBOOKS UNDERSTAND!!?? Haha she said someone's popping by to detach the aircon which resides above my shelves though so... DON'T YOU DARE haha cya guys next week and remember: Don't fall off your bike just because you are pissed off at kids failing at cycling taught by their maid. Haha I htink that's how I fell I don't remember lol also just stay at home no reason to come out to get virus<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
