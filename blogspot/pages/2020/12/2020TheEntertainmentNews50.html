Anyways, I'm already   happy for not working on a Monday but real disappointed in my bulk purchases   in that so-called 12.12 sale because the bad news is my new custom PC is only   shipping a month later wtf the good news is the new IKEA desk top will be   ready for it haha because that'll come next week. If you aren't buying desk   tops (yes, the one board on your desk, not a full set computer) from IKEA let   me tell you they can last as long as you don't try to karate chop them or put   20 CPUs on it because I don't. I just changed it because I heard several   cracks in the course of this year so I'm getting worried lmao </div><div><br /></div><div>  Okay, buying spree over besides that package thing that will take ages to assemble but hey let's talk Anime   shall we? Today was quite a long day of doing a lot of stuff so I could use   more... laughs haha no really read on<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="GREATPRETENDER22">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> GREAT PRETENDER</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "I'm sure (Makoto) will pull some kind of shit out" Yeah Cynthia you're       not wrong haha "What if Laurent pulls it?" Well about that...     </div>  </blockquote>  Yeah, old b*tch, you like the coffee made by your not son Makoto? That be the   last drink you having haha hey don't call out on me. In this new episode   (#GREATPRETENDER22) where I hope all of you guys have your bulletproof vests   ready, maybe we don't need them after all if it ends up being a stealth leader   only kill. You know, then you can't do shit anymore, whichever side did it. Man,   Makoto be sweeping in as the fake son of Suzaku so easily she wants him for   her retirement haha. So, story. Seriously though, why am I scared of the   outcome? Haha the backup(s) should be worried more than me I just watch the   security cameras lol. Eh... I'm sure you're confused at the ending but we'll   get there, I promise. So, as we have seen last episode, the two sides of mafia   are prepared to negotiate a deal, or not because they made both sides offer   cash as tribute to the other side, obviously as a ways for Laurent's team to   sweep up on both sides at the same time, and yeah they did. Let's talk about what   happened after the boring stuff was expected, because seriously, that's where   it gets interesting haha. So, the China mafia fly to Japan, they got   transported to some weird place via shortcut as specified by the driver (ah, I   guess this is where it started), and "they arrived at Suzaku's place". You   know, the tall skyscraper where she has all her tools ready to kill Liu. Well,   on Liu's side he's prepared to poison the old woman too so I guess it's   neutral. Just who dies first, right? WRONG. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> As the China group came   in, got their body searched because why wouldn't you check if the ring is a   fake, they got let in, just the three of them, into the big room. At this   point, I would like to "kindly remind you" that besides the six of them in the   big room, we have some of Chen's men "downstairs", and the "fake police" led by   Cynthia and the others are prepared to storm in, so you see, there is some   expected and unexpected plot. And as the two sides hand over their money lol,   the translators went silent. Because you know, how you gonna explain both   sides are handing over money haha isn't this supposed to be a trade? I don't   think people will want to trade money over money right? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (Depends on the exchange rate lmao) So firstly,   the fake police stepped in. This one, led by Kudo and the others, stormed in   with evidence of child trafficking (lol) and then stole everything valuable-   Yep that sounds right haha. But of course, only Laurent and Makoto did not put   their hands up after a while, so the two sides probably figured out who was   betraying them already. But then, remember Cynthia talked about Makoto and his   emotional nonsense? Cue part 3, I guess. Once per heist, remember? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span>   This time around, he actually called upon Eddie (which I doubt so, so as I   ponder, we'll know the truth soon) to bring his own team of gunmen and force   Laurent's group to surrender. You know, so that he can protect his not mother,   kill his dad along with wiping out the most famous international scam group we   have ever seen in the history of Anime. Hey, did I just praise how good they   were? Haha okay sorry then. Anyways, the money and cheque is on Japan mafia's   side now, but uh, that's not over yet. "Laurent probably predicted Makoto   betraying him" so as with people who have been betrayed, Makoto will be dealt   with, probably making Suzaku sadder than Oz is to be honest (lol), and the fake   police team then take action to deal with the opposing forces on stage. Okay,   at this point you might have figured out what happened already, but it wasn't   until the two mafia groups decide to leave the premises to avoid uh, whatever   conflict there is inside...? Why is it so quiet? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, now for the   truth bomb. Realised how it's the ones being scammed together by themselves   again? That's how you know the heist has ended. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So, to end this talk,   speculation time. In case you didn't notice earlier like me, Liu was transported to not   Suzaku's place. As with how Makoto's side did that, I guess it shouldn't be   tough if he has enough control, but seriously, none of them have seasickness?   THEY WERE TRANSPORTED TO AN ISLAND FOR GOD'S SAKE I would've figured this scam long ago lmao. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (Sorry I just can't) So   that will explain a lot of things already, about how Chen cannot call upon his   reinforcements because they were LITERALLY IN AN ISLAND WITH A FAKE SKYSCRAPER   what the fuck ANYWAYS and that will bring us to the next point. (I guess   Makoto can change Ishigami's card when he's drunk) Secondly, why Eddie is   involved in this. What he said was probably true, proved innocent of his   trials using money he had leftover because why would you give   everything to scammers (lol), actually helped them put another layer to the   drama in the big room by letting Makoto gain control of the situation. To be   honest I don't see why this is necessary to scam two sides of mafia   considering the first part is impressive enough, but maybe Makoto really wants   to prove his point, as he talks about wining over Laurent on his revenge plan   for Dorothy. Nonetheless, really makes me wonder why then, but I guess we'll   know why soon. And lastly, why the plan's outcome was like this. You see, in   order to deal with two mafia groups in the East... <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> You have to use   some dire methods to make sure they cannot come after you again. Forever.   <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So yeah, I just didn't expect dumping them on an island was a   possible manoeuvre, but they did it somehow, so good for you, guys. Maybe   that's why Eddie is involved as he may  the manpower to do this. How they got   access to a remote island considering GPS coverage today, we may never know.   But yeah, because now the two sides' leaders are basically uncontactable,   maybe they can use this chance to really, wipe out both sides of the mafia.   Even if these four were to be able to return back to mainland, they will   probably find themselves with... nothing. Not even a stepson BOOM GOT HER.   <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> All in all, man GREAT PRETENDER you have surpassed yourself once   again, using tactics over tactics just to make sure two sides of mafia won't   be able to get you, this is the ultimate cover to what, even those Grand Theft   Auto heists which is nothing compared to this haha I'm tired&nbsp;   <div>    <div>      [I like to believe that Eddie did actually get out of the scam, and wanted       to ruin Laurent's group, so they counter offered him an actor's job in       this better than Hollywood drama finale (lmao) so he can get a piece of       the action. It's billions of dollars so it'll be worth it haha]     </div>    <div>      <div>        <div class="thumbnail">          <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">            <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">              <tbody>                <tr>                  <td style="text-align: center;">                    <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IvyMKlcnNi4/X9YbyVjuieI/AAAAAAABAPE/swmwwY40pp02nIurvt8xYgay7LxMxD9KACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender22_mafia3.jpg" width="320" />                  </td>                </tr>                <tr>                  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                    This episode in a nutshell haha like really man                   </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>          </div>          <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">            <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">              <tbody>                <tr>                  <td style="text-align: center;">                    <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-prTRwoiu77Q/X9Yb0FPsuTI/AAAAAAABAPI/pjXibfPu4WE_qHRYMzFZEIo80SNB-UyuwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender22_liu3.jpg" width="320" />                  </td>                </tr>                <tr>                  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                    Can confirm Liu is gay haha è¿™äººå¨˜ç‚®äº† lol                   </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>          </div>        </div>        P.S.

Haha I forgot about how bullshit is this series         already]<br />        <br />        <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="MajoTabi11">          <div style="text-align: center;">            <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Majou no Tabitabi</span>          </div>        </blockquote>        <blockquote class="tr_bq">          <div style="text-align: center;">            "Alright I don't look like a mage now" lol Elaina "I'm just an             ordinary, beautiful woman" O~kay haha it's like me when I think I'm a normie having a gf           </div>        </blockquote>        WHERE'S THE OPENING SERIOUSLY I MISS UEDA REINA-CHAN ALREADY Ah.         <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay I don't miss her but I foresee some rated stuff happening,         and if you read some interview with the author (sorry, lost the link), you might be on          something. In this new episode (#MajoTabi11) where Saya-chan if you         would fly a little lower that would be ideal because we can't show         panties here- Okay we know that's not the rated content this episode         haha. So, I guess this is a continuation episode from where Sheila         remembered what was in that box she gave Saya to deliver to the town         they both were at long time ago? Yeah, seems like it. So I guess we will         know what was in that box. Eh, turns out, it is indeed, the topic of our         conversation, to why it might be rated content again. It's not what you         think, I promise, but when you see a dog love a cat you'll start         thinking haha. So, story. Saya was out delivering a box, but the Curio         Company is back. Yeah, those guys that were supposed to be eliminated, I         guess they weren't apprehended to any extent so... they went scot free?         Haha, I have a harsh feeling the box was meant to solve the         Association's problem or something, but we'll ignore that and move to         the two. Saya was confronted by yes that leader, but in case         they can't just steal the box remember they had access to magical tools?         So yeah, it was a pair of pills, and when shot on two targets, will...         start guessing now because, switch bodies with each other. So of course         they had to make Elaina switch with Saya. Saya-Elaina now thinks she's         seeing Elaina which is herself lol, and Elaina-Saya... almost got violated by her younger         sister haha what. Would I call this the rated content though? Probably         not so let's take it as they wanted to squeeze in more content to make         this more complete an episode. So, the two probably figured out they         they switched bodies but you know not like Saya-chan will care (lol) but         just in case, they had to round all the bad guys up because of the box         that was opened. Yes, the box was just filled with smoke made of love         potions, as you can evidently see. (Man, imagine &lt;insert whoever I         like here&gt; was there when Elaina-Saya opened that box haha)         (<span title="*giggles*">ðŸ¤­</span>) The bad guys tell where their boss is because or else they         will really die, the two went there to apprehend her but also know they         had to deal with the chaos outside because despite the loving going on         and them switched bodies having to last for another day (did Saya-Elaina         finger herself for the night haha hey) (and then when they switched back         Elaina was actually very tired for some reason lmao) (sshh you didn't         learn these from me), and that's where Sheila and Fran had to appear.         Remember last episode where Sheila had to rush to Saya because she         predicted that box will be opened at some point? Surprisingly, none of         this was explained in this episode though as to why this is necessary,         and also how the Curio Company learnt of it. Nonetheless (the author did         say a lot of stuff was left out for the adaptation so) we just move on         to learn of the other truths, from Mina which was Saya's sister who left         her alone trying to become a witch some time ago if you recall, to both         Saya and Mina being Sheila's apprentices and it was also all because of         her in the first place. Blah blah blah be independent and all, but don't         ask me how Elaina just became someone's love rival lmao. All in all,         quite a lot to absorb, but it kind of makes sense besides that box         anyways so let's just see what's left to wrap up after that dialogue         between Foula (okay Fran you can drop the book reference) and Elaina so         let's assume Elaina will go back home for once. So far in this series I         must say the least they have done is to make me touched. So we shall see         about it, I guess.       </div>      <div>        <div class="thumbnail">          <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">            <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">              <tbody>                <tr>                  <td style="text-align: center;">                    <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WJFrO5Vkvy8/X9Ycvo4869I/AAAAAAABAPk/EzKURWcyGhI1bJMJLV7fuOkIM7eIANWDwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/majotabi11_saya5.jpg" width="320" />                  </td>                </tr>                <tr>                  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                    Me when I thought I saw someone I know but it's not lol                   </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>          </div>          <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">            <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">              <tbody>                <tr>                  <td style="text-align: center;">                    <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M8I7nrXLDN4/X9Yc96n5JKI/AAAAAAABAPo/Xm3paO_SoxQA3gnCTMBcR8a-h1I_3W4lgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/majotabi11_mina3.jpg" width="320" />                  </td>                </tr>                <tr>                  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                    This might be the worst of drawings in this series because                     either Mina has a wide forehead or                   </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>          </div>        </div>        P.S.

In this new         episode&nbsp;&nbsp;where you can never take a break being Chitose haha         God I wished Koko-chan was privately like this (#ToniKawa11) so spoilers         she's not she always does it for entertainment only btw (she be a drama actress before if I recall), I guess news         doesn't travel fast in this series huh. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Ah by the way, we got a         sponsor this week. This episode is sponsored by Street Fighter V- Some         people might already assume this blog is already earning money without any ads         here but I promise you. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So, how this dumb comedy series managed         to fit a gaming tournament into an episode. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Can they just stop         with the jokes I can't make this post too long you know haha. Okay I've         taken a break from the nonsense let's just talk about story. It's         literally just a party. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> I guess we have to talk about how that         happened, huh. Well, for starters, Chitose found out about the incident.         You know, that someone's place got burnt down and the manager is         building a replacement as we speak... she be looking at it, the not house haha. Tsukasa         tries to lie through her teeth because that sister of hers be an annoying kid         (lmao Koko-chan please no) but hey, they gotta bait her to not ask further or something.         Eventually, she found all of them - Nasa-kun and every woman in the         series - in the bathhouse lol did I mention this was a harem episode? I         mean, harem series. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Anyways, the trio from the mansion stepped         in, they found out of the truth, but you know, they would've left         without an explanation of living in someone else's roof as usual         especially Chitose, so they took a bath before having a sit-down. But         they were enjoying the bathhouse so much, we sure they be leaving that         5/5 Star review on Yelp- Yeah they forgot what they were here for again         lol this series. And then, because Nasa-kun dug through the old house by         the bathhouse they were living in. They found game consoles you probably         don't know of, and I agree gamer Tsukasa: we cannot live in a place         without the Sega Mega Drive if you live in the USA or Sega Genesis if         you live in Europe lol #90sConsoleProblems man you don't even know. (FYI         I had one at my place given from my mom's friend, probably in the storeroom now; I played a lot of         Golden Axe 2 and Bunny Adventures something haha) Okay jokes aside,         because most importantly, Nasa-kun found a         <a href="https://jisho.org/search/takoyaki" target="_blank">takoyaki</a>        plate, in case you also haven't seen one of those before where you live.         (Japanese food be popular here so I see those and eat those often haha)         And that's where Nasa-kun had an idea to have a         <a href="https://jisho.org/search/takopa" target="_blank">party</a> with         everyone to, you know, stop thinking about him for a while lmao. But as         you can guess, it's probably going to involve him considering they put         him up as the prize and the winner can do whatever with him lmao I want         him to die I'll join. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So they wiped up the PS* console up         (lol), set up whatever Street Fighter game people play now because why         would I play those fighting games, and it was a showdown between Chitose         who wasn't even a competitor when you compare with the likes of pro         gamer Tsukasa and professional game streamer and cosplay idol         <strike>Uesaka Sumire</strike> Aya-chan lol can we not glorify them too         much here. In revenge, Tsukasa let Aya play the first game of the (not         sponsored) series, and... well Aya-chan learnt fast though so thank goodness         I guess the final showdown was a tie so Nasa-kun was saved for now.         <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> All in all, LITERALLY JUST A PARTY EPISODE I am not even joking         right here and as entertaining as it is it's as if we forgot about         everything and just watched an Anime filler episode I'm pretty sure it         is but who cares now lmao. And I guess Tsukasa won since she got to         redeem her prize from her husband lol. Again, this is funny but also         totally lame af to watch I'm just like Chitose before she got bought in         by the bath and the cooking and the video games lmao. If you need an         Anime-watching experience equivalent, for me it's tsukkomi and this fabulous         cast I can't even. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So to end the series... They are ending the         series with someone falling sick? Okay haha cya guys for the final         episode then.       </div>      <div>        [TL:DR; Consider yourself a video game pro if you know how to win at         Minesweeper because many youngsters today don't.

Now you know too. In this new episode         (#AttackOnTitan61) where they think they can drop this fact on me so         I'll go nuts thinking about how is this possible instead of fighting the         Marleys who are still gaining an advantage using Titan powers, and to         also, appease its people of their military position in the world. So,         now that you know the summary, let's talk detail. And man, we need a lot         of context from previous seasons on this one. Firstly, after that small         war fighting we saw last week. Gabi was celebrated as a true hero to         have saved 800 of her own people, Reiner is still thankful for not dying         in that one fort of a war somehow. Galliard, which we did see fight         alongside the Armoured Titan which we know who it is now of course, was the         one who took Ymir's powers. Ymir, as you could recall, was a friend of         Historia, but also chose to protect her using her Titan powers instead         of harm her, though the latter was supposed to be the plan. RIP Ymir, I guess-         Okay she just returned the powers of the Jaw Titan. So yeah, a lot         happened in between when the two spies (or more to be honest) had left         and returned to Marley, their supposed home country. As you might have         recalled and we might need a little history lesson here, Eldians were         superior because of Titan powers for a while, but a faction of them         including royalty with the founding Titan powers left for an island to         "protect the Eldian race" if I didn't remember wrongly, but in revenge         the rest of the Eldians decide to fall on (or be forced on) Marley's         military powers at that time, thus the split. Then, we have to talk         about the loyalty of Eldians in the Marley state. I mean, if it's not         obvious enough, and if this doesn't remind you of the third Reich, you         might not have seen enough of history lessons haha. Anyways, these Titan         humans do not have their own power anymore, as they work and slave under         the lords who are Marley humans, so sometimes it's an issue if people         start to waver in times of war. Like how two Titans almost lost in that         one battle last week. So you see, there comes the problem of         questioning... well, anything in this series to be honest. Like how         inheriting Titan powers immediately reduces your life expectancy (refer         to Season 3 for this thanks) but then you gain the honour of inheriting         it for your fellow Eldians but maybe not because Gabi could be a good         housewife lmao. Okay, that future doesn't exist so might as well die a         Titan haha. But hey, someone can take her place before she gets it. Will         that happen though? Probably not Gabi might just die before I do haha.         Lastly, and I'm keeping this real short already, their plan going ahead.         Well, Marleys' plans going ahead. Since they literally can listen in to         their conversations you should know who on who, it's no surprise that         loyalty becomes quite important even if it means killing yourself         fighting in war using Titan powers or whatever. But as Zeke has already         pointed out seasons ago, they have to get the founding Titan powers to         regain supreme power and control of the Titan race, maybe also crush         Marleys then while they can but again, on the surface it is to buy time         so Marleys can improve their military prowess, but seriously though         where are those Titans which can fly haha okay me. All in all, very         information heavy episode, and we might get a couple more before the         real confrontation happens, and going by Reiner's dictation of the         people he met when he went there when he was 12... He might be out next         liability. The rest wouldn't though, and that would suck because we         could use more drama pivot points lol, but we shall see. In my opinion         though? I'm just expecting that flip where the Eldians in Marley do get         to take over the ones in that island, and then turn it on the world.         Maybe that'll be the best ending. If you liked Eren to live I'm afraid         to tell you that he'll probably not be living long anyways, but yeah,         he'll live. The rest would probably be burnt to death for betraying the         rest of the Eldian race lmao bye       </div>      <div>[TL:DR; Eccentric yet well-written worldview, don't you think?]</div><div>        <div class="thumbnail">          <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">            <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">              <tbody>                <tr>                  <td style="text-align: center;">                    <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1X2gKRtCgsA/X9bVEXiEu_I/AAAAAAABARA/mnBTYj-kWvEe2CEd0GDCk6ubTXr49TQeQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan61_friends1.jpg" width="320" />                  </td>                </tr>                <tr>                  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                    Man, I hope this scene and Reiner describing all of them to                     the family triggers somebody haha not me though                   </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>          </div>          <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">            <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">              <tbody>                <tr>                  <td style="text-align: center;">                    <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--oBSALlVT9M/X9bVEU11FEI/AAAAAAABARE/amiUPR_KRngQ-lw0VqZUWa22kx5SIiR9wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan61_friends2.jpg" width="320" />                  </td>                </tr>                <tr>                  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                    Man, I hope this scene and Reiner describing all of them to                     the family triggers somebody haha not me though                   </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>          </div>        </div>        P.S.

Wait,         what? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> You don't mean Marleys? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (Yes they were referring         to Eren and the others, as described by Reiner)<br />        <br />        <blockquote class="tr_bq">          <div style="text-align: center;">            <span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span>            <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>          </div>        </blockquote>        This week was not much of a week, but we did get a couple of songs out         of it.         <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A1%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AD%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%97/1541279718?l=en" target="_blank">yanaginagi's new album</a></b>        is... mostly pop like her previous albums, but maybe this one might have         too much of not her compositions, so I'm just giving them as I go.         Already on one and trying to give another. Both of them are not topic         songs though like         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFkli2XVdmY" target="_blank">that music video</a>        she released online recently after it released. Trust me listening to         her all these years:         <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1336623083550072832?s=20" target="_blank">her voice being unexpectedly cute</a>        is her selling point. Just listen to her         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LAD-zNMYsE" target="_blank">recent live video</a>        and you'll get what I mean. I also took some time to realise I should         have given         <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A8%E3%83%8A%E3%83%A9%E3%83%8A%E3%83%9F%E3%83%80-%E3%81%BB%E3%81%97%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8B%E3%81%91%E3%82%89-ep/1542184140?l=en" target="_blank">Spira Spica's new single</a></b>        because besides me listening to their album released earlier in the year         like a couple of months ago, this single is also unexpectedly good, so         I'm trying to forgive some melody flaws so I can actually credit them         for something this year maybe.<br />        <br />        On news concerning music on Twitter because that's all I care instead of         my friends talking about memes, freaking deja vu when I heard that one         <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1336625155427037185?s=20" target="_blank"><b>cover song by various female voice actors</b></a>        because ClariS covered that before and I guess it's a classic and also         good,         <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1337352093980454912?s=20" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia is doing a Christmas acoustic live</a></b>        yes for free on YouTube so yay,         <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1337004683311771648?s=20" target="_blank">SHE's new single</a>          is out next month</b>        and so far from the drama preview... it's not that great haha,         <b><a href="https://twitter.com/staff_azumi/status/1336324657687904264?s=20" target="_blank">Waki Azumi is releasing her first full album</a>&nbsp;in February</b>        and when I say that I meant TEN NEW SONGS by the way with no single         references and it's a real joke because the same music label invested so         much on her by also releasing         <a href="https://twitter.com/staff_azumi/status/1336324660674355201?s=20" target="_blank">a new lyric video</a>        which is animated by the way instead of         <b><a href="https://twitter.com/marika_staff/status/1335901886826758144?s=20" target="_blank">Kouno Marika's solo music debut</a></b>        in which         <a href="https://twitter.com/marika_staff/status/1335902379447734272?s=20" target="_blank">her first single</a>        is<b>&nbsp;</b>releasing in the following week which also means finally         she got her music debut like seriously it took so long, and         <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1336626646166589440?s=20" target="_blank">Natsukawa Shiina's new song</a></b>        which is also available on early full preview (just the topic song) is a         real meh considering who wrote it I expected more.<br />        <br />        So next week, yes I am going to listen to         <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/nanimono/1542860813?l=en" target="_blank">Polkadot Stingray's new album</a></b>        which is mostly just whatever they sing in digital singles over this         year, and trust me, I can still give them more songs haha. We just have         to see how many by next week.<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />I'm done for the week. Okay, besides Attack on Titan which I         promise I'll update tomorrow morning after enjoying breakfast like how I         do over the weekends normally: Starbucks. Come on, I'm not the only one         who likes to spend money on buying super expensive coffee even though we         know we can just buy cheap shit at home and it won't make a difference         haha that Mac and Cheese pie was GREAT lol okay. Cya guys next week         then, and until then... well at least I've got a 4-day work week next         week hey thank goodness they didn't remove my leave so that they can         rush up some tasks to be able to answer to the client in their meeting         on Tuesday morning haha hey don't blame me<br />              </div>      <div><br /></div>      <div>        P.S. Now that the calendar in my GitHub Page supports multiple series of         birthdays, I've included besides female voice actresses, two games I've         played with their characters so I can track them and know when to watch         their birthday videos first before I sleep lol it's more than just that         I promise you       </div>    </div>  </div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
