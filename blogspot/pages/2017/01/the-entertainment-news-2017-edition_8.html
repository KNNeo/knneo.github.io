Argh, having bad dreams every night now literally. Probably will change after tonight, but considering how little experience (or none) (lol) I have at work I hope tomorrow will be a good day. Or next week will be a good week. But in the world of entertainment, it will be. I assure me. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Sangatsu no Lion:</b> Damn this episode (12) is starting out strong with YUKI singing the opening theme song, I must say. Okay, theme songs aside first, the story itself. Kiriyama recovered from his flu from like, two weeks ago (it let me wait that long, okay?) and now we move on to his shougi matches. We have quite a clear path to what is happening, and that Kiriyama's fate may be to face of with someone he has, I would say, a physical woe, in place. Don't ask me what he did to Kyouka to deserve him getting beaten considering Kyouka loves a married man and Kiriyama just got dragged in to this somehow I guess, but still. We'll definitely hear of that b*tch again in future episodes, so that's something to (not) look forward to. Other than that, I can see why Kiriyama must ditch the warm live of the Kawamoto sisters, but then again he kind of has a reason. Remember the last time he was accepted into a family and he ruined it? Yeah. That's what I was thinking when Momo wanted him to stay over at night.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JqC2woAJo-E/WHGxw2iwI0I/AAAAAAAAc-Y/pIImFmzs05Eb2vTT0kiD8KJ-pvKfzzutgCLcB/s320/sangatsunolion12_cold.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I like how the author wants to make the poor kid get his cold back lol<br />Damn those word puns are forcefully bad. #throwback to Hatsukoi Limited for more</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Kiriyama Rei may be too kind, but that is also his strength. To be blessed with people who will help him along the way. Like his stepdad, or Akari-san.<br /><br />Also, <a href="http://randomc.net/2016/12/26/winter-2017-preview/" target="_blank">this season Anime</a> I intend to watch include (other than the above) ACCA (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/dqc4k7ZO1oo" target="_blank">awesome trailer theme song</a> you don't want to miss) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/iNBoRqmKJtM" target="_blank">Kuzu no Honkai</a> (just because of Anzai Chika probably and how different a romance plot it is to <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/33487/Masamune-kun_no_Revenge" target="_blank">that revenge one</a> lol), both which are airing next week. Their source material manga have completed, so we will likely have determined endings to watch. This season in Anime is looking good.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Konobi:</b> This new chapter (47) which I somehow had a peek when they mentioned on their Twitter that an online raw version is out, but hey, it's Colette-chan yet again! This time, the topic is recycling. For weirder reasons than ever, like "I haven't finished my drink" and "a poster of white space" kind of weird. Then again, she meets a familiar person who teaches her about some eco. That usual Colette makes me think how perfect Sumipe is the voice actor for her role, really.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eac96b1MTVc/WGsS2OOysII/AAAAAAAAcic/CA95uZYbY4gt137OjVinN_AE5aNO19KfACLcB/s320/konobi47_ecoman.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="310" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Clumsy Colette-chan, or failed second prototype?<br />It's up to you to decide which is funnier haha</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Nagasarete Airantou:</b> And there it is. A monster. A youkai. I don't know what. But now I do. An ancestor is back. That doesn't sound like good news for the previous chapters up till this one (149) that I probably dislocated already, but still. Ikuto got his senses back, and likely the "old lady" wants to test him by kidnapping his two dearest females in his life. (It's like she knows lol) Well, at least, on this island for now. This might get a little interesting if I can piece the story together (damn scans took a long time), so we shall see that for ourselves.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="228" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iOma-6go7UU/WGztBF_NgpI/AAAAAAAAc08/Rj_Hcn-Wmf4Dl1gszzuCGxfdE2o66MAewCLcB/s320/airantou149_16.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Well that's a prank you will play on the Northern leader if you have guts.<br />Or if you're as good as this kid lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well this one is going to be tough. I have not been listening to songs for half the week, there aren't any live performance sources I can watch from last year now (forum user RIP), so I decided to use Apple Music to some extent. As will be mentioned in another review I'll do in about two months time lol, Apple Music gave me access to many artists that I have not yet been able to just because the Internet doesn't like it. <b>LILI LIMIT's new album</b> came into scope this week, and I only gave one song, but I guess besides the topic song there are some good ones in their latest EP, so I'll give that a chance or two soon. <b>Tsuzuri Zukuri's music library</b> is now open to me, so I gave their previous albums a listen too. <b>Goose house's new single</b> which shall be the first release of 2017 (as of Klassic Note at least) isn't that disappointing, and what's better is that their new album is not far away too.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point. This month may not be much in Klassic Note, and releases will only start appearing near the end of the month and next month, but the good news is a lot of them are albums from artists I've been listening to for the past few years, which is no doubt good news. It may not be much now, but still.<br /><br />Also, I've been playing games from Japan lately and one which had a theme song probably will be on my list soon. Hey, who can resist a good pop song, yes? I guess, but then again it's also because the source is available... I guess? Damn, I guess I'm not feeling right...<br /><br /><br />Cya guys next week then, where everything will be better by then. Until next time... I wish for my wait of time to be liberated. Soon. Really, it's just all me. I'm not in the mood to do anything. See? I can't even finish Chapter 16 as promised. Well, that one, I think I'm stuck. And I'll need a lot of thinking to see the story flowing logically again. I can't say much, but it's all a setup in a new arc, yes? See you all next Sunday.<br /><br />P.S. I'm also considering preparing for Klassic Note 10th anniversary (if you've heard about it on Twitter) by releasing posts every week to talk about various stuff I experienced and have gone through these years being an audience in the Japanese music industry. I wanted to start soon but we shall see. We're not in a rush here if I want to write quality posts haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
