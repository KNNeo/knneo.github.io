I have to play Secret Santa this year again with my colleagues because they wanted to, and thanks to whatever Google Pay vouchers they refuse to give me anything relevant to my life, I can actually use these to buy a better gift over the budget to whoever the recipient is, so I'm good with that decision making haha. Also buying using the same way to get more discounts for my sis' birthday so happy birthday in advance lmao I hope you like cold brew <div><br /></div><div>  In more great news, the package (for last month) is finally complete! Yeah, so   let's hope for a Christmas miracle where I can review this box AND do that   last Klassic Note Review of the year by this year haha this one might be   rough. We shall see. I don't believe in Santa so who knows what will happen at   the customs lol this is not Australia our local post office isn't that clogged   and yes we will talk about the rough process of procuring all these stuff on   the actual post itself don't you worry </div><div><br /></div><div>  So yeah, Anime and music this week then! I'm going to have quite a day after   this where I have used, mind you, Google Reserve in where I live ie. partnered   with local reservation services here, to reserve a family dinner tonight in   celebration of my sis' birthday in 2 days because who celebrates birthdays on   weekdays lol so yeah, I just hope it doesn't eat in to the quality of this   post haha it won't I promise<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KomiSan10">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Komi-san wa, Komyushou Desu.</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "We will just work hard normally" Yeah something Tadano would say but       really though, who works hard at sports festivals? Haha LOSER lol I sound       like Nakanaka     </div>  </blockquote>  Aw yes another stereotypical scene for all school-based Anime, we have the   sports festival! This is where we see people fail and then get encouraged to   run to the finish line, right? Not with this series, you don't. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Because in this new episode (#KomiSan10) of the series, we got more jokes than   your average romance or high school series so throw those series you know off   the shelf, because this is going to redefine your experience, believe me.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, first we talk about the sports festival. It's so typical I guess   we don't have to explain much, but at least the rules are always different so   in this case it's the super typical class competition so uh... it's the same   lol. What's not the same though, is that they award points unfairly for flair,   so Komi-san's perfect exercising on the field and Agari-chan's jump with her   huge rack... Yeah, those. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> That's how you know it's different. What   else is different is the introduction of senpais in this series, namely super   cool and on fire and portable built-in infrared thermometer 2nd year senior   (lol) Netsuno Chika lol you can figure this out yourself, because she is   always on a fever. Of course, I promise you when she sees me she'll have the   same reaction as seeing cold-blooded Komi-san at first, and then when I see   Komi-san cheering for me I'll just boil up and run across the field like a   cheetah and then panting like Tadano lol no really personal experience   included in this run and don't ask me who made me run that fast. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Not   going to explain the judges because they are literally just there to make   things interesting, but amongst the seven events the classes have to compete   in for points, Komi-san's presence in the class for things like tug of war are   the worst, Tadano is the most popular guy to ask for things including his hair   lol Yamai-san, and Makeru-chan lost. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last one probably not true since   class competition, but you know, she has to lose somehow haha. Yes, the   typical fall over and comeback story is probably the thing Komi-san had to   experience for herself, seeing everyone is cheering for her and she can't do   much shouting herself lol maybe someday then. Tadano got the hint from your   lip sync. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Next up, and I can't believe I can quote MOSHIMO on every   Anime and I think I've done the most from them so far lmao, it's jealousy   time! Haha aw man I regret giving   <a     href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en"     target="_blank"     >that one song</a   >  lol. How that can happen though can be likely seen from Tadano's increasing   workload as class chairperson, most likely due to the crazy demands and   feedback from the class probably about how great Komi-san is (and dude Tadano   can come up with a list himself too so), but also because Najimi as vice is   not helping much, what a surprise. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cue new character to save this   poor bloke's life Nene-san, who is basically to him the nicest person in class   mainly because she represents the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">onee-san</a>  personality, so can't help but take care of   normal-person-who-has-a-jealous-classmate Tadano on his workload. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   Who turns out probably might be the only one who can control   <strike>her</strike> <strike>him</strike> <strike>it</strike> them. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Man Najimi, can we get a check on your actual gender, please? Language is such   a b*tch lol. Anyways, this new girl can see clearer than even Yamai-san who   only sees Komi-san as a goddess haha, but yeah, besides thinking that Tadano   is a masochist amongst other things lol, on the journey of helping the class   chairperson out she also noticed Komi-san's... let's just say worry because   every time is a death stare lol, of having Nene-san in Tadano's social circle,   if I were to put this nicely. But yeah, we know, or she knows, and so Nene   just chose to leave those two alone just as any nice elder sister character   would. Really, best girl in class lol SHE is the class goddess lmao. Last but   not least, let's take ourselves some   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/purintoshi-ru" target="_blank"     >photo stickers</a   >! Says Komi-san enthusiastically to Tadano just because it's really meant to   be two people, but yeah eventually it became four and I'll let you guess who   the other two are without looking at the video haha, but suffice it to say   besides playing around with Komi-san on the photo and/or her nonchalant face   during the photo-taking session in the booth, Komi-san herself was more keen   on the other things in the arcade they were in, specifically that one crane   game with a keychain she seems to want. Or at least, Tadano thinks she wants.   He probably didn't take 200 tries to get that, but Komi-san did get Najimi to   bring her there again, so exchanging gifts when it's not Christmas time is   probably the way to go now that they got it for the wrong reasons. I mean, if   you are a couple that is!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah hey, all in all, great episode   highlighting the social circle of Komi-san and her class AND her progression   with Tadano as a.... prospective romance partner?? Uh oh, I shouldn't have   said that haha let's see if there is actually something up by the end of this   series hehe don't second guess this Anime they cannot disappoint you now lmao   I sound like a Yamai-san </div><div>  [TL:DR; "Komi-san, let's cheer on for everyone in class!" Ah Najimi about   that... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="180"                 data-original-width="320"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgtZhfVym56WNcwrOHWAOmpQS2jQTHfasmYwx7cUOkWaHfiH7v0ueV-aCv_dJhx7FjqnFDfRdKLHZCC1fU2vbp6_XnSrZha5Z92DefVEDfpHnuLq79BANygDm4G2WsFj7iavWZAO8Hdv4P21kpOgo6LNxgB8LGpPaGKRUOp_6uvCZNCDcRYN7X-Hcjs"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This is replacing all ricardoFlick emotes on Twitch lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="180"                 data-original-width="320"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjkeOR7rQtPoVovdcHWGx1TwC7S0fZ9y39nCA-TB-wZbPw3Q-0MUN3x-hRDxF7duBK76ghjaMxq6q6icX7I7n7kHQW0owbZ4C3wy3AfadW0xWUMkLThBEjCDXGMty7iK6ujBHFIConBFDwA9AaexHdbT6FSmUcrjy7yUQYnK-115hERY9uNlPXmuYnj"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              The power of love baby haha<br />(Ah, I wish I have that now)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

And what   a cliffhanger! Okay, leave that aside first, let's talk about visiting   the&nbsp; &nbsp;old friend. In the letter that Yuzuki received regularly from   her friend back in school don't ask me where the other two schoolmates were   lol, but I suppose they are focusing on this one because somehow she already   is pregnant without getting married and at the same age as Yuzu herself, is   moving to Kyushu soon to live with the husband. Man, that's a thing in 1920s   Japan lol. It's so bizarre even Tamahiko allowed the wife to go visit her   friend for perhaps the last time, but still, the worries of lacking each   other's support seemed to worry Yuzuki, but I would argue that Tamahiko can   take care of himself considering he's no Mr. Depression no more, but she still   asked for help from Aya-chan to help with the meals of this one-armed bloke   before she left for Tokyo. Such a good wife, isn't it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And soon   Yuzuki was in Tokyo, spending a day with the friend and talking about their   lives so far. Midori was glad that despite whatever they may have done I don't   even know how you can do the thing without being REALLY sexually attracted to   each other lmao <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, had to get the fiancé to apologize to her whole family   tree for his doings, actually got around it to allow the approval of such a   marriage in the first place. Like really, if it's in China good chances you're   going to drown in a pig's cage. Yes, all three of you. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, creepy   punishment stuff aside, the couple got lucky and so is Yuzuki, and all is well   in the day they spent time together in the city. But it's good to realize and   if you wonder when I teared up, it's bizarre to think of them in school   thinking about their futures, and then honestly saying, living close to what   they probably dreamt of today, having great prospective partners and living   the life though in different directions or circumstances. Such is life much   worth of envy especially if we are talking about 1920s Japan where   discrimination and privilege is still a big thing back then. And boy did I   jinx this since I wrote this part earlier lmao don't ask, we have something to   change the tides. If you don't need me to spoil you on this please stop right   here and watch it for yourself, I almost forgot Japan has earthquakes lol. No   really, go check out Japan's track record for this earthly phenomenon, because   considering earthquake-proof structures weren't a thing a century ago, one can   already guess what that will do to Tamahiko's mansion and the village. And cue   Mr. Depression again since this dude can't help anyone for sh*t and only can   think about bad things that can happen to Yuzuki who is still right now,   probably stuck in Tokyo. But instead of being emo and being sad and after   seeing what was in his wife's room, next episode we going to Tokyo to find   Yuzuki and ensure her safety?? lol serious talk though am I going to read next   episode and say the train broke down?

Man, the shows I gave this season are so good I can only *chef's   kiss* haha let's talk about it. Firstly, Sakurai got fat. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, I'm   going to get punched by her so let's get this over quick haha. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>   Kazama felt the force. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well twice including Natsumi which one should   expect in the later part so go figure haha, but yeah, he be weak to huge racks   lmao bro me too man. Meanwhile as Sakurai is going on a diet, Takeda is eating   the heck out of it to get bigger, namely whatever buns that Itomaki owner   decided to do because he's bored with ramen lol, but what's not expected is,   and as you might see this is technically also a character focus episode,   Tsukishiro joined in on the fun seeing that whoever wins in a showdown against   someone else ie. Takeda is the other dude in the shop, gets to eat for free.   Don't worry they concluded this real quick, so just take a guess at who won   lol I can't believe I should say this but Tsukishiro be cute? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey not   on me but Futaba did just witness them talking happily about what happened   that day. Can we just, just... Futaba stop bringing in the   <a     href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%9B%BB%E5%85%89%E7%9F%B3%E7%81%AB%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%83%BC/1450928093?i=1450928094&amp;l=en"     target="_blank"     >j-j-j-jealousy</a   >!!&nbsp;<span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (I promise you this is the last of it this year we hit the   quota for all three shows this season already lmao) But real talk though,   Tsukishiro is not that kind of competition, Futaba. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, moving   on, probably the highlight of this episode as started from Yuuto, we play   basketball. Kazama spotted the new basketball club member practicing on his   own, and decided to help him out. Don't ask what is the motivation for that   <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Sakurai haha, but you know, it eventually became like a somewhat date   kind of thing because the girl decided it'll be a good time to show off her   cooking to Kazama or something and Yuuto don't go telling others you like   cooking that is not very manly lol sorry for the discrimination. Anyways,   playing amongst themselves is no fun according to Yuuto which the sister   should later put blame on lol, he invited Natsumi who then invited the rest of   the gang to play ball, and that's where Kazama did the penalty with Natsumi   because they can play against each other without a winner for hours, and   Sakurai is taking that as a personal penalty. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah I love this series,   so many layers haha. The guys ended up with a bath and some cold milk which I   must say I should experience that someday, and the MVP couple (lol) had some   alone time because Sakurai wanted to. Haha selfishness for the win, I guess.   <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All in all, you know, we don't have sports festival but we have   this, so I guess it's good enough? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I'm so sorry for all the   references but as you can see I treat all the shows I watch every season as   being in the same world lol. It's still an awesome episode though, all the   short jokes lol Futaba don't hit me and romance things are landing perfectly   and as expected, so I can only watch and giggle at all this drama. What else   can there be between these people after we've reached the peak with Kazama's   boob <strike>censor</strike> sensor and Takeda's large- large physique? Haha   we can only watch on to find out.&nbsp; </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh407-vSaxSVwzgA6fzxuoF3rwxvnvu8O31P-ZovmgkBFzLbKapOEjdcTHVIaZ8AkiSxkklK1VwgQhChh-d3lr09B3_-fRRXUrtFodnKYDcgmrfWd6YHlsJCUSCABL8_EfPI9cL2CQBm_xRTbcThS1aNO816JX5QPHoU6Gwfaq0OxM0KkKd4iXDeb0f=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              #AnimeWithoutContext<br />(MFW I see ripped dudes lol I don't care               tbh)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi3R2xYeSQrTsxIKe2EKpXeMqbpl4n9oFco9M2ehEOh5RexfuTJMNyJuk5KoPIE6NJlaNSfxDnhIyE23-mA2wyyuRBgNIlDXtJYnbB9OTEYxc4-KYsHWcQdHFrLHiIkXHMK-MLg59N3K2fTSHRHq_L2Ubgr-jjLPVJKCTVuLYKMyCvQjyyDzCfRZ2Bd=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              #AnimeWithoutContext<br />(Kazama with the astronomy lessons lmao)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="180"                 data-original-width="320"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhKdck9Lhd6DgS9Sqc2Bqd5quHEDk_rhfBdOGLUSqyanpJPsWyixIiDH75xVR2l_hxK4-uyuZKEA5Pc9A9dB4lf5xQ9KL6ntWmTM5ktHl3aLXq8pNrAtpVu_o9f0BGKfZPjJd593i467GXvUAs-sIQ5ORdzSBC3lfnqmtnH59pH733ZpfL2DPE6I6ul"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This series in a nutshell haha Futaba is great             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  <div>    P.S.

Thankfully, they do NOT make of another Klassic Note Review due to the insert   song being released as a digital single away from the other song so thank   goodness. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> </div><div>  <br />  On news related to music and it's on Twitter and I missed some from last week   so let's make sure we put that in,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1466739599536193543?s=20"       target="_blank"       >Ryokuoushoku Shakai is releasing a new album</a     ></b   >  end of next month and I can't believe I missed this last week,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/non_dayo_ne/status/1467449310585704452?s=20"       target="_blank"       >Sambomaster's new song will be for a movie</a     ></b   >  after celebrating their 15th anniversary live, on   <a     href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1467830736820772864?s=20"     target="_blank"     >Monday's livestream</a   >  where she just ate fried chicken for 5mins (lol) it was announced that   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1467826624813203457?s=20"       target="_blank"       >Natsukawa Shiina's 2nd album will be released in two months</a     ></b   >  and yes if "Pre-2nd" isn't a hint since last year you gotta wonder, but also   they are releasing live video footage from that very live from this year for   the whole of next month every week until the album release, I'm always in with   more   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/honkidance/status/1468204369086943232?s=20"       target="_blank"       >Yoru no Honki Dance live video on YouTube</a     ></b   >, following the   <a     href="https://twitter.com/takagi3_anime/status/1468958614425530374?s=20"     target="_blank"     >third season announcement airing in January</a   >  and likely focusing on the final year of their middle school life,&nbsp;<b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/takagi3_anime/status/1468960879395803147?s=20"       target="_blank"       >Ohara Yuiko's new song will be for Anime "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san"</a     ></b   >  which no doubt will pad the ending songs with more character sung covers like   the previous two seasons,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1469275714205663236?s=20"       target="_blank"       >THE ORAL CIGARETTES will be streaming a live audio album next week</a     ></b   >  from the members' favourite picks,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/lucklife_info/status/1469321002056237058?s=20"       target="_blank"       >LuckLife's newest music video</a     ></b   >  isn't something I gave from the album so welp,&nbsp;<b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/kusoiinkai/status/1469623181556486148?s=20"       target="_blank"       >Kuso Iinkai's new music video</a     ></b   >  made me wonder how much I have missed them because apparently not lol,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1469864590091694081?s=20"       target="_blank"       >Amamiya Sora's new song trailer</a     ></b   >  is written by yours truly reached the first chorus I would hardly call it a   trailer haha, and as a surprise on her live tour   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1470022557353263105?s=20"       target="_blank"       >miwa announced a new album releasing in two months</a     ></b   >&nbsp;and in nearly five years but will now be competing with two OTHER   albums released on that date which I will have to review. Man, I wonder who is   going to win lol all of them lost already right? I mean, what are the chances   miwa is going to win? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh miwa-san...<br />  <br />  So next week is our last break of the year, and I can't tell you how much I   want to shift Kuso Iinkai and tacica's new releases a week earlier but hey,   it's them who are at a disadvantage not me so I'll probably try to look   through the song awards while I have the time then. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> The new songs in   recent weeks aren't going to cut it anyways so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />And... I'm done with the week. Today was quite an evening haha because I   used all my energy to go shopping with my sis and then having dinner with the   family near the seaside which thank goodness right choice for choosing that   restaurant just that we had to wait for the last main dish to appear for like   20mins and <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cya guys next time then, and until next time... I'm trying   to digest my excessive tea from the dinner while drinking more bottled tea   from the shopping trip earlier so... ask me when I'll sleep tonight lol ugh my   head hurts haha bye </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. I can't believe she didn't even notice this and even praised the   cameraman (thanks Sashide Maria haha <span title="*thumbs up*">👍</span>) because despite   <a     href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_1016/status/1470027614111039491?s=20"     target="_blank"     >redoing</a   >  her tweet   <a     href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_1016/status/1470028537906491405?s=20"     target="_blank"     >TWICE</a   >  she still hasn't noticed how I would know that   <a     href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_1016/status/1470027347999211525?s=20"     target="_blank"     >Kitou Akari was wearing black lingerie</a   >  during that Anime livestream just now <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Don't tell her, yes?   <i>2nd image</i> <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really I woke up enough to finish doing this post   lmao </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
