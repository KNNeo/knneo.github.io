<h2>The Klassic Note Review – 2014.10 Issue 2</h2>
Probably the last one this month. Unless I go crazy again over upcoming singles. Means it may still be possible. FML.<br /><br />Also because of a certain delay that I shall not bore you with (I think I shall anyway):<br /><img alt="" border="0" height="347" src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/-wyzIL3opv-k/VEUwTt-CHlI/AAAAAAAAKpA/kS7iWleVjaY/order20141oct%25255B5%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="640" /><br />Focus here!<br /><img alt="" border="0" height="240" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-9y9sed6Muw0/VEUwUV3kUEI/AAAAAAAAKpI/Tvtrbhywrkw/order20141oct_zoomin%25255B6%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="360" /><br />There writes “Will Be In Stock (On) 2nd November 2014”. Yes, that is why I shall do it now. Not next month.<br /><br />And of course if you managed to read what I’ve ordered, is pretty much what I’m covering today. Three singles. Two new singles and one… I guess is a consequence of <a href="http://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-revolutionary-decision.html">this effect.</a>This is going to be long, so let’s get started. I want to sleep. *flips over format used for review*<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Ikimono-gakari – Netsujou no Spectrum/Namida ga Kieru Nara [Single]<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="316" src="https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/16/ESCL-4283.jpg?v=1" title="" width="320" /></div>(Cover image WTF?? My mind is going crazy already…)<br /><br />Origin: If you think it’s the first time I reviewed them, please (after this of course) go to the tags below and click on “Klassic Note”, and probably covers their other single from the year. Ever since that in July this year, also with this too, kick starts their activity this year. With another single and an album slated for release for the next two months till the end of the year, I couldn’t ask for more. Because I have more than enough of their wonderful songs, and if you like them, you know how great it&nbsp; is to listen go the style over and over again. Also, this one came earlier in the news as the opening theme song for Anime “Natatsu no Taizai” (hey if you watched and think it’s nice, I just didn’t watch it LOL). Since they are no strangers, let’s dive in.<br /><br />(1) Netsujou no Spectrum [Spectrum of Passion]<br />The songs in this single are primarily composed by the other guy Mizuno, rather than the hot favourite Hotaka, (you think I know who’s more popular??) this song delivers a mote wild feel and energetic mood to it, as with fitting into the Anime too, whichever one is his priority, I don’t know. What I do know is that it’s a great upbeat song, sure to keep you guys listening due to a catchy chorus. The music video features the trio “in black and white for the first time” (I didn’t say that) and I guess that’s a first. Looks cool though, I must say. Just your average Ikimono song well packaged.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Namida ga Kieru Nara [If Tears Disappear]<br />The reason for (probably) the delay in the order is about this song. Taking the emotional side, and written – as mentioned – by Mizuno, the second of this double A-side takes a turn with the other two writing the lyrics together. (don’t mind the romantic insinuations here) (not like I’m doing it) Not that I’m implying anything (there I go again), but then what comes out of this song is the smoothness of Kiyoe’s voice, and with every other song you would’ve heard form them this is just perfect. Not to say about Kiyoe’s contributions in the group is increasing significantly in recent years. And as an active promoter of self-production of music, this just gets nicer. I’m not crying yet, though.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: All in all a pretty single well done, whichever comes first. And if you’re a fan of Ikimono, this is just another single. If you’re not a fan of Ikimono, it’s time to give chance. They are great, they are popular (at least within Japan), they are (in style) mainstream pop, so unless you listen to stupid techno (Oops), this is worth the listen. I’m not talking about those stupid Anime fans (Oops x2) who buy the single just because it’s a featured song in the show. I won’t.<br /><br /><br />You can just treat me as being lazy and not splitting this into parts, but if I were to you can read the one above and subsequent empty spaces as separate articles, ok?<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Taketatsu Ayana – Kajirikake no Ringo [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/15/12/PCCG-1427.jpg?v=3" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/14/47/PCCG-70222.jpg?v=3" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Regular Edition]</td></tr></tbody></table>(Why does only the Regular Edition have the Anime cover? Which brings me back to the last paragraph before we started.)<br /><br />Origin: She’s a voice actor in Japan. She’s a singer. She has photobook and image DVDs. She’s… awesome. Not that I say it, but Taketatsu Ayana (Ayachi for short) has been in the singer industry since two years ago, and sadly I cannot show you anything else besides this, where I got her first three singles.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en">Klassic Note fact: Recent singers (I could hardly call them artists) who got their first three CDs on my shelf <a href="http://t.co/vuJDxA5TUf" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/vuJDxA5TUf</a><br />— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/441238496993239040" target="_blank">March 5, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> (It’s the first row, by the way)<br />And since that, nothing. Not until her latest and 6th single in her career comes by. Boasting with an Anime theme song credit for the first time in her career, and with songs that resemble the good old times, how can I say no? <strike>Which brings me back to</strike> Yes if you like her, you’ll take a listen or even grab a copy of the CD. But if you don’t, there still is reason why you should “take a chance”. (Oops miwa reference)<br /><br />*A good reminder: Brackets in translation square brackets mean insinuated meaning. Don’t ask me why. Part of Japanese grammar.<br /><br />(1) Kajirikake no Ringo [(The) Bitten Apple]<br />As a first impression, this song turned out better than expected. I first started out with this:<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en">The difference between Ayachi now and back when she started? She didn't act cute. You can't hear it, but I can. <a href="http://t.co/qTTgQ0vjSv" target="_blank">http://t.co/qTTgQ0vjSv</a><br />— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/507929897772150785" target="_blank">September 5, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> But then after some time as I recall from the past times I enjoyed listening to her cute voice, then I noticed this is actually a good song. Even more surprising when you hear the full song. Also this is credit to an Anime “Denkigai no Honya-san” (I watch that show, you guys should know) (wow rhyming), so this is quite a good song considering that. (Don’t start me explaining this, please.) The song is pretty well done, with the same guy who composed songs from… places I don’t recall. Must be reputable people, haha. Also quite an upbeat song, it brings quite a sentimental feel while bringing the overall feel for the show, and her too. The music video… since it’s fanservice I think I shouldn’t even mention much. The scenery is great though, although you know I don’t focus on that.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Fuai! [No Translation (and that is not the song title) (and this is not insinuated)]<br />Hmm… how should I describe this… It’s another lively song, but put in a different feel. You would, for first impression, notice the rather noisy (in terms of sound, not like, irritating) chorus and violin addition to a song which could do well with neither of those, but then I like Ayachi’s voice with this combination, so I decided to give it in the end. Easy chorus, well done song. Yes it may be more of love for her than for the song, but if you listen, it’s like another shout-out song with a nice twist. And I appreciate that. And this is also revealed in the tracklist of her second album.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: Now you know why I am reluctant. Ended up it’s another 4-star single. And 4-star single to me is NOT ENOUGH! But it’s enough for now, especially when it’s been some time since I have given some time for Ayachi’s songs, and coincidentally (almost in a straight line) they line up and I have the mood to listen to two lively songs which made my last week. Really, Ikimono is nothing when you have idolism… Okay seriously, if you dislike her, it’s also worth a listen.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">ONE MORE!</span><br />(Wow look at the time…)<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Kon Natsumi – Niji no Kakera [Single]<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img height="316" src="https://www.animate-onlineshop.jp/resize_image.php?image=05021543_53633e885855c.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none;" width="320" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div>(The cover? Why not refer to… seriously.)<br /><br />Origin: Wow. It’s been some time. Of course this single definitely takes credit from its credited Anime “Isshuukan Friends.”, and as good as the show, Kon Natsumi is here to sing some great songs. Or well-written songs. Her voice is great too, I must say, for a… face that will lose to both girls in the previous two singles. (Oops x3) However, there is something that sounds great – maybe it’s Kawashima Ai who is backing her up – which is why I gave the thumbs up. Why the decision to get five months later? Not because of the special gifts, but you know where I’m going to refer you to if I<br /><br />(1) Niji no Kakera [Fragments of (The) Rainbow] *still checking whether I reviewed this or not*<br />Okay, let’s talk about it. Recalling from five months ago, my first impression from the Anime isn’t bad at all. And as with all Anime I watch if I give the show probably also means I give one, if not both, opening and ending theme songs. And being the frontline, Kon Natsumi here does a great job of delivering a good song. And I like it. Not so much about the music video though; it has her footage. (Oops x4) (I’m seriously not getting bored here) (And I’m supposed to not comment too much too) All in all, something not to get bored to. Especially when you like the show. There’s a friend of mine who is not willing to read the Mange after the show ended just because there’s no music in it. See? The power of theme songs.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Gift<br />Ha yes finally the whole point of this post. The spotlight, and probably why I feel so hesitant to <strike>touch her</strike> No, not that. I mean, press the button seeing it as an Anime cover. (This is the last time I’m saying it already, I swear) This<br />is<br />one<br />good<br />song.<br />Why? The catchy tune will be the first to grab anyone’s attention, and finishing the song the first time I totally remember the feel of satisfaction as if the song as this click with me. Nicely arranged song overall, and if you do follow my Twitter she got in the trend for like… a few months? Even the most recent one is within a month, I think. So much so it’s worth remembering. And recalling. Really. Don’t get deterred by the Anime credit. Listen to it.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average++)<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall a good single for someone I have not listened to and being an Anime theme song credit, I must say this is one good… I’m running out of words to say already. Really, if you don’t like mainstream, and if you don’t like cute voices but still can listen to females singing, this is the decision. Do it. And really sometimes, the B-sides always stand out more than the A-side, ie. Never judge a book by the cover. Or a CD cover. Or if the CD cover is replaced with Kon Natsumi’s face. Really, JFGI.<br /><br /><br />Okay, that’s all. Short ending here. With regards to the singles arriving at my doorstep not anytime soon, I will post the reviews as long as I can grab my hands on it besides notes and textbooks preparing for my exams by then. Until next time… I’m working hard to find more songs. So I can spend my own money away and waste more time typing this. No really, it was a joy, if not for a tight mood schedule. Cya.<br />[P.S.: What? My mood schedule? I can tell you now: Tomorrow’s going to be bad, that is why I’m doing it today.]<br /><br /><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
