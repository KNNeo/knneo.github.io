And what happened? I clicked on the order button, along with SID’s new single, that’s what happened…<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Yanagi Nagi – Mitsuba no Musibime [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/21/GNCA-325.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/22/GNCA-326.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Regular Edition]</td></tr></tbody></table>(I know; I can’t really see the difference either…)<br /><br />Origin: Well this single was to be credited on Anime “Nagi no Asukara” (if you didn’t watch it’s about time you should, it’s great show) as its second Ending Song (yesh second, means you missed the first by the same person last year) and I had an impression of Yanagi Nagi last year with her single “Aqua Terrarium”. Unfortunately her composition skills did not get to me and I left out her only creation in her previous three-track single. But not this time. I intend to give this more chance and given it’s also one of the singles on my birthday week (if I’m mentioning this a lot of times please don’t mind me nagging) so this brings more meaning as I go along.<br /><br />Verdict: As I’m willing to be more open for creativity, the impression of this single surprises me well with the complete A-side song and two short and unique B-sides in terms of the indie style I rarely get to hear. More explanations below.<br /><br />(1) Mitsuba no Musubime [Knotting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptotaenia_japonica">Musubime</a>]<br />An emotional song which can be related to the show itself, talking about people binding together as with the lyrics. The full song is as decent as the 90-second preview I get to hear for the past few weeks, and is not anything disappointing, just like the Opening by Ray. PV does not really help deepen the impression of the song, but the mood of the song is pretty well displayed in the video, and I swear I saw that painting of wings before. Mina-chan might give you guys a hint.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-SLY7Ivbm6w8/UwH_gPgw8rI/AAAAAAAAHO0/yDFw8OQx9aQ/musubime%25255B4%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="137" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="242" />RATING: 4 Stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Intention Propellant<br />Started a little hesitant to give this, but hearing it again gives a different view on this song. It’s a little sci-fi, as if you understood the lyrics or even bother to find out what “sputnik” is in its lyrics (written by Yanagi Nagi herself, lyrics only anyway) is about departing into space. And then suddenly the title makes sense, along with the image it intends to present. And since the song is short and simple, it’s even easier to absorb, especially for someone like me who takes a lean to this type of songs once in a while, or actually it’s once in quite a while. Nice song, really.<br />RATING: 4 Stars (Average)<br /><br />(3) unjour<br />Yesh people, why I hesitate to write this yesterday is due to this song, also a short song entirely done by Yanagi Nagi herself. Let’s just say this song overall has a mood that is entirely in its own realm, and that’s why I’ve been holding to this song and finding its plus points, in contrast to the one I hear from her previous single. This song stood better chance too, as it is simple, though complicated is its mood. Not some song I’ll recommend to anyone, but it’s good, for me. It’s that kind of melody I’ll think of when I run out of songs to listen, really.<br />RATING: 4 Stars (Average) (on the lower end though)<br /><br />Conclusion: A-side pretty expected, did not expect to pick up the two B-sides too, but now I can say this is actually a full 4-stars single. Not very often seen as three songs in my list needs to be exceptionally impressive, and normally includes a 5-star song (Rie fu’s single “For You”). But this, this is just another 4-star single, which means I’ll take a listen if I were you. Even Yocchan’s single is less worth the listening.<br /><br />~Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br />[P.S.: Oh yesh the Tokuten (special gift), the Tokuten… (Audience: You just want the picture of the girl, don’t you…) Not really, but who can resist a free gift, hehe…]<br /><br />[P.P.S.: Will explain more of the ordering path I took this time round once I get the stuff. Which most likely will come next week. I guess.]       <hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
