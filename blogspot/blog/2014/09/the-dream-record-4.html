<h2 class="title">The Dream Record #4</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
<div dir="ltr">As promised, if I remember anything I'll post it here. This time... I made myself blush too.</div><div dir="ltr"><br />THE ROUNDUP</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">I'm in a class again (I know), this time participating in some group activity, and according to someone we have to "break up the pairs and be in groups of four". And then, a group of organisers (more like facilitators) walked in and started grouping people up. Sitting rows in front of me are a couple of girls, one of them called to the front group and then came a query from the activity leader (let's call him that) who said:</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Is there anyone else without a group yet?"</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">There were two guys in my group currently, including me. Another girl came in due to arrangement, but we're still one member short. Suddenly (or actually, obviously) the girl in front got called from behind my group to join this group. And (here's the interesting part) it turns out to be (Amamiya Sora) Ten-chan! (Fancy her being in my dream!) Actually it looks a lot like her, but I guess it's not her... or is she?</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Then, not long after, the game commences. According to instruction, (I forgot how it sounds like, so I'll do a sunmary according to the activities done later on) we're supposed to hit a target which looks like it's in an arcade machine to evaluate us on something. Oh well, since we don't know much and it's an evaluation, let's just start. So, one from each group is to go first. First to go is the other guy in our group. Silence ensues as one of the girls (not Ten-chan of course) also approach that machine. Then it was... since no order was decided between the two of us, in came a shout:</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"The faster we finish this, the earlier it can end! Come on, step up!" (Mostly fabricated, originally accurate is the 'fast' part)</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">The girl looked at me and I kindly volunteered to go first instead. She gave me a faint smile in reply. I went up to the machines and halfway through like, treading through a large storage-room sized compound, one of the facilitators said that we can also call the last member of our groups in too. Just as I was intending to go call that girl, I noticed she was standing nearby, spectating.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Hey, Ten-chan! Why did you come here! Hey, they said we can go together! Come!" (Which is why I deduced that she was Ten-chan)</blockquote><br /><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">THE GAME CONFESSION<br />(Ok this is the weird part. Remember the evaluation?)</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">Then in came Ten-chan and I and a few other people to the machine. It resembles more like a photo booth than something to play on. In front of us is a white circle equal in size to a gun that hangs by the side. The objective is to aim the gun at the white circle and hit three times. As we thought this was easy, I hit it three times and my scores are: (yes I remember numbers) 12 17 6. Ten-chan was beside me, taking a sigh after how bad she performed. A couple of girls standing behind were discussing about Ten-chan too, specifically on one song. (We'll talk about this later) I also commented on it to console Ten-chan:</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"No, Ten-chan is great. I liked your songs. Especially 'Yumesora'; it's like 悲しいの曲ですけど, (the girls are giggling at the back) it totally brings out the beauty in you. I feel so grateful after listening to it." (Something like that, and I even spoke some Japanese to relate to her?)</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Ten-chan turns into a blush, and says a slight 'Thank You' (don't ask me what language) in reply, making me blush too, seeing her embarrassed.</blockquote><div dir="ltr">THE EVALUATION</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">After one finishes the game, not much was mentioned how to go about understanding the results. So I just stood there to wait for instructions. All I do know and did was tally up the results. What I then found out as one of the facilitators passed by is to take the numbers to type a corresponding code down using the keyboard below me on the machine for them to take tabs on. Well obviously I didn't, and the buffer time for doing it on the machine is up too. When I see the guy to my left finishing the typing of his code (looks offensive and weird so probably won't mention it here) and showed the results, I panicked. Seeing that I did not do anything besides knowing the numbers, the facilitator told me they will send me the results after going back to read the details recorded inside the machine. I thank them for the help.</blockquote><br /><br /><div dir="ltr">Result? My scent was used around the 1800s (or 17th century) as a scent remover. OMG.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">That's all, folks. Hope I can remember more details the next time round. Regurgitating my long dreams out sure is quite a chore...</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">[P.S.: Thanks Ten-chan for your debut single. Hope you'll continue to do well. Or if the music company keeps giving you good songs to sing, too.]</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">[P.P.S.: Oh if you need references, at least you know Ten-chan's song needs no introduction. Others include watching a dart game on YouTube (it's a long way to link to here) and watching a video footage of Ten-chan in action. Yeah, NOW you know why.]</div><hr><h4>#The Dreams</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
