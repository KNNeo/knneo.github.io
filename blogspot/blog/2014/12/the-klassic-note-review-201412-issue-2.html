<h2>The Klassic Note Review – 2014.12 Issue 2</h2>
Somehow I NEVER mentioned this yanaginagi’s single before, even though it’s on my shelf. Well. The wait is over. I’m filling it in, and the compilation will come tomorrow. Remember that. I’ll post it here just to remind myself anyway. Let’s get started.<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />yanaginagi – Aqua Terrarium [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://f1.ct.hjfile.cn/pic/201407/493aa1f8-cee5-44e5-b2ec-5952c4141168.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="318" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140113052328/nicodougasingers/images/thumb/8/8b/Aqua_Terrarium_2.png/500px-Aqua_Terrarium_2.png" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Regular Edition]</td></tr></tbody></table>(Both pertaining to the theme. And no close ups. Good. Oops.) (No really, she has her beauty; Refer to the other single review)<br /><br />Origin: Well I guess the most memorable from her of how I started in this single and listening to yanaginagi is from Anime “Nagi no Asukara”. Awesome show by the way. And with awesome shows come awesome theme songs, and she did twice of it. Both great. More than the average standard because she partakes in the lyrics, and her voice is… Yeah you get what I mean. Anyways, it’s because the first of this I hear the diversity and her own composition, barely missing it last year and revisiting it the start of this year, and at least on my shelf. If she deserves that much attention she really is good, I can tell you that.<br /><br />(1) Aqua Terrarium<br />The theme song. A very different feel. A lot of hoohs and hahs going around the chorus. My first impression isn’t wonderful. But then as I go along the show it brings me to the mood of this song, which is uniquely soothing. I can remember back in last year at this time of the year I’m spending every night in a week listening to this song before I go to bed. Really. The hypnotic feeling somehow brings about the despair and mood in the song, as with the lyrics too. Overall a very well done song despite weak first impressions. And despite being still an Anime theme song.<br />RATING: 4 stars (Very Average)<br /><br />(2) mnemonic<br />This is what stopped me last year from getting the single. Her own composition. And there are two reasons why I changed my decision. Firstly, with the arrival of the other single I got for my birthday this year (specifically “unjour” her other composition), I decided to give her another chance, and surprisingly I’m in the mood for it, so instead of giving 4 out of 6 songs in total for both singles, I decided to put both of the singles on my shelf. Period. The drifty mood of this song has its own way, and in the most depressing times of the year (at least for the start of the year) she played a big part, and I forgave some discrepancies to give her the thumbs up. Secondly, this is also (I swear it’s coincidentally and unintentionally) the insert song for the same show. And after listening to it beforehand it really rings a bell, and reminded me once again how great this song is done. Really, have I not convinced you by now she is great?<br />RATING: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(3) You can count on me<br />This song, also given last year along with (1), is the other side of yanaginagi. The active side. The happy side. And a well done melody (not by her), but wonderful lyrics of dependence and hope. Really appreciating her talent by now, and I see why she left that group to advance further in her singing career. (Haha) So lively, five minutes for this song isn’t enough. Really. Upbeat, lively, and I can totally imagine her dancing to this if she did a live performance of it. Well, soon. She just completed her 2nd album…<br />RATING: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall not a bad single after all. You may see me giving average ratings here, but you don’t know how many times I''ve listened to these songs behind the scenes, especially last year, when I don’t have that Twitter account back then. Anyways, fans who has a taste of her composition style would definitely not miss this one of course, and those who haven’t so should give her voice and her rather quirky style of music creation a chance. Definitely a (three-track) single I’ve tried given chances and not got disappointed throughout the course of selection.<br /><br /><br />Yay. I’m done. Now for APoL. Apparently I didn such a haphazard and messy job I may have to rewrite it. Hope it doesn’t come to that. Cya guys next time then, and meanwhile I’ll wait patiently for the Anime tonight to be online.
