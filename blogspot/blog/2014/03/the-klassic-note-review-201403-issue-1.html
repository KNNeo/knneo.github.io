So shall we?<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Satou Satomi – Mirai Night [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/15/KICM-93275.jpg?v=2" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/09/02/KICM-3275.jpg?v=2" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Regular Edition]</td></tr></tbody></table>(Always remember I only possess the Regular Edition because… put in short, it’s too high a price to pay and DVDs are not widely standardised from where I come from) (Which means I’m clearly not from Japan or anywhere near it)<br /><br />Origin: News appeared as early as three months ago from its release, in December last year where Satomi-chan proudly released her artist debut as a singer! Congrats for her during that time, and her debut live performance is (really) times better off Kana-chan when she had hers two years ago. But anyway, it’s a lively rock band that she wants to create on her singing career, thus her effort of waiting this long (after reading many reliable sources) to start and how she intends to start guitar learning in order to show us her dream on her own live in the near future. Probably a year later, I suppose…<br />(I can write longer from where she was singing in K-ON! as Ricchan, but I guess that’s a little far…)<br /><br />(1) Mirai Night [Future Night]<br />As the title suggests, this is definitely a lively and simple rock piece to listen to, and I swear I took a liking to it (and her) the first time I heard it. I guess that’s what everyone wants to listen in a song, and this has everything. Lyrics also mean something too, with the inaccurate English sung by her is definitely not as important as her expressing this song in a positive light. PV-wise… it’s for you to decide. Though it’s not the considering factor to listening to this though: It’s rather unnecessary too… It’s pretty good on its own. Simple and upbeat: just how you guys would also like it.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(2) Brave Morning!<br />This… apparently is more of a cheerleading song than a rock song, but also has the rock style. And listening to it makes me think this song is not as bad as the first one too. Why the title? That I don’t really know, but from what I read online sources lead to the song written the morning of her debut performance as a singer, thus the inspiration, and this upbeat style. It also carries the band rock that Satomi-chan wants in, but put in a little more cheers in between. Overall, a very lively song, and not losing to Tomacchan in this case.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion:&nbsp;If you like her, you’ll like her song. Because from singing upbeat character songs in Anime, this is another fresh approach but this time, she is serious about it. Like all-out band, and her playing the guitar –sort of thing. And this single represents everything in it. I personally think this is great, but as the best this year… If you guys know my ranking standards yanaginagi would win her by one track here… Not my point. DO give her a listen if you like upbeat songs, as this has a little of everything: pop, rock and a little cheer.<br /><br />~Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: x-large;">ALSO!</span></div><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Horie Yui – The World’s End [Single]<br />(If you want me to put the hearts in you've got another thing coming)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/02/41/KICM-91500.jpg?v=1" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/08/28/KICM-1500.jpg?v=1" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Regular Edition]</td></tr></tbody></table>(What is SOOOOO interesting about the Limited Edition is IN it’s music video, where clues are in to access a website with a code that lets you in to solve a mystery within the 5-minute video. Unique, but unfortunately I don’t get it, so…)<br /><br />Origin: If it’s Anime songs you know well then Hocchan barely needs any introduction. Sequel to her first set of theme songs given to the Anime “Golden Time”, this is so referred to the theme songs for the ‘2-cour’ Anime length (ie. second half), as hearing from the songs. Unfortunately, this gets plenty of Anime boost, which is mostly negative in many cases. Let me tell you why below. Really, the first set of theme songs (last year) did better than this…<br /><br />(1) The World’s End<br />How to say this… Eh… It’s very different? Yeah, I guess. No wonder they took so long just to release this. They (production) probably don’t know how to make this into a full song too, haha. Turns out they did, and come out trumps, as I guess this is the most counter-intuitive song I guess I hear from such a cute voice, but that goes to show listening to Anime songs gives a certain level of uncertainty from what you may be hearing, and from the start this has not been good. Upon close inspection things to rather surface, but nonetheless the style of this song is rather rough on the outstanding-character side, similar to what she acts on the show as Kaga Kouko, a rich lady who is possessive of her lover. (Oops spoilers for those who haven’t watched?) The PV gives another side to this song’s impression, as a mystery surrounds the house, apparently not a crime, but about a black cat and… pretty much everything else I don’t understand, but doesn’t seem to look like love already. I don’t know how to put a clear verdict to this, but if this isn’t your taste, you should very well turn away. Or else, give creative/restricted songs a chance, yes?<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average) (Anything higher would be ridiculous)<br /><br />(2) Haneikyuuteki ni Aishite yo [Loving (You) Semi-Permanently]<br />I initially hoped for this song to turn the tides to the impression of this single, but… I guess the composers wrecked this completely, huh. Reading till here, if you guys don’t intend to hear this single, then you can stop reading here. Comparing to her previous single “Golden Time” it consists of two short (rather short) songs written short and simple, yet impressive. In this case, it seems that dragging the song and bringing out the mood of the song seems to be the focus here, as I catch the little familiar melodies as much as I can to make it feel like I’m hearing a nice song. You know, this could well be a short 3-minute song, but I guess the first two minutes are so deliberate I start to feel I’m being an idiot listening to it. But no, I’m not giving it 3-stars just because it has a good melody. Just… just… production problem, just like the show itself initially. Go read the comments online. I don’t even want to comment on it anymore…<br />Rating: 4 stars (Below Average) (Anything lower I won’t even pre-order this)<br /><br />Conclusion: Eh… Can I don’t give one? If you liked Hocchan ever since she was 20 or if you watch the Anime, please give this a listen by all means. Or else, leave it alone. Unless you like to test your endurance of brainwashing (which I apparently did) while listening to songs that are in imperfection. Period.<br /><br />~Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br />Been rather moody these days. I know I should’ve gotten this out like… Monday. I’ll get better, hopefully. When I see my future has some direction. Not miwa. Not VELTPUNCH. Not SPECIAL OTHERS. No music would help that for now. Until next time, people.<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
