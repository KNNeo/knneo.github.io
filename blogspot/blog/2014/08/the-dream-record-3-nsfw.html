<h2 class="title">The Dream Record #3 (NSFW?)</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
<div dir="ltr">I didn't know if I want to post this, since it's actually very interesting. But as the whole thing links as a whole (??) I think I can still do it. Well, if you're underage it's also ok; don't be deterred by the title. I'll make it as it's like an Anime, yes?</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">THE FANSERVICE<br />Hmm how shall I put this...</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">I was going to the public showers (like in a swimming pool) with a bunch of people in a camp* (and yes it probably includes females) and surprisingly we all went into the "female toilet" - actually its a toilet with majority female cubicles. But that doesn't mean there isn't for males; it's just a little smaller. In fact so much smaller the low ceiling height (a little above me, and I'm about 1.7m) and that we're squeezing and fighting for the cubicles after we settled down. (Be reminded that I'm a male here) I... 'assisted' one of the girls to find an empty cubicle (did I mention the male area is so much smaller: I did a comparison) and then missed a few chances to get my own. Some even resorted to using the female cubicles (which are in pink, compared to blue) but I stopped them before they get caught.<br />So I gave up queueing for the showers and I know from outside this shower there's one further down the area (here's the ambiguity), so I packed up my stuff* and went in that direction, assisted by someone in front of me who seemingly is heading in that direction. We entered a mall, turned left and saw toilets. Unfortunately there's a long queue of guys outside the corridor and it looks impossible to queue already.<br /> Then I went back to the original toilet (yes the female toilet) but found people crowding around in front of it. When I walked closer to investigate, I saw some people circling around a middle-aged gentleman with a top hat, in black. </blockquote><div dir="ltr">THE INCIDENT<br />(Did I tell you this was long?)</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">I asked what happened to the gentleman, and in an array of discrete and small actions (I don't know how to describe them well) - he explained whilst pointing the only objects left on the floor:<br />"They... (pointed at one object) and... (pointed at another object) and they... (slit throat sound effect)"<br />(Note: It was much more intense than that. Like a thousand camera angles on like, half a dozen objects. I just don't remember them all...)<br />As he explains the people around him weep in agony. Also this somehow convinced me that this is most likely a serial murder case. Or not. I wondered if this was just an elaborate trap or some scammer who is out to cheat something from me, probably money. I changed from a face of shock to disbelief.<br />"Ok I'll take a bet with you that this is not true! If i can find the people back, you're in trouble*. If not (the focus is over here, by the way), I'll apologise to you."</blockquote><br /><div dir="ltr">THE LIE</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">Then I went up the stage nearby to look around the open area. No one I knew from the camp is in sight, even those guys who I know well. I looked back to see the crowd disperse, the gentleman standing up to see around and looked at me with a broad smile. I knew I lost my own bet. (Audience: Haha so quickly?) (Yeah or else it'll take a season of Anime to finish it) I walked past him in disbelief to the toilet I went in in the first place (that female toilet) and noticed a bunch of females and no males, making me notice I entered the wrong toilet. (Audience: It took you this long to notice?) Also, there's a male toilet beside it!</blockquote><br /><br /><div dir="ltr">*Represents "for the sake of completeness", likely due to absence of information. Vagueness is stated in comments</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Interesting isn't it? And I do recall references in which my dreams come from too. (No not the shower scene) Over the weekend I see my dad watching early chinese movies (those '80s type) and one of the scenes was a bet made my a flirt against another for getting a girl. The gentleman looks like the one in that movie, and I look like that fat jerk who challenged him to get the girl. (LOL)</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">I guess that's all, that was long man. If you wondered how long I took, it was more than an hour later when I woke up as I post this, in which more than 45mins of the time was spent on travelling. Dedication to deliver, people. Cya next time, probably reviewing SPECIAL OTHERS single from three years ago.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">[P.S.: By the way, if you know me and wonder whether you're in that "female toilet"... chances are yes. You are. In the original NSFW version too. (Male Audience: Yesh!) (Female Audience: |||â€¦)]</div><hr><h4>#The Dreams</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
