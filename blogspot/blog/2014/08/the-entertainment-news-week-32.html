<h2>The Entertainment News Week #32</h2>
Wow nano.RIPE’s 3rd album makes them SO DAMN GOOD. Now I’ve to give more songs already.<br />Moving on to the topic of this post… Oh I have to talk about them here too, hehe.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote>Somehow I think I shouldn’t give reviews one day after I’ve watched everything. It all subsides off by the time I get here…<br /><strong>Glasslip:</strong> Wow. Punches and slaps may not be the convention we all watch shows of this genre, and the reasons are rather shallow (on the surface of course), but then they’ve done it. Yukinari-kun and Yanagi-san. I don’t know how far they may get, but it’ll definitely get exciting, nonetheless. And we’re halfway through this already. Let’s hope they think of a good way to solve this. Like, through foreseeing the future? Heh…<br /><strong>Kuroshitsuji:</strong> Getting exciting already, isn’t it? Finally Ciel and Sebastian get into investigation and find out, surprisingly, a lot of things. Like there’s a guy behind all the first-class members in the circus, and Ciel being noticed, and Doll actually being the freckled girl (yeah female summore) sleeping above Ciel all the time. With more to come, I want to see this end in an epic manner. And I know A-1 Pictures will deliver it, yes?<br />It maybe too early to talk about it now, but then I’ve been scouting new Anime for next season, and results have been surprisingly good.<br /><b>Denkigai no Honya-san: </b>A story about a bunch of weird workers in a manga store in the middle of an electronic shop district (hence the title of the story), and feels like WORKING!!, and definitely something I think I can watch. Hope the jokes are funny, and seeing the first chapter I have confidence that it will.<br /><b>Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso: </b>This… may be a good diversion from Ao Haru Ride as I pick up another romance Anime, this time more to Shounen genre (so won’t have the mushy and overdetail stuff) and also has music elements in it. Yeah. The last time I gave a show with a piano in it is… Apollon, two years ago. Let’s hope this time round they’ll make it good. As I say, theme songs and music within make the better of an Anime adaptation. Really. Maybe not for you, but I believe it more. Probably half the reason why I dropped Ao Haru Ride too…<br /><br />SHOWS<br /><strong>MythBusters:</strong> Wow two episodes in one week! And both are new! Well I’ve watch one of the myths, but that is barely making the content familiar to me as they talk a lot of myths from gender preferences to traffic solutions. Pretty damn good episodes in a while, I must say.<br /><strong>CrazyGod:</strong> Yesh, they’re doing an adaption of One Piece. OMG.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><strong>BLEACH:</strong> I wonder what is going to happen to the possessed Hitsugaya when I noticed the real problem is what is REALLY going to happen to him when Mayuri is put into the equation. Let’s just hope it’s just enough to get him off the zombie possession and not kill him. *pause* I say this because I believe Kubo won’t intentionally kill good guys. Yet.<br /><strong>One Week Friends:</strong> Have been chasing the manga ever since the Anime ended, and will do so from now on. Latest chapter is on the school festival, where Shougo and Saki-chan are avoiding each other and Hase-kun, afraid to expose the true beauty of Fujimiya-san to everyone else, is stopping her from helping out as a waitress in the maid cafe held by the class. Seriously, this possessiveness he has better not get over him. And yes, Fujimiya-san IS damn cute. It’s like I see a second season coming by soon. Haha. Actually I also want Kashiwagi-san to appear as an adaptation, but- Haiz…<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Wow. I don’t know how to start liao. I just talked about a <strong>nano.RIPE album</strong> just now. Since we know about Choucho already, let’s talk about nano.RIPE then. In the afternoon have been listening to a live from them, specifically their live tour this year from the single’s DVD. Not bad I must say, and that brings me to the main point. The three songs that caught me? Two of them are from the latest album. The other is a classic in their list, which is great too. I’ll see how much I can give them; the girl’s high pitch voice plus the standard rock style in the band don’t make of a deep impression, but that doesn’t mean they’re bad. So have a listen to them too; they songs sound great with the melodic tunes and out-of-the-box lyric compositions…<br /><br />Coming next week (obviously have not came yet) is <b>Amamiya Sora-chan’s first solo single</b> “Skyreach”, no doubt will give a listen, even if I don’t watch Anime “Akame ga Kill”. Just to offset the disappointment I hear from <b>Tomacchan’s new single</b>? Haha she may just replace her? I guess I’ll think about it…?<br /><br /><br />Well I guess that’s all for this week. Next week… I may be in a bad mood. Not like I’m not now, but I’ll try not to. Cya guys next week then, and until next time… don’t be a sloth like me. Now, if you would excuse me, I shall continue to assume lying down position…<br /><br />[P.S.:<br /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10606587_10152645698722460_6666515850730327878_n.jpg?oh=44e9647916ad74b68a5a71c8af7f9e45&amp;oe=578AA4AA" /><br /><br />I hope no one finds this extra segment irritating. Or disappointing. Or both. For me? Personally I think it’s both.]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
