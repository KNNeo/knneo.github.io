<h2 class="title">The (Intentional) Near Miss</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
<p>Hi guys. And I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm here anyway. Fancy me b***ching about when I can‚Ä¶ ok let‚Äôs get to it.</p> <p>THE NEWS<br>I was overjoyed. Supposedly it‚Äôs the first time I had a first-hand information of an artist I know performing in Singapore (that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre mostly Japanese), and what is more is not on concert, means no tickets required to listen to music! It‚Äôs Rie fu-san on her first gig in Singapore! Like, what I‚Äôve been waiting for! But even if I said I will go if anyone I know ever comes here to perform‚Ä¶</p> <p>THE IDEAL<br>Why should I go? Well for first, I‚Äôll be able to listen to her new songs of her album, which also feature a song about Singapore, which sounds great by the way. Also, it‚Äôs cheap compared to actually getting into a concert, as I can just support the artist through a direct donation.I might also be able to request songs I‚Äôd like to hear, or even more, talk to her in person! I guess that‚Äôs what‚Äôs good about a gig compared to just a concert where buying tickets is tougher than getting to talk to the artist. Yeah.</p> <p>And the circumstances are appropriate. Today I have an exam (I know, condolences to me) and it being in the afternoon means I can just go after the paper, in the evening. And I can just hang out with my friends before that anyway. I can settle my own dinner too, for it is not taken care of by the family today.</p> <p>THE PROBLEM<br>The problem‚Ä¶ is with me.</p> <p>Really.</p> <p>Why so? Well. Just thinking about me makes me too excited, and such enthusiasm makes me‚Ä¶ somewhat unable to sleep. I suppose it‚Äôll work for those outdoorsy people, but not for me. And that‚Äôs not the only problem. Also in the way is me fundamentally not getting out of the house, especially when I‚Äôm outside. ALONE.</p> <p>And yes seeing that it is a gig means it‚Äôll be in a cafe or some sort (well intense research isn‚Äôt necessary), which means spending money on secondary items besides hearing her performance, which requests lightly for a donation to support the artist. Furthermore, she is selling her album there too, which means it‚Äôll look stupid for one (who abides by the rules in Klassic Note) to not buy the release. Well, it wouldn‚Äôt be cheaper than the online price anyway, if you do the calculations. Also I just‚Ä¶</p> <p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>"Because I have to review albums from SPYAIR and FLOWER FLOWER tonight, I won't be-" Excuses.</p>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/537938525102936066" target="_blank">November 27, 2014</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Overall. I‚Äôm a wimp. Yeah. And the main concerns are me not used to going outdoors so I can just go for her gig, and also‚Ä¶ because I have no balls. I don‚Äôt dare to. Too bad.</p> <p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>Due to the inherent lack of etiquette and guts, I'm not going anywhere tonight. Sorry, Rie fu-san.</p>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/537938340431949825" target="_blank">November 27, 2014</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>Okay let's just say I'm "not prepared for it" yet, yes? I wonder when I will be. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span></p>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/537942629539786752" target="_blank">November 27, 2014</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Maybe next time, yes? Honestly saying, me feeling bad about it and typing this much really means that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot prepared yet‚Äù for such things. Even if it may just happen two years ago in AFA 2012 with sphere. And last year with SID. And today. Yes. How much I have missed as a fan. Why‚Ä¶</p> <p>[P.S.: On a better note, my package will be arriving tomorrow, also the review. And I‚Äôll not miss it to make it next week. Maybe just to comfort myself for not going out for liking the music. Haiz‚Ä¶]</p> <p>[P.P.S.: Not that impactful because I feel so bad writing about it. If you need more‚Ä¶ actually don‚Äôt even ask for it. I shouldn‚Äôt be doing this.]</p>  <hr><h4>#The Klassic Note #The Everyday Life</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
