<h2>The Klassic Note Review – 2014.11 Issue 1</h2>
I can say this may not the only one because I’m reviewing Goose house’s new single, and I haven’t gave Ten-chan a chance on her second single yet. Plenty of room for another issue for the month. Just you wait and see.<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Toyosaki Aki – Portrait [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.gamers-onlineshop.jp/resize_image.php?image=10271535_544de7b4480b0.jpg&amp;amp;width=500" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="314" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515psJAnFHL._SL500_.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Regular Edition]</td></tr></tbody></table>(How to say… total fanservice? Well I’m not expecting anything or anyone else on the cover anyway, so… good. xD)<br /><br />Origin: Rather than explain how I came about listening to Aki-chan as she reaches her 5th year in the music career, I should talk about how I came about listening to this again? Well you guys should know about her live radio broadcast every week “Okaeri Radio”, where of course she starts giving previews to her song as early as one month before release date. Due to her enthusiasm, I already know part of the song before I even get to listen the whole single, and of course being a fan of her I must give her chance, which is why the reason for the pre-order. (Of course there’s a darker reason for that; we’ll get to it later) It’s winter, and Aki-chan wants to bring us a touching song. Not well written, but touching nonetheless.<br /><br />(1) Portrait<br />How should I say it… it’s emotional. It’s winter and we make a promise with her under the sky. Listening to the lyrics makes me know that the lyricist is a pro (and he is, for he writes many songs for sphere), however the composition is not that its best. Comparatively, it is still better than CHEEKY last year, probably the most regrettable single I got without a gift. (Oops) It’s heartfelt feeling from Aki-chan, and I feel it too, but… not too much. So it’s just be that average song I’ll come to love, yes? I’m being so frank over here…<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Shamrock<br />This one is probably more of an issue. Somehow music composition in music companies but spoil the song with the bridge part of the song (between second and last chorus), which makes of very bad reveal once you hear the whole song, because the original preview sounds great. And lively, and relaxed. But just that part of the song. I know. But it’s forgivable, for the lyrics and overall suggest a light-hearted song and a happy mood. So I shouldn't be complaining, isn’t it?<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall a very average single, and with the end of year rankings coming after so many reviews throughout the year, this single is likely not going to hit the top ones anyway. But it’s worth a listen, for Aki-chan’s soft and unique voice will soothe you, and feel for the mood of the songs within. It’s all inside, people. Give it a listen, yes?<br /><br />[P.S.: Always remember if it’s reviewed means it passed the (somewhat strict) requirements of Klassic Note. Means you should give any review a listen, yes?]<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-m6Rqnh8a-uM/VGmq-PIzvjI/AAAAAAAAK2k/Yx6v9GDG53o/IMG_20141117_144820%25255B31%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="244" style="background-image: none; border-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="640" /><br />A picture speaks a thousand words, but no picture is going to explain my nerves when I saw the delivery slip on my door last Friday. Probably going to be the earliest of deliveries I get in my history of pre-ordering (within three days of release), but the local post office had to spoil it. I had to head to the post office in the next district (transport costs) to get the package instead. You should already see me b****hing about it from last week already, isn’t it? Haiz… (Audience: Then you still want to show us?) Haha yah.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en">Well... I've got bad news (esp. for myself): Aki-chan's single review will be done on next Monday. I failed to get the CD today. Goddammit.<br />— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/533158725100392448" target="_blank">November 14, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en">It could've been today... I rushed home already...*sob* (What's more I have to get it from the post office in the next neighbourhood??)<br />— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/533159640427540480" target="_blank">November 14, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> <br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en">Would've costed me two bucks and half an hour less if I had rushed home, which was impossible. Sorry, Aki-chan. <a href="http://t.co/dnUIN3FnZj" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/dnUIN3FnZj</a><br />— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/534247400362086401" target="_blank">November 17, 2014</a></blockquote>Nonethtless, it’s here, and I’m happy. For the gift. That’s what makes it good, I guess. For having to wait to get here. I swear if I was in Japan I’ll just go get it in a nearby music store already. But no. I’m not in Japan. Too bad for one who should’ve been born there, huh. Oops.<br /><br /><br />Okay I guess that’s all. I need to keep my mood for doing mock exams tonight, for the real deal. Cya guys next time. And probably I’ll be able to pre-order more singles to make myself happy. Using my own money, hopefully, hehe. No I don’t know whether my bank account contains my savings or my dad’s to finance my education…<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
