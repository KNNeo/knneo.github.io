<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2014.05 Issue 1: Klassic Note Reviews x2!</h2>
<div align="center">  <i     ><span style="font-size: x-small;"       >(This is an imported post. For the original post please refer to       <a         href="http://knwebreports2012.blogspot.com/2014/05/sunday-night-report-klassic-note.html"         target="_blank"         >this link</a       >.)</span     ></i   ><br /><br /></div>Since I made the title obvious, and most of you (if any) is waiting for this after reading Entertainment News Weekly, I shall start without delay, yeah?<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />fumika – Endless Road [Single]<br /><div class="post-body" style="text-align: center;">  <img     height="254"     src="https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/10/13/YRCN-90227.jpg?v=2"     width="250"   /></div>(Simple cover, isn’t it?)<br /><br />Origin: As you guys know, I’m not unfamiliar with fumika-san. Ever since listening to her debut single from Anime “BLEACH”, I’ve been following her on her new songs, with a breakthrough in 2012, where she sings the three-parter duo songs followed by her album, which created an impression, at least for me. Since her shift out of Sony Music Japan, she has been actively singing original and cover songs too, with this being an original production. Without cover songs. Her previous two songs are not the case. <br /><br />(1) Endless Road<br />This song is about love, and more than that. It’s about happiness and bliss. Besides, the topic is about marriage anyway, shown in the PV. Nice song though, like I’ve not been hearing a good song from fumika in a while. Lyrics are also written in topic, with four seasons and reminiscing the past, making the songs more impressionable. Overall, this is a nice song, and it fully represents fumika’s style. And since she’s out of Sony Music Japan, a super-copyrighted label, means you can watch the PV on YouTube! My eyes tear up the first time I watched and sang to this. *sob*<br /><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe     allowfullscreen=""     frameborder="0"     height="189"     src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fLX_A80dMVw"     width="336"   ></iframe></div><div style="clear: both; width: 448px;">  If you tear up halfway through the song, so did I… </div><br />Rating: 4 stars (Solid Average) <br /><br />(2) A~Yokatta<br />Don’t mind the looks of the song title, but the song itself is full of hype, and a feel of thankfulness is felt after receiving bliss and enjoying the happiness. I like this song too, as is concludes the single really well. Which really makes this single so complete. Makes me feel like I’ve reached another stage of my life, though not marriage, haha. <br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Verdict: Overall, it’s a good single. It’s complete, as I mentioned above in the two songs in it. And I’ve already placed an order, which… is not here yet. I’ll show fumika-san on Twitter when I got the copy. It’s the best proof that I do support artists I listen.<br />[P.S.: With “Endless Road” the song I also got fumika-san to follow me on Twitter. OMG.]<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"   >ALSO!</span ><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span>THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />sphere – Kasuka na Hisoka na Tashika na Mirai [Single]<br /><table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" >  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           src="https://www.gamers.co.jp/resize_image.php?image=04281330_535dd96954e42.jpg&amp;width=500"           style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           width="200"         />      </td>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           src="https://www.gamers.co.jp/resize_image.php?image=04281331_535dd9ab52640.jpg&amp;width=500"           tyle="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           width="200"         />      </td>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           src="https://www.gamers.co.jp/resize_image.php?image=04281332_535dd9daed032.jpg&amp;width=500"           style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           width="200"         />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Anime Limited Edition       </td>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>(I know about the title being in <a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/LASM-4168">another format</a>, but I shall stick to the consensus. Very typical covers though, and Nanana-chan seems to have twisted her arm…)<br /><br />Origin: If you guys need me to introduce this voice actor idol group, then you’re insulting my unique taste in their works. Again they have tied up with another Anime “Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin” which I do watch (not a bad show), impending for their upcoming FOURTH album after celebrating their 5th anniversary after debut. Again, this single is not a disappointment, and I’ve already prepared to press the order button when I finished listening to this release.<br /><br />(1) Kasuka na Hisoka na Tashika na Mirai [(A) Faint, Scretive, Certain Future]<br />What’s almost awesome is from when I heard the Anime preview and radio previews before that, and overall the song lands in the typical Anison format, which is fine by my case. I personally favour a shorter song (as shorter song makes lesser mistakes and variations), but this is fine as it is. A very nice song to listen to, especially the chorus.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Anison-typical Average)<br /><br />(2) synchronicity<br />I only knew of the title of the song and heard the preview of the song from Aki-chan’s radio show just three days ago, and I heard the full song yesterday already. With the song title’s creativity aligned with mine (refer to APoL cards for details LOL), this song is also creativity presented, in a wacky and somehow naughty way (with a slight dere theme?), typical of their songs. And I particularly liked the chorus, and again, this song turned out better than the A-side above. It’s not the first time this has happened, so I shall no dwell upon it. Personally like this song more than the Anison, and primarily the reason why I would bother to go Sony Music Shop to get the special gift AGAIN.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Verdict: If it’s not good it wouldn’t even make it here. This is another good single from sphere. And I like it. PV-wise… I haven’t seen it yet, so… But overall it’s good, and Klassic Note is about listening, so I guess the video is not important?<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br />That’s all, folks. Until the next time… if I get the two singles within next week then I’ll talk about it again? Meanwhile I’ll moan about the dreadful reality that I don’t live in Japan…<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div style="text-align: center;">  Follow @KlassicNote on Twitter! –   <a     href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote"     title="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote"     >https://twitter.com/KlassicNote</a   ></div><div style="text-align: center;">  Listen to dozens of music videos on Youtube! –   <a href="mailto:KlassicNote@YouTube">KlassicNote@YouTube</a></div><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe     allowfullscreen=""     frameborder="0"     height="189"     src="//www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB"     width="336"   ></iframe   ><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">END OF ADVERTISEMENT</div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
