<h2>The Klassic Note Review – 2014.07 Issue 4</h2>
Well in contrast of the previous issue, I’ve slept enough to come back to do this, but let’s get to it then. This time I’m reviewing a single that is… close to when I started, but only got to it five years later.<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Kalafina – sprinter/ARIA [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5188DvL63yL._AC_.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Gc2MT0Y9VYI/TdxxXbYBYgI/AAAAAAAACC8/LeSu-yvX9Bw/s320/sprinter_-_aria_re1.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Regular Edition]</td></tr></tbody></table>[If you saw four people in the album art, the one in red is NOT Kaijiura Yuki-sensei.&nbsp; Really. Go do research, or read below for more.]<br /><br />Origin: Kalafina is well-known by its chorus trio WAKANA, HIKARU and KEIKO created and backed up by famous Anime composer and also active artist Kaijiura Yuki. The group was created for all the theme song performances of Anime Kara no Kyoukai movies back in 2008. Unfortunately, due to an announcement, Kalafina was reduced to three retiring its fourth member Maya (this early!), in between releasing this single and the next “fairytale”, which I don’t possess. You should’ve known the trio due to its many appearances in Kuroshitsuji, Madoka Magica, Fate and much more. Celebrating the release of their best albums this month, I took another listen to their songs, and yes after five years ever since I watched Kara no Kyoukai and started listening to them, this was given the thumbs up. <br /><br />If you find out about the main group Kaijiura-sensei is at (FictionJunction), it contains her, the members of Kalafina and another main vocal, which was created years after. Don’t worry, she’s got a longer music history than what’s written here.<br /><br />(1) sprinter<br />Well known as the theme song for the fifth movie of Kara no Kyoukai, this was the song back years ago I immediately gave the thumbs up due to it being the most lively song of the series, and one of the most unique songs and genre I’ve heard ever since. That’s what is special about the music written by Kaijiura-sensei, this special make of classical pop along with the help of these vocal maidens. If you believe this is good, you shall give it a listen.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) ARIA<br />And this is the song that got this single stuck on its feet ever since I started buying CDs two years ago. Let me tell you why. This song, also known as the theme song for the fourth movie, does not feel very the same as the previous song. It exhibits a very different feel which is more of the movie and less of conventional pop music. But you know what? The point I can give it now also means I enjoy their music so much I must give them in face of the group and the Anime itself. They and the show have come a far way till last year (search “Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin”), and listening to this (especially the intro) brings back distant memories of the show. Go ahead and listen, if you like the genre.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: At this point, I can safely say I like this single. I know when it’s a song missing releases do not get reviewed, but as long as it does, it deserves attention. A hell lot more attention. So here it is. If you truly like this group, I guess this single’s already on your shelf. If not, and you know a song or two from them, this single will not disappoint. I’m already feeling bad for giving confirmation THIS late…<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br />THE EVIDENCE<br /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-d9_fygSrP9g/U9eLqhRDDyI/AAAAAAAAKDI/jl7pR7AFzL4/IMG_20140729_125331%25255B12%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="360" style="background-image: none; border: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="640" /><br />You want me to say something? Eh… It finally got here? Should’ve been last week, if I had chosen HMV Japan…<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
