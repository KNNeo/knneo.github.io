<h2>The Introduction</h2>
Hello, and welcome. If you came here because you were wanting to read something, you're at the right place. Or else... you're still welcome, and I hope this post will clarify most of the *nonsense* you see here.<br /><br />THE STYLE<br />After much thinking and planning (which is like less than a week), I've came up with a <b>new title and theme</b> for the blog. Though still named "reports", they are <b>more flexible, more like notes</b> this time round in "Klassic Note". <b>New labels</b> are in, and title formats have changed. <b>Posts that are really damn long in my opinion will also be highlighted in bold</b> to give a summary of the post. <b>Censorship is a must</b> here, but vulgarities will be a minimal anyway (studies have shown such phrases occurring less than 2% of the previous blog), and I'm keeping this as general an audience rating as possible.<br /><br /><b>Do not believe that the "The" in almost every post is a typo</b>, thank you. This time I'm keeping the title short, and the important things long. <b>What that matters, in small doses</b>. Or a huge dose if I'm blogging-deficient.<br /><br />Also, <b>announcements in this blog</b> are going to be varied between posting officially in individual posts or slotted in the numerous posts I post every week. Since it's <b>all over the place</b>, I see no need to create a label for it too.<br /><br /><br />THE POSTSCRIPTS<br />I love to forget things. And I don't like to add them into it, because it doesn't feel like I'm talking to you. To make it more creative and random, P.S.-es are added, mostly at two, if I don't start forgetting at my age...<br /><br />THE AUDIENCE<br />Less than often you may see another opinion. Of course that is also me, but it brings another perspective.<br /><br />THE ACCENT<br />If you know where I am from, then you shouldn't mind the extra words I type in this blog. It's part of me, and where I am, yesh?<br /><br />THE IMAGES<br />Mostly female voice actors in Anime, or sometimes Anime characters. It's all because there's this desperate man wanting someone to look at, and all the girls in the streets are shy. Or maybe it's just me.<br /><br />THE VIDEOS<br />I don't upload videos, so I don't hold responsibility for all posted online videos here. If you can't find it, there is nothing much I can do. But for all videos I will leave a note close enough to reveal its source so you can still search it.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORDS<br />Lastly, don't bother commenting. I am prone to criticism, and dislike it too, so if you do end up liking it, feel free to keep quiet and read. Otherwise, thank you for coming.<br /><br />[P.S.: And if the mobile site looks bad it's because Blogger doesn't allow for editing mobile sites. They should consider it soon, considering my devotion to this service...]<hr><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
