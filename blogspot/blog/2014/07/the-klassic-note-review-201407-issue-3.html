<h2 class="title">The Klassic Note Review – 2014.07 Issue 3</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
I’m going to sleep soon, so let’s get this done quick. (Audience: Already?) I guess not, after this post. Waited for that package until I felt like joining my dad for his afternoon nap already…<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />SCANDAL – Yoake no Ryuuseigun (Single)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/06/ESCL-4241.jpg?v=1" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/08/ESCL-4243.jpg?v=1" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition Type A]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Limited Edition Type B]</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/05/ESCL-4240.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/10/ESCL-4245.jpg?v=1" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Pokemon Edition]</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">[Regular Edition]</td></tr></tbody></table>Origin: We should also not be unfamiliar with this girls’ rock band that took an allegiance with fame, with their solid rock style debuting in their youth. Many years has passed since their start in 2008, and if not for BLEACH and the weird opening song they gave to me as first impression, I wouldn’t have known they are that awesome. This year is also a year for the start of releasing their own compositions with “Departure” back in April (the review’s on the old site though), but this one is because of the Pokemon movie that it was assisted by production teams. Nevertheless, it’s a good single, which is why it’s on my shelf and I’m here to share about it.<br /><br />(1) Yoake no Ryuuseigun [The Meteor Shower at Dawn]<br />Not talking about objectively how this song is nice, I shall just talk about how I came about this song. First of course is knowing about it being a Pokemon Movie theme song for the year (last year’s movie theme song was by Ikimono-gakari, “Egao”), and then hearing the PV. You can say the music video may have left a better impression instead of the music itself, but nonetheless it’s still good in its own way. No much comments about this, but with TOMOMI in with writing the lyrics (not alone for this song though) this sure is a nice song to listen to.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Your song<br />Yes this IS a song by themselves, for themselves. All written by all their members, this featured in a music program “J-MELO” which is also (surprisingly) airing it in English in order to reach the wider audience (sadly not aired where I’m from) to know about them. From video footage they seems to have written everything themselves, and the simple lyrics with powerful meanings bring forward more belief of one to move on in life, which is why the title is for us listeners. Don’t take the lyrics in too much though; this maybe just their opinion.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br />(I wished I could show you videos, but I guess it’ll have to take time, unless you want me to do this review next month?)<br /><br />Conclusion: As I would’ve said many times, that if you are a fan of SCANDAL supporting their own compositions is really a way to show them support, like me. If you’re not, but if you’re watching the Pokemon (which won’t be translated to other languages anytime soon) movie then take a listen to this. This is no childish audio you know, it’s about Pokemon growing up. Haha yah right. If you want to know more about intentions behind economic marketing feel free to chat with me. No contact details for you to use to reach me though.<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />On a side note, the package that came today… was very late. Well I thank those people who are still delivering even on a Saturday though, must be hard on them. More importantly, the package. As I’ve already seen SCANDAL’s single images online I know about the First Press Edition special booklet about their diaries on their music journey, this time (#9 already) on this single. And if anyone needs help understanding why I mentioned about middle fingers in the booklet, here’s the image I saw online. And it is also what I saw when I received the package: (NOTE: NOT MY IMAGE!)<br /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Phis7RDti4s/U8pjshQzHtI/AAAAAAAAJ_Y/3uqQW1IkA64/358dee11728b471005ff900ac1cec3fdfe0323d4%25255B11%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="299" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="660" /><br />(The music company is definitely deciding whether to let them go overseas or not already)<br />Haha besides that, I guess everything else is in my possession ONLY. Unless you still remember that I may just place Aki-chan’s scanned photo and TOMOMI’s card as my phone wallpaper, yeah?<br /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-AH6mYyn6mYA/U8pjHdacXYI/AAAAAAAAJ_A/XJXOcTjdt5s/IMG_20140719_161219%25255B6%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="182" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="242" /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-hVawn8YKr3o/U8pjINHK_lI/AAAAAAAAJ_I/FkkNazspY2E/IMG_20140719_162042%25255B11%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="182" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="182" /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-P6odDskaGfY/U8pjIxEayDI/AAAAAAAAJ_Q/L8QEz7DUoaA/IMG_20140719_160152%25255B7%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="182" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="242" /><br />Yes I thought I bought a copy of Aki-chan’s LP. Well if she and I were around half a century ago then I guess so…<br />[P.S.: Maybe I should just post a review every week, even if the single is not on my shelf… yeah?]<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
