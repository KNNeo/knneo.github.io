<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2014.06 Issue 1: The (Neatest) Klassic Note Review</h2>
<div align="center"><i><span style="font-size: x-small;">(This is an imported post. For the original post please refer to <a href="http://knwebreports2012.blogspot.com/2014/06/monday-night-report-neatest-klassic.html" target="_blank">this link</a>.)</span></i><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">“Neat, Neater, Neatest!”</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> -Kaineng</span></div>Feels like I’m doing something like a video review of LG G3 here, but it’s Neat’s we’re talking about and… “third time’s the charm”, indeed.<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Neat’s – MOA [Album]<br /><img alt="" src="https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/08/e5/db/08e5db3f-8556-e608-023d-2c43bf0b07a6/source/626x0w.jpg" style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="" width="240" />(Apparently one of those album art which is same as the PV. Great!)<br />Origin: It’s this.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en data-scribe-reduced-action-queue="><a href="http://t.co/2sKXUhwAVw">pic.twitter.com/2sKXUhwAVw</a><br />— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/statuses/472727036037849088">May 31, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />The release live stream. Firstly it’s the news because I know her back then when she was in pop duo RYTHEM with YUKARI (now yucat), and that they decided to go both ways. Now on her third album, she decides to go free, focusing on creating the best impression “Neat’s world” (ニーツの世界) from the album songs down to the PV, and even the live stream, featuring a band. And if it’s not good, I won’t be here doing a review about it already. Let’s have a good talk about it shall we?<br />Oh in this review I also will be talking about the notable differences I hear from the studio versions (in the CD) compared to the live stream, and if it is done under a major music label. You’ll get what I mean later.<br /><br />(“Above Average” is purely based on first impression, mainly from the live stream)<br /><br />(1) MOA<br />Being the topic song for the album, this does not disappoint. Short yet lovely, this song does bring the start to her overall feel of her world and her album in general. The music video is also interestingly done, though seen with v~ery minor discrepancies (flinging her hair etc.) which can be treated as nothing. Personally liked this:<br /><img alt="" border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-j14kdCU90lA/U6gjWhRMR4I/AAAAAAAAJtA/KLE2FtiyWpo/Neat%252527s%252520-%252520MOA.avi_snapshot_02.59_%25255B2014.06.23_20.16.28%25255D%25255B5%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="135" style="background-image: none; border-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="" width="240" /><br />But you can also watch this:<br /><div align="center"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="189" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-x0xTN-MXM" width="336"></iframe></div>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(2) Gray no Mori [trans.: The Grey Forest]<br />Major differences between this and the live stream version is that it is more epic, more… boldly presented. Which is good, in my opinion, making me like this song more and more. If you also do not understand much of the lyrics like me, this song is so her style when she is active. And it’s a great song. Short, and sweet.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(3) Yuugure Record [trans.: Evening Record]<br />Honestly saying I’m impressed by the first few songs presented in the live stream, and don’t know why I didn’t pre-order back then already (especially when she told me to too) and had to wait until now. Strict rules, probably?<br /><br />Okay, this may sound like an oldie if you only hear the introduction, but then the added chorus emphasis makes this song also more in depth in some way, though personally think it’s good without it too. The chorus is the focus point, because it’s that catchy, you may just miss this great song. Especially when it’s three minutes short.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(4) Tasogare ni Ame [trans.: Twilight Rain]<br />More emotional than simple, this song brings out the mood of the topic we know very much about: the rain. Neat’s has done quite a decent job to create the correct mood for this song too, slow-paced and simple (as like without any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_structure_(popular_music)#Bridge">bridge in song format</a>), and easy to listen to. The best song to listen now (in summer) is when you’re in a quiet air-con room at night. Really. The added effects in the studio version also bring out the better feel in the song, but makes me feel real spooky in the circumstances I tell you guys a sentence ago. Haha.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(5) Yoru no Iro [trans.: Colour of the Night]<br />Supposedly Neat’s favourite song in this list, this song has proven to be pretty great too. Problem here is I favour the live stream version because in the studio version the beat is greatly emphasised, making it sounds very electropop in this case. You’ll know why when I talk about the remix of this song in the last track of this album. Nevertheless, the melody is a great companion, and is already attached to me long before the album is out.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(6) Shinsekai [trans.: New World]<br />Recently the catch of my list after I reviewed the album yesterday, this song has a deep meaning into it, if for this song you focus on the lyrics… and then reference it to “Neat’s world” that she’s been talking about in the live stream. Also, if you are deterred by the introduction which somehow does not blend in with the melody, you’ll get it when you hear the whole song.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en data-scribe-reduced-action-queue=">『あなたと世界を作れるなら私の全てを見せてあげる』 And thus the new world is formed. Listening to Neat's - Shinsekai — Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/statuses/480743983413338112">June 22, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>  The tweet’s lyrics translate to (haha now then you know I typed those?):<br /><div align="center"><blockquote class="tr_bq">“If I were to create the world with you<br />I’ll be able to show you my everything”</blockquote></div>So simple, it makes you want to create a world with her too. Not that I’m implying anything. Oops is that an exhibition of tsundere?<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(7) Umi [trans.: Sea]<br />There aren’t many times people would use a single world as a song title, but this is what it essentially; about the sea. The live stream version is more acoustic due to the other band members rotting from their toilet break (haha kudos to those who watched it), and the studio version is more dramatic, which somehow infects me to like this song more. More of the mood than the melody, but it’s a nice song, so why not?<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(8) Sabaku no Scorpion [trans.: The Scorpion in the Desert]<br />Another song with a beat, this song is one with more of the beat than focused on its lyrics, which is very catchy and a great song to listen to. Though the song is long, the continuous beat of the song makes it of a active mood, and is one more nice tune created by Neat’s-san.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(9) Greatest Eden [trans. not needed]<br />Another song that caught my impression that time back in the live stream. Why? Because it’s grand, so grand it’s great. Thus the song title “Greatest Eden”, in my opinion, of course. Nevertheless, the song is a catch, and reminds me so much about Christmas, though at this time of year this is better than any Christmas carol. Sorry to any faith affected, but it’s just me speaking my mind…<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(10) wonderland<br />One of the later considerations, maybe in order to be able to spend 3000 yen away with a reason. I know. I’m crying internally already.<br />Forgetting about that, this song also is in its own league, bearing the style that is Neat’s. Quiet and peaceful, it reminds one about the wonderland we live in, isn’t it? Simple in melody and in lyrics, which makes this a perfect song if you dislike everything from this list. But you don’t dislike after everything I’ve said, right~<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(11) Climbers<br />Eh… this is the only song I “didn’t like”, or shall I say “haven’t grown attached to” at all. But in an opinion I guess this is also a well-done song though, not that I listen to it anyway. Sorry.<br />Rating: Not In List<br /><br />(12) Yoru no Iro ~electro circus by Sunahara Yoshinori~<br />Not that I know the guy that remixed this song, but the extended remix also makes this a nice track to listen, probably even better than the studio version especially with me saying this many bad things about it.<br />Rating: Not In List, because Klassic Note don’t take remixes<br /><br />Conclusion: This is AN ALBUM, people. I can already declare that an album making its way to my shelf is definitely the best of the year, and one to listen to. So if you like some indie pop out of major companies, grab your earphones and speakers, hit the play button and dive into the world that is Neat’s. You know, ニーツの世界-desu!<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
