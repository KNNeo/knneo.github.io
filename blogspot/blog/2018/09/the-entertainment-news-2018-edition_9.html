<h2>The Entertainment News 2018 Edition Issue #36</h2>
Wow.<br /><br />If you saw this at midnight that's because I decided to have a nap on a Sunday afternoon forgetting that I have a movie to catch up and I have to watch live Anime from Japan at night. Man, that was quite a run. Sorry to myself for not deciding to not give up on any one of them so I can sleep early and not doze off at work tomorrow lol I wouldn't to be honest it's an open office setting it's impossible to sleep haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"The only thing they long for is freedom" Yeah right freedom from your hands Golzine you sick fuck haha why is it always him? lol</div></blockquote>Hmm, that was quite a development. The new episode (10) and if I may say is only getting better, talks about what happened after the experiment. Shorter was obviously dead (RIP) (and damn did they operate the shit out of his dead corpse), but Golzine has something to attend, and that gives everyone the perfect chance to do whatever they need to, well, save people and escape apparently. Before it got to the Papa's ears, the China boy managed to give Ash a chance to escape with his friends including Eiji, Ash's gang came to save him along with Shorter's gang who now has a new leader, and the China boy himself... let's say he has some plans up his sleeve. The bigger thing is when the scientist - who has been disabled by the needles - mentioned about him taking all the drugs. I mean, we know that anyone who took the drug wouldn't do anything else but bad things with it, so hopefully that doesn't turn out to be a zombie apolocalyse case where everyone will be finding Ash and killing him. I don't know man, the possibilities are infinite with this one. <span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> On other things, the animation is terrible especially when zoomed out - you want to measure the proportions of Ash's figure against the rooms in the mansion that are ever-changing in proportions? I don't want to screncap that because it's really bad, but hey, the action was pretty good. Not the violence though. They showed bullet shots in the head real good, you can't even unsee those scenes now. What next to happen? Revenge on the papa, probably. Now that everyone pretty much is safe and out of the hellhole that is Golzine's mansion, we may be able to see a comeback on Ash's position to... well, I don't really know if anything else he's planning for besides revenge, unless he also wants to put the drug on Golzine to make him kill little boys that he so fancies haha I mean it's only Ash and Eiji for now right? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Oh no old man we can't have those people dead so you kill yourself, yes?<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-alRSITeUhBQ/W5SOV9T0eBI/AAAAAAAAp8w/qKqLliLIo1EOAckHTVwNPTtVyJj0TqGZACLcBGAs/s320/bananafish10_ash1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A decent comparison of Ash crying as a kid and him... not as much of a kid</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5Kx1KkvWg6Y/W5SOWCFNVLI/AAAAAAAAp80/jqUzo-YIwUIw2J0pxPGv9ezgB-9wSEFvgCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish10_ash2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A decent comparison of Ash crying as a kid and him... not as much of a kid</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>P.S. "I mean, technically that scientist there killed your gang leader Shorter; I just shot him good with my gun" lol if I was Ash haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"She's basically trying to find me, right?" Yep. Chio-chan, you're right. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span></div></blockquote>So Momo-senpai has feelings for eating sweets the same way I jerk off at home? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, the new episode (10) talks about sweets for some reason (I mean, this isn't that <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31636/Dagashi_Kashi" target="_blank">sweets Anime series</a>, okay?), the reunion of the Andou siblings and the truth, and a touching story between Mayuta (yep that's his name, that Andou) and George. Firstly, the sweets. Shinozuka Momo, the school president, is troubled over why she doesn't understand why kids want to smuggle sweets and snacks into school (termed as "dagashi" in general), and if you don't understand Gotou-sensei's analogy like me, you'd be pleased to know that the pair will be here to help us get... whatever Momo-chan is trying to get. Instead, we're kind of brought in to the reality of Momo being really enthusiastic even to the extent of crazy, over sweets. And without stopping her, they went to a sweets shop and ate all the stuff they can handle. That, and they probably allowed Momo-chan to go on character overdrive lol. I mean, the only thing these girls are going to get is get fat from all the sweets they ate lmao. Next, the return of the legend. Well, just in talk. The real legend is dead. Right, guys? (#RIPBloodyButterfly) So yeah, we finally knew in detail of the relation between ex-gang leader Andou and shove-fingers-up-your-kid-ass Andou lol, considering they are siblings 10 years apart. Chiharu, the kid one, got pissed of at finding out that her brother lost her coolness (apparently what influenced her to go to a private school for some reason) (so she can do that fingering thing during their break?) (I wonder what she would be like grown up, Chiharu-chan haha) (I may want to date this girl HAHA) because he got done by the legend who is a girl on the street, and of course found out somehow that Chio-chan was the culprit. Instead of settling things on the spot in front of the sister, the two probably ended up getting closer than ever before. Physically, I mean. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> MVP for this scene was Manana when the ass-beaten beast comes back for revenge and is stopped by the brother, so all's well ends well? I don't know, this show's too complicated haha. But man, did the hits from Chio on Mayuta fail so badly lol. Also, <a href="https://jisho.org/search/burakon" target="_blank">BURAKON</a>! BURAKON!! BURAKON!!! Haha Chiharu-chan you innocent girl. Lastly, a heartwarming silent story about Andou (Mayuta) and George, that one cat we've seen in a couple of episodes. It's good to be filled with some backstory, and again didn't expect silent stories to still hold up this well here. For storytelling purposes, this Anime has done it well. Just, don't stick your kid fingers up my anus, yes? I don't study in Samejima High School. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />[I can't show anything in the Andou sibling scene so here's a couple of SFW thumbnails lol]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b5F25YLKgpY/W5SbvmfVThI/AAAAAAAAp9A/SC-lVtIbidIuHdbJTuyT9WgsKIF9gjJTwCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan10_wefie.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Happiness is...</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LqCesWWwP-Q/W5SbxKESrYI/AAAAAAAAp9E/NJ7BMt-5LNwqViKpJcIWtH7t1SrPNxEvgCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan10_wtf.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">... wishing that someone would make this a messaging app sticker haha</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>P.S. To be frank, I want someone in my life to go "Stop working!!" because seriously I don't wanna haha<br />P.P.S. I would like to bring your attention to how ridiculous it is with the sizes (not talking about Chio-chan's chest here, sorry) between the Andou siblings because man it really looks like I'm watching some pedophile holding an underaged <strike>or those monster hentai</strike> haha I'm sorry<br />[Because this in a GIF looks so good]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RTX8Fs4Rssg/W5Scgoz5TWI/AAAAAAAAp9Q/Oiq7DHTDXgYAKSiWhx5RnBOe82cyUHP2ACLcBGAs/s1600/chiochan10_stuffing.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Happiness is... when you stuff your Anime self with sweets and you don't get fat haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Asobi Asobase</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"This is random but I want them to say poo" Yep that's real random Hanako lol</div></blockquote>"If you're talking about the illustration above your head" Hey Olivia you're breaking the 4th wall here girl haha. Okay, the new episode (10) someone did a reverse Olivia, Aozora did a Kasumi, and Kasumi did a Hanako?? Wow, this show has everything. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Firstly, about Fujiwara, that girl who represented Olivia who cannot speak English to speak in an English contest, now knows that this girl can't even speak English even though she was English at some point. Oh well. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> But man, do I speak Japanese like she does. (Nope, not going to do it here so just imagine it yourself lol) (But really, I do that in that one Japanese mobile game I'm playing when I'm bored haha) Not that I would want to interest you to <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/44461/Shuu_Uchida" target="_blank">this newbie</a> apparently (she's not listed of the role yet as time of writing) but man her English is not bad. I mean, the voice acting. Otherwise, you'd be pleased to know Fujiwara speaks Japanese as badly as Olivia does with English, so she mixes her bad lingo with the language she is confident in speaking. That, and she may have already known and confirmed that Olivia really can't speak English. As Hanako said revealing to anyone would be a good thing, but now I guess to Kasumi at least it's being used as a threat to do anything whoever knows of it wants, I guess. Don't ask me why Fujiwara wants to go on a date with Kasumi with that of a face lol, but Aozora-san saved Kasumi so we don't have to see it happen haha. On the other hand, Aozora may have helped us confirm her gender? Which brings us to part two. Apart from Hanako wanting the others to say poo lol, Kasumi keeps thinking about that one kiss to her lips because the other person was... maybe a male, and is having bad dreams about a revaling d*ck. For the sake of censorship in an Anime which doesn't do it (well, for most of the time), they did make a lot of puns around that forbidden word during their Home Economics class, and Kasumi not being able to hold it herself, decides to ask her friends to help to discern once and for all if Aozora is indeed female. Well, it didn't go as well, and they kind of mssed the part on the Banana Book, so... that's their problem. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Adding on to that, I think the ending for when Hanako and Olivia re-enacting the ideal crotch-looking scene is evidence that it won't be possible to check that for Aozora-san considering she would be wearing safety pants too. Yeah. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Lastly, Kasumi takes the stage again (this show is all about her too) but as a director, so she suddenly becomes as sarcastic as Hanako for some reason, taking scenes of space humans and a sexy spy alien (I'll f**k a sexy spy alien you know what I'm sayin'?) and hopefully it ties up all together wonderfully like the Star Trek series? Sure, Kasumi-san. All in all diggin' that sweet-a** poster lol, and if that's a not at all cryptic message about this series getting a second season I'M IN!! No really, may this Anime never end just like how Kasumi's thoughts about that kiss haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CdrFCCtXTAg/W5U7elaOPTI/AAAAAAAAp-Q/Ga1Hz9QB0iwunsA2V8Zzkh9D160TQlvOwCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase10_tie.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I can't show most of the stuff said so here's alien Olivia tied up and screaming haha</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KTFYbsgQ27U/W5U7elVX7RI/AAAAAAAAp-M/1KzBmgWys14u3phYlHolH7kYxWd6VeY9QCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase10_scream.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I can't show most of the stuff said so here's alien Olivia tied up and screaming haha</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>P.S. Olivia, behind the scenes of those shoujo manga, Hanako is actually referring to hentai anthologies. You don't know about them? Oh it's just me? The brother didn't intro her to that? Oh. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />P.P.S. I like how I know of "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/chinsukou" target="_blank">chinsuko</a>" thanks to one deranged Anime that is Seitokai Yakuindomo and its OVAs haha thanks Yokoshima-sensei for the OG Okinawa joke lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">A Channel</span></div></blockquote>Ah, the joys of hanging out. The new chapter (107) talks about Miporin, one of Tooru's classmates (the one who's not an a**hole?) and her going out with the others. Well, she's not feeling well though so she tries to cover it up, but as Tooru said if you don't feel well take a rest, man. (I guess she hasn't started the work life yet so she doesn't know how good that feeling is lol) I mean, if you thought she had a fever thinking about Tooru too much you got another thing coming. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> But hey, one can think, right?

I hinted last week that I'll be reviewing this, and here I am. Gone is a series of Anime so worth watching this was the first fighting show I've watched in years since "BLEACH" ended, but came is another production with nothing else but fights, stories, and an overall created plan that is better than the plan which resides it. Thnaks dear author, for we got another wonderful story and production due to your extra effort. Coming from the original Anime series, this was an original filler content talking about a different story in the current era paused in the time of the Anime I assume, and spoiled of some of the future  content which would be present if I read the original work. Again, talking about this in three main segments. (1) How this came about, (2) the story of what it is, and (3) how good was this overall considering I've only watched animated adaptations of this work.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vbNcCtBRc8s/W5VB_hA4JgI/AAAAAAAAp-o/RqEFyTj-Sk4yjJKmJfnOe61-FQlhvYgmwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_06.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">OKAY WHO POSTED THIS SHIT lol another Singapore reference</td></tr></tbody></table>Firstly, why I'm watching this. You guys should know I watched this series; I talked about both seasons of it here. Shortly after the end of the second season (which was awesome btw; remember Izumi "sword bitch" Kyouka became one of them after the President Fukuzawa "you're ma bitch now" Yukichi activated his ability?) came an announcement of an original film which will present more awesome content that we wish we didn't ask for, and here we are. Aired more than half a year ago in cinemas, I finally got my hands on this and decided to give it a go. Hey, I have no expectations, so this did blew my mind away.<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JY0BIvmRz0E/W5VCZd51I4I/AAAAAAAAp-0/QJAGfOTg6ScpVcxesPtDqwVUVd40pnlUACLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_08.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Ah, the nostalgia haha<br />(All screencapped from the movie I swear)</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2HuAZKdqDvM/W5VCZcmgOTI/AAAAAAAAp-4/ai0Ii5fgUj8Ed-Lu6RRne-mig-yQgMHOwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_09.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Ah, the nostalgia haha<br />(All screencapped from the movie I swear)</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>Secondly, let's talk about the story of this in a nutshell. Man, this is going to be hard to summarise because I'll talk about that later on how the author condenses content based on assumptions and inferences, but suffice it to say it was a story of the past. Actually, of the dead. History goes that in the Dark Ages (if you can recall, the one policeman died for it, and Ozamu "ISNULL()" Dazai changed sides after that) (that's a SQL programming joke) there was quite a war of the Ability users, so the organisation governing the users decided to use a last resort, training and supposedly deploying the one Ability user Shibusawa "911" Tatsuhiko (sorry America) who can possess all powers to turn against each other, in order to end the fighting. Fast forward 6 years later in the Detective Agency (if you recall it was 5 years later Dazai left Port Mafia) and this became a recurring problem since the one Ability user felt empty after being used, and now is seeking the Abilities of others, I guess. His motive isn't that clear, but I'd like to guess it's just trying to fuse all the powers together for something. That, we didn't get to. In comes two collaborators who decided to help him further his cause, even though more likely they are to betray him at the right time anyways because... he's dead. That in a moment, but the two are Dazai (I mean, he gotta) and Fyodor "chaos starter" D, apparently a Russian Ability user (man, we gotta cover that after those in America came in?) (Wait, the English too?? This is actually reminding me of "Shakugan no Shana" tbh) who is also leader of the underground group there, has an interesting Ability to "punish" the powers of others. That, may not be clearly shown in the movie, so I guess he gets to release the powers of those who have lost them in order for them to be duly taken care of? I mean, that doesn't sound like anything good because he was technically the culprit for everything considering the one Shibusawa is already dead. How is Shibusawa already dead? This brings us to our main guy Nakajima "weretiger" Atsushi (yes I'm going to do the nicknames till the end) who has a past. A past to not be mentioned. Well, it was revealed in this movie. Turns out he was tortured by the occupants, which actually turns out to be Abitlity users who wanted to take away his power through any means possible considering he's an attack-based Ability user. And the one who did the deed, surprise surprise, was Shibusawa. In a strange turn of events, instead of taking away the ability, Atsushi took back his Ability and killed the man who tortured him. So yeah, that guy is already dead. I don't want to guess how exactly he came back, but according to the movie his Ability took over his existence which explains why "he" felt so empty, considering the body is already dead as shown by the skull on the table with the three tiger-slashing scars. So, the whole stage is set by the two collaborators and the undead I suppose? Yeah, to take all the powers from Yokohama (it's like they invited them for something) similar in direction to what the Detective Agency was recently tasked by the organisation but different in execution. Well, it's gotta happen somehow. After realising what was to happen, and at the right moment, Dazai and Fyodor took quick action to steal some of the powers in order to put an end to this crazy phenomenon. In order to do this easily, they have to be friends with Shibusawa in order for him to reveal the den which keeps all the Ability-condensed crystals safe which was meant to "create the crown". That, they didn't bother to do, but they did intend to stop this by using some of the Abilities and with Dazai's nullifying Ability and that will be able to... I guess stop Shibusawa's Ability in range and power by making it unstable. You know, suicide just like he loves it. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, so with Shibusawa's Ability he thought by getting rid of Dazai following a bunch of betrayals he will be able to, hey, bring back his memories which was his real intention but he can't. What he did know of though from Fyodor, was the story that we mentioned that is from Atsushi, and the fact that he's dead. It probably didn't mean as much to him as to Atsuhi as he struggles to get his power back despite being able to defeat him quite easily with the help from Kyouka and Akutagawa "Gengar" Ryuunosuke despite them being in different leagues from each other at this point. You know, collaboration is a common thing in this world lol. Also from the Port Mafia team with others nowhere to be seen, Nakahara "Magneto" Chuuya, who has been around back then with Dazai, knew of the problem, took it to his own hands to confront Ango (he doesn't get a nickname here because he has no Ability) about the situation, and of course, took it to his own hands to take care of Shibusawa himself. Well, he was half the equation as he was only able to stop the Ability user as seen released as a dragon considering the disruption and "death" executed by the Russian user. That, and then for punishment, that idiot Fyodor gave the skull power in order to revive his memories and settle things with Atsushi once and for all, I assume. Well, it was all a big fight, Yokohama's citizens came out unscathed despite the huge amount of damage done to the place and the fog that surrounded the place lol, and peace was restored. Good job, guys.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EIumfL-dA8Y/W5VCJg9N8RI/AAAAAAAAp-s/MNW-NFjG61cXDikM_-GUUj32PkySq-kpwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_01.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Badass bike-riding like you've never seen before until you're reminded that this guy controls gravity lol</td></tr></tbody></table>Lastly, what was awesome. Hey, we got no capacity to talk about being unfamiliar, as the movie made sure to create an opening to introduce everyone and everything such that even the noobest of viewers can get a grasp of what happened. Although I would like to say even watching the Anime I still don't get most of the stuff even WITH the intro. Haha should've watched back a couple of episodes before watching this lol. That, and we immediately jump into the story. Feels haphazard, but still really well written. I only felt that it was as cliche as any movie out there was at the last part of the battle because it was obviously just there to satisfy Atsushi's burning desire to kill haha okay jkjk that one was just extending the fight so... the fight with Akutagawa was longer (and better) haha. I also like some of the potential spoilers leaked in this show ahead of original Anime content ranging from Mori "kid dresser" Ougai's Ability manifestation in the form of Elise-chan in case you guys didn't notice that in the Anime (I didn't) to that one woman who works for the organisation. (Thanks Takahashi Rie; your acting was great lol MVP haha) I also appreciate the simplicity in resolving most of the problems besides the psychological ones because Atsushi was created by the author as an idiot lol. The simplicity explains the solution to fighting their own power which was that gem, and fighting each other's power will return back the power. Which also explains how after the fog only one Ability user was killed because the guys were always dealing it alone. See? I knew the author was a genius. (He wrote the script for the movie btw) Other things which are less understood in the movie are the English Abitlity users and whatever that incineration Ability was we don't want to know lol, but hey, they don't have to interfere since it got settled. But all these show potential spoiler for those who have watched the Anime but didn't read the manga tbh and I'm looking forward to them making more of this series already.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JuubsdRf4cI/W5VCqhFWCzI/AAAAAAAAp_E/aCks4t-SbgIuAlpt0PmqUXKUbmJx3372ACLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_15.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Aw this is the cutest thing ever hehe</td></tr></tbody></table>All in all this movie is amazing as it sounds (okay maybe not the new GRANRODEO opening because it sucked haha) (the soundtrack was cool though), and boy am I hyped to be enjoying this show once again. Can't expect more from this show though, as I'm just going to feel bad picking on the minor flaws for the show not explaining it blatantly the situation and resolution, but that's all fine. The ever-changing scenes coupled with some level of reflection and fighing makes it all of what Bungou Stray Dogs was and will become. And for that, I salute to the Ability users who have to risk their lives to secretly keep the world safe. I like these kinds of shows, actually. It makes me feel good without having to exercise or do charity lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Qq1zFDbVEJk/W5VC8fGA5vI/AAAAAAAAp_Q/g01putFq-i8cwzD6XScQdk8fxMmpZbWRgCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs_deadapple_19.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">MVP this bitch haha now I want to work with Ango lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. "A sea of white and nothingness" Man, you need to get out more bro lol (Well it's not going to be possible considering his illusion-based ability but still)<br />P.P.S.

BOOM GOT HIM and myself too actually lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Can I just do this tomorrow? No? Okay, real quick then, guys. <b>Aimer's new single</b> wasn't that impressive to be honest so I'll be taking the latest preview I've heard of which is the first out of the three topic songs of her latest release. (Really? Triple A-side single?) <b>Tomatsu Haruka's new single</b> which was intended for her 10th anniversary as a solo music artist was a real disappointment even though I've a feeling I may come back for this in the future, and I finally got a listen to <b>Porno Graffiti's new singles for the year</b>. I'll take the latest single topic song then. The rest aren't that memorable to be honest. (Surprise surprise, it was a Pokemon movie theme song, no wonder)<br /><br />On latest Twitter news, some news outlets are spreading <b>rumours about RYTHEM forming back</b> after Yukari-chan (aka yucat) posted an image of them singing in karaoke online lol, <b>Tsuji Shion is coming up with her first best album</b> since her debut 10 years ago (wow) (just wow) (how many songs was that?), <b>Kalafina is coming up with a new best album collection</b> because they know the group is not going to hold up any longer (RIP Kalafina), <b>KANA-BOON's 2nd B-side album</b> releases in in two weeks time, and <b>Asakura Momo debut album</b> releases in October. Yeah, that girl. I suppose thanks to her new single the momentum will bring many (not including me) to get the album too. Sure, this girl's music career is going to be better than her voice acting career. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Lastly, if you haven't figured out how I can review their songs lol, <b>Porno Graffitti's music collection is now available in major streaming services</b> including Apple Music Japan shortly after SID announced theirs weeks ago. Thanks, guys. Really aprpeciate it. You guys are making my yearly subscription worth every dollar every year that I sign it. *thumbs up*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm real tired now and I haven't played that game that if I don't play now I'll be screwed for tomorrow- Oh, I can play it tomorrow morning I guess. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Cya guys tomorrow then, and hopefully by then, I won't be this rushed for time. Have a good midnight lol<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
