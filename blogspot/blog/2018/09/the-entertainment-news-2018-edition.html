<h2>The Entertainment News 2018 Edition Issue #39</h2>
Wow, what a week. Of nothing. Well, I meant here by the way. Don't ask me about work haha<br /><br />Oh and tomorrow will still have Anime to watch, so don't freak out if this page got real short all of a sudden. Well it won't be because as you can scroll down and see I'm talking about all of them from this season. So be sure to check that out.<br /><br />Okay let's do this I almost forgot to do this because I was playing so much DOAXVV I even got myself an auto clicker but then I can't do this when it "works" lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH?</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">Wow, you don't know what life is without Anime. Well, at least I get to clear my other stuff this weekend, especially Klassic Note stuff maybe&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;(This week's Anime and the new season shows will start next week!! Meanwhile...)</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Summer Anime 2018 Review</span></div></blockquote>Yes, I have thought about doing this for some time because I read back and noticed what I mentioned at the start of the season wasn't very smart of me until I regretted watching them, among all other reasons. So, I'm here to technically mock myself of what I said at the start of the season (and each season from here on) but also talk about what was good on the stuff that I watched. This is by means no ranking though; if I chose to watch a show it's already good. Exceptions do apply though, so we can talk about those. *laughs* Let's start.<br /><br />I'll not talk about BANANA FISH since it hasn't ended yet, but so far it's pretty accurate actually, from my initial guess. I'll also not talk about the other two shows from tomorrow because they have not been mentioned here.<br /><br />This is a full quote (WITH MY OPINIONS) from three months ago in <a href="http://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2018/07/the-entertainment-news-2018-edition.html" >Entertainment News #26</a>:<br /><hr />(Opinions on my) Opinions on the new season of Anime:<br /><ul><li>BANANA FISH (airs 5th July): Not interested in plot (it's like L.A.Noire but with heavier context in war so... no)</li><span class="popup"><span class="normal"><li>Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro (airs 6th July): It's Naomi-chan's next big role (unless you watched her 2014 romance Anime) as a main character and the story is totally a joke, and Random Curiosity wrote as fun to watch since it describes the life of something you'll never do which is going to school without getting distracted lmao</li></span><span class="pop" style="margin: 0;"><div style="width: 100%; animation: none; background-color: #444444; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px; word-wrap: break-word;">Thanks Naomi-chan because <b>Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</b> was awesome. Well, apart from the sticking it up your butt and kabbadi references I think it's real entertaining haha sorry Andou (Mayumi) for being discriminated in a female-dominant show also that homeless Sensei haha </div></span></span><span class="popup"><span class="normal"><li>Hataraku Saibou (airs 7th July): I may just watch 1st episode to see how heavy in technical knowledge it gets (as long as they describe things I'm fine, but explain further then please make it short), the plot seems interesting anyways (lol cancer bacteria), there's Kana-chan in a main role again... we'll see haha</li></span><span class="pop" style="margin: 0;"><div style="width: 100%; animation: none; background-color: #444444; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px; word-wrap: break-word;">Sorry <b>Hataraku Saibou</b> you only got cute stuff and lame jokes I can't put up with a biology class every week, as expected. Also, cheesy motivational stories are not my thing. </div></span></span><span class="popup"><span class="normal"><li>Asobi Asobase (airs 8th July): It's Aho Girl stupid but with all kinds of games I assume, I may not get used to the animation so I'll have a test of 1st episode to see if I can forgive it, but otherwise you've got a cast of very new female voice actresses, so I'll remember this based on my first impression of the promotional video because it made me crack lmao</li></span><span class="pop" style="margin: 0;"><div style="width: 100%; animation: none; background-color: #444444; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px; word-wrap: break-word;">Well... Aho Girl has got nothing on <b>Asobi Asobase</b> mainly because it's middle schoolers talking about mostly sex which is super entertaining (and still less dirty than that banana-loving idiot lol) but also, features three attractive characters. For Aho Girl the class chairperson is the only one I think has some body and isn't stupid haha (Audience: 華子ちゃんは?) Who? *laughs* </div></span></span><span class="popup"><span class="normal"><li>Jashin-chan Dropkick (airs 9th July): Random Curiosity relates the show to Anime like "Binbougami ga!" and "Gabriel Dropout" (which I did not watch the latter), the promotional content did not reveal much of the plot, but the animation looks good and it's just one of those I-can't-get-back-to-my-world-so-let-me-stay-in-your-human-house-for-now stories, so... I'll give a chance based on my mood and considering Gabriel Dropout got so much attention over the past few years (I'm saying based on Reddit experience haha)</li></span><span class="pop" style="margin: 0;"><div style="width: 100%; animation: none; background-color: #444444; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px; word-wrap: break-word;">Nope, didn't watch <b>Jashin-chan Dropkick</b>. Didn't even bother to watch one episode of it. And as expected, the content was real crazy. I mean, I probably would laugh at it, but I'll have a hard time giving theme songs. Well, I had a hard time giving Asobi Asobase too but, for this I had a choice haha also too many shows liao </div></span></span></ul><hr />...<br /><br />I guess I'll talk about Tsukumogami next time? Or maybe right when it ends? I really forgot about that one it's ending in... two weeks? Oh this week's episode is also postponed? Man, typhoon can make a lot of things not work according to plan...<br /><br /><b>NOTE: THERE WON'T BE AN ISSUE OF ANIME EXTRA TOMORROW</b><br /><br />I know I'm going to regret my initial opinions from last week's season preview already because I'm to going to have to critique on it at the end of this year lol #NextSeasonProblems<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>漫画</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">A Channel</span></div></blockquote>"And that is how your sister got her driver's license" is what I would like to use to summarise this new chapter (108) but hey, Keiko did it. She allowed her sister to come fetch her. Not in a vehicle she didn't, but isn't it great to be able to go home with your sibling? (Never tried that before though so I can't relate) (Or even recommend) (I'm dumb lol) You know, what's wrong with siblings going home together? I must say though, these small things are what makes life great. And it's most definitely not your sis being more attractive than you, dumber than you, or just plain ignorant compared to you. At least you two are similar (*stops to go watch the one OVA episode Keiko starred in*), and maybe because of your sis you'll finally get laid. *laughs* <span class="popup"><span class="normal">Ganbatte </span><span class="pop"><iframe style="background-color: white; height: 400px;" src="https://jisho.org/search/ganbatte" width="100%">Ganbatte</iframe></span></span> Keiko-chan; you'll be successful one day without your sister haha wait she is already lol<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="362" data-original-width="496" height="233" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5-mRofRK7vA/W7DFaE8OlXI/AAAAAAAAqeg/GpJxeyWFbMk9_diTBmt_y54aViC4KENCgCLcBGAs/s320/1085.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">How I introduce people I know to others lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="360" data-original-width="494" height="233" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4YfdqIfqCeE/W7DFy2PQRjI/AAAAAAAAqeo/CNhRqJ4Cx6UzwStfA7M6nfcu5el4CeSIwCLcBGAs/s320/1082.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I want this to become a reaction gif tbh</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week is mostly on YUKI. Sorry guys, didn't have that much time to listen to new songs, but a new week is dawning and I'm desperate, so that's good news before the releases next week which we'll talk about later. Firstly, <b>YUKI's 15th anniversary album</b> introduces 15 songs (I don't know if it's one per year but I don't think so) and... I got interested in two. Also, surprising that they are from the past 5 years so I must have been missing out tbh. I also took some time to listen to <span class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>Tsuzuri Zukuri's album from last year</b></span><span class="pop"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%8B%E3%82%B8%E3%83%9F%E3%82%AB%E3%83%85%E3%82%AD/1349673319?l=en"></iframe></span></span> apparently they released one and I only listen to them a year later lol, and... I think I can give a song or two. We shall see. <span class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</b></span><span class="pop"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BA-%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BA-single/1436020625?l=en"></iframe></span></span> was quite a disappointment to be honest so I'm not giving it, and I also got a listen to some rock festivals and <span class="popup"><b><span class="normal">"Polkadot Stingray" </span></b><span class="pop"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ad4NsEy1tg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></span> and <span class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>"SHE'S" </b></span><span class="pop"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LoAZtHUGVlM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></span> caught my attention so I'll be doing a little research (again, the appearance of women in the music video is a coincidence) about them next week. Both available on Apple Music Japan by the way, in case you need to know.<br /><br />Next week brings us finally, <b>Asakura Momo's 1st album</b> since her debut since she debutted two years ago, and I can't wait what <strike>leftover</strike> new compositions they have given for this lovely girl to sing hehe. <b>YOSHIKI's new single</b> which was the theme song for Anime "Attack on Titan" after getting much media attention is also getting released next week, so I'll have a listen to that to see if this guy is any better than Linked Horizon. I expect, it will be a flop. *laughs*<br /><br />In Twitter news, I missed that <span class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>Scenarioart live YouTube stream</b></span><span class="pop"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">【緊急生配信】<br><br>ワンマン名古屋公演延期に伴い、何か届けたいと考え、急遽、バンドフルセットでの生配信を行います！<br><br>YouTubeライブにて、<br>9/30(日) 20:00〜生配信いたします！<br><br>ぜひ皆様ご覧ください！！<br>お楽しみに！！<a href="https://t.co/pTKWb7jRpO" target="_blank">https://t.co/pTKWb7jRpO</a> <a href="https://t.co/XiN4IvnJbM" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/XiN4IvnJbM</a></p>&mdash; シナリオアート (@Scenarioart) <a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1045912407728545792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">September 29, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></span></span> which I told myself to watch but I was here lol *sob* (that tracklist too, <a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1046396935421100034" target="_blank">so many good songs</a>...), <span class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>GLIM SPANKY is releasing a new album</b></span><span class="pop"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GLIM SPANKY<br>4th Album<br>『LOOKING FOR THE MAGIC』<br>2018.11.21 Release🎉🌈🌈 <a href="https://t.co/guUxuLl05V" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/guUxuLl05V</a></p>&mdash; GLIM SPANKY (@glimspanky) <a href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1045238045564272641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">September 27, 2018</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></span></span> end of the year, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fumika_tweet/status/1045146678783664128" target="_blank"><b>fumika is releasing a new cover album</b></a> considering she has been singing cover songs for the past 6 months. So yeah, this versus Yoshioka Kiyoe? You know I hate to give cover songs haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I shall stop here; the weather today is really hot for some reason. Has been like that for the weekend for some reason. I should be glad I didn't have Anime to watch this week because the amount of content I need to edit on this is CRAZY but really did you guys see every single one of them? Cool, huh? I always thought of how this place can be more interactive, and creating a flexible frame is just a small step in the right direction. Hey, I'm no web coder but I try. Probably have to iron some stuff out when I have free time at work next week but this will do haha. But seriously, WAY easier to just type stuff and not link to everything I mention, but hey, I liked doing this so... Cya guys next week then, and hopefully until then that single which was delayed shipment will come so I can talk about King Gnu then haha *sigh*<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
